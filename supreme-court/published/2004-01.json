Ariail, \r\n          of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  Kenneth \r\n  Curtis was convicted of two counts of the sale of urine with the intent to defraud \r\n  a drug or alcohol test, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-470 (2003).  \r\n  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1994, Curtis started a business \r\n  known as Privacy Protection Services (PPS) which sells urine substitution kits \r\n  to individuals.  The kits contain urine, a pouch, a tube, a hand-warmer device, \r\n  duct tape, a pen, instructions for use, two business cards and a â€œNotice.â€  \r\n  The instructions advise how to use the heat pack to maintain proper temperature, \r\n  how to affix the kit to the body for â€œmaximum concealment,â€ and instruct the \r\n  user to check the temperature strip just before arriving at the collection center \r\n  and to â€œdress in loose fitting clothing.â€  The instructions also claim that \r\n  â€œafter thousands of kits and years of testing, no one has ever failed a test \r\n  when using our kit.â€  At the bottom of the instructions is a â€œDisclaimer Statementâ€ \r\n  which, among other things, states that â€œPrivacy Protection Services does not \r\n  market this kit for use in â€˜drug testing.â€™â€  A strip of paper, approximately \r\n  2â€ by 8â€ enclosed in the kits states that â€œBecause of recent changes in South \r\n  Carolina law, Privacy Protection Services no longer markets this URINE TEST \r\n  substitution kit for use in â€˜DRUG TESTINGâ€™ .  . . .  THIS PRODUCT IS SOLD AS \r\n  A NOVELTY ONLY.â€  However, also included in the kits are Privacy Protection \r\n  Services business cards, stating â€œPass Any Drug Test.â€  Curtis was indicted \r\n  in July 2001, and charged with two counts of violating Â§ 16-13-470. \r\n  [1]   The jury convicted him on both counts.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n    Do the indictments \r\n      sufficiently allege a crime?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    Is the term â€œdrug \r\n      testâ€ impermissibly vague?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court \r\n      err in allowing Curtis to be cross-examined regarding pornographic websites \r\n      accessible from his internet website?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court err \r\n      in denying Curtisâ€™ motion for a directed verdict?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   SUFFICIENCY OF INDICTMENTS\r\nThe indictments in this matter allege:\r\n\r\n  That KENNETH CURTIS did in Greenville \r\n    County. . . unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally operate a business that \r\n    sold a quantity of urine and a supplemental heating device, with the intent \r\n    to defraud a drug or alcohol test.  This being in violation of Â§ 16-13-470. \r\n    . . \r\n\r\nCurtis asserts the indictments, while \r\n  alleging his business sold urine with the intent to defraud, fail to \r\n  allege that he, individually, had the intent to defraud a drug test.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAn indictment is sufficient if it \r\n  apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged \r\n  and apprises the defendant what he must be prepared to meet.  State v. Wilkes, \r\n  353 S.C. 462, 464-465, 578 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2003).  Further, an indictment is \r\n  sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to \r\n  know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal \r\n  or conviction thereon.  Id.  An indictment phrased substantially in language \r\n  of a statute which creates and defines the offense is ordinarily sufficient.  \r\n  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 1981).   \r\nThe indictment here patently alleges \r\n  that Curtis knowingly and intentionally operated a business which sold urine \r\n  with the intent to defraud a drug test.  If Curtis knowingly and intentionally \r\n  operated a business which sold urine with the intent to defraud, it is patent \r\n  that his conduct is within the ambit of the statute.  The fact that the indictment \r\n  does not allege that he personally sold urine with the intent to defraud is \r\n  not fatal.  We find no merit to this contention.\r\n2.  IMPERMISSIBLY \r\n  VAGUE\r\nCurtis next asserts Â§ 16-13-470 is \r\n  impermissibly vague inasmuch as it fails to define the term â€œdrug test.â€  We \r\n  disagree.  \r\nStatutes are to be construed in favor \r\n  of constitutionality, and this Court will presume a legislative act is constitutionally \r\n  valid unless a clear showing to the contrary is made.  State v. Brown, \r\n  317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888 (1994).  A legislative enactment will be declared \r\n  unconstitutional only when its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no \r\n  room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the Constitution.  \r\n  See Westvaco Corp. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 321 S.C. \r\n  59, 467 S.E.2d 739 (1995).  The established test for vagueness is whether the \r\n  statute provides &quot;fair notice to those to whom the law applies.&quot;  \r\n  Main v. Thomason, 342 S.C. 79, 92, 535 S.E.2d 918, 925 (2000). A statute \r\n  is not unconstitutionally vague if a person of ordinary intelligence seeking \r\n  to obey the law will know, and is sufficiently warned of, the conduct the statute \r\n  makes criminal.  Johnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc., 349 S.C. \r\n  613, 564 S.E.2d 653 (2002).  As Justice Toal noted in Curtis v. State, \r\n  345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001), [a] law is unconstitutionally vague if \r\n  it forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that a person of \r\n  common intelligence must necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to \r\n  its application. . . . One to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not \r\n  have standing to challenge it for vagueness.  345 S.C. at 72, 549 S.E.2d at \r\n  598.  \r\nIn Curtis, we upheld Â§ 16-13-470 \r\n  against challenges of vagueness for failing to define the terms &quot;foil,&quot; \r\n  &quot;spike,&quot; &quot;defraud,&quot; &quot;bodily fluids,&quot; and &quot;adulterate,â€ \r\n  stating, â€œall the Constitution requires is that the language convey sufficiently \r\n  definite warnings as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding \r\n  and practices.â€  Id.\r\nContrary to Curtisâ€™ contention, the \r\n  term â€œdrug testâ€ clearly has a sufficiently common meaning to put him on notice \r\n  of the conduct proscribed.  Main v. Thomason, supra.  Curtis alleges \r\n  the statute is unduly vague in failing to specify that it is only the sale of \r\n  urine with the intent to defraud testing for illegal drug usage which is prohibited.  \r\n  We disagree.  Initially, we note that the Legislature, had it chosen to do so, \r\n  could easily have specified that only the sale with the intent to defraud tests \r\n  for illegal drugs was prohibited.  Its failure to do so indicates its intent \r\n  that the intent to defraud any drug test is illegal.  Stardancer Casino \r\n  v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001); Tilley v. Pacesetter, \r\n  333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d 16 (1998) (if legislature had intended certain result \r\n  in statute it would have said so).\r\nCurtis asserts that prohibiting the \r\n  sale of urine with the intent to defraud any drug test is an unwarranted \r\n  intrusion upon the privacy of those tested and that there is no legitimate purpose \r\n  in allowing businesses to test employees or others for drugs which are not illegal.   \r\n  Curtis has no standing to assert the privacy rights of persons who are being \r\n  tested.  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003)(one cannot \r\n  obtain a decision as to the invalidity of an act on the ground that it impairs \r\n  the rights of others).  To the extent that an employee or person tested wishes \r\n  to challenge the legitimacy of a certain test, they are free to do so.  Further, \r\n  the statute merely prohibits the sale of urine with the intent to defraud a \r\n  drug test; it does not give businesses unfettered discretion to test. \r\n  [2] \r\nWe find the term â€œdrug testâ€ sufficiently \r\n  apprises Curtis of the conduct proscribed by the statute.\r\n 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    PORNOGRAPHIC WEBSITE\r\nCurtis next argues the trial court \r\n  erred in permitting the state to cross-examine him concerning pornographic links \r\n  on his website.  \r\nCurtisâ€™ website [3]  provides the following information: â€œOur Complete \r\n  Urine Test Substitution Kits allow anyone, regardless of substance intake, to \r\n  pass any urinalysis within minutes.â€  It further states:\r\n \r\n  Proven real world protection from \r\n    urine testing invasions. . . Designed to easily be concealed on the body the \r\n    kits are complete with chemically reactive supplemental heat sources and temperature \r\n    monitoring system that insures proper acceptance temperature is maintained \r\n    (Proper temperature is a critical element for acceptance at any testing site).  \r\n    You can use our kit in a natural urinating position, unisex (male or female), \r\n    and you cannot be detected even if directly observed. . . . \r\n  Our Kits Work!!! \r\n    We guarantee 100% satisfaction \r\n    and 300% results.  It works because itâ€™s easy to use and gives the piss police \r\n    what they want. . . .\r\n    After thousands of sales \r\n    no one has ever failed a test when using our kit.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the state began its presentation \r\n  of the case by calling SLED agent West, who investigated the case against Curtis, \r\n  and inquiring about the contents of the PPS website.  A printout from the website \r\n  was entered into evidence, and Agent West was extensively questioned concerning \r\n  the contents of the site and the claims therein.  The state introduced this \r\n  information for the purpose of establishing Curtisâ€™ intention in selling the \r\n  urine substitution kits.  \r\nAfter the state rested, the first \r\n  person called by the defense was Curtisâ€™ webmaster, James Turner.  Turner was \r\n  questioned concerning the contents of the website, and whether, at Curtisâ€™ request, \r\n  all references to â€œdrug testingâ€ had been removed from the site subsequent to \r\n  the passage of Â§ 16-13-470.  Counsel then began going through the website with \r\n  him page by page, beginning with a â€œMedia Archivesâ€ section, which included \r\n  clips of Curtisâ€™ appearances on various television shows.  The defense then \r\n  moved to the â€œLinksâ€ section of the website and asked Turner to explain to the \r\n  jury how they decided what links to incorporate into the site.  Turner explained \r\n  that they had an â€œopen-linkâ€ policy, and that anybody who wanted a link on the \r\n  site could just email him with an address.  On cross-examination of Turner, \r\n  the state queried whether all of the links on the site were subject to Curtisâ€™ \r\n  approval, and whether there were any sites with which they did not want to be \r\n  associated.  Turner replied that they did not allow pornographic material or \r\n  links to pornographic material.  \r\nSubsequent to Turnerâ€™s testimony, \r\n  Curtis was questioned on direct exam about the contents of the website.  His \r\n  attorney asked about the â€œLinksâ€ page and how links get onto the page.  Curtis \r\n  responded that â€œ[w]e have a free association link policy.  I do ask not to have \r\n  pornography sites listed because, first of all, I chose a web server that does \r\n  not host pornography sites because I personally object to pornography on the \r\n  web because it often is slipped in.â€  Thereafter, on cross-exam, the state questioned \r\n  Curtis about his website while actually clicking through it on a computer screen, \r\n  demonstrating that it was possible to access pornographic links via other links \r\n  on Curtisâ€™ website.  The line of inquiry went on for approximately three and \r\n  one-half transcript pages before defense counsel objected on the basis of relevancy.  \r\n  Curtis was then allowed to explain that he â€œdid not list those things on my \r\n  site.  They are links from someone elseâ€™s site.  Theyâ€™re not- - They have nothing \r\n  to do with my site.â€  Curtis now asserts the inquiry concerning pornographic \r\n  websites was irrelevant and misleading.  We disagree.\r\nA party cannot complain of an error \r\n  which his own conduct created.  State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d \r\n  683, cert denied 519 U.S. 1045 (1996) (party cannot complain of error \r\n  which his own conduct has induced).  Given that both Curtis and Turner maintained \r\n  that PPS did not allow pornographic materials or links on the website, it is \r\n  patent that they opened the door to this line of inquiry.  See State \r\n  v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (2003)(when a party introduces evidence \r\n  about a particular matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut \r\n  it, even if the latter evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had \r\n  it been offered initially).  Moreover, counsel raised no objection to the inquiry \r\n  until several pages of testimony concerning the pornographic links had been \r\n  taken.  We find counselâ€™s objection came too late.  State v. Hoffman, \r\n  312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (contemporaneous objection is \r\n  required to properly preserve an error for appellate  review).   \r\nFurther, even assuming arguendo \r\n  we were to review the issue, we agree with the state that given Curtisâ€™ own \r\n  testimony that there were no pornographic links on his website, the inquiry \r\n  was relevant to his credibility.  Yoho v. Thompson, 345 S.C. 361, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 584 (2001)(a witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to \r\n  any issue in the case, including credibility and considerable latitude is allowed \r\n  in this regard).\r\nFinally, Curtis was not prejudiced \r\n  by the inquiry.  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000) \r\n  (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).  Curtis repeatedly testified \r\n  before the jury that the pornographic links were not in fact links from \r\n  his site, but were links from other links.    Accordingly, we find no error.  \r\n  \r\n 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nCurtis lastly argues the trial court \r\n  erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict as the state presented â€œno \r\n  evidence that this particular sale was made with the intent to defraud a drug \r\n  test.â€  We disagree.\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.  State \r\n  v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).  In reviewing a motion \r\n  for directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the \r\n  evidence, not with its weight.  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, \r\n  535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, \r\n  an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State.  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999).  \r\n  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was \r\n  properly submitted to the jury.  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 526 (2000).\r\nCurtis argued at trial only that \r\n  he was entitled to a directed verdict on the basis that he was not directly \r\n  involved in the sale of the kits in question and that there was no evidence \r\n  the individual who purchased his urine kits had any intent to defraud a drug \r\n  test.  He now asserts he was entitled to a directed verdict on the ground that \r\n  there is no evidence the kits were sold with the intent to defraud.  Accordingly \r\n  his current argument is not preserved for appeal.  State v. Byram, 326 \r\n  S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (party cannot argue one basis in support of \r\n  motion at trial and another ground on appeal).          \r\nIn any event, there is ample evidence \r\n  to warrant submission of the case to the jury.  As noted previously, the kits \r\n  which form the basis of this case contain warming devices and temperature indicator \r\n  devices to ensure the urine is at the proper temperature for acceptance (91-101 \r\n  degrees). [4]   The kit gives instructions, \r\n  with photos, as to how to affix it to your body for proper temperature transfer \r\n  and maintenance and stresses that the location between the breast and armpit \r\n  â€œallows for maximum concealment, comfort, temperature monitoring, and allows \r\n  pressure to be applied with the upper arm to assist flow.â€  Although there is \r\n  a Disclaimer at the bottom of the instructions which indicates that â€œPrivacy \r\n  Protection Services does not market this kit for use in drug testing,â€ business \r\n  cards enclosed with the kits state, in bold print, â€œPass Any Drug Test.â€  Additionally, \r\n  the state submitted evidence of an email from Privacy Protection Services to \r\n  an individual who inquired about selling Curtisâ€™ products.  In the email, Curtis \r\n  gives an example of the response they give to inquiries, stating \r\n\r\n  â€œWe can provide a COMPLETE KIT \r\n    that will allow ANYONE regardless of drug intake to pass ANY urine test within \r\n    minutes after receiving it. . . That being said let me explain what we offer \r\n    and why it is the only real world answer to the invasion of drug testing. \r\n    . . . the hardest thing about using this kit is to avoid putting your own \r\n    sample in the cup.â€ \r\n\r\nFurther, Curtisâ€™ website makes the \r\n  claim that â€œOur Complete Urine Substitution Kits allow anyone, regardless of \r\n  substance intake, to pass any urinalysis within minutes.â€  We find this is ample \r\n  evidence to submit to the jury on the issue of whether Curtis was selling urine \r\n  kits with the intent to defraud drug tests.  His motion for a directed verdict \r\n  was properly denied.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nCurtisâ€™ convictions for violation \r\n  of Â§ 16-13-470 are affirmed. [5] \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, and BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]   In 1999, the Legislature enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-470 which \r\n    provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      Defrauding drug and alcohol \r\n        screening tests;  penalty.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (A) It is unlawful \r\n        for a person to:\r\n        sell, give away, distribute, \r\n        or market urine in this State or transport urine into this State with \r\n        the intent of using the urine to defraud a drug or alcohol screening test; \r\n        \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    Although not the issue presented today, there \r\n    are safety concerns which could conceivably justify a businessesâ€™ testing \r\n    for drugs which are not in themselves illegal, but which could impair or hinder \r\n    an employeeâ€™s ability to perform a given task.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   The website may be found at www.privacypro.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   In Curtis, supra, the Court held \r\n    unconstitutional section 16-13-470â€™s presumption of intent from the sale of \r\n    a warming device with the urine.  However, the sale of a warming device is \r\n    nonetheless evidence which the jury may consider in determining the defendantâ€™s \r\n    intent. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]   The remaining issue is affirmed pursuant to Rule \r\n    220(b), SCACR, and the following authority:  Curtisâ€™ Issue 3- Ex Parte \r\n    Littlefield, 343 S.C. 212, 540 S.E.2d 81 (2000)(discretion to prosecute \r\n    is solely in prosecutor's hands).   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25763","title":"State v.

According \r\n  to Renee, she and Brent were walking along the beach towards their motel when \r\n  they were approached by a man wearing black clothes and a ski mask.  The man \r\n  told them to lie face down on the beach and give him their money and jewelry.  \r\n  They complied, whereupon the assailant shot Brent twice in the head and fled.   \r\n  \r\nShortly after the shooting, Renee \r\n  indicated to police that she had been having marital problems with Brent and \r\n  had been â€œinvolvedâ€ with Frazier.  Frazier and Renee were subsequently arrested \r\n  and charged with Brentâ€™s murder.  At trial, the stateâ€™s case against Frazier \r\n  was largely circumstantial.  The only direct evidence placing Frazier near the \r\n  scene of the crime was the identification testimony of Mark and Donna Hobbs, \r\n  two passersby who identified Frazier from a photographic line-up as the suspicious-looking \r\n  man they had seen near the scene of the crime on June 9, 1998.  The jury convicted \r\n  Frazier of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and armed robbery. [1] \r\nISSUES [2] \r\n  \r\n     \r\n      1.&nbsp;\r\n      Did the trial \r\n        court err in excluding the testimony of appellantâ€™s expert, Donald Smith, \r\n        and a videotape made by Smith depicting the scene of the eyewitness identification?\r\n    \r\n     \r\n      2.\r\n      Did the trial \r\n        court err in excluding portions of the videotaped deposition of Dr. Elizabeth \r\n        Loftus concerning a â€œPhoto Lineup Studyâ€?\r\n    \r\n     \r\n      3.\r\n      Did the trial \r\n        court err in allowing the testimony of Frazierâ€™s co-worker, Bruce Sovereign?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n  VIDEOTAPE OF CRIME SCENE\r\nAt trial, Frazier attempted to introduce \r\n  a videotape made of the scene of the crime by Donald Smith, a videographer.  \r\n  The purpose of the videotape is to demonstrate the effect of lighting on images \r\n  at the motel where Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs claimed to have seen Frazier on the night \r\n  of the crime.  Counsel for Frazier was attempting to convey the idea that because \r\n  the man observed by the Hobbs was backlit by motel lighting, there would have \r\n  been shadows cast upon him, thus calling into question the reliability of the \r\n  Hobbsesâ€™ identification.  Smith testified he had made the videotape at 11:30P.M. \r\n  on February 11, 2000, and that the exterior lighting conditions present at the \r\n  motel were the same on that date as on the date of the crime.  Smith also testified \r\n  that the effect of a backlit subject would not be affected by the moonlight \r\n  or the atmospheric conditions or other natural events.  \r\nThe trial judge refused to qualify \r\n  Smith as an expert, and ruled the videotape inadmissible stating, â€œThe court \r\n  is of the view that it is not possible, scientifically human or any other study \r\n  or discipline, to recreate precisely the lighting that occurred that evening. \r\n  . . . The ability to comprehend lighting. . . thatâ€™s subjective, not objective, \r\n  and that is an intangible. . .  I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s capable of recreation.â€  \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. \r\n  138, 143, 406 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1991), we recognized that, although the admission \r\n  of expert testimony is generally a matter within the trial courtâ€™s discretion, \r\n  the exclusion of expert testimony on the issue of eyewitness reliability constitutes \r\n  an abuse of discretion in cases in which, â€œthe main issue is the identity of \r\n  the perpetrator, the sole evidence of identity is eyewitness identification, \r\n  and the identification is not substantially corroborated by evidence giving \r\n  it independent reliability.â€  We find the present case meets these criteria.  \r\n  Accordingly, under Whaley, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing \r\n  to admit Smithâ€™s testimony.\r\nFurther, we find the trial court \r\n  likewise erred in excluding the videotape made by Smith.  A trial courtâ€™s admission \r\n  or rejection of evidence is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error \r\n  of law.  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000).  As \r\n  noted by this Court in Weaks v. South Carolina State Hwy Depâ€™t, 250 S.C. \r\n  535, 542, 159 S.E.2d 234, 237 (1968):\r\n\r\n  The rule laid down by this court \r\n    for the introduction of evidence and an experiment out of court requires that \r\n    the experiment be made under conditions and circumstances similar to those \r\n    prevailing at the time of the occurrence involved in the controversy.  It \r\n    is not required that the conditions be identical with those existing at the \r\n    time of the controversy; it is sufficient if there is a substantial similarity. \r\n    \r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).  As noted previously, \r\n  the trial judge ruled he did not believe the lighting conditions in effect on \r\n  the night of the crime were capable of recreation.  Weaks, however, requires \r\n  only a substantial similarity, not a precise recreation.  Smithâ€™s testimony \r\n  demonstrated a sufficient degree of similarity to render the videotape admissible.  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court committed an error of law in refusing to \r\n  admit it. \r\n   \r\n 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  DR. LOFTUS STUDY\r\nFrazier also asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in excluding a portion of Dr. Loftusâ€™ videotaped deposition which discusses \r\n  a â€œPhoto Lineup Study,â€ conducted by Wofford College Professor, Dr. Alliston \r\n  Reid.  We agree and find this study should have been admitted. \r\nThe purpose of Dr Loftusâ€™ testimony \r\n  was to impeach the reliability of the Hobbsesâ€™ identification of Frazier from \r\n  a photographic lineup.  Dr Loftus based her testimony upon a study conducted \r\n  by Dr. Alliston Reid, a psychology professor at Wofford College.  The Hobbses \r\n  had identified the man they saw on the beach as having a large forehead and \r\n  large eyes, and Dr. Reidâ€™s study was intended to show the lineup procedure used \r\n  in this case was unduly suggestive inasmuch as Frazier had larger eyes and a \r\n  larger forehead than the other subjects in the lineup.  \r\nAs noted previously, the Hobbsesâ€™ \r\n  identification was crucial to the stateâ€™s case against Frazier.  Accordingly, \r\n  we find that Frazier should have been permitted to impeach the reliability of \r\n  the identification procedure through Dr. Loftusâ€™ testimony.   State v. Council, \r\n  335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (evidence will assist the trier of fact, the \r\n  expert witness is qualified, and the underlying science is reliable).  Whaley, \r\n  supra, specifically permits expert testimony on the issue of eyewitness \r\n  reliability.  As with the testimony and videotape of Donald Smith, Dr. Loftusâ€™ \r\n  testimony demonstrating a lack of reliability in the eyewitness identification \r\n  of Frazier was essential to the defense and its exclusion cannot, under the \r\n  facts of this case, be deemed harmless error.   Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  exclusion of this testimony is reversed.\r\n 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   TESTIMONY OF BRUCE SOVEREIGN\r\nFinally, Frazier asserts the trial \r\n  court erred in admitting testimony of his co-worker, Bruce Sovereign, to the \r\n  effect that Sovereign overheard Frazier tell Renee during a telephone conversation \r\n  that â€œsomebody should kill that son-of-a-bitch,â€ and Sovereignâ€™s testimony that \r\n  he considered the statement very serious.  We hold the trial court erred in \r\n  admitting Sovereignâ€™s testimony.\r\nA witness may not testify to a matter \r\n  unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding the witness has \r\n  personal knowledge of the matter.  Rule 602, SCRE; State v. Williams, \r\n  321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996).   \r\nHere, Sovereign testified that approximately \r\n  four weeks prior to the shooting, Frazier stomped into the room where they worked, \r\n  having been on the phone with someone Sovereign believed to be Renee, \r\n  and said either â€œsomebody should kill that son-of-a-bitchâ€ or â€œIâ€™m going \r\n  to kill that son-of-a-bitch.â€  Sovereign â€œguessedâ€ Frazier had been speaking \r\n  to Renee and he believed Frazierâ€™s statement was serious.   \r\nWe find Sovereignâ€™s testimony is \r\n  simply beyond the ambit of Rule 602.  Sovereign did not know when the \r\n  statement was made, he did not know to whom Frazier was speaking, and \r\n  he could not recall the exact content of the statement he attributed \r\n  to Frazier.  Under these circumstances, we hold the testimony was too speculative \r\n  to be admitted.  \r\nMoreover, unlike State v. Williams, \r\n  supra, we cannot say the erroneous admission of Sovereignâ€™s testimony \r\n  was harmless error.  As noted above, there was little direct evidence linking \r\n  Frazier to the crime, and the trial court erroneously limited Frazierâ€™s attempts \r\n  to impeach the only direct evidence against him, i.e., the eyewitness identification \r\n  by the Hobbses.  Under these circumstances, we simply cannot say that the erroneous \r\n  admission of statements accusing Frazier of stating â€œsomebody should kill that \r\n  son-of-a-bitchâ€ constitutes harmless error.  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse and remand \r\n  for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J., concur. \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result and dissenting in part, in which BURNETT, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n  \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I agree \r\n  with the majority that Mr. Frazierâ€™s conviction should be reversed and remanded \r\n  because the trial court erred in excluding the video tape expertâ€™s testimony \r\n  and erred in allowing the testimony of Mr. Sovereign.  However, in my opinion, \r\n  the trial court properly excluded Dr. Loftusâ€™ testimony discussing a â€œPhoto \r\n  Lineup Studyâ€ conducted by Dr. Alliston Reid of Wofford College.\r\nThe proffered study reports the results \r\n  of an experiment conducted by Dr. Reid in which sixty random participants viewed \r\n  the photographic lineup shown to the Hobbses.  The participants were asked to \r\n  identify the individual who best matched the description â€œhigh forehead and \r\n  large round eyes.â€ [3]   Forty-eight \r\n  of the sixty participants selected appellantâ€™s photograph from the line-up.  \r\n  The report concludes the photographic lineup was â€œstrongly biased toward selection \r\n  of Photo Number 1 [i.e., appellantâ€™s photograph]. . . [Photo Number 1] was a \r\n  better match to the written description of the suspect than was any other photo.â€ \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. \r\n  138, 406 S.E.2d 369 (1991), we approved the admission, under certain circumstances, \r\n  of eyewitness reliability testimony by expert witnesses.  The Court stated, \r\n  however, â€œthat nothing in this opinion should be construed as allowing an expert \r\n  to give his or her opinion of a particular witnessâ€™ identification.â€  406 S.E.2d \r\n  at 372.   \r\nThe purpose of Dr. Reidâ€™s study was \r\n  to address the reliability of the photographic lineup presented to the Hobbses.  \r\n  Clearly, Dr. Loftusâ€™ testimony about the results of the study was an attempt \r\n  to establish that the Hobbsesâ€™ identification of appellant was unreliable. The \r\n  nature of this testimony was specifically precluded in State v. Whaley, \r\n  406 S.E.2d at 372. \r\nThe trial judge properly excluded \r\n  Dr. Loftusâ€™ testimony concerning the study of the photographic lineup. The participants \r\n  in Dr. Reidâ€™s study were, in effect, instructed to select the photograph of \r\n  the individual which most closely matched the description â€œlarge, round eyesâ€ \r\n  and â€œhigh forehead.â€  The Hobbses, on the other hand, were asked if one \r\n  of the six photographs in the lineup was the individual they had seen on June \r\n  9.  In addition to their given description of the individual as having large, \r\n  round eyes and a high forehead, the Hobbses also had general perceptions of \r\n  the individual they saw at the Carolina Winds Motel which were not specifically \r\n  articulated.  Accordingly, Dr. Reidâ€™s finding of a bias in the photographic \r\n  lineup did not fairly challenge the reliability of the Hobbsesâ€™ identification \r\n  of appellant in the lineup.  See Rule 404, SCRE (evidence is relevant \r\n  if it tends to make the existence of any fact at issue more or less probable).\r\n For the above reasons, the trial \r\n  judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to allow Dr. Loftus to testify \r\n  about Dr. Reidâ€™s study.  \r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   Renee was convicted of murder and conspiracy \r\n    to commit murder.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The denial of Frazierâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n    verdict is affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authority: \r\n    State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000) (if there is \r\n    any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending \r\n    to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted \r\n    to the jury).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The Hobbses initially described the man they saw on June 9th \r\n    as having large, round eyes and a high forehead.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25764","title":"Hospitality Management Associates, Inc.,  v.

The main issue of this appeal is whether two nationwide \r\n  class action settlements approved by the Alabama and Tennessee state courts \r\n  are entitled to full faith and credit, thereby precluding appellants - as absent \r\n  class members who did not opt out - from proceeding with this action.  Moreover, \r\n  the crucial sub&#8209;issue of that question is what is the appropriate scope \r\n  of collateral review this Court should give to the rendering courtsâ€™ final \r\n  decisions approving the settlements.  The trial court found that:  (1) a limited \r\n  scope of review is proper, and (2) the due process issues were fully and fairly \r\n  litigated; therefore, the trial court ruled the final settlements are entitled \r\n  to full faith and credit.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\nAppellants seek damages against respondents Shell Oil Company (â€œShellâ€), Hoechst \r\n  Celanese Corporation (â€œCelaneseâ€), and E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. (â€œDuPontâ€), \r\n  for defective polybutylene plumbing systems.  Appellants own structures containing \r\n  this type of plumbing system.  Neither of the respondents manufactured these \r\n  polybutylene systems, but each produced and sold a resin utilized in the manufacture \r\n  of the systems. [1]   The systems were marketed as an alternative \r\n  to copper-based systems.  Appellants allege respondents falsely represented \r\n  that the polybutylene plumbing systems were of high quality, were reliable, \r\n  and would last decades.  Indeed, appellants claim respondents knew the resins \r\n  would degrade and corrode when exposed to the chemicals found in ordinary drinking \r\n  water (e.g., chlorine), and therefore, knew these systems would fail.  According \r\n  to appellants, polybutylene plumbing systems are an â€œunmitigated disasterâ€ as \r\n  they experience an unusually high failure rate.\r\nOn May 30, 1995, the original plaintiffs filed \r\n  this lawsuit (â€œthe Howard plaintiffsâ€).  However, two nationwide class action \r\n  settlements - Spencer in Alabama state court and Cox in Tennessee \r\n  state court - were finalized in November 1995; the Howard plaintiffs opted out \r\n  of these two settlements and subsequently settled their individual claims. \r\n  [2]   Appellants successfully intervened in the instant case in 1996 and \r\n  1997.  The lawsuit was designated as a complex case, and Judge Pieper was assigned \r\n  to it.  Initial discovery in the litigation was restricted to the full faith \r\n  and credit issue.\r\nRespondents moved for summary judgment arguing \r\n  that appellants were members of the national class actions which had been settled \r\n  and those settlements are entitled to full faith and credit.  Appellants responded \r\n  that because class members were not provided with due process, the state courts \r\n  did not acquire personal jurisdiction, and thus, the final orders should not \r\n  be accorded full faith and credit.  Holding that further inquiry into the facts \r\n  was appropriate, Judge Pieper denied respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment \r\n  in June 1998.\r\nShortly after the denial of summary judgment, Judge Pieper sua sponte \r\n  recused himself after learning that a family member had requested claim information \r\n  from one of respondentsâ€™ representatives in the out-of-state litigation.  Thereafter, \r\n  Judge Dennis was assigned to the case.\r\nRespondents moved to have Judge Dennis reconsider or vacate Judge Pieperâ€™s \r\n  order denying summary judgment.  The trial court denied this request, finding \r\n  that Judge Pieperâ€™s order was â€œa temporary ruling which invites another Motion.â€\r\nPursuant to Rule 23, SCRCP, appellants requested certification of a class defined, \r\n  in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  An opt-in class of all South Carolina persons and entities that own structures \r\n    in which there has been installed a polybutylene plumbing system, wherever \r\n    located; and non-resident persons and entities that own such structures located \r\n    in the State of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nFinding that none of Rule 23â€™s requirements had \r\n  been satisfied, Judge Dennis denied class certification.\r\nFinally, after respondents renewed their motions for summary judgment, the \r\n  trial court granted judgment in their favor.  The trial court found that the \r\n  Alabama court-approved Spencer settlement and the Tennessee court-approved \r\n  Cox settlement were both entitled to full faith and credit.  Significantly, \r\n  the trial court found that the issue of whether absent class members were provided \r\n  with minimum due process was an issue subject only to extremely limited collateral \r\n  review, making the dispositive issue whether the due process issue was fully \r\n  litigated in, and determined by, the Alabama and Tennessee courts.  The trial \r\n  court found that the due process issues relating to the exercise of personal \r\n  jurisdiction over the absent class members had been fully considered by the \r\n  Cox and Spencer courts, and therefore their findings of jurisdiction \r\n  were entitled to full faith and credit without further review on the merits.\r\nTo resolve the issues raised in this appeal, a review of the facts surrounding \r\n  the nationwide settlements is also necessary.\r\nThe Spencer and Cox Settlements\r\nThe Spencer lawsuit was filed in November 1994 in Alabama state court.  \r\n  At that time, yet another nationwide class action case was pending in a Texas \r\n  state court, Beeman v. Shell Oil Co., and a settlement was actively being \r\n  negotiated.  Although the parties reached a settlement in Beeman, it \r\n  ultimately fell through when the Texas court denied preliminary approval in \r\n  February 1995.  In May 1995, DuPont reached a settlement in Spencer, \r\n  and the Alabama court preliminarily approved it.  However, because the settlement \r\n  was only with DuPont, claims against Shell and Celanese remained.\r\nAccording to the original terms of the settlement with DuPont, DuPont agreed \r\n  to pay 8% of:  (1) the actual cash value of physical damage to tangible property \r\n  caused by a leak in the plumbing system which occurred within 15 years of the \r\n  installation, and (2) the cost of a replumb completed within 15 years of the \r\n  installation.  The fund for these costs was set at $120 million, and when that \r\n  amount was paid, DuPont retained the option to provide additional funding.  \r\n  If it opted not to provide additional funding, class members who had not been \r\n  paid would retain all rights against DuPont.\r\nIn June 1995, Cox was filed against Shell and Celanese in Tennessee.  \r\n  The same day the lawsuit was filed, the Tennessee court certified the class.  \r\n  Meanwhile, the Spencer action was still proceeding against Shell and \r\n  Celanese, and the Alabama court certified that class as well.  Thus, two competing \r\n  nationwide classes had been certified. [3] \r\nNegotiations in Cox resulted in a settlement \r\n  being reached with Shell and Celanese on July 31, 1995.  The original settlement \r\n  terms were that Shell and Celanese would provide $850 million to fund replumbs \r\n  for those claimants who had a qualifying leak.  In addition, recovery could \r\n  be had for physical damage to tangible property resulting from a leak.  A centralized \r\n  facility, the Consumer Plumbing Recovery Center (CPRC), was to be created to \r\n  administer the terms of the settlement.  Like the settlement reached with DuPont \r\n  in Spencer, the agreement tolled the statutes of limitation and repose \r\n  in the event the fund was exhausted and Shell and Celanese decided not to contribute \r\n  additional funding.  Moreover, future owners were covered by the settlement \r\n  because the agreement provided for four future notice periods.\r\nObjections were raised to the Cox settlement.  \r\n  In October/November 1995, class counsel for both Cox and Spencer \r\n  participated in a two-week mediation with California Judge Richard M. Silver, \r\n  [4]  and ultimately, a joint national settlement was reached.  This global \r\n  settlement was basically the Cox settlement that previously had been \r\n  approved by the Tennessee court, but with several significant changes, such \r\n  as the joint settlement fund was increased to $950 million; the interest on \r\n  the funds was to go to the CPRC (not back to Shell and Celanese); and the window \r\n  for filing claims was increased from one year to two years.  In addition, the \r\n  parties agreed that no objection would be made to Spencer class counsel \r\n  requesting up to $30 million in attorneysâ€™ fees.  After the global settlement \r\n  was reached, the objections to Spencer by Cox class counsel and \r\n  the objections to Cox by Spencer class counsel were withdrawn.\r\nOn November 17, 1995, the Cox court entered \r\n  a final order approving the class action settlement against Shell and Celanese \r\n  which included $45 million for class counsel and $3,000 for class representatives.  \r\n  The funds for notice and attorneysâ€™ fees were in addition to the $950 \r\n  million in settlement funds.  On the same day, the Spencer court finally \r\n  approved the class action settlement against DuPont.\r\nAlso on November 17, Shell, Celanese and DuPont \r\n  entered into an agreement coordinating the two settlements.  DuPont agreed to \r\n  pay 10% of all CPRC costs associated with claims arising from polybutylene plumbing \r\n  systems with acetal insert fittings, and 10% of CPRC administrative expenses \r\n  (excluding costs for Cox attorneysâ€™ fees or notice).  These payments \r\n  by DuPont were to come out of the Spencer settlement fund.  The coordination \r\n  apparently allows claimants to file a single claim with the CPRC in order to \r\n  get relief from both settlements.\r\nISSUES \r\nAppellants appeal from three orders wherein the trial court granted summary \r\n  judgment to respondents, denied appellantsâ€™ request for class certification, \r\n  and denied respondentsâ€™ request to vacate or reconsider Judge Pieperâ€™s previous \r\n  order denying summary judgment.  However, we find the dispositive issue of this \r\n  appeal is:\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment based on its finding \r\n    that the Spencer and Cox final settlement orders are entitled \r\n    to full faith and credit?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\nAppellants argue that as absent parties who did not appear in the out-of-state \r\nactions, they are free to collaterally challenge the Spencer and Cox \r\njudgments based on personal jurisdiction.  Appellants claim the Alabama and Tennessee \r\ncourts did not have personal jurisdiction over them because they were not accorded \r\nthe minimal due process required for absent class members.  Specifically, appellants \r\nargue that, for several reasons:  (1) notice was constitutionally insufficient; \r\nand (2) there was inadequate representation.\r\nRespondents, on the other hand, argue the trial court correctly found that \r\n  the scope of review when determining full faith and credit is limited to whether \r\n  the jurisdictional issues were fully and fairly litigated in the rendering courts. \r\n   Because they claim the issues related to due process were fully and fairly \r\n  litigated, respondents argue the trial court correctly granted summary judgment \r\n  without further inquiry into the merits of personal jurisdiction/due process.\r\nClearly, the scope of review aspect of the full faith and credit issue \r\n  is the threshold question, and, given the current state of the law on this issue, \r\n  it is also a thorny one.\r\nScope of Collateral Review \r\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause provides, in pertinent part, that â€œ[f]ull \r\n  faith and credit shall be given in each state to the . . . judicial proceedings \r\n  of every other state.â€  U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 1.  Full faith and credit â€œgenerally \r\n  requires every State to give to a judgment at least the res judicata effect \r\n  which the judgment would be accorded in the State which rendered it.â€ \r\n  Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106, 109 (1963) (emphasis added).\r\nThe rule in a class action lawsuit is not any different.  \r\n  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court (â€œUSSCâ€) has specifically stated that \r\n  â€œa judgment entered in a class action, like any other judgment entered in a \r\n  state judicial proceeding, is presumptively entitled to full faith and credit.â€  \r\n  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 374 (1996).\r\nNonetheless, it is also well settled that a judgment \r\n  issued without proper personal jurisdiction over an absent party is not entitled \r\n  to full faith and credit, and therefore has no res judicata effect as to that \r\n  party.  E.g., Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, \r\n  805 (1985); see also Kremer v. Chemical Const. Corp., 456 \r\n  U.S. 461, 482 (1982) (â€œA State may not grant preclusive effect in its own courts \r\n  to a constitutionally infirm judgment, â€¦ and other state and federal courts \r\n  are not required to accord full faith and credit to such a judgment.â€) (footnote \r\n  omitted).\r\nIn Shutts, the USSC held that the Due Process Clause protects an absent \r\n  class action plaintiff â€œeven though that plaintiff may not possess the minimum \r\n  contacts with the forum which would support personal jurisdiction over a defendant.â€  \r\n  Shutts, 472 U.S. at 811.  Thus, in order to provide minimal due process, \r\n  absent class plaintiffs:\r\n\r\n  must receive notice plus an opportunity to be heard and participate in the \r\n    litigation, whether in person or through counsel. The notice must be the best \r\n    practicable, â€œreasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise \r\n    interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity \r\n    to present their objections.â€ â€¦ The notice should describe the action and \r\n    the plaintiffsâ€™ rights in it.  Additionally, â€¦ due process requires at a minimum \r\n    that an absent plaintiff be provided with an opportunity to remove himself \r\n    from the class by executing and returning an â€œopt outâ€ or â€œrequest for exclusionâ€ \r\n    form to the court.  Finally, the Due Process Clause of course requires that \r\n    the named plaintiff at all times adequately represent the interests of the \r\n    absent class members.\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 812 (citations omitted).  If the due process requirements of (1) notice; \r\n  (2) an opportunity to be heard; (3) an opportunity to â€œopt out;â€ and (4) adequate \r\n  representation are met, the foreign court properly asserts personal jurisdiction \r\n  over the absent class plaintiffs.  Accordingly, those plaintiffs who elect not \r\n  to opt out are bound by the foreign courtâ€™s judgment.\r\nThe law is less settled, however, when the issue is the scope of review of \r\n  a rendering courtâ€™s judgment regarding due process in a class action lawsuit.  \r\n  According to respondents, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitâ€™s view \r\n  on the law is the correct one.  In Epstein v. MCA, Inc., 179 F.3d 641 \r\n  (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1004 (1999) (â€œEpstein \r\n  IIIâ€), the Ninth Circuit held that broad collateral review of the \r\n  due process requirements for binding absent class members is not available.  \r\n  Instead, the extent of collateral review is limited to a consideration \r\n  of â€œwhether the procedures in the prior litigation afforded the party against \r\n  whom the earlier judgment is asserted a â€˜full and fair opportunityâ€™ to litigate \r\n  the claim or issue.â€  Id. at 648-49.  The Epstein III court declared \r\n  the following:\r\n\r\n  Simply put, the absent class membersâ€™ due process right to adequate representation \r\n    is protected not by collateral review, but by the certifying court initially, \r\n    and thereafter by appeal within the state system and by direct review in the \r\n    United States Supreme Court. â€¦ Due process requires that an absent class memberâ€™s \r\n    right to adequate representation be protected by the adoption of the appropriate \r\n    procedures by the certifying court and by the courts that review its determinations; \r\n    due process does not require collateral second-guessing of those determinations \r\n    and that review.\r\n\r\nId. at 648 (citations omitted). [5] \r\nMoreover, the procedural history of Epstein v. MCA, Inc. is noteworthy.  \r\n  The initial decision by the Ninth Circuit reversed a district courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  which gave full faith and credit to a class action settlement in Delaware.  \r\n  See Epstein v. MCA, Inc., 50 F.3d 644 (9th Cir. 1995) (â€œEpstein \r\n  Iâ€).  The Epstein I court held that because the Delaware class action \r\n  settlement released exclusively federal claims, the Delaware state court \r\n  judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit.  The USSC reversed and remanded.  \r\n  See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Epstein, supra.  On \r\n  remand, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the Delaware judgment \r\n  was not entitled to full faith and credit because it violated due process \r\n  based on the inadequacy of the class representation.  Epstein v. MCA, Inc., \r\n  126 F.3d 1235 (9th Cir. 1997) (â€œEpstein IIâ€).  Significantly, the Epstein \r\n  II court rejected Matsushitaâ€™s argument that the court was limited to reviewing \r\n  â€œthe procedures that Delaware had in place to ensure adequate representation, \r\n  rather than the adequacy of the representation itself.â€  Id. at 1242 \r\n  (emphasis in original).  Thereafter, the Ninth Circuit granted rehearing, and \r\n  a reconstituted panel [6]  withdrew its Epstein II opinion and rejected the appellantsâ€™ \r\n  contention that the Delaware judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit.  \r\n  Epstein III, supra.\r\nThus, the final word from the Ninth Circuit in Epstein III was \r\n  the emphatic statement that â€œwhere the certifying court makes a determination \r\n  of the adequacy of representation in accord with Shutts,â€ this determination \r\n  is not subject to broad collateral review.  179 F.3d at 648. \r\n  [7]   The USSC declined to review Epstein III.  Epstein v. Matsushita \r\n  Elec. Indus. Co., 528 U.S. 1004 (1999).\r\nAfter Epstein III was decided, however, the Court of Appeals for the \r\n  Second Circuit handed down Stephenson v. Dow Chemical Co., 273 F.3d 249 \r\n  (2nd Cir. 2001).  Appellants contend that, pursuant to Stephenson, \r\n  a broad collateral attack on the nationwide settlements is permissible. \r\n  [8] \r\nIn Stephenson, two Vietnam War veterans brought suit in 1998 and \r\n  1999 for injuries based on their exposure to Agent Orange during the war.  But \r\n  in 1984, a global class action settlement had been entered on identical claims.  \r\n  The settlement provided that no payments would be made for death or disability \r\n  occurring after December 31, 1994. The Stephenson plaintiffsâ€™ conditions \r\n  had not been diagnosed until 1996 and 1998.\r\nThe district court dismissed the Stephenson lawsuit finding it \r\n  was an impermissible collateral attack on the 1984 settlement.  On appeal, the \r\n  plaintiffs argued they were inadequately represented, and therefore, the earlier \r\n  class action settlement did not preclude their claims.  The Stephenson \r\n  court agreed thereby allowing a â€œbroad collateral attackâ€ on the class action \r\n  settlement.  The Stephenson court specifically found that the plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  lawsuit could continue because there had been â€œno prior adequacy of representation \r\n  determination with respect to individuals whose claims arise after the depletion \r\n  of the settlement fund.â€  Id. at 258.  The court rejected the defendantsâ€™ \r\n  reliance on Epstein III for â€œa limited collateral review theory.â€  Id. \r\n  at n.6.  Instead, the court decided that:\r\n\r\n  [T]he propriety of a collateral attack such as this is amply supported by \r\n    precedent.  In Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 61 S.Ct. 115, 85 L.Ed. \r\n    22 (1940), the Supreme Court entertained a collateral attack on an Illinois \r\n    state court class action judgment that purported to bind the plaintiffs.  \r\n    The Court held that class action judgments can only bind absent class members \r\n    where â€œthe interests of those not joined are of the same class as the interests \r\n    of those who are, and where it is considered that the latter fairly represent \r\n    the former in the prosecution of the litigation.â€ Id. at 41, 61 S.Ct. \r\n    115; cf. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 805, \r\n    105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985) (â€œ[I]t is true that a court adjudicating \r\n    a dispute may not be able to predetermine the res judicata effect of its own \r\n    judgment.â€).\r\n\r\nId.\r\nAs to the merits of the collateral attack, the Stephenson court \r\n  relied on the USSCâ€™s recent decisions in Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, \r\n  521 U.S. 591 (1997), and Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815 (1999), \r\n  [9]  to find that the Stephenson plaintiffs had not been adequately \r\n  represented in the 1984 settlement, and therefore were not bound by it.\r\nThe USSC granted certiorari to review Stephenson. \r\n  [10]   However, the USSC ultimately issued a per curiam decision which vacated \r\n  the Second Circuitâ€™s opinion as to one set of plaintiffs, and, by an equally \r\n  divided court, summarily affirmed the decision allowing collateral review as \r\n  to the other set of plaintiffs.  Dow Chemical Co. v. Stephenson, ___ \r\n  U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2161 (2003) (Stevens, J., not participating).\r\nThus, it remains an open, and hotly litigated, question as to whether limited \r\n  collateral review is required on the Shutts due process requirements \r\n  in a class action case (see Epstein III), or whether a broader, \r\n  merits-oriented collateral review is permitted (see Stephenson).  \r\n  In addition to the conflict in the federal circuits as exemplified by Epstein \r\n  III and Stephenson, there is also disagreement amongst the state \r\n  courts [11]  and legal scholars. [12] \r\nIn our opinion, there are important policy considerations favoring both limited \r\n  and broad collateral review.  Certainly, in the specialized context of class \r\n  action litigation, the significant interests in efficiency and finality favor \r\n  limited review.  If the due process issues are fully and fairly litigated and \r\n  necessarily decided by the rendering court, then the strong interest in finality \r\n  militates in favor of an extremely limited collateral review.  Without limited \r\n  review, a nationwide class action could be vulnerable to collateral actions \r\n  in the 49 other states in which it was not litigated initially.  It would seem \r\n  to be a waste of judicial resources to require reviewing courts to conduct an \r\n  extensive substantive review when one has already been undertaken in a sister \r\n  state.  As the Ohio court stated in Fine v. America Online:  â€œTo allow \r\n  substantive collateral attacks would be counterintuitive to [the] procedural \r\n  relief that a class-action suit is intended to afford our judicial system nationwide.â€  \r\n  743 N.E.2d at 421-22.\r\nOn the other hand, there is the fundamental interest in not allowing constitutionally \r\n  infirm judgments to be enforced.  It would be troublesome to enforce a class \r\n  action settlement against parties over whom the rendering court did not have \r\n  personal jurisdiction.  We note, however, that the view espoused in Epstein \r\n  III envisions that direct appellate review of a class action is the appropriate \r\n  vehicle to correct whatever errors may have been made at the trial court level. [13]   \r\nWe hold that in a case such as this one, only a limited collateral review \r\n  is appropriate.  It would run counter to the class action goals of efficiency \r\n  and finality to allow successive reviews of issues that were, in fact, fully \r\n  and fairly litigated in the rendering court.  Moreover, second-guessing the \r\n  fully litigated decisions of our sister courts would violate the spirit of full \r\n  faith and credit.  See Fine v. America Online, 743 N.E.2d at 421.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, we concur with the Ninth Circuitâ€™s view and find due process \r\n  requires that an absent class memberâ€™s rights are protected by the adoption \r\n  and utilization of appropriate procedures by the certifying court; thereafter, \r\n  the merits of the certifying courtâ€™s determinations are subject to direct appellate \r\n  review.  As for collateral review, however, due process does not afford any \r\n  â€œsecond-guessing of those determinations.â€  Epstein III, 179 F.3d 648.  \r\n  Instead, what this limited review entails is â€œan examination of procedural \r\n  due process and nothing more.â€  Fine v. America Online, 743 N.E.2d at \r\n  421.  More specifically, we must determine:  (1) whether there were safeguards \r\n  in place to guarantee sufficient notice and adequate representation; and (2) \r\n  whether such safeguards were, in fact, applied.  Id. at 422.\r\nInitially, we note our agreement with the trial courtâ€™s findings that \r\n  both the Spencer court in Alabama and the Cox court in Tennessee \r\n  actually ruled that the due process requirements had been met.  Both these courts \r\n  specifically found that the respective notice programs met minimal due process.  \r\n  The Cox final order stated that the adequacy requirement (in terms of \r\n  Tennesseeâ€™s Rule 23) had been met and it had jurisdiction over the parties.  \r\n  The Spencer final order found the â€œsettlement fair, adequate and reasonableâ€ \r\n  to the members of the class.  \r\nAccordingly, under a limited collateral review, the two foreign judgments \r\n  on their face appear to be entitled to full faith and credit.  See, e.g., \r\n  Epstein III, supra; Fine v. America Online, supra.  \r\n  Nonetheless, we turn separately to a review of the procedures utilized by the \r\n  foreign courts to ensure proper notice and adequate representation.\r\nNotice\r\nSome factual background on the notice programs is required.\r\nAs noted by the Cox court, the notice in Cox was â€œa singularly \r\n  comprehensive and creative notice program.â€  According to the president of one \r\n  of the consulting companies hired to provide notice in Cox, the program \r\n  was designed to reach the largest possible number of consumers whose homes contained \r\n  polybutylene plumbing.  Over 5.6 million individual mailed notices were sent; \r\n  of those, 244,756 were mailed to South Carolina addresses.  In addition, there \r\n  was a toll-free 800 telephone number set up to field questions about the settlement.  \r\n  More than 1 million calls were received, and over 10,000 additional notices \r\n  were mailed out.  \r\nFurthermore, there was an extensive multimedia campaign.  For example, between \r\n  August 21, 1995 and September 3, 1995, a 30-second television spot was aired \r\n  213 times on national network and cable television; during September 1995, full \r\n  page notices appeared in Parade magazine, USA Weekend, USA Today, People magazine, \r\n  and TV Guide, as well as in 201 daily and weekly newspapers in 13 targeted states \r\n  (of which South Carolina was one), 38 Hispanic newspapers, and 2 African-American \r\n  newspapers; on October 3, 1995, a national news conference was held in Washington, \r\n  DC, and a press release was sent to 2,000 newspapers, wire services, magazines \r\n  and broadcast points across the United States; and a World Wide Web home page \r\n  was created.  Statistics as of October 30, 1995, estimated that the media campaign \r\n  reached over 90% of those Americans over age 25, or exposure to over 150 million \r\n  people.\r\nLikewise, in Spencer, an extensive notice program occurred during August, \r\n  September and October 1995.  Because the DuPont product was sold â€œmore heavily \r\n  in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions in site-built (â€˜starterâ€™) homes, mobile \r\n  homes, and apartments,â€ the notice program was designed to reach people that \r\n  fell within this demographic, which was determined to be middle-class, high \r\n  school educated adults with household incomes of less than $45,000.  Over 2.5 \r\n  million notices were directly mailed to people in 12 states, of which South \r\n  Carolina was one.  The mailing list was generated based on mobile home ownership \r\n  listings.  Over 275,000 phone calls were initially received on the 800 number, \r\n  and 90,000 additional notices were sent out based on individual requests.\r\nAs in Cox, there was a multimedia campaign in Spencer as well.  \r\n  The notice was published in USA Today, USA Weekend, TV Guide, Jet magazine, \r\n  Parade magazine, and 66 Spanish-language newspapers.  Television and radio commercials \r\n  were aired; press and video news releases were distributed.  The notice program \r\n  cost $7.4 million.\r\nRegarding the content of the notices, the notices in both Cox and \r\n  Spencer explained the terms of the settlement, provided for the opportunity \r\n  to participate (e.g., by filing objections and appearing at the fairness hearing), \r\n  and gave information on how to opt out.  \r\nNonetheless, appellants contend that notice to them as absent class members \r\n  was constitutionally insufficient.  Appellants argue, inter alia, that \r\n  they were entitled to personal notice, rather than by publication.  In addition, \r\n  they maintain that the notice programs were deficient to all class members other \r\n  than mobile home owners and the content of the notice was incomplete.\r\nWithout question, due process requires that absent class plaintiffs be \r\n  given notice.  Shutts, supra.  However, the standard for notice \r\n  is that it must be â€œthe best practicable, â€˜reasonably calculated, under all \r\n  the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action \r\n  and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.â€™â€  Shutts, \r\n  472 U.S. at 812 (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., \r\n  339 U.S. 306, 314-15 (1950)).\r\nIn the final order approving the class settlement, the Cox court made \r\n  several general findings, and numerous specific findings, related to notice.  \r\n  The Cox court characterized the notice program as excellent and found \r\n  it was the best notice practicable under the circumstances.  The court further \r\n  described the program as one unprecedented in â€œreach, scope, and effectiveness.â€  \r\n  Additionally, the Cox court used court-appointed class notice providers \r\n  (two consulting companies), and considered testimony of employees of these companies.  \r\n  The final order extensively details the notice program, highlighting many of \r\n  the aspects outlined above.  The Cox court concluded that the notice \r\n  program â€œmet and exceededâ€ both minimum due process requirements and the notice \r\n  requirements under Tennesseeâ€™s class action rule. [14] \r\nClearly, the Cox court designed and utilized various procedural \r\n  safeguards to guarantee sufficient notice under the circumstances.  Pursuant \r\n  to a limited scope of review, we need go no further in deciding the Cox \r\n  courtâ€™s findings that notice met due process are entitled to deference.\r\nAs in Cox, the issue of notice was fully litigated in Spencer.  \r\n  The Spencer court issued an order prior to the implementation of the \r\n  notice program specifically approving the notice and authorizing the notice \r\n  program. [15]   In the final order approving \r\n  the class settlement, the Spencer court stated that notice was sent â€œvia \r\n  first class and by means of a massive national media campaign.â€  The court specifically \r\n  found that the form of notice satisfied both due process requirements and the \r\n  notice requirements under Alabamaâ€™s class action rule.  The Spencer court \r\n  relied on the affidavit of the consultant who designed the notice program and \r\n  related the details of the notice program, as discussed above.  The court concluded \r\n  that â€œthe means of disseminating the notice was the best practicable, reasonably \r\n  calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise the interested parties of \r\n  the pendency of the Action and their rights therein.â€\r\nAccordingly, we hold that under a limited collateral review it is clear \r\n  there were proper procedures in place to ensure notice in the Spencer \r\n  case complied with minimum due process.\r\nAdequate \r\n  Representation\r\nAppellants argue full faith and credit should not be accorded to the Spencer \r\n  and Cox settlements because adequate representation was lacking.  More \r\n  specifically, appellants argue that conflicts within the class required subclasses; \r\n  class counsel had impermissible conflicts with class members; and class representatives, \r\n  as mobile home owners, were inadequate representatives for other types of owners, \r\n  such as those who own multi-unit structures.  Pursuant to a limited review, \r\n  however, we need merely to determine whether there were safeguards in place \r\n  to guarantee adequate representation.  We conclude that in both Spencer \r\n  and Cox, there were the proper procedures present. \r\nShutts declared that due process â€œof course requires that the named \r\n  plaintiff at all times adequately represent the interests of the absent \r\n  class members.â€  472 U.S. at 812 (emphasis added).\r\nRecently, the USSC has elaborated on what constitutes \r\n  adequate representation.  In Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. \r\n  591 (1997), an asbestos litigation case decided after the Spencer \r\n  and Cox settlements were finalized, the USSC affirmed the Third Circuitâ€™s \r\n  decision to vacate a global class settlement where the federal district court \r\n  had certified the class for settlement purposes.  The Amchem class covered \r\n  plaintiffs who had been exposed to asbestos; the plaintiffs included people \r\n  who had already manifested personal injury and those who had not yet \r\n  manifested any affliction; this latter group was labeled the â€œexposure-onlyâ€ \r\n  plaintiffs.\r\nInitially, the Amchem court made clear that \r\n  while settlement is certainly relevant to a trial courtâ€™s decision to certify \r\n  a class, the other requirements for certification under Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., \r\n  must still be given appropriate, and even heightened, attention because they \r\n  are specifically designed to bind and protect absent class members.  Id. \r\n  at 619-21.  The court also clearly stated that the overall fairness of a settlement \r\n  is no substitute for Rule 23â€™s certification criteria.  Id. at 622. \r\n  [16] \r\nWith respect to adequate representation, the Amchem \r\n  court stated that the adequacy inquiry â€œserves to uncover conflicts of interest \r\n  between named parties and the class they seek to represent.â€  Id. at \r\n  625.  Significantly, a class representative â€œmust be part of the class and possess \r\n  the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.â€  Id. \r\n  at 625-26 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he \r\n  adequacy heading also factors in competency and conflicts of class counsel.â€  \r\n  Id. at 626 n.20.  \r\nOn the merits of the adequate representation issue, \r\n  Amchem found serious problems with the global class settlement.  First, \r\n  the named parties had â€œdiverse medical conditionsâ€ but nevertheless â€œsought \r\n  to act on behalf of a single giant class rather than on behalf of discrete subclasses.â€  \r\n  Id. at 626.  In addition, the USSC found it significant that the currently \r\n  injured plaintiffsâ€™ interest in â€œgenerous immediate paymentsâ€ would be adverse \r\n  to the exposure-only plaintiffsâ€™ interest â€œin ensuring an ample, inflation-protected \r\n  fund for the future.â€  Id.  The Amchem court also was troubled \r\n  by certain terms of the settlement, to wit, it included no adjustment \r\n  for inflation and only a few claimants per year could opt out at the back end.  \r\n  Thus, the court stated the global settlement had â€œno structural assurance \r\n  of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals affected.â€  \r\n  Id. at 627 (emphasis added).\r\nAppellants argue that, pursuant to Amchem, \r\n  there was inadequate representation, and therefore Spencer and Cox \r\n  should not be given full faith and credit.  Respondents argue that Amchem \r\n  is not appropriately considered on this issue because it involved a direct appeal, \r\n  rather than a collateral review as in this case.  Along the same lines, respondents \r\n  also contend that Amchem cannot be retroactively applied to Spencer \r\n  and Cox, both of which were finalized in 1995, when Amchem was \r\n  decided in 1997.\r\nGiven our limited scope of review, we need not \r\n  address the merits of appellantsâ€™ arguments on adequate representation.  In \r\n  addition, we believe the arguments raised by respondents on Amchemâ€™s \r\n  applicability do not require resolution for our limited review.  Instead, we \r\n  find it is patent that both the Spencer and Cox courts had procedures \r\n  in place to ensure adequate representation.  For example, the Spencer \r\n  court made preliminary findings regarding the adequacy of the named plaintiff \r\n  representatives and the qualifications of counsel.  Moreover, many of appellantsâ€™ \r\n  allegations regarding the actions of class counsel were expressly raised at \r\n  the Spencer fairness hearing.  Finally, the final order in Spencer \r\n  stated that the settlement was fair, adequate and reasonable to the members \r\n  of the class.  The Cox court responded specifically to various objections \r\n  to class counselâ€™s alleged conflicts of interest and found such allegations \r\n  to be without factual support. Indeed, the court commented on class counselâ€™s \r\n  professionalism in protecting and promoting the interests of the class.  The \r\n  court further noted that the $45 million in attorneysâ€™ fees represented only \r\n  approximately 5% of the settlement fund and were not deducted from the settlement \r\n  fund.  The court in Cox specifically stated that â€œthe Agreement is the \r\n  result of good faith, arms-length, and non-collusive negotiations.â€  Finally, \r\n  we note the Cox court also found that the settlement class met the adequacy \r\n  requirements of Tennesseeâ€™s class action rule.\r\nWe find there obviously were procedures in place \r\n  to ensure adequate representation in both Spencer and Cox, and \r\n  that such procedures were implemented throughout.  Accordingly, these court \r\n  findings survive our limited collateral review.  Furthermore, it is important \r\n  to observe that we agree with the Fine v. America Online courtâ€™s view \r\n  that â€œ[m]ere disagreement with the terms of a settlement cannot provide grounds \r\n  for a collateral attackâ€ on a class settlement.  743 N.E.2d at 423.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we find that the proper scope of collateral review of a rendering \r\n  courtâ€™s rulings on the due process requirements for binding absent class members \r\n  is one limited to a consideration of whether the procedures in \r\n  the prior litigation allowed a full and fair opportunity to litigate the due \r\n  process issues.  It is our opinion that such procedures were not only in place \r\n  in Spencer and Cox, but were also consciously and steadfastly \r\n  utilized to accord minimum due process to the absent class members.  Consequently, \r\n  we hold the trial court correctly accorded full faith and credit to the Spencer \r\n  and Cox orders approving the nationwide settlements and properly granted \r\n  summary judgment to respondents.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Shell manufactured and sold polybutylene, which is a raw material \r\n    plastic, i.e., a resin, to manufacturers who extruded it into the polybutylene \r\n    pipes used in these systems.  Celanese and DuPont manufactured and sold Celcon \r\n    and Delrin, respectively, which were molded into the plastic fittings used \r\n    to join the pipes together.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The Howard plaintiffs were three couples who each owned a home with \r\n    a polybutylene plumbing system.  They received settlements for $25,000, $20,000 \r\n    and $20,000.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  It may even be more accurate to say that three classes had \r\n    been certified:  a settlement class vs. DuPont in Alabama, a trial class vs. \r\n    Shell and Celanese in Alabama, and a settlement class vs. Shell and Celanese \r\n    in Tennessee.  The competition aspect, however, clearly was between the trial \r\n    class against Shell and Celanese in Alabama and the settlement class against \r\n    those same two companies in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Judge Silver was presiding over another class action suit, this one \r\n    a statewide class action pending in California.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] While the specific challenge in Epstein III involved adequate \r\n    representation, the Epstein III court made clear that its reasoning \r\n    applied to all aspects of the Shutts due process requirements.  See \r\n    Epstein III, 179 F.3d at 649 (â€œMatsushita itself indicates that \r\n    broad collateral review of the adequacy of representation (or of the other \r\n    due process requirements for binding absent class members) is not available.â€) \r\n    (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  The authoring judge of both Epstein I and \r\n    II had resigned in the interim.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  One judge on the panel dissented, standing by the decision in Epstein \r\n    II.  Epstein III, supra (Thomas, J., dissenting).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Appellants also argue that South Carolina precedent supports the \r\n    proposition that the courts of this state may review the jurisdictional underpinnings \r\n    of a foreign judgment before granting full faith and credit.  See, \r\n    e.g., Peoples Natâ€™l Bank of Greenville v. Manos Bros., Inc., \r\n    226 S.C. 257, 275, 84 S.E.2d 857, 866 (1954) (where in determining the validity \r\n    of a Georgia divorce decree, the Court stated: â€œIt is well settled that want \r\n    of jurisdiction over either the person or the subject matter is open to \r\n    inquiry where a judgment rendered in one state is challenged in another.â€) \r\n    (emphasis added).  We note, however, that nationwide class action lawsuits \r\n    clearly raise very particularized due process issues, and we therefore focus \r\n    our analysis on case law in that context.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Both these cases involved direct appeals of global class settlements \r\n    in asbestos litigation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [10]  The two questions at issue on certiorari were whether absent class \r\n    members are precluded from relitigating the issue of adequacy of representation \r\n    through a collateral attack on a class settlement, and, if collateral attack \r\n    is permissible, whether the â€œadequacy of representationâ€ issue is properly \r\n    determined as of the time of the original litigation or in light of changes \r\n    in the law years after the settlement has become final.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [11]  Compare Fine v. America Online, Inc., 743 N.E.2d 416, \r\n    420 (Ohio Ct. App. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 942 (2001) (staunchly \r\n    following Epstein III and stating: â€œModern constitutional jurisprudence \r\n    requires that the absent class membersâ€™ rights to due process be protected \r\n    not by substantive collateral review, but, rather, by the application of appropriate \r\n    procedures in the certifying court and by the courts that review its determinations.â€) \r\n    with State v.

See Kahan &amp; Silberman, \r\n    73 N.Y.U.

Clare, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:   We granted \r\n  a writ of certiorari to review the grant of Petitionerâ€™s application for post-conviction \r\n  relief (PCR).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nPetitioner, Corey Randall, was convicted \r\n  of trafficking in crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute (PWID) \r\n  crack cocaine within proximity of a school.  He was concurrently sentenced to \r\n  25 years and 15 years, respectively.  He was granted PCR on the basis that 1) \r\n  his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him that, if he proceeded \r\n  to trial and was convicted, he would have to serve 85% of his sentence prior \r\n  to being eligible for parole, and 2) counsel should have objected to the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  closing argument comparing Randall to a cockroach.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was \r\n    counsel ineffective in failing to advise Randall he would be required to serve \r\n    85% of his sentence before being eligible for parole?\r\n   2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was \r\n    counsel ineffective in failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument?\r\n\r\n 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   PAROLE ELIGIBILITY\r\nThe \r\n  PCR court ruled counsel was ineffective in failing to advise Randall that, if \r\n  convicted, he would be required to serve 85% of his sentence prior to being \r\n  parole eligible.  This was error.  \r\nThis \r\n  Court has repeatedly acknowledged that normally, parole eligibility is a collateral \r\n  consequence of sentencing of which a defendant need not be specifically advised \r\n  before entering a guilty plea.  Griffin v. Martin, 278 S.C. 620, 300 \r\n  S.E.2d 482 (1983).  See also Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d \r\n  887 (2000)(counsel is not ineffective for failing to advise a defendant regarding \r\n  parole eligibility in connection with his guilty plea because it is a collateral \r\n  consequence of sentencing); Smith v. State, 329 S.C. 280, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  626 (1997) (unless counsel gives erroneous advice, parole information is not \r\n  a ground for collateral attack of a guilty plea); Brown v. State, 306 \r\n  S.C. 381, 412 S.E.2d 399 (1991)(guilty plea is not rendered involuntary if the \r\n  defendant is not informed of the collateral consequences of his sentence).  \r\n  \r\nRandall \r\n  was advised of the maximum potential sentences he was facing if he proceeded \r\n  to trial (25 years for trafficking and 15 years for PWID within proximity of \r\n  a school), and nonetheless elected to proceed to trial, rejecting an offer for \r\n  a 10 year sentence if he pled to PWID.  The fact that he was not advised of \r\n  the collateral consequence of his parole eligibility did not render his counsel \r\n  ineffective.  Jackson v. State, 349 S.C. 62, 562 S.E.2d 475 (2002) (trial \r\n  counsel need not advise client of collateral consequence of parole eligibility).  \r\n  The grant of PCR on this ground is reversed.\r\n 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   SOLICITORâ€™S COCKROACH ARGUMENT\r\nRandall next argues the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  closing argument, equating him and his co-defendant with cockroaches, was improper \r\n  and infected the trial with unfairness by arousing the passion and prejudice \r\n  of the jury.  We disagree; the comments did not so infect the trial with unfairness \r\n  as to deprive Randall a fair trial.  \r\nA solicitor's closing argument must \r\n  not appeal to the personal biases of the jurors nor be calculated to arouse \r\n  the jurors' passions or prejudices, and its content should stay within the record \r\n  and reasonable inferences thereto.  State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 \r\n  S.E.2d 584 (1999).  A solicitor has a right to state his version of the testimony \r\n  and to comment on the weight to be given such testimony.  Id.  Improper \r\n  comments do not require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant, \r\n  and the appellant has the burden of proving he did not receive a fair trial \r\n  because of the alleged improper argument.  The relevant question is whether \r\n  the solicitor's comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the \r\n  resulting conviction a denial of due process.  Humphries v. State, 351 \r\n  S.C. 362, 570 S.E.2d 160 (2002). \r\nDuring his closing argument, the \r\n  solicitor was describing Randall and his co-defendant (Yawn), accusing them \r\n  of driving up from Florida to South Carolina to traffic drugs.  He explained \r\n  to the jury that a multitude of 10 and 20 dollar bills were found in their motel \r\n  room, and 211 grams, or nearly one-half pound, of cocaine was found in a brown \r\n  paper bag in the room.  He told the jury they were not nice people and they \r\n  were dirty because they were in the business of selling death and had come up \r\n  to South Carolina to get rich, and they didnâ€™t care who they hurt when they \r\n  sold their drugs.  The solicitor then went on:\r\n\r\n  Thatâ€™s why when I think of dope \r\n    dealers ladies and gentlemen, the only way I can think of them is like cockroaches.  \r\n    And if that sounds foul to you, it should.  Cause drug dealers are filthy \r\n    just like cockroaches.  Everywhere they go, everything they touch, they contaminate.  \r\n    And one thing about cockroaches and certainly is true is they hate the light.  \r\n    Particularly the blue kind like the ones that stopped these two fellows cause \r\n    they were scurrying back to their nest egg.  40 to 80 thousand dollars total.  \r\n    But the thing that makes them worse than cockroaches is the fact theyâ€™re human \r\n    beings. [1]    \r\n\r\nRandall \r\n  contends the â€œdirty cockroachâ€ analogy deprived him of a fair trial.  We disagree.  \r\n  Given the facts of the case, we are confident the solicitorâ€™s cockroach analogy \r\n  in no way affected the juryâ€™s verdict.  Nearly one-half pound of crack cocaine, \r\n  along with razor blades, was found in a motel room registered to Randall, and \r\n  nearly $900.00 cash was found upon him, and several hundred more dollars were \r\n  found amongst his personal belongings in a motel room, registered solely to \r\n  Randall.  We find the solicitorâ€™s comments did not so infect the trial with \r\n  unfairness as to make Randall's conviction a denial of due process.   \r\nFurther, \r\n  the objected-to argument consists of only 10 lines in the transcript.  This \r\n  is not  akin to other situations in which we have reversed for repeated improper \r\n  references throughout trial.  See State v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  41 (2000)(23 references to defendant by his nickname â€œOutlawâ€ were prejudicial \r\n  when used not to establish identity but, rather, to demonstrate the defendantâ€™s \r\n  character); State v. Hawkins, 292 S.C. 418, 357 S.E.2d 10 (1987) overruled \r\n  on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 \r\n  (1991)(solicitor's reference to defendant's nickname, &quot;Mad Dog,&quot; over \r\n  forty times denied the defendant due process).  This case is more akin to State \r\n  v. Tubbs, 333 S.C. 316, 509 S.E.2d 815 (1999) in which this Court held seven \r\n  isolated references to the defendantâ€™s nickname â€œCobra,â€ though undesirable, \r\n  did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to deprive the defendant due \r\n  process. \r\nThe \r\n  grant of PCR is reversed.  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, \r\n  C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    We note that a â€œcockroachâ€ \r\n    closing argument has been upheld against challenge by the Supreme Court of \r\n    Indiana.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the sanction of disbarment.  We accept the \r\n  agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.  The \r\n  facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Trust Account Matter\r\nFrom September 2002 through July 2003, respondent, who \r\n  had a large real estate practice, issued approximately 750 checks from his trust \r\n  account to his operating account.  The checks were not, on the occasions issued, \r\n  payment for earned fees, but were from monies belonging to clients and/or lenders \r\n  involved in  pending real estate transactions.  Respondent began this misappropriation \r\n  in an effort to maintain his law practice after there was a dramatic reduction \r\n  in the number of closings he was handling.  \r\nThe checks at issue were usually written in amounts of \r\n  $500, $550, or $600.  Respondent wrote anywhere from ten to thirty-five checks \r\n  at a time.  The checks were written to appear like and replicate checks for \r\n  fees respondent was regularly paid out of his trust account for real estate \r\n  transactions.  Respondent maintained a ledger of the checks which showed the \r\n  check number, date of issuance and amount of money owed to the trust account \r\n  due to the issuance of the checks.  As real estate transactions were closed, \r\n  respondent would use the check number of a previously written check listed on \r\n  the ledger as the fee due respondent for that transaction so as to balance respondent's \r\n  records for that particular transaction.  Respondent would then delete that \r\n  check number from the ledger.\r\nAs of February 2003, respondent had repaid all amounts \r\n  previously misappropriated using the foregoing arrangement.  Respondent repaid \r\n  the misappropriated funds by not issuing checks for fees for real estate closings \r\n  and instead using check numbers of checks already on the ledger to balance the \r\n  trust account records for a particular real estate transaction.\r\nHowever, beginning in March 2003, respondent resumed issuing \r\n  checks from his trust account to his operating account pursuant to the foregoing \r\n  arrangement, but was unable to repay those amounts due to a further downturn \r\n  in the number of real estate closings his firm was handling.\r\nRespondent misappropriated approximately $412,000 under \r\n  the foregoing arrangement.  After deducting the amount repaid from the total \r\n  amount misappropriated, there was, and presently remains, a shortage in respondent's \r\n  trust account of approximately $327,000.\r\nRespondent self-reported his misconduct to the Office of \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel and consented to being placed on interim suspension.  In \r\n  the Matter of Arsi, 355 S.C. 411, 585 S.E.2d 778 (2003).  Respondent has \r\n  fully cooperated with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel as well as the attorney \r\n  appointed to protect the interests of respondent's clients.\r\nII.                Refinancing Matter\r\nRespondent represented clients who refinanced a mortgage.  \r\n  The closing documents indicated the existing mortgage was to be paid from the \r\n  proceeds of the refinancing transaction.  The new mortgage was recorded and \r\n  forwarded to the new lender along with a final loan policy of title insurance.  \r\n  A condition for the issuance of the loan policy of title insurance was that \r\n  the existing mortgage be paid off and satisfied of record.  The loan policy \r\n  indicated the new mortgage was a first mortgage on the public records when, \r\n  in fact, the existing mortgage had not been satisfied.  Several months after \r\n  the closing, respondent's clients were contacted by the holder of the existing \r\n  mortgage and discovered the existing mortgage had not been paid.  The clients \r\n  attempted to contact respondent but for several months were only able to talk \r\n  to respondent's staff.  After the clients were finally able to talk directly \r\n  with respondent, respondent caused the existing mortgage to be paid off and \r\n  satisfied of record.\r\nRespondent maintains the check to pay off the existing \r\n  mortgage was issued at closing and was hand delivered to the holder of the mortgage \r\n  on the day of closing, the original check has never been located, and respondent \r\n  has not been able to discover any explanation as to what happened to the check \r\n  after it reached the holder of the existing mortgage.  Respondent contends the \r\n  funds to pay the existing mortgage remained secure in respondent's trust account \r\n  from the time they were received until paid by way of a new check to the holder \r\n  of the existing mortgage.\r\nRespondent acknowledges he did not provide competent representation \r\n  to the clients, that he was not diligent in handling the matter, and that he \r\n  gave incorrect information to the new lender when he represented that the new \r\n  mortgage constituted a first lien of record on the secured property when, in \r\n  fact the existing mortgage constituted a first lien on the property.  \r\nRespondent maintains he was utilizing a computer program that he thought was \r\n  reconciling his trust account on a monthly basis.  However, respondent recognizes \r\n  that the system he was using was inadequate to meet the requirements of Rule \r\n  417, SCACR, inasmuch as respondent failed to recognize the funds in this matter \r\n  had been retained and undisbursed in his trust account for over a one-year period.  \r\n  Approximately fourteen months elapsed from the date of the closing of the refinanced \r\n  transaction until the existing mortgage was paid off and satisfied of record.  \r\n  As a result of the foregoing, foreclosure proceedings were initiated against \r\n  the clients by the holder of the existing mortgage, but were eventually resolved.  \r\n  In addition, the clients filed a civil action against respondent which was settled.\r\nIII.              Title Insurance Matter\r\nRespondent, directly and/or through a title insurance agency, \r\n  was a title insurance agent for, and obtained title insurance from, a title \r\n  insurance company from 1999 through December 2001.  Respondent was the owner \r\n  of or had a substantial interest in the title insurance agency.  On numerous \r\n  occasions there was an undue delay in the issuance of final title insurance \r\n  policies after the related loan transaction had been closed, which resulted \r\n  in the title insurance company terminating its agency relationship with respondent \r\n  and the title insurance agency.  Thereafter, the title insurance company spent \r\n  over a year preparing final title insurance policies on transactions closed \r\n  by respondent while an agent for the company.  Respondent acknowledges that \r\n  on numerous occasions related to loan closings involving title insurance from \r\n  the title insurance company, respondent did not provide competent representation, \r\n  was not diligent, and did not properly supervise his non-lawyer staff.  \r\nThe title insurance company maintains it is owed, by respondent and/or the \r\n  title insurance agency, $4,353.23 for title insurance premiums collected by \r\n  respondent and/or the title insurance agency but not forwarded to the title \r\n  insurance company.  Respondent contends the failure to pay the amount due was \r\n  not a result of misappropriation of funds by respondent, but was instead due \r\n  to respondent's failure to supervise his non-lawyer staff and his failure to \r\n  comply with Rule 417, SCACR.  However, respondent does not believe he owes any \r\n  money to the title insurance company and maintains he has never received a statement \r\n  or claim from the company for the amount it claims it is due.  Regardless, respondent \r\n  acknowledges he did not provide competent representation in connection with \r\n  the related real estate transactions, was not diligent in the completion of \r\n  work undertaken in connection with the transactions, and did not properly see \r\n  to the safekeeping of funds belonging to the company that were deducted from \r\n  proceeds of the real estate transactions.\r\nIV.              Title Agency Matter\r\nRespondent entered into a business arrangement with a non-lawyer \r\n  to form the above-referenced title insurance agency in which both respondent \r\n  and the non-lawyer were principles.  The agency entered into a title insurance \r\n  underwriting agreement with a title insurance company.  Under the terms of the \r\n  agreement, respondent was required to maintain a separate escrow account for \r\n  all funds received in connection with the title insurance company's title insurance \r\n  policies and to remit premiums collected, and copies of all policies and commitments \r\n  issued, to the company on a monthly basis.  Respondent, acting as closing attorney, \r\n  and the agency began closing real estate loans.  Thereafter, differences arose \r\n  between respondent and the non-lawyer, the agency ceased operations and the \r\n  business arrangement between respondent and the non-lawyer was dissolved.  Because \r\n  it appeared that all title insurance premiums due the title insurance company \r\n  had not been paid by the agency, and that there was a shortage in excess of \r\n  $66,000, the title insurance company initiated a civil action against respondent.  \r\n  That action is still pending.\r\nRespondent maintains he did not withhold any of the funds \r\n  due the title insurance company, [1] \r\n   but acknowledges he failed to properly supervise the non-lawyer employee \r\n  of the agency and failed to oversee the safekeeping of the title insurance premiums \r\n  collected by the agency in real estate closings handled by respondent in contravention \r\n  of the procedures established by this Court for the operation of trust accounts \r\n  and the handling of monies of others and in violation of the agreement between \r\n  respondent and the title insurance company.  Respondent contends any shortage \r\n  in funds owed to the company is not due to any acts committed on the part of \r\n  respondent or to misappropriation of funds.\r\nV.                Carolina Title Services Matter\r\nRespondent closed approximately five real estate transactions \r\n  in a two-week period for Carolina Title Services (CTS).  There were no licensed \r\n  attorneys employed by CTS.  Pursuant to an arrangement between respondent and \r\n  CTS, CTS prepared the closing documents and respondent reviewed the title abstract \r\n  and closing documents and attended the closings as attorney for the borrowers.  \r\n  The HUD-1 Settlement Statements showed respondent as the &quot;settlement agent&quot; \r\n  and respondent signed the settlement statements in that capacity.  However, \r\n  respondent represents his signature was added without his knowledge by non-lawyer \r\n  staff of CTS.  \r\nFor a period of time, respondent left disbursement of the proceeds from the \r\n  transactions to be completed by the non-lawyer staff of CTS.  During this period, \r\n  respondent was under the impression, from discussions with the manager of CTS, \r\n  that another attorney, William J. McMillian, III, was overseeing the disbursement \r\n  of the proceeds of the transactions, the recordation of documents, and any other \r\n  aspects of the closings required to be performed by an attorney.  Respondent \r\n  relied on those representations from the manager, but did not discuss the arrangement \r\n  with McMillian.  McMillian did, in fact, have a close working relationship concerning \r\n  the closing of real estate transactions with CTS and respondent was aware of \r\n  that relationship.  Respondent was paid by way of checks drafted on McMillian's \r\n  trust account, signed by the manager of CTS, and transmitted to respondent by \r\n  CTS rather than McMillian.  All of the checks were returned due to insufficient \r\n  funds; therefore, respondent was not paid for his services in the transactions.  \r\n\r\nRespondent later learned that McMillian was not involved in the transactions, \r\n  that the manager of CTS had signature authority on McMillian's trust account, \r\n  and that disbursements were being made by CTS without supervision by a licensed \r\n  attorney.  Thereafter, respondent insisted that all disbursements on real estate \r\n  transactions with CTS be made by respondent through respondent's trust account.  \r\n  Respondent is now aware that the manager of CTS had directed the bank to &quot;sweep&quot; \r\n  all funds out of McMillian's IOLTA trust account each day into the manager's \r\n  personal bank account, which later resulted in a considerable shortage of funds \r\n  in McMillian's trust account; however, respondent was unaware of that arrangement \r\n  during the time respondent allowed CTS to handle the disbursement of funds from \r\n  real estate transactions.  Respondent now recognizes that, as a result of his \r\n  reliance on incorrect information from the manager of CTS, respondent assisted \r\n  one or more of the non-lawyer employees of CTS to engage in the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law.  Respondent maintains he discontinued participating in the \r\n  &quot;closing only&quot; arrangement with CTS when he learned that representations \r\n  made to him regarding the involvement of McMillian in other aspects of the transactions \r\n  were incorrect.\r\nIn one case, respondent reviewed the closing documents \r\n  but was unable to attend the closing due to a scheduling conflict.  Respondent \r\n  retained attorney Stephen M. Pstrak to attend the closing in his place.  However, \r\n  respondent did not advise the clients of the limited scope of  Pstrak's representation.  \r\n  Neither respondent nor Pstrak did any further work on the matter after the closing.  \r\n  Shortly thereafter, McMillian was placed on interim suspension by this Court \r\n  and his trust account, used by CTS for disbursement of funds from the transaction, \r\n  was frozen by the attorney appointed to protect the interests of McMillian's \r\n  clients.  In the Matter of McMillian, 350 S.C. 216, 565 S.E.2d 765 (2002).  \r\n  Some time later, respondent was advised that the transaction had not been completed.  \r\n  The clients had to retain another attorney to complete the closing, which took \r\n  approximately one year.  Respondent was never paid for the closing, but paid \r\n  Pstrak for his participation.  \r\nRespondent contends he was under the mistaken impression on the occasion of \r\n  the closing that McMillian would be handling the disbursement of the funds and \r\n  recordation of the closing documents when, in fact, he now knows McMillian was \r\n  not involved in the transaction and it was, instead, being handled by non-lawyer \r\n  employees of CTS without the supervision of a licensed attorney.  Respondent \r\n  now recognizes that it was his responsibility to see that the transaction was \r\n  properly closed and that the proceeds from the transaction were disbursed in \r\n  accordance with the settlement statement since Pstrak, as his designee, signed \r\n  as &quot;settlement agent&quot; under respondent's authorization and direction, \r\n  and that it was his further responsibility to have assisted the clients in removing \r\n  the impediments to closing once respondent was advised that the transaction \r\n  had not been completed.  However, due to respondent not supervising the non-lawyer \r\n  employees of CTS after closing, respondent was unaware that the transaction \r\n  had not been completed until some time later by the new attorney for the clients. \r\n\r\nVI.              Cooperation With Disciplinary Counsel\r\nDisciplinary Counsel states that, to the best of his knowledge \r\n  and belief, respondent has fully cooperated with the inquiries of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel into the above-referenced matters and that respondent has been forthright \r\n  in acknowledging the misconduct set forth herein.  Disciplinary Counsel states \r\n  further that respondent maintained he did not realize some of his actions constituted \r\n  misconduct at the time, but now recognizes as much with the advice of counsel \r\n  and the advantage of hindsight. \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated \r\n  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the \r\n  objectives of representation, except in limited circumstances, and shall consult \r\n  with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule 1.2(c) \r\n  (a lawyer may limit the objectives of the representation if the client consents \r\n  after consultation); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence \r\n  and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall \r\n  keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly \r\n  comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer \r\n  shall hold property of clients that is in the lawyer's possession in connection \r\n  with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property); Rule 1.15(b) \r\n  (a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client any funds that the client is \r\n  entitled to receive); Rule 5.3(b) (a lawyer having direct supervisory \r\n  authority over a nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the \r\n  person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); \r\n  Rule 5.3(c) (a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of a nonlawyer that would \r\n  be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer \r\n  if the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies \r\n  the conduct involved or the lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the \r\n  person is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the person, and \r\n  knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated \r\n  but fails to take reasonable remedial action); Rule 5.4(c) (a lawyer \r\n  shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render \r\n  legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer's professional judgment \r\n  in rendering such legal services); Rule 5.4(d) (a lawyer shall not practice \r\n  with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized \r\n  to practice law for a profit, if a nonlawyer owns any \r\n  interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of the estate of a \r\n  lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable time during \r\n  administration, a nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof \r\n  or a nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the \r\n  professional judgment of a lawyer); Rule 5.5(b) (a lawyer shall not assist a \r\n  person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes \r\n  the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule \r\n  8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal \r\n  act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness \r\n  as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, \r\n  fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).\r\nRespondent also acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration \r\n  of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute); and \r\n  Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate a \r\n  valid court order issued by a court of this state).\r\nFinally, respondent admits that he failed to comply with \r\n  the record keeping and money handling procedures set forth in Rule 417, SCACR.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.  Respondent's \r\n  request that the disbarment be made retroactive to the date he was placed on \r\n  interim suspension is denied.  \r\nWithin thirty days of the date of this opinion, Disciplinary Counsel and respondent \r\n  shall establish a restitution plan pursuant to which respondent shall pay restitution \r\n  to all persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of respondent's \r\n  misconduct in connection with this matter.   Respondent shall also reimburse \r\n  the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any claims paid as a result of his \r\n  misconduct in connection with this matter.  Failure to make restitution in accordance \r\n  with this opinion and the restitution plan may result in respondent being held \r\n  in contempt of this Court.  Moreover, respondent shall not apply for readmission \r\n  unless and until all such restitution has been paid in full.\r\n Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an \r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 \r\n  of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to \r\n  the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent also believes the shortage to be considerably \r\n    less than that claimed by the title insurance company due to the fact that \r\n    the company's audit was based on commitments instead of policies actually \r\n    issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25767 ","title":"In the Matter fo Pstrak","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25767 ","description":"This opinion publicly reprimands Stephen M.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nStephen M. Pstrak, of Lexington, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand. [1]   The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Real Estate Closing Matter I\r\nRespondent attended a real estate closing in place of attorney \r\n  J. Wendell Arsi, who had a conflict and could not attend. [2]   The closing involved the purchase of a mobile \r\n  home from a mobile home dealer and real property from a developer.  The transaction \r\n  was being financed by a lender.  Respondent was only asked to attend the closing \r\n  and be responsible for the review and execution of the closing documents.  Respondent \r\n  was &quot;under the good faith impression&quot; that Arsi had examined, or would \r\n  be examining, or at least reviewing, the abstract of title and had drafted, \r\n  or at least reviewed, the closing documents.\r\nRespondent attended the closing at the offices of Carolina \r\n  Title Services, Inc. (CTS).  The HUD-1 Settlement Statement reflected that attorney \r\n  William J. McMillian, III, was the settlement agent.  Respondent gathered from \r\n  that information that the proceeds from the transaction would be disbursed by \r\n  McMillian in accordance with the Settlement Statement.  It was unclear to respondent \r\n  whether Arsi or McMillian was to be responsible for updating the title and seeing \r\n  to the recordation of documents in connection with this transaction, but respondent \r\n  incorrectly assumed that one of those attorneys would do so.\r\nRespondent is now advised, and does not dispute, that the \r\n  loan documents were prepared by CTS, that Amy Cook, the owner and manager of \r\n  CTS, advised Arsi that the funds from this transaction would be disbursed by \r\n  McMillian, and that Arsi was under the impression that he was only expected \r\n  to attend the closing and that other aspects of the transaction required by \r\n  applicable rules to be handled by an attorney would be handled by McMillian. [3]   Respondent did not confirm any \r\n  of the foregoing with Arsi or McMillian and respondent is advised, and does \r\n  not dispute, that Arsi did not confirm any of the foregoing with McMillian.  \r\n  It is now known and acknowledged that McMillian had no involvement with the \r\n  transaction whatsoever, that McMillian had previously opened an IOLTA account \r\n  with BB&amp;T on which he allowed Cook to be a signatory, that the checkbooks \r\n  for that IOLTA account were kept by Cook at CTS, that the cancelled checks and \r\n  bank statements concerning real estate transactions were returned to and maintained \r\n  by Cook, that McMillian was not reconciling or even reviewing the bank statements \r\n  and cancelled checks pursuant to Rule 417, SCACR, and that McMillian's only \r\n  involvement with transactions such as the instant transaction was to allow CTS \r\n  to use his IOLTA account and show McMillian as settlement agent.\r\nSubsequently, there was a substantial shortage discovered \r\n  in McMillian's IOLTA account.  It is reported that BB&amp;T placed a &quot;sweep&quot; \r\n  on the account at the direction of Cook and would &quot;sweep&quot; the funds \r\n  from the account into Cook's account on a daily basis.  After the shortage of \r\n  funds in McMillian's IOLTA account was discovered, McMillian was placed on interim \r\n  suspension.  In the Matter of McMillian, 350 S.C. 216, 565 S.E.2d 765 \r\n  (2002).\r\nThe closing appeared to be a relatively simple matter.  \r\n  Respondent had no file in connection with the transaction when he arrived for \r\n  the closing.  Respondent questioned Cook about getting a file to Arsi.  Respondent \r\n  later checked with Arsi's office, which confirmed that it had received a file \r\n  in connection with the closing, which, in turn, &quot;triggered&quot; the firm \r\n  to compensate respondent for standing in for Arsi at the closing.  At the time, \r\n  respondent was under the impression that his involvement in the transaction \r\n  ended upon the review and execution of the closing documents and the file being \r\n  sent to Arsi.\r\nAs a result of delays and the subsequent suspension of McMillian, \r\n  the transaction was not completed.  The mobile home dealer received payment \r\n  for the mobile home, but the developer did not receive payment for the real \r\n  estate.  Respondent subsequently received a telephone call from an attorney \r\n  representing the developer advising that the transaction had not been completed.  \r\n  Respondent left a message on the attorney's answering machine relating his limited \r\n  involvement in the transaction and advising her to contact Arsi.\r\nWhen the purchaser became aware that the transaction had \r\n  not been completed in a timely manner, he filed a complaint with the Commission \r\n  on Lawyer Conduct.  He maintained he had expended funds to clear the real property \r\n  and to have the driveway installed, but was not able to register his mobile \r\n  home or get connections for water or electricity or a permit for a septic tank \r\n  because the transaction had not been completed.  The purchaser was under the \r\n  impression that respondent was standing in for McMillian at the closing and \r\n  was unaware of Arsi having any involvement in the matter.\r\nRespondent now recognizes that, pursuant to State v. \r\n  Buyers Service Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d 15 (1987) and Doe \r\n  v. McMaster, 351 S.C. 158, 568 S.E.2d 356 (2003), Cook was engaged in the \r\n  unauthorized practice of law and that respondent, albeit unintentionally, assisted \r\n  Cook in doing so.  Respondent now acknowledges that when he served as the closing \r\n  attorney in connection with the transaction it was his responsibility to see \r\n  that an attorney had been involved in all other aspects of the transaction requiring \r\n  attorney participation under the aforementioned cases, that it was his responsibility \r\n  to either see to the proper disbursement of the funds or see that an attorney \r\n  approved by the client was going to handle or oversee the recordation of documents \r\n  and proper disbursement of the funds.\r\nIn mitigation, Disciplinary Counsel states respondent was \r\n  under the good-faith impression that either Arsi or McMillian were to see to \r\n  the other aspects of the closing that required attorney participation, that \r\n  respondent was unaware that Cook was engaging in the unauthorized practice of \r\n  law, that respondent was unaware Cook had unsupervised access to and use of \r\n  McMillian's IOLTA account and that respondent in no way contributed to the subsequent \r\n  defalcations in the transaction.  Furthermore, Disciplinary Counsel has been \r\n  advised by the attorney subsequently retained by the developer that the matters \r\n  set forth herein were resolved to the satisfaction of the purchaser within a \r\n  few months after the closing. \r\nII.               Real Estate Closing Matter II\r\nRespondent was contacted by a paralegal in Arsi's office \r\n  to attend a second closing in Arsi's place.  The paralegal asked only that respondent \r\n  attend the closing and perform as closing attorney at the closing.  Respondent \r\n  attended the closing, reviewed the closing documents with the clients and supervised \r\n  the execution of the closing documents.  Respondent did not undertake any further \r\n  work on the transaction after attending the closing and, instead, left the executed \r\n  documents and the proceeds from the transaction in the hands of Cook or another \r\n  employee of CTS.\r\nRespondent was under the impression that either Arsi or \r\n  McMillian had conducted the title examination or reviewed a title abstract in \r\n  connection with the property, had prepared and reviewed the closing documents, \r\n  and would see to the finalization of the transaction, including updating the \r\n  title prior to recordation, recordation of the necessary documents in the public \r\n  records, and disbursement of the proceeds in accordance with the HUD-1 Settlement \r\n  Statement presented and executed at closing. [4]   \r\nIt was respondent's understanding, from his conversation \r\n  with Arsi's paralegal, that his sole function at the closing was to review the \r\n  closing documents, see to the proper execution of the documents, and answer \r\n  any questions that the clients might have concerning the closing documents and \r\n  the closing.  Respondent did not advise the clients of the limited scope of \r\n  his representation.\r\nDue to McMillian being placed on interim suspension and \r\n  his IOLTA account being frozen, the transaction could not be closed.  The clients \r\n  called respondent's office to discuss the impediments to closing the transaction.  \r\n  Respondent instructed his secretary to tell the clients that respondent's involvement \r\n  was limited to attending the closing and they should contact Arsi about the \r\n  problems they were having getting the transaction closed.  Respondent tried \r\n  to contact the clients directly on two occasions, but was unable to reach them.  \r\n  He left a message on their answering machine to contact Arsi since respondent \r\n  was only at the closing to assist Arsi and that he understood Arsi to be the \r\n  actual closing attorney.  The clients were able to remove the impediments to \r\n  the transaction a year later after hiring counsel to assist them.\r\nArsi reported that had he been able to attend the closing, \r\n  his participation would have been limited to the same participation respondent \r\n  had in the transaction, that no lawyer examined the title to the real property \r\n  which was the subject of the transaction or reviewed any title abstract, that \r\n  no lawyer prepared the closing documents, that no lawyer saw to the recordation \r\n  of documents in the public records or to the completion of the transaction in \r\n  accordance with the wishes of the clients and the instructions from the lender, \r\n  and that, had the transaction been closed, the disposition of the proceeds of \r\n  the transaction would not have been made by a licensed attorney but would have \r\n  been made by CTS using McMillian's IOLTA account.  \r\nRespondent now recognizes that, by his limited participation in the closing, \r\n  he assisted Cook in the unauthorized practice of law, albeit unwittingly.  Respondent \r\n  further acknowledges that it was his professional responsibility upon serving \r\n  as closing attorney, to ensure that the other aspects of the closing required \r\n  to be handled by an attorney were handled or properly supervised by a person \r\n  licensed to practice law in South Carolina.\r\nIII.              Mitigation\r\nDisciplinary Counsel reports that respondent has been fully \r\n  cooperative in the conclusion of this matter, has been forthright in acknowledging \r\n  his misconduct and addressing the matter, and had no involvement whatsoever \r\n  in, or knowledge of, the subsequent shortages in McMillian's IOLTA account until \r\n  after his participation in the two closings.  Respondent now recognizes that \r\n  he should have been more diligent in insuring that an attorney was acting at \r\n  each stage of the transactions, for which he became responsible upon serving \r\n  as the closing attorney, and that client funds from the transactions should \r\n  not have been left in the hands of a non-lawyer.  Finally, it appears that respondent's \r\n  relationship with CTS was short lived and only involved two transactions.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 5.3(b) (a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer \r\n  shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible \r\n  with the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 5.5(b) (a lawyer shall \r\n  not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity \r\n  that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); and Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct).  We also find he has violated the following provisions of the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation \r\n  to a client); Rule 1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions \r\n  concerning the objectives of representation, except in limited circumstances, \r\n  and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); \r\n  and Rule 1.2(c) (a lawyer may limit the objectives of the representation if \r\n  the client consents after consultation).\r\nRespondent's misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly \r\n  reprimand respondent for his actions.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In January 2003, respondent received an eight \r\n    month suspension for misconduct unrelated to that set forth in this opinion.  \r\n    In the Matter of Pstrak, 352 S.C. 505, 575 S.E.2d 559 (2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Respondent discussed the matter with Arsi's paralegal, \r\n    but did not speak directly with Arsi.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  By separate opinion of this same date, Arsi has \r\n    been disbarred due, in part, to his participation in this closing arrangement \r\n    with CTS and McMillian.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The settlement statement showed McMillian as the \r\n    settlement agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25768","title":"In the Matter of Wolf","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25768","description":"This opinion disbars C.T.

Richardson, Jr., and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, \r\n  both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nC.T. Wolf, of  North Myrtle Beach, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction permitted by \r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice \r\n  of law in this state. [1]   The \r\n  facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Misappropriation of Funds Matter\r\nRespondent was retained by a client to assist her with the \r\n  estate of her common law husband.  Respondent received $22,275.57 from one of \r\n  the husband's bank accounts and deposited those funds into respondent's trust \r\n  account.  Thereafter, respondent misappropriated and converted the entire amount \r\n  to purposes other than those for which they were intended.\r\nRespondent subsequently directed the bank to close the trust account.  He then \r\n  presented the client with a check, in the amount of $22,275.57, from the closed \r\n  account.  The check was returned due to the fact that the account had been closed \r\n  and contained insufficient funds.  Respondent provided the client with a letter \r\n  of explanation which stated respondent had closed a real estate matter, the \r\n  client's funds were in the trust account from which disbursements were made \r\n  on the real estate matter, the lender in the real estate matter failed to wire \r\n  the funds into the trust account, the lender was supposed to wire approximately \r\n  $62,000 into the trust account, and if the lender did not wire the funds within \r\n  the week, respondent would pay the client from personal assets.\r\nTwo weeks later, the client, who had not been paid, confronted respondent.  \r\n  Thereafter, respondent presented the client with a check for $12,000, drawn \r\n  on his mother's home equity account, and a promissory note for the balance.  \r\n  As collateral, respondent gave the client the title to his boat and informed \r\n  the client that she could sell the boat if respondent had not honored the promissory \r\n  note by the following week.  Respondent subsequently gave the client a cashier's \r\n  check for the balance due and she returned the title to the boat.\r\nRespondent admits he misappropriated the client's money and that the information \r\n  he provided in his letter of explanation contained false and misleading information \r\n  for the purpose of delaying the client until respondent could acquire funds \r\n  to pay her.\r\nII.               Fee Dispute Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to represent a client in a post-conviction \r\n  relief matter.  A fee agreement was prepared which indicated the fee would be \r\n  $4,000.  Thereafter, the client's mother met with an employee of respondent, \r\n  paid $11,000 by way of two checks, and was given a receipt.\r\nThe client's wife later filed a complaint with the Resolution of Fee Disputes \r\n  Board, alleging respondent failed to work on the case.  In response to an inquiry \r\n  from the Board, respondent represented that he had only received a payment of \r\n  $4,000.  Ultimately, the Board ruled that respondent must refund $10,000 of \r\n  the fee paid.  The Board notified the Office of Disciplinary Counsel of respondent's \r\n  misrepresentation regarding the amount received.  \r\nAn investigation by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which included an examination \r\n  of respondent's financial records, revealed respondent received an $11,000 payment.  \r\n  Respondent thereafter admitted he received $11,000 and admitted he owed a refund \r\n  of $10,000 of the fee paid. \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer \r\n  shall hold property of clients that is in the lawyer's possession in connection \r\n  with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that \r\n  is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to \r\n  willfully violate a valid order of the Supreme Court, Commission or panels of \r\n  the Commissions in a proceeding under these rules, willfully fail to appear \r\n  personally as directed, willfully fail to comply with a subpoena issued under \r\n  these rules, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary \r\n  authority, to include a request for a response or appearance under Rule 19(b)(1), \r\n  (c)(3) or (c)(4)); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to \r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice \r\n  law in this state).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.  Within \r\n  thirty days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall make restitution to \r\n  the victims whose funds were misappropriated as well as the Lawyers' Fund for \r\n  Client Protection for any amounts the Fund has paid to the attorney appointed \r\n  to protect the interests of respondent's clients and any other amounts the Fund \r\n  may have paid on claims resulting from respondent's misconduct in connection \r\n  with this matter.  Failure to make restitution in accordance with this opinion \r\n  may result in respondent being held in contempt of this Court.  Moreover, respondent \r\n  shall not apply for readmission unless and until all such restitution has been \r\n  paid in full.\r\n Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an \r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 \r\n  of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to \r\n  the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  By order dated November 22, 2002, respondent was \r\n    placed on interim suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25769","title":"Stanley v.

Thye, of the Office of the City Attorney, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nM. Baron Stanton, of Stanton Law Offices, P.A., of Columbia, for respondent.\r\nWilliam H. Davidson, II, and Kenneth P. Woodington, of Davidson, Morrison and \r\n  Lindemann, P.A., of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae South Carolina Municipal Association.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  Respondent commenced a 42 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1983 [1]  action against petitioner (the \r\n  City) alleging the City had a policy or custom of attempting to oppress and \r\n  financially hobble her.  We granted certiorari to determine whether the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred by reversing the trial courtâ€™s order granting the City summary \r\n  judgment and denying respondentâ€™s motion to amend her complaint.  Stanley \r\n  v. Kirkpatrick, 2001-UP-016 (S.C. Ct. App. refiled October 3, 2001).  We \r\n  affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent bred Shar-Pei dogs at her Columbia home.  Due to the complaints \r\n  of neighbors, the City fined respondent several times for operating an unlawful \r\n  kennel and for keeping unlicensed pets.  Officer Kevin Kirkpatrick issued at \r\n  least three of these citations.\r\nKirkpatrick testified he received a complaint in July 1996.  As a \r\n  result, he, along with Officer H.P. Stephenson of the Humane Society, visited \r\n  respondentâ€™s home and saw fifteen Shar-Pei dogs inside the house and in the \r\n  backyard, which was enclosed with a metal gate.  On July 8, 1996, Stephenson \r\n  and Kirkpatrick returned to the residence in an effort to acquire details for \r\n  a search warrant.  On this visit, they saw five female Shar-Pei puppies running \r\n  around the street and in the neighborâ€™s yard.  They captured the at-large puppies.\r\nThe following day, Kirkpatrick served a warrant on respondent, citing \r\n  her for violating a city ordinance restricting the number of dogs per residence.  \r\n  He informed respondent he had captured five puppies that were taken to the Animal \r\n  Services Shelter (the shelter) and that she needed to contact the shelter to \r\n  identify the puppies.  While Kirkpatrick assumed the dogs were respondentâ€™s, \r\n  he testified that because the dogs were picked up at-large, there was still \r\n  a question whether they were truly hers.\r\nIn her deposition, respondent disputed the events as related by Kirkpatrick \r\n  and Stephenson.  She testified she believed Kirkpatrick opened the gate, entered \r\n  her backyard, and removed her dogs. [2]   However, she stated she did not see him open \r\n  the gate, nor did anyone tell her they saw him open the gate.  She stated a \r\n  dog had never escaped from her backyard, and there was mesh screening around \r\n  the gate to prevent such an occurrence.\r\nRespondent contacted the shelter and was informed she would have \r\n  to pay $129 per dog to redeem them. \r\n  [3]   Two employees at the shelter testified they directly informed respondent \r\n  she had to identify the dogs because the shelter holds unidentifiable animals \r\n  for only five days. [4]   Respondent claimed no one told \r\n  her she had only five days to retrieve the dogs.\r\nBecause no one came to the shelter to identify the dogs, they were \r\n  euthanized.  They were found to be unsuitable for adoption because they had \r\n  a skin problem and were aggressive towards each other and the handlers. \r\nRespondent filed a Â§ 1983 claim against the City.  She later filed \r\n  a motion to amend the complaint to add state tort claims to her Â§ 1983 lawsuit.  \r\n  The City filed a motion for summary judgment.  The trial court denied the motion \r\n  to amend and granted the Cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s denial of respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend her complaint to add state tort claims and reversed the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment on the Â§ 1983 claim.\r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by reversing the trial courtâ€™s denial of respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend her complaint?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondent served her original complaint asserting a Â§ 1983 claim in February \r\n  1997.  The City filed its motion for summary judgment in July 1998.  Respondent \r\n  later served her motion to amend the complaint to add the tort claims of trespass \r\n  and conversion.\r\nFollowing hearings, the court issued an order denying respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend on the basis it was made more than two years after the incident \r\n  and that the applicable statute of limitations had passed on the causes of action \r\n  against the City under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. [5]   The court noted the motion to amend was denied based on the \r\n  prejudice to the defendants and the absence of good cause shown to allow the \r\n  amendments.  The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court.\r\nRule 15(a), SCRCP, provides that, if more than thirty days have elapsed \r\n  from the time a responsive pleading is served, a party may amend his pleading \r\n  only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party.  The rule \r\n  further provides this leave will be freely given when justice so requires and \r\n  does not prejudice the other party.\r\nIt is well established that a motion to amend is addressed to the \r\n  discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden \r\n  of establishing prejudice.  Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 \r\n  S.C. 552, 521 S.E.2d 153 (1999).  The prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack \r\n  of notice that the new issue is to be tried and a lack of opportunity to refute \r\n  it.  Id.  \r\nThe trial court erred by not allowing the amendment on the basis \r\n  the City was prejudiced and respondent had not shown good cause for the amendment.  \r\n  The burden is not on the movant, but on the party opposing the motion to show \r\n  how it is prejudiced.  See Tanner, supra (responsibility \r\n  of party opposing amendment to establish prejudice).  The City argues the amendment \r\n  prejudices it because the statute of limitations on the tort claims had passed \r\n  and because depositions would have to be retaken if the amendment is \r\n  allowed.  However, given the facts of the case, i.e. the events giving \r\n  rise to the claims, are not different from the facts that gave rise to the Â§ \r\n  1983 claim, depositions would not have to be retaken.  Therefore, the Cityâ€™s \r\n  argument of prejudice on this point is without merit.\r\nThe Cityâ€™s argument the amendment prejudices it because the statute \r\n  of limitations has passed is likewise without merit.  Rule 15(c), SCRCP, states:  \r\n  â€œ[w]henever the claim . . . asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the \r\n  conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in \r\n  the original pleadings, the amendment relates back to the date of the original \r\n  pleading.â€  Respondentâ€™s tort claims arose out of the conduct previously set \r\n  forth in the original complaint.  The factual circumstances of the tort claims \r\n  of trespass and conversion have already been set out in the original complaint \r\n  asserting a Â§ 1983 claim.  No new information is required to assert those tort \r\n  claims.  Therefore, under Rule 15(c), the amendment relates back to the date \r\n  of the original pleading that was filed within the statute of limitations.  \r\n  See also Thomas v. Grayson, 318 S.C. 82, 456 S.E.2d 377 (1995) \r\n  (purpose of Rule 15(c) is to salvage causes of action otherwise barred by statute \r\n  of limitations).\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals properly found the trial court \r\n  erred by not allowing the amendment of the tort claims.\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by reversing the trial courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  the Cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe City argues the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  granting summary judgment to the City on respondentâ€™s Â§ 1983 action.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \r\n  law.  Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, \r\n  575 S.E.2d 549 (2003).  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist \r\n  for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that can \r\n  be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.  Id.\r\nSection 1983 allows a civil action to recover damages for deprivation of a \r\n  constitutionally protected right.  In any Â§ 1983 action, â€œa plaintiff is required \r\n  to plead three elements:  (1) an official policy or custom (2) that causes the \r\n  plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right.â€  Moore \r\n  v. City of Columbia, 284 S.C. 278, 326 S.E.2d 157 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nRespondent claims the Cityâ€™s policy or custom \r\n  [6]  is to oppress and financially hobble her by charging fines without \r\n  a lawful citation, by destroying her animals without time restrictions, and \r\n  by entering her enclosed backyard without a warrant.  Considering the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to her, the factual inferences that can be made \r\n  from the evidence do not rise to the level of a policy \r\n  [7]  or custom set for the purpose of oppressing and financially hobbling \r\n  her.\r\nThe evidence shows that, according to respondent, her dogs may have been removed \r\n  from inside her fence and she may have not been told she had only five days \r\n  in which to identify or redeem the dogs.  The evidence further reveals respondent \r\n  was improperly informed she would have to pay a fine to redeem the dogs.  However, \r\n  none of these facts presented by respondent show there was a deliberate choice \r\n  to harm her or that the City was deliberately indifferent to the alleged \r\n  constitutional violations by Kirkpatrick and the shelter.  See Pembaur \r\n  v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986) (municipal liability under Â§ \r\n  1983 attaches where deliberate choice to follow course of action is made from \r\n  among various alternatives by official responsible for establishing final policy \r\n  with respect to subject matter in question); Moore v. City of Columbia, \r\n  supra (municipality may be subjected to liability due to its de facto \r\n  policies as well as its de jure policies; de facto policies may be established \r\n  by omissions of municipality or supervisory officials where their unreasonable \r\n  failure to make rules causes employees to engage in unconstitutional conduct; \r\n  such omissions are actionable, however, only if constitute â€œtacit authorizationâ€ \r\n  of or â€œdeliberate indifferenceâ€ to constitutional violations).  Respondent has \r\n  not presented any evidence to show there is a custom that is so widespread as \r\n  to have the force of law.  See Board of the County Commissioners of \r\n  Bryan County, Oklahoma v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397 (1997) (locating â€œpolicyâ€ \r\n  ensures municipality is held liable only for deprivations resulting from decisions \r\n  of its legislative body or of those officials whose acts may be said to be those \r\n  of municipality; similarly, act performed pursuant to â€œcustomâ€ that has not \r\n  been formally approved by appropriate decisionmaker may fairly subject municipality \r\n  to liability on theory that relevant practice is so widespread as to have force \r\n  of law).\r\nFurther, respondent has not demonstrated that the City, through deliberate \r\n  conduct, was the â€œmoving forceâ€ behind Kirkpatrickâ€™s alleged seizure of the \r\n  dogs and the shelterâ€™s alleged wrongful destruction of the dogs.  See Board \r\n  of County Commissioners, supra (plaintiff must also demonstrate that, \r\n  through its deliberate conduct, municipality was â€œmoving forceâ€ behind injury \r\n  alleged).  There is no evidence that would support an inference City either \r\n  knew or should have known of the events involved in this case or that the acts \r\n  complained of were part of a pattern of similar acts.\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order granting the Cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the decision finding the trial court erred by denying respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend the complaint and reverse the decision finding the trial court \r\n  erred by granting the summary judgment motion.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] 42 \r\n    U.S.C. Â§ 1983 provides, in part:\r\n  \r\n  Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, \r\n    regulation, custom, or usage, of any State  . . ., subjects, or causes to \r\n    be subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of \r\n    any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, \r\n    shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, \r\n    or other proper proceeding for redress. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Respondent \r\n    further testified that, at a prior court hearing on her citations, Kirkpatrick \r\n    told her, â€œIâ€™ll find your dogs.â€  Kirkpatrick denied the conversation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] This \r\n    fee included a $76 fine for the puppy being at-large, a $20 impound fee, $28 \r\n    for spaying, and $5 for a future rabies vaccination.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Section \r\n    9-5027(a) of the Columbia City Code states, â€œ[I]mpounded animals not redeemed \r\n    within five (5) days may thereafter be humanely destroyed by the animal control \r\n    division.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]\r\n   S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. 2002) provides:  â€œ. . . any action brought pursuant \r\n    to [the Tort Claims Act] is forever barred unless an action is commenced within \r\n    two years after the date the loss was or should have been discovered . . .â€ \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] The City argues the Court of Appeals \r\n    erred by holding the identity of the policymaker was a factual issue.  To \r\n    the extent the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision can be read to conclude the identity \r\n    of the policymaker is a factual issue, we find this holding incorrect.  See \r\n    Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U.S. 701 (1989) (as with \r\n    other questions of state law relevant to application of federal law, identification \r\n    of officials whose decisions represent official policy of local governmental \r\n    unit is itself legal question to be resolved by trial judge before case is \r\n    submitted to jury).  In the present case, the City has elected to adopt the \r\n    council/manager form of government.  In this form of government, all legislative \r\n    powers of the municipality and the determination of all matters of policy \r\n    shall be vested in the municipal council, with each member, including the \r\n    mayor, to have one vote.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-13-30 (1977).  Therefore, the \r\n    shelter and those employed by the shelter do not have the authority to set \r\n    city policy, nor can their acts be said to represent official policy in view \r\n    of the legislative authority granted to the municipal council.  See \r\n    Todd v. Smith, 305 S.C. 227, 407 S.E.2d 644 (1991), cert. denied, \r\n    502 U.S. 1059 (1992).  Therefore, the policymaker is the city council.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] The Cityâ€™s written policy \r\n    regarding animal control is contained in Ordinances Â§Â§ 9-5021 - 9-5037.  These \r\n    ordinances provide that owners who allow their dogs to run at-large do not \r\n    have property rights in the dogs and are guilty of a misdemeanor.  Further, \r\n    the keeping of three or more dogs is prohibited without first obtaining an \r\n    inspection certificate.  Any pet found within the city limits in violation \r\n    of the ordinances may be caught and impounded by city authorities and those \r\n    impounded animals that are not redeemed within five days may thereafter be \r\n    destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25770","title":"Samuels v.

Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25770\r\nSubmitted December 4, 2003 - Filed January \r\n  12, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nTara Dawn Shurling, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. \r\n  McIntosh, Chief, Capital and Collateral Litigation Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant \r\n  Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General \r\n  David Spencer, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted certiorari to determine \r\n  whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by finding the trial court \r\n  did not lack subject matter jurisdiction to convict petitioner and by finding \r\n  appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to appeal the denial of petitionerâ€™s \r\n  directed verdict motion at trial.  We affirm.\r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nWas there subject matter jurisdiction to convict petitioner?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner was convicted of entering a bank with the intent to steal and was \r\n  sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed his \r\n  conviction.  State v. Samuels, Op. No. 99-UP-205 (S.C. Ct. App. filed \r\n  March 24, 1999).  His PCR application was denied.\r\nThe indictment for entering a bank with intent to steal reads:\r\n\r\nThat JOSEPH A. SAMUELS did in Richland County on or about May 15, \r\n  1996, unlawfully enter a bank, depository, or building and loan association \r\n  to wit:  Richland Teacherâ€™s Credit Union, \r\n  [1]  with intent to steal money or securities for money, either by force, \r\n  intimidation or threats.\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on this \r\n  charge because a credit union is not covered by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-380 (2003).\r\nSection 16-11-380 provides:  â€œIt is unlawful for a person to enter \r\n  a building or part of a building occupied as a bank, depository, or building \r\n  and loan association with intent to steal money or securities for money, either \r\n  by force, intimidation, or threats.â€\r\nWhile a credit union is not a bank or a building and loan association, [2]  a credit union is a financial institution [3]  and is, in the language of Â§ \r\n  16-11-380, a depository.  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 \r\n  S.C. 433, 567 S.E.2d 240 (2002) (all rules of statutory construction are subservient \r\n  to one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in language used, and that language must be construed in light of statuteâ€™s \r\n  intended purpose).  \r\nThe South Carolina Credit Union Act is located under Title 34, which \r\n  is entitled â€œBanking, Financial Institutions and Money.â€  A credit union is \r\n  defined as \r\n\r\na cooperative, nonprofit corporation, incorporated . . . for the purposes of \r\n  encouraging thrift among its members, creating a source of credit at fair and \r\n  reasonable rates of interest, and providing an opportunity for its members to \r\n  use and control their own money on a democratic basis in order to improve their \r\n  economic and social condition.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-26-110(5) (Supp. 2002).\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-26-720 (Supp. 2002) provides â€œ[a] credit union \r\n  may accept deposits from members, other credit unions, and governmental units \r\n  subject to the terms, rates, and conditions established by the board of directors \r\n  [of the credit union.]â€  Further, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-26-730 (1) (Supp. 2002) \r\n  provides that â€œdeposit accounts [4]  may be withdrawn for payment \r\n  to the account holder or to third parties . . .â€  Accordingly, a credit union \r\n  is a depository.\r\nTherefore, the PCR court properly denied petitionerâ€™s claim the trial \r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict petitioner of entering a \r\n  depository with the intent to steal.\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nWas appellate counsel ineffective for failing to appeal the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of petitionerâ€™s directed verdict motion?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAt trial, petitioner moved for a directed verdict on the basis there was no \r\n  evidence the credit union was a bank, depository, or building and loan association \r\n  within the meaning of the statute.  The trial court denied the motion because \r\n  there was evidence the credit union was a depository. \r\n  [5]   Appellate counsel did not raise this issue on appeal.         \r\nBecause a credit union is a depository as a matter of law, appellate \r\n  counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the directed verdict issue \r\n  on appeal.  See Thrift v. State, 302 S.C. 535, 397 S.E.2d 523 \r\n  (1990) (appellate counsel must provide effective assistance but need not raise \r\n  every nonfrivolous issue presented by the record).  Cf. Simpkins v. \r\n  State, 303 S.C. 364, 401 S.E.2d 142 (1991) (appellate counsel ineffective \r\n  in failing to raise issue, preserved below, which would have entitled defendant \r\n  to reversal on appeal).  Therefore, the decision of the PCR court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Before \r\n    trial, the indictment was amended to reflect the proper name of the credit \r\n    union:  Richland Teachers Council Federal Credit Union.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] See, \r\n    e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-3-10 (1987) (no person shall use word â€œbankâ€ \r\n    or â€œbankingâ€ in connection with any business other than legalized incorporated \r\n    banking institution); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-5-10 (1987) (bank includes building \r\n    and loan association); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-26-110(5) (Supp. 2002) (definition \r\n    of credit union).\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-1-20 (Supp. \r\n    2002) (two members of State Board of Financial Institutions must be engaged \r\n    in cooperative credit union business and recommended by State Cooperative \r\n    Credit Union League); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-150(16) (1985) (under Uniform \r\n    Gifts to Minors Act, credit union included in definition of financial institution); \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-6-101 (1987) (under Nonprobate Transfers article, credit \r\n    union is financial institution).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] â€œâ€˜Deposit \r\n    accountâ€™ means a balance held by a credit union and established by a member, \r\n    another credit union, or a governmental unit in accordance with standards \r\n    specified by the credit union including balances designated as deposits, deposit \r\n    certificates, checking accounts, or other names.  . . .  A deposit account \r\n    is a debt owed by the credit union to the credit holder.â€  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 34-26-110(6) (Supp. 2002). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] A credit union employee testified \r\n    the credit union acted like a bank by engaging in the business of deposits, \r\n    withdrawals, and loans. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Rules of Professional Conduct","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-01-07-01","description":"This administrative order states that lawyers who assist, on a volunteer basis, in the prosecution of criminal domestic violence cases, is not prohibited from representing clients in civil matters and criminal matters unrelated to any case the lawyer has prosecuted.

Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  \r\n  We granted certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals holding \r\n  that the circuit court properly denied petitionerâ€™s motion for a directed verdict \r\n  on the charge of misprision of felony.  State v. Smith, 348 S.C. 601, \r\n  560 S.E.2d 430 (Ct. App. 2002).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nThe proprietor of a small rural grocery \r\n  store was found dead in the store at about 2:30 p.m.  The cash register and \r\n  the victimâ€™s purse were missing.  The victimâ€™s pastor had been at the store \r\n  that afternoon from about 1:45 p.m. to 2:15 p.m.  He testified that petitionerâ€™s \r\n  husband purchased several food items.  When the pastor left the store, he observed \r\n  petitioner and her husband eating in their car in the parking lot.  Another \r\n  customer, who had arrived as the pastor was leaving, testified that petitioner \r\n  and her husband, whom the customer recognized, were sitting in their car and \r\n  eating while she was at the store.\r\nEarly the next morning, petitioner \r\n  and her husband went to the victimâ€™s daughterâ€™s home, ostensibly to pay their \r\n  respects.  During this visit, petitioner attempted to mislead the daughter into \r\n  believing that petitioner and her husband had been at the store hours, rather \r\n  than minutes, before the murder and armed robbery occurred.  The daughter was \r\n  suspicious, and called the pastor.  When he arrived at the daughterâ€™s home, \r\n  he recognized the couple and discreetly telephoned the police.  The pastor then \r\n  told the couple the police wished to speak to the â€˜witnessesâ€™ at the store, \r\n  and the three left the daughterâ€™s home.\r\nAfter speaking briefly with officers \r\n  at the store, petitioner and her husband agreed to be interviewed at the police \r\n  substation.  They were interviewed separately, and it is petitionerâ€™s statements \r\n  during this initial interview that gave rise to the misprision charge that she \r\n  intentionally misled the police.  Petitioner told the police that she and her \r\n  husband stopped at the store to get a few food items, that he went in and bought \r\n  groceries, returned to the car, then reentered the store and got some cigarettes.  \r\n  Petitioner told the police that she and her husband then drove away from the \r\n  store.  \r\nThat evening, following the interviews, \r\n  officers executed a search warrant at the coupleâ€™s home.  Petitioner returned \r\n  to the sheriffâ€™s department with the officers and gave a statement after being \r\n  read her Miranda rights.  In this second statement, petitioner maintained \r\n  that she and the husband stopped at the store to get food.  Her husband purchased \r\n  the food, and when he returned to the car they sat there briefly before her \r\n  husband reentered the store to get cigarettes.  While petitionerâ€™s husband was \r\n  in the store, petitioner heard a â€œpowâ€ and looked towards the store.  Petitioner \r\n  observed her husband coming out of the front door carrying the cash register \r\n  and â€œan object with a long strap.â€ [1]   Her husband placed the items in the back of \r\n  the car; they sat in the parking lot and ate some food, then drove home.\r\nISSUE \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n    Whether the Court of Appeals \r\n      erred in holding that the trial court properly denied petitionerâ€™s directed \r\n      verdict motion?\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS \r\n\r\nPetitioner \r\n  contends she was entitled to a directed verdict on the misprision charge.  We \r\n  agree.  Misprision is:\r\n \r\n  [A] criminal neglect either to \r\n    prevent a felony from being committed or to bring the offender to justice \r\n    after its commission, but without such previous concert with, or subsequent \r\n    assistance of, him as will make the concealer an accessory before or after \r\n    the fact.\r\n    State v. Carson, 274 \r\n    S.C. 316, 262 S.E.2d 918 (1980).\r\n  \r\nAs this Court acknowledged in State \r\n  v. Carson, there are situations where the defendantâ€™s 5th amendment \r\n  privilege against self-incrimination will bar a misprision prosecution.  The \r\n  privilege acts as a bar where the information concealed would incriminate the \r\n  defendant as an accessory or principal in the underlying felony.  Id.\r\nThe State contends that because petitioner \r\n  did not invoke her 5th amendment â€œright to remain silentâ€ when first \r\n  questioned by police but instead chose to tell officers only part of \r\n  the story, she waived any privilege.  The State misunderstands the relationship \r\n  between the privilege against self-incrimination and the right of the State \r\n  to prosecute an individual for misprision.  The issue is not whether the Constitutional \r\n  privilege was explicitly invoked, but rather whether the individual sought to \r\n  be charged had a reasonable belief at the time the concealment occurred that \r\n  revealing the information could lead to her criminal prosecution.  Where the \r\n  information concealed exculpates the individual questioned, the 5th \r\n  amendment privilege does not bar a misprision charge.  State v. Carson, \r\n  supra.  Where, however, the speaker reasonably believes \r\n  [2]  that the information concealed could be used against her in a criminal \r\n  prosecution as an accessory or principal in the underlying felony, then the \r\n  privilege bars a misprision prosecution.  Id.\r\nWe find the \r\n  evidence here is susceptible of the inference that petitioner and her husband \r\n  sat in the parking lot, waiting for the â€œcoast to clear,â€ before he entered \r\n  the store intent on committing an armed robbery.  Inferentially, petitioner \r\n  acted as lookout and getaway car driver.  In fact, an investigator testified \r\n  at trial that he believed that petitioner participated in the crimes with â€˜knowledge \r\n  aforethought.â€™\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that petitioner \r\n  could not reasonably have feared prosecution as an accessory after the fact \r\n  because she was present at the scene.  As a brief review of the state of the \r\n  law on accessory after the fact will show, no lawyer would have been unreasonable \r\n  in advising petitioner she could face this charge, nor was it unreasonable for \r\n  petitioner, a layperson, to fear that her acts after the murder and armed robbery \r\n  could result in her criminal prosecution.  See State v. Collins, \r\n  329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998) (from 1981 until 1998 only, â€œmere presenceâ€ \r\n  at the scene precluded prosecution as an accessory after the fact).  The reasonableness \r\n  of petitionerâ€™s belief in the possibility of an accessory charge is amply demonstrated \r\n  by the fact she was indicted and tried for that offense in this proceeding.  \r\n  Petitioner was granted a directed verdict on this charge, however, because the \r\n  murder and armed robbery occurred before State v. Collins was decided, \r\n  and the trial judge held that petitionerâ€™s presence at the scene precluded an \r\n  accessory conviction.\r\nThe Court of Appeals, without explanation, \r\n  held petitioner had no reasonable belief that she could be charged as a principal.  \r\n  We disagree.  As noted above, the record supports an inference that petitioner \r\n  may have acted as lookout and getaway driver.  Accordingly, petitioner \r\n  had a reasonable belief that full disclosure of the facts surrounding the crimes \r\n  could have exposed her to prosecution as a principal.  See State v. \r\n  Gates, 269 S.C. 557, 238 S.E.2d 680 (1977) (getaway driver guilty as principal \r\n  in armed robbery).\r\nPetitionerâ€™s belief that revealing \r\n  all she knew about the crimes could expose her to prosecution as an accessory \r\n  after the fact or as a principal in the murder and armed robbery of the grocery \r\n  store proprietor was reasonable.  She was therefore entitled to a directed verdict \r\n  on the misprision charge because her concealment of inculpating information \r\n  was protected by her privilege against self-incrimination.  State v. Carson, \r\n  supra.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nPetitioner was entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict.  The decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., \r\n  concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion\r\nChief Justice Toal: I respectfully \r\n  dissent, as I find that neither of the two exceptions to the misprision of a \r\n  felony statute, which are grounded in the Fifth Amendment protection against \r\n  self-incrimination, applies in this case.  Therefore, I would affirm the Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ decision to uphold petitionerâ€™s conviction of misprision of a felony.\r\nWhen reviewing the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State.  State v. Mahoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  30 (2001).  \r\nThis Court has described the offense \r\n  of misprision of a felony as the criminal neglect to either prevent the commission \r\n  of a felony or to bring a felon to justice.  A person commits misprision of \r\n  a felony only if he makes some positive act of concealment.  Therefore, the \r\n  offense does not contemplate mere silence or a failure to come forward.  A person \r\n  cannot be convicted of misprision of a felony if his act of concealment makes \r\n  him an accessory before or after the fact.  State v. Carson, 274 S.C. \r\n  316, 318, 262 S.E.2d 918, 920 (1980) (citation omitted).  \r\nThis \r\n  Court explained how the privilege against self-incrimination protects the concealer \r\n  from being convicted of misprision of a felony:\r\n\r\n  [w]hile it is true the privilege \r\n    sometimes works to bar prosecution for misprision, this is only when \r\n    the statements concealed would incriminate the defendant as an accessory or \r\n    principal in the protected felony.\r\n\r\nCarson, \r\n  274 S.C. at 319, 262 S.E.2d at 920 (emphasis added).  Therefore, in order for \r\n  this Court to find that the Fifth Amendment protects petitionerâ€™s statements \r\n  to the SLED agent, we also must conclude that one of the exceptions applies: \r\n  petitioner must either have been an accessory after the fact or the principal \r\n  actor of the offense. \r\nThe trial judge correctly ruled that \r\n  petitioner could not be convicted of accessory after the fact because on the \r\n  date of her offense, December 30, 1996, South Carolina law required that a person \r\n  could only be convicted of accessory after the fact if she was absent from the \r\n  crime scene.  See State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998). \r\n  [3]   \r\nIn her statement made to a SLED agent, \r\n  petitioner admitted she heard a gunshot inside the store and saw her husband \r\n  get into the car with a cash register and â€œan object with a long strap.â€   This \r\n  statement implicates only petitionerâ€™s husband as the principal actor of the \r\n  crime.  \r\nTherefore, in my opinion, the Fifth \r\n  Amendment privilege does not protect petitionerâ€™s statement to the SLED agent \r\n  because she could not have been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact or \r\n  a principal actor in the crime.\r\nIn my view, the majority inappropriately \r\n  injects a subjective test into the misprision-Fifth Amendment analysis.  The \r\n  majority holds that the Fifth Amendment protects the concealer if â€œthe individual \r\n  sought to be charged had a reasonable belief at the time the concealment occurred \r\n  that revealing the information could lead to her criminal prosecution.â€  The \r\n  majority bases this subjective analysis on Kastigar v. United States, \r\n  406 U.S. 441, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972), where a witness affirmatively \r\n  invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  \r\nIn \r\n  the case at hand, petitioner never invoked her Fifth Amendment right; rather, \r\n  she affirmatively concealed information from the investigator.  She elected \r\n  to speak to the investigator, and from the moment she elected to speak to the \r\n  investigator, she no longer was afforded Fifth Amendment protection unless \r\n  she was an accessory after the fact or the principal actor of the crime.  \r\n  [4]   As the United States Supreme Court has duly noted, there is no constitutional \r\n  right to lie.  United States v. Apfelbaum, 445 U.S. 115, 117, 100 S. \r\n  Ct. 948, 950, 63 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1980) (â€œproper invocation of the Fifth Amendment \r\n  privilege against compulsory self-incrimination allows a witness to remain silent, \r\n  but not to swear falselyâ€).\r\nIn my opinion, this Court cannot \r\n  employ a subjective test that essentially condones a suspect lying to the police \r\n  if she â€œreasonably believesâ€ that if she told the truth, she might be subjected \r\n  to criminal prosecution.  This test extends well beyond our Carson test \r\n  for misprision of a felony and is inconsistent with the analysis we employ for \r\n  inculpatory statements. [5]   \r\n  \r\nIn my view, the majorityâ€™s decision \r\n  inappropriately cloaks the Carson analysis with a new subjective test \r\n  that exceeds the boundaries of our jurisprudence in this area of the law.  In \r\n  effect, the majority opinion encourages a suspect to lie to the police, thoroughly \r\n  impeding a police investigation, and then hide behind a subjective â€œreasonablenessâ€ \r\n  standard.    \r\nBased on the reasoning above, especially \r\n  considering that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State, I would hold that petitionerâ€™s attempt to conceal her husbandâ€™s involvement \r\n  in the robbery and murder of the convenience store clerk is not protected by \r\n  the Fifth Amendment according to our Carson test.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Inferentially this was the victimâ€™s handbag.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  This standard is taken from the test used where \r\n    a witness actively invokes his privilege against self-incrimination.  See \r\n    Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. \r\n    2d 212 (1972). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  From 1981 until the date of the Collins opinion, January 5, \r\n    1998, a defendant could not be prosecuted for accessory after the fact if \r\n    she was present at the crime scene.  The Court refused to retroactively apply \r\n    the new rule that an actorâ€™s presence at the crime scene did not preclude \r\n    an accessory after the fact conviction to crimes committed during this seventeen-year \r\n    period.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  I respectfully disagree with the manner in which \r\n    the majority stretches its new, subjective test, in conjunction with its presumptuous \r\n    inference that petitioner may have been a principal actor of the crime, to \r\n    conclude that petitioner is not guilty of misprision of a felony.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  For example, we employ an objective analysis in determining whether \r\n    the suspect is in police custody when she elects to give an inculpatory statement.  \r\n    Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 \r\n    (1966); see Bradley v. State, 316 S.C. 255, 257, 449 S.E.2d 492, 493-494 \r\n    (1994) (the custodial determination is an objective analysis based on whether \r\n    a reasonable person would have concluded that he was in police custody). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25772","title":"Main Corporation v.

Arnold, of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: We granted \r\n  certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals properly dismissed an appeal \r\n  from a binding arbitration order.  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nPetitioners brought suit against \r\n  respondents to determine title to a strip of land located behind petitionersâ€™ \r\n  property.  The parties consented to an order issued by the trial judge referring \r\n  the case to binding arbitration.  In the order, the trial judge stated, among \r\n  other things, that the parties consented to â€œany appeal of the arbitratorâ€™s \r\n  finding to be directed to the South Carolina Court of Appeals, pursuant to the \r\n  South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.â€ [1]   The arbitrator issued an award, and petitioners filed a motion \r\n  to amend the arbitration award with the arbitrator, and the arbitrator denied \r\n  the motion.  No motion was filed with the circuit court.  \r\nPetitioners filed a notice of appeal \r\n  of the arbitratorâ€™s ruling with the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  issued an order dismissing the appeal ex mero motu stating \r\n  that â€œS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-200 (Supp. 2001) governs the appealability of orders \r\n  respecting arbitration and specifically enumerates the orders which may be appealedâ€¦The \r\n  statute governing arbitration does not provide for an appeal to this court directly \r\n  from the award of the arbitrator.â€  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal \r\n  without prejudice.  \r\nISSUE \r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in dismissing \r\n  an appeal of an arbitratorâ€™s order on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction?\r\nANALYSIS \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals did not err \r\n  in dismissing the appeal of the arbitratorâ€™s order, as there was no court order \r\n  that can be the subject of an appeal.   In the case at hand, the parties consented \r\n  to arbitration, and the trial judge ordered the case to be sent to an arbitrator. \r\n  At that point, the circuit court was divested of jurisdiction over the case.  \r\n  See Mills v. William Clarke Jeep Eagle, Inc., 321 S.C. 150, 152, \r\n  467 S.E.2d 268, 269 (Ct. App. 1996)(Once a party files a motion to confirm an \r\n  arbitration award with the circuit court, the circuit court resumes jurisdiction \r\n  of the case)(emphasis supplied).  \r\nUnder the Uniform Arbitration Act, \r\n  a party may move the circuit court to confirm an award, [2]  vacate an award, [3]  or modify or correct an award. [4]   Neither the petitioners nor the respondents have moved before \r\n  the circuit court pursuant to any of these statutory provisions.  Therefore, \r\n  the circuit court has not resumed jurisdiction over the case. Mills, \r\n  467 S.E.2d at 269. In essence, the case has not reentered the judicial system \r\n  until the parties choose to have the award ruled upon in some way by the circuit \r\n  court.  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-180 \r\n  (Supp. 2002) states that making an agreement providing for arbitration in South \r\n  Carolina confers jurisdiction on the court to â€œenforce the agreement under this \r\n  chapter and to enter judgment on an award thereunder.â€  The only appeals that \r\n  may be taken under the Uniform Arbitration Act are from orders issued by the \r\n  circuit court pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-200 (Supp. 2002).  If the circuit \r\n  court has not resumed jurisdiction and issued one of the orders enumerated in \r\n  Section 15-48-200, there is no court order that can be the subject of an appeal.  \r\n  Since the circuit court did not resume jurisdiction over the case, the Court \r\n  of Appeals cannot have jurisdiction over the case. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 \r\n  (a) (Supp. 2002) (The Court of Appeals â€œshall have jurisdiction over any case \r\n  in which an appeal is taken from an order, judgment, or decree of the \r\n  circuit or family courtâ€) (emphasis supplied).  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge stated in his Consent \r\n  Order to Arbitrate that any appeal of the arbitratorâ€™s findings be directed \r\n  to the South Carolina Court of Appeals.  Petitioners followed these directions, \r\n  and filed the appeal with the South Carolina Court of Appeals, even though jurisdiction \r\n  was not resumed by the circuit court.   We affirm the dismissal of the appeal \r\n  by the Court of Appeals. However, due to the exceptional circumstances in this \r\n  case, we dismiss the case without prejudice to any partyâ€™s right to take any \r\n  action allowed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-48-120, et. seq. (Supp. 2002). The timing \r\n  deadlines required under Sections 15-48-120, et. seq. were tolled during the \r\n  period of this appeal.  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The trial judge did not state which Appellate \r\n    Rule provides for such an appeal.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  S.C.

City built a system serving the central commercial district, using \r\n  mostly state and federal grant monies. The system collects untreated wastewater \r\n  and pumps it across the Folly River to an interconnection with the James Island \r\n  Public Service District. The wastewater is then transported to the Charleston \r\n  Commission for Public Works treatment and disposal.\r\n In 1984, City adopted Ordinance \r\n  No. 84-13, which governs the operation and extension of the sewer system. User \r\n  charges fund the operation and maintenance of the system. Extensions must be \r\n  funded and constructed by the person requesting them. Detailed plans of proposed \r\n  extensions prepared by a registered engineer must be submitted to City for approval. \r\n  \r\n In February 2000, City enacted Ordinance \r\n  No. 29-99, which stated &quot;[t]here shall be no expansion of the sewer system \r\n  beyond the commercial, C-1 and C-2, districts within the corporate boundaries \r\n  of the City of Folly Beach . . . without an affirmative vote of the Folly Beach \r\n  City Council.&quot; In July 2000, City enacted Ordinance No. 14-00, which stated \r\n  &quot;sewer service shall not be extended outside of the existing C-1 and C-2 \r\n  Districts to serve any additional buildings or residential units except residential \r\n  units adjacent to the existing taps on the original gravity sewer line at the \r\n  time of this ordinance.&quot; The ordinance preamble notes the original grants \r\n  were to provide sewer service to the central commercial district; that it is \r\n  not possible to foresee increased demands within that district; that City depends \r\n  on two other entities to transport and treat the waste; and that City &quot;is \r\n  facing significant capital and overhead increases just to service the existing \r\n  sewer.&quot;1 \r\n In September 2001, Developer acquired \r\n  about seven acres of land located within City's limits. Developer bought the \r\n  property from the O'Rourks, who had tried but failed to obtain sewer service \r\n  from City. Developer has paid city taxes on the property. Developer proposes \r\n  to build eight residential duplexes on the property, but needs sewer service \r\n  to do so. Without sewer service, Developer may be limited to building fewer \r\n  duplexes with septic tanks.\r\n Developer's property is located \r\n  at the far western end of the island. The extension would require some 4,000 \r\n  feet of new pipeline - equal to the amount already in place to serve the central \r\n  commercial district. The extension would serve few residences and likely would \r\n  require boring through sensitive marshlands. It would require one or more additional \r\n  pumping stations and additional staff, maintenance, and operating expenses, \r\n  City asserts. The residents of Folly Beach neither need nor desire an island-wide \r\n  sewer system &quot;for a myriad of ecological and financial reasons,&quot; City \r\n  contends. \r\n Developer's property is zoned C-3 \r\n  (marine commercial). Developer asserts the system has been extended at least \r\n  ten times over the years to serve various commercial and residential properties, \r\n  including at least one property zoned C-3 that is not located within the central \r\n  commercial district. City concedes the system has been expanded, but asserts \r\n  the system still is largely confined to the core commercial district as originally \r\n  planned. Expansion of the system apparently has been a controversial issue among \r\n  residents since it was built, with the majority of residents and council members \r\n  choosing to limit expansion and the development likely to follow.\r\n In March 2002, Developer's attorney \r\n  wrote City, asking it &quot;to acknowledge that it will accept the extension \r\n  of sanitary sewer facilities&quot; to Developer's property, with Developer funding \r\n  the cost of the extension. City responded by letter, saying it &quot;cannot \r\n  extend the system or accept any extension under the existing ordinance,&quot; \r\n  but Developer was welcome to request an extension from city council.\r\n In April 2002, Developer brought \r\n  a declaratory judgment action against City, alleging City is required to provide \r\n  sewer service under the state Constitution and statutes and asking the court \r\n  to enjoin enforcement of ordinances limiting expansion of the sewer system outside \r\n  the central commercial district. Developer filed a motion for partial summary \r\n  judgment, seeking a declaration that the ordinances on their face are contrary \r\n  to state law and unconstitutional, and an order enjoining enforcement of the \r\n  ordinances. The City subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, contending \r\n  the ordinances are valid under the state Constitution and statutes.\r\n The circuit court dismissed the \r\n  case without prejudice, ruling Developer's statutory and constitutional challenges \r\n  to the ordinances were not ripe for review under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments \r\n  Act. Developer timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, arguing the issues \r\n  were ripe for review and asking the Court to address them. The circuit court \r\n  denied the Rule 59 motion. This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the circuit \r\n      court err in ruling that Developer's statutory and constitutional challenges \r\n      to the City's ordinance were not ripe for review under the Uniform Declaratory \r\n      Judgments Act?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.\r\n    Does the City have \r\n      the power, pursuant to the state Constitution and statutes, to enact an \r\n      ordinance that on its face limits expansion of the sewer system unless city \r\n      council affirmatively votes to approve an expansion?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    III. \r\n    Does an ordinance \r\n      limiting expansion of the City's sewer system unless city council affirmatively \r\n      votes to approve an expansion violate Developer's constitutional right to \r\n      equal protection under the law?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Does an ordinance \r\n      limiting expansion of City's sewer system unless city council affirmatively \r\n      votes to approve an expansion violate Developer's constitutional right to \r\n      substantive due process of law?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Declaratory \r\n  Judgment Act\r\n City contends Developer was required \r\n  to submit an application, including a detailed construction proposal prepared \r\n  by a registered engineer, and follow the extension process outlined in the ordinance. \r\n  Developer's one letter asking City to acknowledge it would grant an extension \r\n  and City's one letter in response did not constitute an application, City asserts. \r\n  The circuit court declined to rule on the merits of Developer's arguments, and \r\n  agreed with City the case was not ripe for review because Developer had not \r\n  applied for a sewer extension. \r\n Developer argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in ruling its statutory and constitutional challenges to City's ordinance \r\n  were not ripe for review under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15-53-10 to -140 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2002). Developer \r\n  asserts its challenges to the ordinance were ripe for review because the record \r\n  was sufficiently developed and &quot;there would be no point in [Developer] \r\n  exhausting a remedy that does not exist.&quot; We agree.\r\n The Declaratory Judgments Act provides \r\n  that &quot;[c]ourts of record within their respective jurisdictions shall have \r\n  power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further \r\n  relief is or could be claimed.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-53-20 (1976). \r\n  &quot;Any person . . . whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected \r\n  by a statute [or] municipal ordinance . . . may have determined any question \r\n  of construction or validity arising under the . . . statute [or] ordinance . \r\n  . . and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.&quot; \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-53-30 (1976); see also Rule 57, SCRCP.\r\n Despite the Act's broad language, \r\n  it has its limits. An adjudication that would not settle the legal rights of \r\n  the parties would only be advisory in nature and, therefore, would be beyond \r\n  the intended purpose and scope of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Power \r\n  v. McNair, 255 S.C. 150, 154, 177 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1970); City of Columbia \r\n  v. Sanders, 231 S.C. 61, 68, 97 S.E.2d 210, 213 (1957). A declaratory judgment \r\n  should not address moot or abstract matters. Waller v. Waller, 220 S.C. \r\n  212, 223, 66 S.E.2d 876, 882 (1951).\r\n To state a cause of action under \r\n  the Declaratory Judgment Act, a party must demonstrate a justiciable controversy. \r\n  Power v. McNair, 255 S.C. at 154, 177 S.E.2d at 553. &quot;A justiciable \r\n  controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial \r\n  determination, as distinguished from a dispute or difference of a contingent, \r\n  hypothetical or abstract character.&quot; Power v. McNair, 255 S.C. at \r\n  154, 177 S.E.2d at 553; Graham v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., \r\n  319 S.C. 69, 71, 459 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1995) (same); Holden v. Cribb, \r\n  349 S.C. 132, 137, 561 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 2002) (same).\r\n The Declaratory Judgments Act is \r\n  a proper vehicle in which to bring a controversy before the court when there \r\n  is an existing controversy or at least the ripening seeds of a controversy. \r\n  Waller, 220 S.C. at 223, 66 S.E.2d at 882. The basic purpose of the Act \r\n  is to provide for declaratory judgments without awaiting a breach of existing \r\n  rights. The Act should be liberally construed to accomplish its intended purpose \r\n  of affording a speedy and inexpensive method of deciding legal disputes and \r\n  of settling legal rights and relationships, without awaiting a violation of \r\n  the rights or a disturbance of the relationship. Graham, 319 S.C. at \r\n  71, 459 S.E.2d at 845; Power, 255 S.C. at 154, 177 S.E.2d at 553; Waller, \r\n  220 S.C. at 223, 66 S.E.2d at 882; Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, \r\n  351 S.C. 1, 16, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888-89 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n Our courts have found the existence \r\n  of a justiciable controversy, for example, in determining whether a vehicle \r\n  insurance policy should be reformed to include underinsured motorist coverage, \r\n  Graham, supra; in determining whether the consolidation of two municipalities \r\n  resulted in the merger of municipally owned utility systems, City of Columbia, \r\n  supra; in the determination of heirs' contingent or vested interest under \r\n  a will, Waller, supra; in deciding whether the court should issue a writ \r\n  of mandamus directing the sheriff to accept a non-cash bid at a judicial sale, \r\n  Holden, supra; and in a dispute involving homeowners' challenge to amendments \r\n  of their subdivision's restrictive covenants, Pond Place Partners, supra. \r\n  \r\n Furthermore, we agree with Developer \r\n  that a party is not required under the Declaratory Judgments Act to spend time \r\n  and money complying with what allegedly is an invalid or unconstitutional ordinance. \r\n  See Town of Hilton Head Island v. Coalition of Expressway Opponents, \r\n  307 S.C. 449, 455, 415 S.E.2d 801, 805 (1992) (finding a justiciable controversy \r\n  in a pre-election review of a voter-initiated ordinance and reasoning that, \r\n  when an ordinance is alleged to be facially defective, &quot;it is wholly unjustified \r\n  to allow voters to give their time, thought, and deliberation to the question \r\n  of desirability of the legislation as to which they are to cast their ballots, \r\n  and thereafter, if their vote be in the affirmative, confront them with a judicial \r\n  decree that their action was in vain&quot;) (quoting Schultz v. City of Philadelphia, \r\n  122 A.2d 279, 283 (1956)).\r\n A justiciable controversy exists \r\n  in the present case. City has enacted an ordinance limiting the expansion of \r\n  its sewer system. Developer, a city resident, has purchased property within \r\n  the City and wishes to build houses on it. Developer's plans are directly affected \r\n  by the ordinance at issue. Developer has challenged the validity of the ordinance \r\n  on statutory and constitutional grounds. The controversy is real and substantial; \r\n  it is not contingent, abstract, or hypothetical. The validity of the ordinance \r\n  and the parties' rights under it as they presently exist will be resolved by \r\n  our decision.\r\nII: Power to enact \r\n  and validity of challenged ordinance\r\n Developer argues City does not have \r\n  the power to enact an ordinance that on its face limits expansion of the sewer \r\n  system unless city council affirmatively votes to approve the expansion. City \r\n  does not have the discretion to preclude residents of particular areas from \r\n  obtaining a sewer extension because it has a statutory and constitutional duty \r\n  to make such service equally available to all residents if it is available to \r\n  any, Developer argues. We disagree.\r\n &quot;A municipal ordinance is a \r\n  legislative enactment and is presumed to be constitutional.&quot; Whaley \r\n  v. Dorchester County Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 337 S.C. 568, 575, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  404, 408 (1999). The burden of proving the invalidity of an ordinance is on \r\n  the party attacking it. Id. Determining whether an ordinance is valid \r\n  is a two-step process. First, the Court must determine whether a municipality \r\n  has the power to adopt the ordinance. If no power exists, the ordinance is invalid. \r\n  Second, the Court must determine whether the ordinance is consistent with the \r\n  Constitution and general laws of this state. Riverwoods, LLC v. County of \r\n  Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 384, 563 S.E.2d 651, 654 (2002); Bugsy's, Inc. \r\n  v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 87, 93, 530 S.E.2d 890, 893 (2000).\r\n The Constitution provides, in pertinent \r\n  part, that &quot;[a]ny incorporated municipality may, upon a majority \r\n  vote of the electors of such political subdivision who shall vote on the question, \r\n  acquire by initial construction or purchase and may operate gas, water, \r\n  sewer, electric, transportation or other public utility systems and plants.&quot;\r\n  S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16 (emphasis added).\r\n &quot;Each municipality of the State \r\n  . . . may enact regulations, resolutions, and ordinances, not inconsistent \r\n  with the Constitution and general law of this State . . . respecting any subject \r\n  which appears to it necessary and proper for the security, general welfare, \r\n  and convenience of the municipality or for preserving the health, peace, order, \r\n  and good government in it. . . .&quot; S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-30 (Supp. 2002). \r\n  See also Hospitality Ass'n of South Carolina, Inc. v. County of Charleston, \r\n  320 S.C. 219, 464 S.E.2d 113 (1995) (only limit on broad grant of power to municipalities \r\n  in &sect; 5-7-30 is the regulation or ordinance be consistent with the Constitution \r\n  and general laws).\r\n More specifically, &quot;any city \r\n  or town may . . . [c]onstruct, purchase, operate and maintain waterworks \r\n  and electric light works within or without, partially within and partially \r\n  without, their corporate limits for the use and benefit of such city or \r\n  town and the inhabitants thereof. . . .&quot; S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-610 \r\n  (1976) (emphasis added). &quot;Upon the written request of any property owner \r\n  requesting the city or town to extend to him water and sewer service and agreeing \r\n  to pay the cost thereof the city or town may provide such service. . \r\n  . .&quot; S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-1510 (1976) (emphasis added). A municipality \r\n  may impose charges and assessments on users and specified property owners to \r\n  fund the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining a sewer system. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-2010 to -2040 (1976).\r\n No constitutional or statutory provision \r\n  imposes a duty on City to provide sewer service to all residents if it provides \r\n  such service to any. The provisions consistently use the permissive term &quot;may.&quot; \r\n  See Waites v. S.C. Windstorm &amp; Hail Underwriting Ass'n, 279 S.C. \r\n  362, 365, 307 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1983) (agreeing with lower court's ruling that \r\n  legislature used the word &quot;may&quot; in statute as permissive and not mandatory); \r\n  Graham v. Alliance Ins. Co., 192 S.C. 370, 6 S.E.2d 754, 755 (1940) (statute \r\n  providing persons interested in controversy &quot;may&quot; be made defendants \r\n  is permissive and not mandatory).\r\n Moreover, &sect; 5-31-610 specifically \r\n  states that utility services may be provided &quot;partially within&quot; corporate \r\n  limits. The Legislature has recognized that a municipality - for financial or \r\n  other legitimate reasons - may be able to provide sewer service or other utilities \r\n  for only part of its residents. See, e.g., Riverwoods, 349 S.C. at 384, \r\n  563 S.E.2d at 654 (&quot;cardinal rule of statutory construction is for the \r\n  Court to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature&quot;).\r\n The circuit court correctly noted \r\n  any resident must be able to apply for sewer service, as Developer is free to \r\n  do in this case. However, the decision whether to grant a sewer extension request \r\n  generally must be left to the sound discretion of municipal leaders, who are \r\n  charged with considering all the various factors, including financial and economic \r\n  implications, aesthetic and environmental concerns, feasibility of a particular \r\n  plan, and the effect of an extension on the municipality's long-range zoning, \r\n  planning, or organization. See Annot. Right to Compel Municipality \r\n  to Extend Its Water System, 48 A.L.R.2d 1222 (1956) (citing cases in which \r\n  courts have concluded, although a city-owned water system should impartially \r\n  supply all applicants who are similarly situated, it generally has been held \r\n  a municipality has the discretion to decide whether to extend its system to \r\n  an entirely new section within its limits; municipality usually cannot be compelled \r\n  to do so at the instance of a prospective consumer, at least if its basis for \r\n  refusing is in any way reasonable and does not involve any abuse of discretion \r\n  or arbitrary or fraudulent action).\r\n Developer relies primarily on three \r\n  cases in support of its argument, asserting they stand for the proposition that \r\n  a city-owned utility has a duty to make service available to all its residents: \r\n  Childs v. City of Columbia, 87 S.C. 566, 70 S.E. 296 (1911); Looper \r\n  v. City of Easley, 172 S.C. 11, 172 S.E. 705 (1934), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by McCall by Andrews v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985); \r\n  and Sloan v. City of Conway, 347 S.C. 324, 555 S.E.2d 684 (2001).\r\n In Childs, a non-resident \r\n  water customer sought an injunction to prevent the city of Columbia from cutting \r\n  off his water or increasing his rates. In rejecting the customer's contract-based \r\n  arguments and explaining the different status of residents and non-residents, \r\n  the Court stated: &quot;The statute passed in pursuance of the constitutional\r\nprovision2 . . . expressed the limitation of duty to residents of the city implied \r\n  in the Constitution by the provision that the construction and operation of \r\n  municipal waterworks should be 'for the use and benefit of said cities and towns \r\n  and its citizens.'&quot; Childs, 87 S.C. at 570, 70 S.E.2d at 298.\r\n In Looper, the Court rejected \r\n  a non-resident business owner's attempt to hold the city-owned electrical utility \r\n  liable in contract or tort for failing to install equipment designed to prevent \r\n  fires caused by lightning strikes on the power lines. The Court noted that the \r\n  provision of electricity to either residents or non-residents was a governmental \r\n  function, but &quot;the main difference is that the municipal authorities may \r\n  be required to furnish the inhabitants of the municipality, while they may not \r\n  be forced to furnish those living beyond the limits of the municipality.&quot; \r\n  Looper, 172 S.C. at 15, 172 S.E. at 706-707.\r\n In Sloan, the Court rejected \r\n  various challenges to a municipality's decision to charge higher water rates \r\n  to non-residents than residents. Relying on Childs, the Court again noted \r\n  the distinction between residents and non-residents in relations with a city-owned \r\n  utility. \r\n Developer's reliance on Childs, \r\n  Looper, and Sloan is misplaced. None of those cases in any way \r\n  suggests a municipality has a duty to provide a given utility service to everyone \r\n  if it provides it to anyone. At most, Childs can be read to say that \r\n  a municipality owes a duty to its residents to operate a publicly owned utility \r\n  for the use and benefit of the residents. The word &quot;duty&quot; is not mentioned \r\n  in Looper, although the Court noted in passing that a municipality &quot;may&quot; \r\n  be required to provide a given service to residents but not non-residents. Sloan \r\n  simply reiterates that residents and non-residents do not always stand on equal \r\n  footing when dealing with a city-owned utility.\r\n  \r\n  City properly exercised its legislative power to enact the challenged ordinance, \r\n  and the ordinance is not contrary to the cited statutory or constitutional provisions.\r\nIII. Equal protection\r\n Developer contends an ordinance \r\n  limiting expansion of City's sewer system unless city council affirmatively \r\n  votes to approve an expansion violates its constitutional right to equal protection \r\n  under the law. City has treated residents outside the C-1 and C-2 districts \r\n  as &quot;second-tier inhabitants.&quot; The pertinent class includes &quot;all \r\n  of City's inhabitants,&quot; and City's failure to treat all of them alike under \r\n  similar circumstances violates the equal protection clause, Developer argues. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n No person shall be denied the equal \r\n  protection of the laws. S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. To satisfy the equal protection \r\n  clause, a classification must (1) bear a reasonable relation to the legislative \r\n  purpose sought to be achieved, (2) members of the class must be treated alike \r\n  under similar circumstances, and (3) the classification must rest on some rational \r\n  basis. Jenkins v. Meares, 302 S.C. 142, 146-147, 394 S.E.2d 317, 319 \r\n  (1990)). The rational basis standard, not strict scrutiny, is applied in this \r\n  case because the classification at issue does not affect a fundamental right \r\n  and does not draw upon inherently suspect distinctions such as race, religion, \r\n  or alienage. See Fraternal Order of Police v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, \r\n  352 S.C. 420, 433, 574 S.E.2d 717, 723 (2002); Bryant v. Town of Essex, \r\n  564 A.2d 1052, 1056 (Vt. 1989) (provision of sewer service does not implicate \r\n  fundamental right).\r\n A legislative enactment will be \r\n  sustained against constitutional attack if there is any reasonable hypothesis \r\n  to support it. Gary Concrete Products, Inc. v. Riley, 285 S.C. 498, 504, \r\n  331 S.E.2d 335, 338-39 (1985) (citing Thomas v. Spartanburg Ry., Gas &amp; \r\n  Elec. Co., 100 S.C. 478, 85 S.E. 50 (1915)). The Court must give great deference \r\n  to a legislative body's classification decisions because it presumably debated \r\n  and weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the legislation at issue. Furthermore, \r\n  &quot;[t]he classification does not need to completely accomplish the legislative \r\n  purpose with delicate precision in order to survive a constitutional challenge.&quot; \r\n  Foster v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 306 S.C. \r\n  519, 526, 413 S.E.2d 31, 36 (1992).\r\n In this case, City has created two \r\n  classes - one consisting of residents inside the C-1 and C-2 districts and one \r\n  consisting of residents outside those districts. City generally has treated \r\n  residents within each of those classes alike under similar circumstances, although \r\n  City admits it previously has extended sewer service to at least one property \r\n  in a C-3 district.\r\n The legislative purposes sought \r\n  to be achieved by City's classifications are (1) the provision of sewer service \r\n  to residents primarily located within City's central commercial district and \r\n  (2) limiting substantial expansion of sewer service because the majority of \r\n  council members and residents wish to prevent or limit the additional operating \r\n  and maintenance costs, environmental impact, and development likely to follow. \r\n  Thus, the classifications bear a reasonable relation to the legislative purposes \r\n  because they accomplish those purposes.\r\n Furthermore, the classifications \r\n  rest on rational bases - providing sewer service to a limited area due to the \r\n  financial burden of additional operating and maintenance costs for all users, \r\n  aesthetic and environmental concerns, and the effect on City's long-range zoning, \r\n  planning, or organization. The challenged ordinance does not violate Developer's \r\n  right to equal protection under the law.\r\nIV. Substantive \r\n  due process\r\n Developer argues an ordinance limiting \r\n  expansion of City's sewer system unless city council affirmatively votes to \r\n  approve an expansion violates its constitutional right to substantive due process \r\n  under the law. We disagree.\r\n No person shall be deprived of life, \r\n  liberty, or property without due process of law. S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; \r\n  3. In order to prove a denial of substantive due process, a party must show \r\n  that he was arbitrarily and capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest \r\n  rooted in state law. Worsley Companies, Inc. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  339 S.C. 51, 528 S.E.2d 657 (2000). A property owner does not have a protected \r\n  property interest in connecting to a sewer line. Id. As explained in Issue 2, \r\n  the state Constitution and statutes generally grant a municipality the discretion \r\n  to decide whether to extend sewer service to additional residents within its \r\n  corporate boundaries. Cf. Scott v. Greenville County, 716 F.2d 1409, \r\n  1418 (4th Cir. 1983) (finding a property interest was protected by substantive \r\n  due process where a developer was entitled to issuance of a building permit \r\n  upon presentation of application and plans showing a use expressly permitted \r\n  under then-current zoning ordinance).\r\n We recently held that the standard \r\n  for reviewing all substantive due process challenges to state statutes, including \r\n  economic and social welfare legislation, is whether the statute bears a reasonable \r\n  relationship to any legitimate interest of government. R.L. Jordan Co. v. \r\n  Boardman Petroleum, Inc., 338 S.C. 475, 477, 527 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2000). \r\n  &quot;The purpose of the substantive due process clause is to prohibit government \r\n  from engaging in arbitrary or wrongful acts regardless of the fairness of the \r\n  procedures used to implement them.&quot; In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, \r\n  351 S.C. 122, 140, 568 S.E.2d 338, 347 (2002) (internal quotes omitted). We \r\n  apply this same standard in reviewing challenges to a municipal ordinance.\r\n Developer's argument fails for two \r\n  reasons. First, Developer does not have a cognizable property interest in sewer \r\n  service that is rooted in state law. Second, the ordinances at issue in this \r\n  case bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate interest of government. \r\n  City has a legitimate interest in controlling the expansion of its sewer system \r\n  due to the financial burden of additional operating and maintenance costs for \r\n  all users, aesthetic and environmental concerns, and the effect on City's long-range \r\n  zoning, planning, or organization. City has not acted arbitrarily or wrongfully \r\n  in enacting the ordinances. The challenged ordinance does not violate Developer's \r\n  right to substantive due process under the law.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We conclude (1) a justiciable controversy \r\n  exists in the present case, such that review of Developer's challenge to the \r\n  facial validity of the ordinance is appropriate under the Declaratory Judgments \r\n  Act; (2) City properly exercised its legislative power to enact the challenged \r\n  ordinance, and the ordinance is not contrary to statutory or constitutional \r\n  provisions; and (3) the challenged ordinance does not violate Developer's constitutional \r\n  rights to equal protection and substantive due process under the law.\r\n REVERSED.\r\n MOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 In April 2003, City amended the ordinance at issue in this appeal, codified \r\n  at &sect; 52.104 of the city ordinances, to add the phrase &quot;without an \r\n  affirmative vote of the City Council.&quot; City asserts it passed the amendment \r\n  in response to Developer's lawsuit and to state the obvious - that council could \r\n  change the ordinance or allow extensions. Section 52.104 in its present form \r\n  states:\r\n\r\n   The sewer service shall not be \r\n    extended outside of the existing C-1 and C-2 Districts to serve any additional \r\n    buildings or residential units except residential units adjacent to the existing \r\n    taps on the original gravity sewer line at the time of this ordinance without \r\n    an affirmative vote of the City Council.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Developer initially focused \r\n  on the version of the ordinance that does not contain the underlined phrase. \r\n  City responded the 2003 amendment makes the appeal moot. In reply, Developer \r\n  clarified it has challenged all ordinances purporting to limit expansion \r\n  of the sewer system. We agree with Developer that the case is not moot. We focus \r\n  our analysis on the present version of the ordinance contained in this footnote.\r\n  2 The statute and constitutional \r\n  provision under consideration in Childs were the predecessors of S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-610 and S.C.

The State gave notice \r\n  of its intent to seek the death penalty.  After extensive jury voir dire, petitioner \r\n  decided to plead guilty.  He was sentenced to life without parole for thirty \r\n  years on the murder charge, a consecutive sentence of twenty-five years for \r\n  armed robbery, and a consecutive â€œjoint sentenceâ€ of five years for the two \r\n  conspiracy counts.\r\n          In 1997, petitioner commenced \r\n  this post-conviction relief (PCR) action alleging several grounds for relief.  \r\n  The PCR judge found these allegations without merit.  Petitioner then sought \r\n  a writ of certiorari in this Court claiming for the first time that the trial \r\n  court was without subject matter jurisdiction because the indictments charging \r\n  him with criminal conspiracy are insufficient.  \r\nISSUE\r\n \r\n  \r\n    Are the indictments sufficient \r\n      to confer subject matter jurisdiction?  \r\n      \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n\r\nThe indictments \r\n  for criminal conspiracy allege as follows:\r\nCRIMINAL CONSPIRACY\r\n  (16-17-410)\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n       \r\n         \r\n          \r\n            That [petitioner] did \r\n              in Dillon County on or about January 30, 1992, unlawfully and wilfully \r\n              unite, combine, conspire, confederate, agree to commit the offense \r\n              of Armed Robbery.\r\n            Against the peace and \r\n              dignity of the State, and contrary to the statute in such case made \r\n              and provided.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCRIMINAL CONSPIRACY\r\n  (16-17-410)\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n       \r\n         \r\n          \r\n            That [petitioner] did \r\n              in Dillon County on or about January 30, 1992, unlawfully and wilfully \r\n              unite, combine, conspire, confederate, agree to commit the offense \r\n              of Murder.\r\n            Against the peace and \r\n              dignity of the State, and contrary to the statute in such case made \r\n              and provided.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPetitioner first contends these indictments \r\n  are insufficient because they do not allege all the elements of criminal conspiracy.  \r\n  Failure to sufficiently allege all the elements of the offense is a jurisdictional \r\n  defect that cannot be waived.  Hooks v. State, 353 S.C 48, 577 S.E.2d \r\n  211 (2003); see also State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 75 \r\n  (1993) (indictment that does not allege element of offense is insufficient to \r\n  confer jurisdiction).  Accordingly, this contention may be raised for the first \r\n  time in this Court.  State v. Hooks, supra.\r\nConspiracy is a combination between \r\n  two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or a \r\n  lawful object by illegal means.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (Supp. 2002).  The \r\n  body of each indictment simply states that petitioner did â€œunite, combine, conspire, \r\n  confederate, [and] agree to commitâ€ the alleged offense.  Petitioner complains \r\n  this language is insufficient to allege conspiracy because it does not specify \r\n  â€œwith another or others.â€  \r\nBy definition the words â€œcombine,â€ \r\n  â€œunite,â€ â€œconspire,â€ â€œconfederate,â€ and â€œagreeâ€ all imply an action with another.  \r\n  See State v. Joseph, 351 S.C. 551, 571 S.E.2d 280 (2002) (finding \r\n  words of indictment encompassed within meaning of words used in statute charged).  \r\n  Assuming, however, that these words alone do not sufficiently indicate an agreement \r\n  between two or more persons, the titles of the indictments both cite Â§ 16-17-410.  \r\n  As we recently clarified, the title of an indictment may be considered in determining \r\n  the indictmentâ€™s sufficiency as a whole.  State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C. 462, \r\n  578 S.E.2d 717 (2003).  The language in the body of each indictment together \r\n  with the reference to the statute in each title sufficiently alleges all the \r\n  elements of criminal conspiracy.\r\nPetitioner further contends these \r\n  indictments are insufficient because they do not identify the victim and the \r\n  co-conspirator, nor do they specify facts upon which the charges are based.  \r\n  \r\nNot all defects in an indictment \r\n  involve subject matter jurisdiction.  Non-jurisdictional defects apparent on \r\n  the face of the indictment must be timely raised as required by S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-19-90 (2003) [1]  or they \r\n  are waived.  Hooks v. State, supra; State v. Young, 243 \r\n  S.C. 187, 133 S.E.2d 210 (1963).  While the failure to allege certain circumstances \r\n  of the crime may be ground to quash an indictment for insufficient notice, [2]  such a defect does not necessarily implicate \r\n  the courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction which is satisfied so long as the elements \r\n  of the offense are sufficiently stated.    \r\nHere, the alleged defects regarding \r\n  the victimâ€™s name, the co-conspiratorâ€™s identity, and the particular details \r\n  of the conspiracy are defects that are facially apparent and do not involve \r\n  the elements of the offense.  See State v. McGill, 191 S.C. 1, \r\n  3 S.E.2d 257 (1939) (issues concerning the victimâ€™s name in an indictment do \r\n  not involve the courtâ€™s jurisdiction); State v. Hightower, 221 S.C. 91, \r\n  69 S.E.2d 363 (1952) (co-conspirators need not be named); State v. McIntire, \r\n  221 S.C. 504, 71 S.E.2d 410 (1952) (facts detailing a conspiracy are not required).  \r\n  Because these defects are not jurisdictional, petitioner cannot raise them for \r\n  the first time now.\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] This section provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Every objection to any \r\n    indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer \r\n    or on motion to quash such indictment before the jury shall be sworn and not \r\n    afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This section applies whether the \r\n    defendant goes to trial or pleads guilty.  State v. Hooks, supra.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Our discussion of circumstances of the crime includes venue.  A defect \r\n    in venue may be raised by a timely motion to quash.  See, e.g., State \r\n    v. Montgomery, 246 S.C 545, 144 S.E.2d 797 (1965) (lower court erred in \r\n    denying timely motion to quash where indictment did not name illegitimate \r\n    child who was subject of action for nonsupport); State v. McIntire, \r\n    221 S.C. 504, 71 S.E.2d 410 (1952) (motion to quash properly denied where \r\n    indictment sufficiently alleged venue).  Venue does not relate to the courtâ€™s \r\n    subject matter jurisdiction.  State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 415 S.E.2d \r\n    816 (1992).  We note that language in McIntire speaks of the allegation \r\n    of the county where the crime occurred as necessary to â€œlay the jurisdiction \r\n    of the court.â€  This loose reference to â€œjurisdictionâ€ instead of the proper \r\n    term â€œvenueâ€ has mistakenly joined venue with subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    in at least one later case.  See Jones v. State, 333 S.C. 6, \r\n    507 S.E.2d 324 (1998).  McIntire and Jones are overruled to \r\n    the extent they conflict with our discussion of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25776","title":"State Auto Property and Casualty","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25776","description":"The Court established a two-prong test to determine whether an insured is engaged in a \"business pursuit\" as it pertains to an exclusion within a homeowners insurance policy.

Teer of Mitchell, Bouton, Yokel &amp; \r\n  Childs, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C. J.:  Petitioner State Auto Property \r\n  and Casualty Insurance Company (â€œState Autoâ€) asserts that the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred when it held that insured David and Sherry Raynolds (â€œthe Raynoldsâ€), \r\n  were entitled to coverage and a defense for a third partyâ€™s personal injury \r\n  that occurred at the Raynoldsâ€™ home.    State Auto also seeks to overturn the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision awarding the Raynolds attorneyâ€™s fees.   We now reverse \r\n  the Court of Appeals and hold that the Raynolds were not entitled to coverage, \r\n  a defense, or attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThe Raynolds are a couple who breed, rear, and \r\n  sell Akita show dogs in Spartanburg.  David is a retired engineer, and he and \r\n  his wife Sherry operate a retail cosmetic business.  \r\nThe Raynolds have invested \r\n  a considerable amount of time and money in their dogs.  Since 1989, the Raynolds \r\n  have attended between 40 and 70 dog shows per year, and they are members of \r\n  the Akita Club of America.  They have constructed separate, eighty-square-foot \r\n  kennels for each dog.  They converted their garage into a facility for bathing \r\n  and grooming the dogs, purchased a specialized canine treadmill to condition \r\n  the dogs, and acquired a recreational vehicle for transporting themselves, their \r\n  equipment, and their dogs to shows. They deducted many of the costs of raising, \r\n  training, and showing their dogs as â€œSchedule Câ€ business expenses and depreciated \r\n  items such as the R.V., clothing purchased for the shows, and the canine treadmill \r\n  on their tax return. [1]   \r\nThe Raynolds advertise their puppies in various \r\n  newspapers and publications under the name â€œKo-Akita Kennels.â€  The Raynolds \r\n  also have business cards for â€œKo-Akita Kennels,â€ as well as, grossed $5,000 \r\n  to $12,000 a year since they began operation. \r\nThis case arose after one of the Raynoldsâ€™ dogs, \r\n  Emperor, bit Harold Turner (â€œTurnerâ€), a professional dog-handler, at the Raynoldsâ€™ \r\n  home on April 6, 1996.  When Turner sued, State Auto defended the Raynolds under \r\n  a reservation of rights.  During the time it defended the Raynolds, State Auto \r\n  sought a declaratory judgment, seeking to deny the Raynolds coverage and a defense \r\n  based on the â€œbusiness pursuitsâ€ exclusion in the policy.  The exclusion provides:\r\n\r\nMedical Payments to others do not apply to bodily injury or \r\n  property damageâ€¦ (b) arising out of or in connection with a business engaged \r\n  in by an insured.  This exclusion applies but is not limited to an act or omission \r\n  regardless of its nature or circumstance, involving a service or duty rendered, \r\n  promised, owed, or implied to be provided because of the nature of the business.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, the court applied the two-pronged test \r\n  set forth in Faddin v. Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co. to determine whether \r\n  the Raynolds were engaged in a business pursuit. 274 N.Y.S.2d 235 (N.Y. App. \r\n  Div. 1967).  The trial court found the Raynolds were not engaged in a â€œbusiness \r\n  pursuitâ€ and that State Auto was required to defend the Raynolds and provide \r\n  coverage up to the policyâ€™s limits.  In addition, the trial court denied the \r\n  Raynoldsâ€™ claim for attorneyâ€™s fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial \r\n  court as to State Autoâ€™s obligations but reversed on the issue of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.  State Auto v. Raynolds, 350 S.C. 108, 564 S.E.2d 677  (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).\r\nThe following issues are before this Court:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Court of Appeals err in finding that the Raynoldsâ€™ activities \r\n  did not satisfy the â€œbusiness pursuitsâ€ test of Faddin? \r\n   \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Court of Appeals err in awarding the Raynolds attorneyâ€™s fees? \r\n   \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n&nbsp;I.  Business Pursuits Test \r\nSouth Carolina has not developed a test for determining \r\n  whether activities are a â€œbusiness pursuitâ€ and thus fall under a homeowners \r\n  insurance policy exclusion. [2]   \r\n  Courts in other jurisdictions have developed a plethora of tests yielding varied \r\n  results.  In this case, the lower courts applied the two-prong test developed \r\n  in Faddin. 274 N.Y.S.2d at 241.  We now hold that this was the proper \r\n  test to apply.  \r\nUnder the Faddin test, an insurance provider \r\n  can establish that an insuredâ€™s conduct falls within a â€œbusiness pursuitsâ€ exclusion \r\n  if the provider proves two elements:  continuity and profit motive. \r\nA.  Continuity Prong\r\nPetitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in holding that the Raynoldsâ€™ activities did not meet the continuity prong of \r\n  Faddin.  We agree.  \r\nThe court in Faddin defined â€œcontinuityâ€ \r\n  as â€œa customary engagement or a stated occupation.â€ Id.  Faddin \r\n  does little to explain whether a part-time activity could satisfy the continuity \r\n  prong.  However, in a later case, the New York Court of Appeals clarified the \r\n  Faddin test:  â€œfor the purposes of the â€˜business pursuitâ€™ exclusion, \r\n  the â€˜businessâ€™ engaged in by [the insured] need not necessarily be limited to \r\n  his sole occupation or employmentâ€¦.â€  Shapiro v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., \r\n  365 N.Y.S.2d 892 (N.Y. App. Div. 1975), affâ€™d 347 N.E.2d 624 (N.Y. 1976).  \r\n\r\nAlthough courts have defined \r\n  â€œcontinuousâ€ in various ways, a majority of courts have held that a â€œpart-timeâ€ \r\n  activity may constitute a business pursuit for insurance coverage purposes.  \r\n  For example, in Wiley v. Travelers Ins. Co., the plaintiff was bitten \r\n  when he went to the defendantâ€™s house to buy a Saint Bernard puppy. 534 P.2d \r\n  1293 (Okla. 1974).  The Oklahoma Supreme Court held that the defendant was engaged \r\n  in the business of selling puppies even though he was a full-time salesman. \r\n  Id. at 1298.  \r\nOther jurisdictions have found \r\n  that part time activities constitute business pursuits.  See Allstate \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Crouch, 666 A.2d 964 (N.H. 1995) (an insuredâ€™s long-standing \r\n  hobby of automobile repair constituted a business pursuit); Nationwide Mut. \r\n  Fire Ins. Co. v. Nunn, 442 S.E.2d 340 (N.C. App. 1994) (insuredâ€™s operation \r\n  of a bed and breakfast that operated for three months out of the year was a \r\n  â€œbusiness pursuitâ€); Williams v. State Farm &amp; Cas. Co., 509 N.W.2d \r\n  294 (Wis. 1993) (insured, who was a part-time investor in the stock market, \r\n  was engaged in a business); Heggen v. Mountain W. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., \r\n  715 P.2d 1060 (Mont. 1986) (insured, who participated in a jack steer-roping \r\n  contest, was engaged in a business); State Farm &amp; Fire Cas. Co. v. Moore, \r\n  430 N.E.2d 641 (Ill. App. 1981) (insuredâ€™s part-time babysitting constituted \r\n  a â€œbusiness pursuitâ€). \r\nIn the present case, the parties \r\n  do not dispute that Ko-Akita Kennels is not the Raynoldsâ€™ primary occupation.  \r\n  As noted earlier, Mr. Raynolds is a retired engineer, and he and Mrs. Raynolds \r\n  maintain a retail cosmetic business.  Given the amount of time and resources \r\n  that the Raynolds have contributed to the care, sales, and breeding of their \r\n  dogs, however, we hold that an activity may be continuous even though it is \r\n  a â€œpart-timeâ€ activity or a secondary occupation.\r\nThe Raynolds have been breeding, \r\n  showing, and selling Akitas for almost fifteen years.  Mr. Raynolds spent approximately \r\n  120 hours a month caring for the dogs.  He also attended dog shows two times \r\n  a month, each show lasting two to three days.  The Raynolds have also spent \r\n  a considerable amount of time customizing their property to care for the dogs. \r\n\r\nThe Raynoldsâ€™ activities represent \r\n  a â€œcustomary activity or a stated occupationâ€ within the meaning of Shapiro.  \r\n  Therefore, the continuity prong of Faddin is satisfied.\r\nB. Profit-Motive \r\n  Prong\r\nState Auto argues that the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred in holding that the Raynoldsâ€™ activities did not meet the profit-motive \r\n  prong of the Faddin analysis.  We agree. \r\nThe profit-motive prong of Faddin \r\n  may be satisfied when the activity in question is â€œshown to be such an activity \r\n  as a means of livelihood, gainful employment, means of earning a living, procuring \r\n  subsistence or profit, commercial transactions or engagements.â€  Faddin, \r\n  274 N.Y.S.2d at 241. \r\nThe Court of Appeals held that \r\n  the Raynolds did not have a profit motive as to their activities with the dogs \r\n  primarily because they never made an actual profit.  State Auto v. Raynolds, \r\n  350 S.C. 108, 564 S.E.2d 677 (Ct. App. 2002).  However, we recognize that the \r\n  concepts of profit motive and actual profit are not identical and while the \r\n  Raynoldsâ€™ overall income from selling or breeding the dogs may not have produced \r\n  a profit, evidence suggests that they at least had a motive to cover their costs.\r\nThe Raynolds filed losses for \r\n  â€œProfit or Loss from Businessâ€ under Schedule â€œCâ€ of their federal income tax \r\n  return pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Â§162 (2003) as to their dog breeding and selling \r\n  expenses.  Courts in other jurisdictions have held that seeking such tax advantages \r\n  is evidence of a profit motive.  See Heggan, 715 P.2d at 1060 (holding \r\n  that the use of business deductions pursuant to steer roping activities indicated \r\n  a profit motive despite a lack of actual profit); Pacific Indem. Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Aetna Cas. and Surety Co., 688 A.2d 319 (Conn. 1997) (holding that activities \r\n  related to boarding horses constituted a business pursuit where the insured \r\n  depreciated items and deducted expenses, evidencing a profit motive).       \r\nSince 1989, the Raynolds have \r\n  attended between 40 and 70 dog shows a year.  Mr. Raynolds testified that he \r\n  showed his dogs in an attempt to build their reputation, which increases the \r\n  value of the dogs for purposes of stud fees and breeding prices. \r\nThe Raynolds also publicly advertised \r\n  the sale and breeding prices of their dogs under the name â€œKo-Akita Kennels,â€ \r\n  and they have sold puppies for substantial amounts of money.\r\nSeveral jurisdictions have held \r\n  that actual profit is not necessary to satisfy the profit-motive prong.  In \r\n  Pacific Indem. Ins. Co. v. Aetna Cas. and Surety Co., supra, the \r\n  Connecticut Supreme Court held an insured need not show an actual profit to \r\n  be engaged in a business pursuit. Id.  Also see Wiley, 534 P.2d \r\n  1293, 1295 (Okla. 1974) (â€œProfit motive, not actual profit, makes a pursuit \r\n  a business pursuitâ€).\r\nMany businesses are not profitable, \r\n  but they are businesses nonetheless.   Therefore, we hold that the Raynoldsâ€™ \r\n  activities satisfy the profit-motive prong.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees \r\n   \r\nState Auto argues that the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to the Raynolds.  This issue is \r\n  moot.\r\nIt is well-settled in South Carolina \r\n  that when a defendant insured prevails in a declaratory judgment action, the \r\n  insured is entitled to recover attorneyâ€™s fees.  Hegler v. Gulf Ins. Co., \r\n  270 S.C. 548, 243 S.E.2d 443 (1978).  However, in this case, the Raynolds did \r\n  not prevail and therefore, the issue is moot.\r\nconclusion\r\nWe now reverse the Court of Appeals \r\n  on the â€œbusiness pursuitsâ€ issue holding that the Raynolds were involved in \r\n  a business pursuit; Turnerâ€™s injuries were connected to that pursuit; State \r\n  Auto properly denied coverage pursuant to an enforceable exclusion; and thus, \r\n  the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees is moot.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Their tax return showed $3,500 in receipts related to Ko-Akita Kennels, \r\n    with similar expense deductions. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  However, South Carolina law has established that a court will construe \r\n    contract exclusion provisions in favor of the insured when the exclusion is \r\n    ambiguous.   Boggs v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 272 S.C. 460, 252 S.E.2d \r\n    565 (1979).  Nevertheless, courts are not to â€œtorture the meaning of policy \r\n    language to extend or defeat coverage that was never intended by the parties.â€ \r\n    Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v.

Ramey, of Bryan D. Ramey &amp; Associates, P.A., of Piedmont and John \r\n  S. Nichols, of Bluestein &amp; Nichols, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nSamuel C. Weldon, of Clarkson, Walsh, Rheney &amp; Turner, of Greenville, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: \r\n  Angel Gilliland (â€œPetitionerâ€) sought coverage for personal injuries she sustained \r\n  from a car accident involving an unknown driver.  At trial, Gayle Norris (â€œNorrisâ€) \r\n  testified that she saw Petitionerâ€™s accident.  The parties dispute whether this \r\n  witness testimony implicated the unknown carâ€™s involvement in Petitionerâ€™s accident.  \r\n  The jury awarded Petitioner actual and punitive damages. Respondent made a motion \r\n  for JNOV, which was denied.  The Court of Appeals later reversed and granted \r\n  the JNOV on grounds that Norrisâ€™s testimony did not satisfy S.C. Code Â§ 38-77-170 \r\n  because she was unable to provide evidence that the unknown car caused Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  accident. Gilliland v. Doe, 351 S.C. 497, 570 S.E.2d 545 (Ct. App. 2002).  \r\n  Petitioner seeks this Courtâ€™s review of that ruling.\r\nFactual/Procedural \r\n  Background\r\nAt trial, Petitioner testified that on the night \r\n  of March 29, 1996, as she was leaving a grocery store in Greenville, SC, two \r\n  young men waved at her from a pick-up truck.  As she drove from the store, the \r\n  boys began to follow her.  \r\nSoon after Petitioner turned north on Berea Drive, \r\n  the boys began to closely pursue her vehicle.  She testified that they â€œrode \r\n  her bumperâ€ for a two-mile stretch.  Petitioner sped up in a frightened attempt \r\n  to get away from the boysâ€™ truck.  As she accelerated, Petitioner lost control \r\n  of her car, ran off the road, and hit a tree.  Upon impact, she suffered substantial \r\n  bodily injuries and spent nine days in the hospital.  \r\nPetitioner testified that the boysâ€™ truck never \r\n  made contact with her car and that the boys â€œbacked offâ€ once she began to lose \r\n  control.           \r\nThe investigating officer testified that when he \r\n  questioned Petitioner at the scene of the accident, she told him that she was \r\n  run off the road by an unknown vehicle.          \r\nDuring the accident, Gayle Norris was stopped at \r\n  a nearby intersection.  She testified that she saw the lights of two cars as \r\n  the cars came around the curve.  She also testified that after the accident, \r\n  she saw the lights of the car behind Petitionerâ€™s â€œarc through a fieldâ€ as if \r\n  it were making a U-turn.           \r\nAfter the jury returned a verdict for Petitioner, \r\n  Respondent made a JNOV Motion, which Judge Alison Lee denied.  The Court of \r\n  Appeals reversed Judge Leeâ€™s ruling and granted the JNOV.  Petitioner asks the \r\n  following on appeal:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err when it granted Respondentâ€™s \r\n  JNOV because Norrisâ€™s testimony did not meet the â€œindependent witnessâ€ requirements \r\n  of Â§ 38-77-170?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  when it granted Respondentâ€™s JNOV Motion.  We agree.  \r\nThis Court recently reiterated the standard for \r\n  appellate review of JNOVs:\r\n\r\nâ€¦[u]nder the state standard the trial court should not grant \r\n  JNOV where the evidence yields more than one inference.  An appellate court \r\n  may not overturn the decision of the trial court, under the state standard, \r\n  if there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling\r\n\r\nRogers v. Norfolk Southern \r\n  Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 92, 588 S.E.2d 87, 90 (2003).  We have also held that \r\n  â€œ[i]n ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the \r\n  verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences \r\n  that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party \r\n  opposing the motions.â€  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, \r\n  336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). \r\nThe Legislature first enacted \r\n  a â€œJohn Doeâ€ statute in 1963, recognizing an insuredâ€™s right to receive uninsured \r\n  motorist coverage for injuries caused by unknown drivers.  Since the statuteâ€™s \r\n  enactment, the Legislature placed safeguards within the statute to prevent citizens \r\n  from bringing fraudulent â€œJohn Doeâ€ actions.  The initial safeguard was a requirement \r\n  that the unknown vehicle make â€œphysical contactâ€ with the plaintiffâ€™s car. Act \r\n  No. 312, 1963 S.C. Acts 535.  \r\nThen in 1987, the Legislature \r\n  amended the statute once again to allow insureds to bring a â€œJohn Doeâ€ action \r\n  regardless of physical contact as long as an independent person witnessed the \r\n  accident.  Act. No. 166, 1987 S.C. Acts 1122.  \r\nIn 1989, the Legislature \r\n  again amended the statute to require that the independent witness provide the \r\n  court with a signed affidavit attesting to the unknown vehicleâ€™s involvement \r\n  in the accident.  \r\nThis Court must now determine \r\n  to what extent an independent witness must testify about the causal connection \r\n  between the unknown vehicle and the accident to satisfy the legislatureâ€™s intent \r\n  to protect insurance companies from fraudulent claims in â€œJohn Doeâ€ actions.  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Â§ 38-77-170 (Supp. 2002) provides:\r\n\r\nIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes \r\n  bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, there is no right \r\n  of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, unless:\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the insured \r\n  or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate police \r\n  authority within a reasonable time, under all circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the injury \r\n  or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, or the \r\n  accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator \r\n  of the insured vehicle; provided however, the witness must sign an affidavit \r\n  attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained in the \r\n  affidavit;\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the insured \r\n  was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the other vehicle \r\n  and the driver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, \r\n  309 S.C. 269, 422 S.E.2d 106, (1992) this Court indicated that the statute required \r\n  an independent witness to attest to facts that provide at least some causal \r\n  connection between an unknown driver and the accident.  The Court provided that \r\n  the adequacy of the â€œcausal connectionâ€ should pass the same test used in determining \r\n  whether an injury or damage arose out of the ownership, maintenance, or use \r\n  of the uninsured vehicle. Id. at 275, 422 S.E.2d at 110.   The Court \r\n  explained that this test regarding the sufficiency of the evidence is â€œsomething \r\n  less than proximate cause and something more than the vehicle being the mere \r\n  site of the injury.â€  Id. at 272, 422 S.E.2d at 108 (citing Continental \r\n  Western Ins. Co. v. Klug, 415 N.W.2d 876 (Minn. 1987)).\r\nBased on the test set forth \r\n  in Howser, Â§ 38-77-170(2) may be satisfied even though an independent \r\n  witness fails to provide a clear answer to the question of proximate cause.  \r\n  Howser suggests that Â§ 38-77-170(2) should be interpreted liberally.  \r\n  This Court arguably abandoned a liberal interpretation of Â§ 38-77-170(2) in \r\n  Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002).\r\nIn Collins, this \r\n  Court strictly interpreted Â§ 38-77-170(2).  This Court held that while the purpose \r\n  of the affidavit requirement of Â§ 38-77-170(2) could have been met by witness \r\n  testimony, the statute specifically required that the plaintiff provide an affidavit \r\n  of an independent witness.  \r\nHere, Â§ 38-77-170(2) provides that an independent \r\n  witness must attest to â€œthe truth of the facts of the accident.â€  On one hand, \r\n  Collins suggests that we should not apply standards that are not specifically \r\n  set forth in the statute.  On the other hand, the provision in question here \r\n  is arguably ambiguous (while the affidavit requirement, according to Collins, \r\n  is not); therefore, a strict interpretation of Â§ 38-77-170(2) would undermine \r\n  the statuteâ€™s purpose.  See Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, \r\n  Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)(â€œHowever plain the ordinary \r\n  meaning of the words used in a statute may be, [we] will reject that meaning \r\n  when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not \r\n  possibly have intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative \r\n  intention.â€)   \r\nIn the case at hand, the \r\n  Court of Appeals held that the witness must â€œbe able to attest to the circumstances \r\n  surrounding the accident, i.e., what actions of the unknown driver contributed \r\n  to the accident.â€ Gilliland, 351 S.C. at 500, 570 S.E.2d at 548.  \r\n  We agree that this analysis is consistent with Howser and constitutes \r\n  a fair interpretation of the ambiguous fact requirement of Â§ 38-77-170(2).  \r\n  However, the Court of Appeals found that Norris failed to attest to the existence \r\n  of an unknown vehicle.  Gilliland, 351 S.C. at 498, 570 S.E.2d at 546.  \r\n  We find the record includes sufficient evidence that an unknown vehicle was \r\n  involved in Petitionerâ€™s accident.   \r\nIn Marks v. Indus. Life \r\n  &amp; Health Ins. Co., 212 S.C. 502, 505, 48 S.E.2d 445, 446, this Court \r\n  held that â€œ[t]he attending circumstances along with direct testimony may be \r\n  taken into account by the jury in arriving at its decision as any fact in issue \r\n  may be established by circumstantial evidence, if the circumstances, which must \r\n  themselves be proven lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty.â€  \r\nWe now hold that the testimony \r\n  of Gayle Norris contained circumstantial evidence that supports Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  testimony that an unknown driver contributed to her accident.  Norrisâ€™s testimony \r\n  that she saw the lights of an unknown car that was turning around and fleeing \r\n  the scene of the accident sufficiently corroborates Petitionerâ€™s testimony creating \r\n  a question of fact as to causation for the jury.  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe believe that \r\n  the record includes sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to find \r\n  the requisite causation necessary to satisfy Â§ 38-77-170(2).  We therefore reverse \r\n  the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial courtâ€™s judgment for Petitioner.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25778","title":"Cothran v.

Land, of Land, \r\n  Parker &amp; Welch, P.A., of Manning, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  We granted a writ of certiorari \r\n  to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Cothran v. Brown, 350 S.C. \r\n  352, 566 S.E.2d 548 (2002).  We reverse.\r\nPetitioner, Alvin Brown (Brown), pled guilty to reckless \r\n  homicide, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2910 (1976), in connection with \r\n  the death of Douglas J. McFaddin (McFaddin).  Respondent, Ferrell Cothran, as \r\n  personal representative of McFaddinâ€™s estate, filed a civil action asserting \r\n  wrongful death and survival claims against Brown.  The trial court granted partial \r\n  summary judgment for McFaddinâ€™s estate on the issue of liability, finding Brownâ€™s \r\n  guilty plea estopped him from denying civil liability.  A panel of the Court \r\n  of Appeals reversed.  The Court of Appeals subsequently granted Cothranâ€™s Petition \r\n  for Rehearing en banc to consider whether Brown should be judicially \r\n  estopped from asserting comparative negligence in this civil proceeding.  A \r\n  majority of the Court of Appeals held Brown to be judicially estopped from contesting \r\n  liability.  The majority also adopted the â€œcompeting affidavitâ€ rule.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.  Did the Court of Appeals err in applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel \r\n  to preclude Brown from asserting a comparative negligence defense in a civil \r\n  proceeding when Brown had previously entered a guilty plea to criminal charges \r\n  arising from the same automobile accident?\r\nII.  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding Brownâ€™s second affidavit did not \r\n  merit consideration for summary judgment purposes?\r\n\r\nI.\r\nThis matter arose out of an automobile accident.  \r\n  Brown was driving his vehicle east on Rainbow Lake Road in Clarendon County \r\n  on the night of December 2, 1995.  McFaddin had parked his westbound truck on \r\n  the eastbound shoulder near the curve of the road with the vehicle headlights \r\n  on.  Brown entered the left-hand curve, saw the headlights on McFaddinâ€™s vehicle, \r\n  swerved to his right off the paved surface of the road, striking McFaddin, who \r\n  was standing outside his vehicle calling his dogs after a day of hunting.  Brown \r\n  was given a chemical test of his breath which registered an alcohol concentration \r\n  of .17 percent.  Brown told officers at the scene that, as he came around the \r\n  curve, he saw headlights in his lane and swerved to the right, striking McFaddin \r\n  and colliding with McFaddinâ€™s vehicle.  \r\nAt the plea hearing, Brown admitted his guilt \r\n  and explained to the plea judge that he was blinded by the headlights on McFaddinâ€™s \r\n  vehicle.  Plea counsel presented Brownâ€™s statement to the officer at the scene, \r\n  as well as a map, survey, and video recreation of the accident scene to illustrate \r\n  the position of McFaddinâ€™s vehicle.  The recreation demonstrated the appearance \r\n  of the headlights from Brownâ€™s perspective.  Brown believed McFaddinâ€™s vehicle \r\n  was traveling in Brownâ€™s lane and a head-on collision was imminent.  \r\nIn the civil proceeding, Cothran argued Brownâ€™s \r\n  comparative negligence defense was inconsistent with his plea of guilty in the \r\n  criminal proceeding.  Brownâ€™s counsel presented the investigating officerâ€™s \r\n  report and photographs of the accident scene.  Additionally, Brownâ€™s counsel \r\n  presented two affidavits, one by Brown, and one by Maechearda McCray. \r\n  [1]   \r\nJudicial estoppel is an equitable concept that prevents \r\n  a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with, or in conflict with, \r\n  one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or related proceeding.  \r\n  See Colleton Reg. Hosp. v. MRS Med. Rev. Systs., \r\n  866 F.Supp. 896, 900 (D.S.C. 1994).  The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure \r\n  the integrity of the judicial process, not to protect the parties from allegedly \r\n  dishonest conduct by their adversary.  See Hawkins v. Bruno \r\n  Yacht Sales, 353 S.C. 31, 42, 577 S.E.2d 202, 208 (2003).\r\nIn Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, \r\n  251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997), we formally adopted the doctrine of judicial \r\n  estoppel as it relates to matters of fact, not law.  For the following reasons, \r\n  we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ application of judicial estoppel.\r\nThis Court has not previously explicitly \r\n  delineated the requirements for the application of judicial estoppel.  We now \r\n  adopt the following elements necessary for the doctrine to apply:  (1) two inconsistent \r\n  positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) \r\n  the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving \r\n  the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the \r\n  position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received \r\n  some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to \r\n  mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.  \r\n  See Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 83, 552 S.E.2d 767, \r\n  772 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nThe evidence in this matter fails to satisfy \r\n  the first, fourth and fifth elements.\r\nAs to the first element, Brown has consistently \r\n  maintained McFaddinâ€™s vehicle was parked in such a way that the vehicleâ€™s headlights \r\n  blinded and confused him.  His position at the accident scene, the guilty plea \r\n  proceeding and the summary judgment hearing has been consistent.\r\nIn concluding Brown was judicially estopped from contesting \r\n  liability, the Court of Appeals focused on a statement made by Brownâ€™s plea \r\n  counsel at the plea hearing.  At the plea hearing, Brown admitted fault and \r\n  also stated he was blinded by McFaddinâ€™s headlights.  His plea counsel attempted \r\n  to clarify Brownâ€™s position. [2]   Plea counselâ€™s statement was an attempt to \r\n  reinforce his clientâ€™s acceptance of fault to ensure the successful entry of \r\n  the guilty plea.  It is not surprising that counsel made such an effort under \r\n  these circumstances to encourage the sentencing judge to accept the plea.   \r\n\r\nThe doctrine of judicial estoppel is an equitable \r\n  concept and should be applied sparingly, with clear regard for the facts of \r\n  the particular case.  The application of judicial estoppel must be determined \r\n  on a case-by-case basis, and must not be applied to impede the truth-seeking \r\n  function of the court.  In the context of the entire plea proceeding, Brownâ€™s \r\n  counselâ€™s statements, which were intended to reinforce his clientâ€™s acceptance \r\n  of fault for the criminal charge, do not represent a different factual scenario \r\n  than the one continuously set forth by Brown in both the plea and summary judgment \r\n  hearings.\r\nAs to the fourth element, Brown has consistently \r\n  maintained he was blinded by McFaddinâ€™s headlights.  We find no evidence Brown \r\n  sought to intentionally mislead the trial court.  To the contrary, Brown has \r\n  repeatedly stated the position of McFaddinâ€™s vehicle was a contributing cause \r\n  of the accident.  In both the plea and summary judgment hearings, Brown submitted \r\n  evidence supporting this contention.  \r\nAs to the fifth element, McFaddinâ€™s conduct is not \r\n  germane to Brownâ€™s guilty plea.  The plea judge was not required to consider \r\n  McFaddinâ€™s negligence, if any, in any regard with Brownâ€™s guilty plea.  Brown \r\n  is bound by his factual admissions at his guilty plea.  By virtue of that plea, \r\n  Brown admitted he is criminally responsible for McFaddinâ€™s death.  He cannot, \r\n  thereafter, deny liability in a civil proceeding.  See Doe v. Doe, \r\n  346 S.C. 145, 148, 551 S.E.2d 257, 258 (2001) (holding that once a person is \r\n  criminally convicted he is collaterally estopped from relitigating his guilt \r\n  in a subsequent civil proceeding if the civil proceeding is based on the same \r\n  facts underlying the criminal conviction).  However, because McFaddinâ€™s relative \r\n  fault, if any, was not at issue in the guilty plea, Brown is entitled to contest \r\n  it in a subsequent civil proceeding. Brownâ€™s guilty plea is not totally inconsistent \r\n  with his comparative negligence defense in the civil proceeding because McFaddinâ€™s \r\n  negligence, if any, was not an issue for consideration by the judge at the plea \r\n  hearing.  McFaddinâ€™s negligence, if any, under a theory of comparative negligence \r\n  is a question for the jury. \r\nII.\r\n Although unnecessary for resolution of this appeal, for the benefit \r\n  of the Bench and Bar, we address the â€œcompeting affidavitâ€ rule, also commonly \r\n  referred to as the â€œsham affidavitâ€ rule.  Brown argues the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the additional \r\n  sustaining ground that Brown presented no evidence of McFaddinâ€™s negligence.  \r\n  Brown argues, inter alia, the court erred in disregarding his second \r\n  affidavit.  Brown signed two affidavits.  In his first affidavit, Brown stated \r\n  he struck McFaddin as a result of his alcohol consumption.  In his second affidavit, \r\n  Brown stated he was not drunk at the time of the accident, although he had been \r\n  consuming alcohol, and the cause of the accident was his inability to determine \r\n  the position of  McFaddinâ€™s vehicle. \r\nWe find persuasive the reasoning of federal case law.  Federal courts, \r\n  including the Fourth Circuit, have held a court may disregard a subsequent affidavit \r\n  as a â€œsham,â€ that is, as not creating an issue of fact for purposes of summary \r\n  judgment, by submitting the subsequent affidavit to contradict that partyâ€™s \r\n  own prior sworn statement.   See Margo v. Weiss, \r\n  213 F.3d 55, 63 (2nd Cir. 2000); Rohrbough v. Wyeth Labs. Inc., \r\n  916 F.2d 970, 976 (4th Cir. 1990); Martin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, \r\n  Inc., 851 F.2d 703, 705 (3rd Cir. 1988).\r\nIn distinguishing between a sham affidavit and a correcting or clarifying \r\n  affidavit, the following considerations provide guidance: (1) whether an explanation \r\n  is offered for the statements that contradict prior sworn statements; (2) the \r\n  importance to the litigation of the fact about which there is a contradiction; \r\n  (3) whether the nonmovant had access to this fact prior to the previous sworn \r\n  testimony; (4) the frequency and degree of variation between statements in the \r\n  previous sworn testimony and statements made in the later affidavit concerning \r\n  this fact; (5) whether the previous sworn testimony indicates the witness was \r\n  confused at the time; (6) when, in relation to summary judgment, the second \r\n  affidavit is submitted.  See Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., \r\n  754 A.2d 1030, 1042 (Md. 2000). [3] \r\n  \r\nAlthough our finding on the competing affidavit rule is not necessary \r\n  for resolution of this matter, we conclude the Court of Appeals misapplied the \r\n  rule under the facts of this case.  The competing affidavit rule is an exception \r\n  to a general prohibition against a judge excluding a contradictory affidavit \r\n  from consideration and is used only when the affidavit is an attempt to create \r\n  a sham issue of material fact.  See Hancock v. Bureau of Natâ€™l \r\n  Affairs, 645 A.2d 588, 591 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  Brown did not intend to create \r\n  a sham issue.  Brown has consistently asserted throughout the criminal and civil \r\n  proceedings that he was blinded by the headlights of McFaddinâ€™s vehicle. Therefore, \r\n  it cannot be said Brownâ€™s second affidavit was admitted for the sole purpose \r\n  of creating a â€œshamâ€ issue of fact.\r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n                     [1] McCrayâ€™s affidavit states McCray \r\n    saw Brown before the accident and Brown did not appear to be drunk.  Additionally, \r\n    McCray stated he returned to the accident scene with Brown and McFaddinâ€™s \r\n    vehicle was positioned in such a way that its headlights blinded oncoming \r\n    cars, making a head-on collision seem imminent to vehicles traveling in Brownâ€™s \r\n    direction.\r\n\r\n \r\n                     [2] Brownâ€™s plea counsel stated, \r\n    in part, â€œYou know, heâ€™s not trying to indicate to you or to anyone else in \r\n    this courtroom that [McFaddin] caused the accident or had anything to do with \r\n    the accident.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n                     [3] The considerations developed \r\n    by the Maryland Supreme Court primarily address the factual circumstance in \r\n    which a party or witness has been deposed and subsequently submitted an affidavit \r\n    in contradiction of the previous deposition testimony.  We have modified the \r\n    language to include the current factual scenario, where a party has submitted \r\n    an affidavit conflicting with prior sworn testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25779","title":"Heyward v.

James, Jr., of Lee, Erter, Wilson, James, \r\n  Holler and Smith, of Sumter, for petitioner.\r\nDwight Christopher Moore, of Sumter; John Dennis Delgado and Kathrine Haggard \r\n  Hudgins, both of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted certiorari to review \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion [1] \r\n   finding the trial court erred by granting petitioner Samuel Christmas a \r\n  directed verdict.  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent brought a civil action against petitioner Samuel Christmas, a South \r\n  Carolina Highway Patrol trooper, alleging excessive force and illegal seizure \r\n  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 [2]  \r\n  and alleging other causes of action.  After the other actions were dismissed, \r\n  a trial was held on the Â§ 1983 cause of action. \r\nOn February 16, 1996, respondent, who had been drinking at a bar, asked his \r\n  cousin, Ronald Brunson, to give him a ride home.  During the ride, a Pinewood \r\n  police officer attempted to pull Brunson over.  Brunson refused to stop and \r\n  shots were fired from the car towards the officer.  Several officers, including \r\n  Trooper Christmas, were dispatched to assist the Pinewood police in the car \r\n  chase.  Brunsonâ€™s car was eventually stopped at a roadblock.\r\nOnce the car stopped, the officers exited their cars and instructed \r\n  Brunson and respondent to exit the vehicle with their hands up.  Brunson exited \r\n  from the driverâ€™s side with his hands in the air.  He held a Coke can in one \r\n  of his hands.  Because Brunson did not exit with a weapon, Trooper Christmas \r\n  concluded the gun was still in the car or on respondentâ€™s person.  Respondent \r\n  did not exit the car or raise his hands as instructed by the officers.\r\nWhile another officer secured Brunson, Trooper Christmas approached \r\n  the driverâ€™s side of the car.  He testified he saw respondent in the passenger \r\n  seat and that he could not see respondentâ€™s hands because they were tucked under \r\n  his thighs.  He testified he had the best view of respondent because the door \r\n  was open between him and respondent.\r\nHolding his gun in his right hand, Trooper Christmas placed his left \r\n  knee on the driverâ€™s seat and reached through the car to extract respondent \r\n  from the car.  Trooper Christmas testified respondent did not raise his hands \r\n  until he reached in the car to grab him.  While trying to extract respondent \r\n  from the car, respondentâ€™s weight shifted causing Trooper Christmas to stumble.  \r\n  When the weight shifted, Trooper Christmas testified he instinctively re-gripped \r\n  his hand and accidentally pulled the trigger, shooting respondent in the thigh.  \r\n  Trooper Christmas testified respondent did not resist while being pulled from \r\n  the car and that the entire event occurred in a matter of seconds.\r\nTrooper Christmas testified he did not holster his gun while trying \r\n  to pull respondent from the car because he had a new holster that was not properly \r\n  broken in.  He testified he was worried the gun would either fall out of the \r\n  holster or that he would not be able to retrieve it quickly if he needed to \r\n  do so.  He stated if there had not been a known weapon inside the car, he would \r\n  have holstered his gun.\r\nRespondent called Rick Johnson as an expert in law enforcement.  \r\n  Johnson testified Trooper Christmasâ€™s actions were unreasonable because he should \r\n  not have approached the car after Brunson was subdued.  Johnson stated Trooper \r\n  Christmas placed himself and other officers in jeopardy and that there was adequate \r\n  time for Trooper Christmas to take time to assess the situation.  Johnson testified \r\n  the reasonable approach would have been to stay in a protected position behind \r\n  the door of one of the police cars and use the public address system to order \r\n  respondent out of the car. [3]   He also testified that coming \r\n  across the driverâ€™s side of the car and extracting respondent with one hand \r\n  was unreasonable because Trooper Christmas would have lacked control of his \r\n  gun and of respondent.  On cross-examination, Johnson admitted he had the benefit \r\n  of 20/20 hindsight.\r\nFollowing the close of the evidence, the trial court granted Trooper \r\n  Christmasâ€™s directed verdict motion based on the Fourth Amendment and qualified \r\n  immunity.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision granting \r\n  Trooper Christmasâ€™s directed verdict motion?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn review of a ruling granting a directed verdict, the evidence and \r\n  all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the party against whom the verdict was directed.  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, \r\n  331 S.C. 589, 503 S.E.2d 717 (1998).  If the evidence is susceptible to more \r\n  than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.  Id.\r\nOur decision is controlled by the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision \r\n  in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989).  Quesinberry, 331 S.C. \r\n  at 594-595, 503 S.E.2d at 720.  Graham held all claims that law enforcement \r\n  officers used excessive force in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, \r\n  or other seizure of a free citizen should be analyzed under the reasonableness \r\n  standard of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states \r\n  that people have a right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable \r\n  seizures.  Id. at 595, 503 S.E.2d at 720.\r\n\r\nDetermining whether the force used to effect a particular seizure is reasonable \r\n  under the Fourth Amendment requires a careful balancing of the nature and quality \r\n  of the intrusion on the individualâ€™s Fourth Amendment interests against the \r\n  countervailing governmental interests at stake.  Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence \r\n  has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily \r\n  carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat \r\n  thereof to effect it.  Because the test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment \r\n  is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application, however, its \r\n  proper application requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances \r\n  of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether \r\n  the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, \r\n  and whether [the suspect] is resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest \r\n  by flight.\r\nThe reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from \r\n  the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 \r\n  vision of hindsight.  With respect to a claim of excessive force, the same standard \r\n  of reasonableness at the moment applies:  Not every push or shove, even if it \r\n  may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judgeâ€™s chambers, violates the \r\n  Fourth Amendment.  The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for \r\n  the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments--in \r\n  circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving--about the amount \r\n  of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 396-97 (internal quotations \r\n  and citations omitted)). \r\nLooking at all the facts and circumstances that existed during the \r\n  event in question, Trooper Christmasâ€™s action of entering the car to extract \r\n  respondent with his gun drawn was objectively reasonable.  First, the crime \r\n  was severe.  Several shots had been fired from the car at one of the pursuing \r\n  officers.  At the time, Trooper Christmas did not know whether respondent or \r\n  Brunson was responsible for the shooting.  \r\nSecond, because Brunson exited the car without the weapon used in the crime, \r\n  Trooper Christmas reasonably concluded the gun was either still in the car or \r\n  in respondentâ€™s possession.  See Anderson v. Russell, 247 F.3d \r\n  125 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 949 (2001) (officer \r\n  not required to see object in suspectâ€™s hand before using deadly force); Pleasant \r\n  v. Zamieski, 895 F.2d 272 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 \r\n  U.S. 851 (1990) (not knowing what, if anything, plaintiff had with him in car, \r\n  it was reasonable for officer to draw gun and failure to holster gun was not \r\n  unreasonable under circumstances where plaintiff could have escaped if had holstered \r\n  gun).  Therefore, respondent could have posed a threat to the safety of Trooper \r\n  Christmas and the other officers.\r\nThird, respondent did not comply with the officersâ€™ orders to exit the car \r\n  with his hands raised.  See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001) \r\n  (if officer reasonably, but mistakenly, believed suspect was likely to fight \r\n  back, officer justified in using more force than in fact needed; officers can \r\n  have reasonable, but mistaken, beliefs as to facts establishing existence of \r\n  exigent circumstances and in those situations courts will not hold they have \r\n  violated Constitution); Brown v. Gilmore, 278 F.3d 362 (4th \r\n  Cir. 2002) (reasonable for officers to believe suspect who had already disobeyed \r\n  one direct order would balk at being arrested).  Further, because the police \r\n  had already been led on a car chase, there was still a possibility respondent \r\n  could attempt to continue to evade arrest by fleeing.\r\nAs Trooper Christmas testified, these events occurred within a matter \r\n  of seconds.  As a result, Trooper Christmas was forced to make a split-second \r\n  judgment about entering the car to remove respondent with his gun drawn.  Understandably, \r\n  Trooper Christmas did not want to holster his gun due to his fear he might be \r\n  unable to retrieve it quickly if the gun was needed.  See Graham v. \r\n  Connor, supra (police officers often forced to make split-second \r\n  judgments about amount of force necessary in particular situation in tense and \r\n  rapidly evolving circumstances); Pleasant v. Zamieski, supra (court \r\n  could not say officerâ€™s failure to holster gun was unreasonable under circumstances; \r\n  had officer taken time to holster gun, plaintiff would have escaped).\r\nWhile Trooper Christmas could have placed himself in a protective \r\n  position and could have used the public address system to give orders to respondent, \r\n  considering those facts is exactly the type of analysis prohibited by Graham. [4]   See Graham, supra \r\n  (reasonableness of particular use of force must be judged from perspective of \r\n  reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 hindsight); Anderson \r\n  v. Russell, supra (declined to adopt 20/20 hindsight to second guess \r\n  officerâ€™s decision to shoot rather than take cover, given officer reasonably \r\n  believed his life to be in imminent danger).\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred by reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to grant Trooper Christmasâ€™s directed verdict motion because the evidence was \r\n  only susceptible to the inference that Trooper Christmasâ€™s actions in seizing \r\n  respondent were reasonable.  Cf. Quesinberry, supra (evidence \r\n  susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, case should be submitted \r\n  to jury). [5]   Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Heyward v. Christmas, 352 \r\n    S.C. 298, 573 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] 42 \r\n    U.S.C. Â§ 1983 provides, in part:\r\n  \r\n  Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, \r\n    regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . ., subjects, or causes to be \r\n    subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any \r\n    rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall \r\n    be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other \r\n    proper proceeding for redress.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Trooper \r\n    Christmas testified he was trained to remain in a protected position when \r\n    dealing with a known or suspected felon and that he could have done so in \r\n    this case.  He further testified he had been trained to use the public address \r\n    system in felony car stops. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Respondentâ€™s \r\n    argument that Trooper Christmas acted unreasonably because his actions placed \r\n    the other officers in jeopardy is without merit.  See Howerton v. \r\n    Fletcher, 213 F.3d 171 (4th Cir. 2000) (question is not whether \r\n    officer acted reasonably vis-Ã -vis world at large; rather, question is whether \r\n    officer acted reasonably as against plaintiff).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Because \r\n    we find the trial court properly granted Trooper Christmasâ€™s directed verdict \r\n    motion pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, we do not address the trial courtâ€™s \r\n    decision granting the motion on the basis of qualified immunity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25780","title":"McWee v.

McWee, Petitioner,\r\nv.\r\nThe State of South Carolina, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL\r\nJURISDICTION\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25780\r\nHeard September 23, 2003 - Filed January 27, 2004\r\n\r\nWRIT DENIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn F. Hardaway and Melissa Jane Reed Kimbrough, both of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W. McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of \r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Petitioner, a death row inmate \r\n  who has exhausted his state remedies, seeks a writ of habeas corpus contending \r\n  the denial of his request for a parole eligibility charge at trial was â€œa violation, \r\n  which, in the setting, constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness shocking \r\n  to the universal sense of justice.â€  Butler v. State, 302 S.C. 466, 468, \r\n  397 S.E.2d 87, 88 (1990) (emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).  \r\n  We deny the writ.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder and armed robbery and \r\n  was sentenced to death.  His direct appeal was affirmed.  State v. McWee, \r\n  322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996), cert. denied 519 U.S. 1061, \r\n  117 S.Ct. 695, 136 L.Ed.2d 618 (1997).  His application for post-conviction \r\n  relief was denied and this Court declined to issue a writ of certiorari to review \r\n  that decision.  Petitioner received no relief from the federal courts, see \r\n  McWee v. Weldon, 283 F. 3rd 179 (4th Cir.), cert. \r\n  denied 537 U.S. 893, 123 S.Ct. 162, 154 L.Ed.2d 158 (2002), and has now \r\n  filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.  \r\n  See Butler v. State, supra.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s habeas petition involves the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  refusal to give a parole eligibility charge during the penalty phase of petitionerâ€™s \r\n  capital trial.  Prior to jury voir dire, petitionerâ€™s attorneys inquired whether \r\n  the trial judge would instruct the jury that petitioner would be parole eligible \r\n  after service of thirty years.  The trial judge indicated he would give such \r\n  a charge.  At the beginning of the penalty phase, however, the trial judge stated \r\n  he would not instruct the jury on petitionerâ€™s parole eligibility.  Accordingly, \r\n  during his initial charge in the penalty phase, the trial judge told the jury \r\n  that the terms â€œlife imprisonmentâ€ and â€œdeath penaltyâ€ were to be given their \r\n  plain and ordinary meanings.  After some deliberation, the jurors inquired whether \r\n  a defendant who received a life sentence was required to serve a minimum number \r\n  of years before becoming eligible for parole.  The trial judge reiterated the \r\n  â€œplain and ordinary meaningâ€ charge.  Petitioner again requested the jury be \r\n  instructed as to his parole eligibility; the judge again denied the request. \r\n\r\nOn direct appeal, petitioner argued the trial judgeâ€™s refusal \r\n  to give the parole eligibility charge was a violation of his due process and \r\n  Eighth Amendment rights.  The Court held the issue was not properly preserved \r\n  for review since petitioner failed to assert any constitutional basis for the \r\n  charge at trial.  State v. McWee, supra.  Nevertheless, \r\n  the Court addressed the merits of petitionerâ€™s claims, ruling that because petitioner \r\n  was eligible for parole, his due process rights were not infringed. [1]   In addition, the Court held petitionerâ€™s Eighth Amendment \r\n  protections were not violated.  Finally, the Court found that petitioner failed \r\n  to demonstrate any fundamental unfairness as the result of the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  ultimate decision not to give a parole eligibility charge.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes the denial of petitionerâ€™s request for a parole eligibility \r\n  charge warrant the grant of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nHabeas relief will be granted only for a constitutional \r\n  claim  rising to the level of â€œa violation, which in the setting, constitutes \r\n  a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.â€  \r\n  Green v. Maynard, 349 S.C. 535, 538, 564 S.E.2d 83, 84 (2002), quoting \r\n  Butler v. State, supra.  â€œ[N]ot every intervening decision, nor \r\n  every constitutional error at trial will justify issuance of the writ.â€  Id.  \r\n  A writ of habeas corpus will only be granted under â€œunique and compelling circumstances.â€  \r\n  Id.  Habeas corpus is available only when other remedies are inadequate \r\n  or unavailable.  Gibson v. State, 329 S.C. 37, 495 S.E.2d 426 (1998).  \r\n\r\nThe Court has previously reviewed and denied petitionerâ€™s \r\n  present claim.  In his direct appeal, the Court determined petitionerâ€™s failure \r\n  to receive a parole eligibility charge was neither a violation of due process \r\n  nor the Eighth Amendment.  State v. McWee, supra.  The Fourth \r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in its denial of petitionerâ€™s federal habeas \r\n  application.  McWee v. Weldon, supra.  No controlling constitutional \r\n  law has since been created holding otherwise.  See Shafer v. South \r\n  Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263, 149 L.Ed.2d 178 (2001) (whenever \r\n  future dangerousness is at issue in capital sentencing proceeding under South \r\n  Carolinaâ€™s sentencing scheme, due process requires jury be informed that life \r\n  sentence carries no possibility of parole).  There is simply no constitutional \r\n  requirement that a parole eligible defendant receive a parole eligibility instruction. \r\n\r\nThe current case is both factually and legally distinguishable from Butler \r\n  v. State, supra, where habeas relief was granted.  After Butler was \r\n  tried, his direct appeal affirmed, and his application for post-conviction relief \r\n  denied, the Court issued several decisions stating a defendantâ€™s Fifth Amendment \r\n  rights are violated if the trial judge pressures a defendant into testifying.  \r\n  See State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. 332, 353 S.E.2d 441 (1986); State \r\n  v. Pierce, 289 S.C. 430, 346 S.E.2d 707 (1986); State v. Gunter, \r\n  286 S.C. 556, 335 S.E.2d 542 (1985).\r\nSubsequently, Butler filed a habeas petition on the basis the trial judge had \r\n  coerced him into testifying. [2]   \r\n  The Court noted Butler â€œseeks to take advantage of constitutional principles \r\n  recognized after his trial, appeal, and exhaustion of state post-conviction \r\n  relief proceedings.â€  Butler, 302 S.C. at 468, 397 S.E.2d at 88.  The \r\n  Court stated:  \r\n\r\nWe caution that not every intervening decision, nor every constitutional error \r\n  at trial will justify issuance of the writ.  Rather, the writ will issue only \r\n  under circumstances where there has been a â€œviolation, which, in the setting, \r\n  constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense \r\n  of justice.â€  Although we do not condone the delay in calling this grave constitutional \r\n  error to our attention, under the unique and compelling circumstances of this \r\n  case we grant petitioner relief. \r\n\r\nId. (italic in original) (internal citation omitted).  \r\nThe Court granted Butler extraordinary relief.  It emphasized \r\n  the trial judge was unaware Butler was mentally retarded and it expressed concern \r\n  that Butler may not have understood the trial proceedings.    \r\nFurthermore, this case is dissimilar to Tucker v. Catoe, \r\n  346 S.C. 483, 552 S.E.2d 712 (2001), in which the Court granted habeas relief \r\n  to an applicant after concluding his due process rights were violated by an \r\n  unduly coercive Allen [3]  \r\n  charge.  The Court found it was the combination of the constitutional violation \r\n  and other circumstances which compelled it to conclude the applicant \r\n  had been denied fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.   \r\n\r\nPetitioner notes that, despite the trial judgeâ€™s â€œplain \r\n  and ordinary meaningâ€ charge during the initial penalty phase instructions, \r\n  the jury returned with a parole eligibility question.   Petitioner suggests \r\n  that, after his appeal was decided, we created new law holding it is misconduct \r\n  for a jury to fail to â€œrely solely upon the courtâ€™s instructions for the law.â€  \r\n  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 627 (2000).\r\nIt has always been the law that the jury must confine its consideration to \r\n  the law as given by the trial judge.  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 21 (the judge shall \r\n  declare the law). [4]   On direct appeal, petitioner could have readily \r\n  challenged the juryâ€™s misconduct in considering matters contrary to the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s instruction, but he did not do so.  Accordingly, the misconduct by petitionerâ€™s \r\n  jury does not â€œin the settingâ€ - -  petitionerâ€™s trial and its reviews - - constitute \r\n  a violation shocking to the universal sense of justice.  \r\nPut simply, failure to charge the jury that petitioner was parole eligible \r\n  is not shocking to the universal sense of justice.  Clearly, petitionerâ€™s constitutional \r\n  rights were not violated by the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a parole eligibility \r\n  charge; moreover, there have been no intervening circumstances by way of new \r\n  law, after-discovered evidence, or any other alleged fact, which, in the setting, \r\n  warrants the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.  [5]   We deny the petition.           \r\n WRIT DENIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., \r\n  and WALLER, J., concur.  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in \r\n  which Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent.  In my opinion, the denial \r\n  of petitionerâ€™s request for a parole eligibility charge at his capital trial \r\n  was â€œa violation, which, in the setting, constitutes a denial of fundamental \r\n  fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.â€  Butler v. State, \r\n  302 S.C. 466, 468, 397 S.E.2d 87, 88 (1990) (emphasis in original) (internal \r\n  citation omitted).  Accordingly, I would grant the writ of habeas corpus and \r\n  remand the matter to Aiken County for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\nFACTS\r\nPrior to voir dire, petitionerâ€™s attorneys asked the trial \r\n  judge whether he would charge the jury that, were it to find an aggravating \r\n  circumstance yet recommend a life sentence, petitioner would be required to \r\n  serve thirty years before becoming eligible for parole. \r\n  [6]   Had petitioner received a life sentence, he would have been seventy-one \r\n  years old when he first became parole-eligible.  Although the trial judge indicated \r\n  he would give such a charge and the solicitor at one point agreed, the trial \r\n  judge subsequently informed the parties, prior to the commencement of the penalty \r\n  phase, that no such charge would, in fact, be given.\r\nThe trial judge also denied petitionerâ€™s attorneysâ€™ request to voir \r\n  dire potential jurors regarding their views of parole eligibility for murderers \r\n  who do not receive a death sentence.  Despite the lack of any inquiry, the record \r\n  reflects that fourteen of the thirty-nine jurors voir dired raised the \r\n  issue of parole eligibility themselves: five of these fourteen individuals were \r\n  seated on petitionerâ€™s jury.\r\nDuring his initial charge in the penalty phase, the \r\n  trial judge told the jury that the terms â€˜life imprisonmentâ€™ and â€˜death penaltyâ€™ \r\n  were to be given their plain and ordinary meanings.  Despite this charge, the \r\n  jurors returned approximately two minutes after beginning their deliberations \r\n  asking whether a defendant who received a life sentence was required to serve \r\n  a minimum number of years before becoming eligible for parole.  The trial judge \r\n  reiterated the â€˜plain and ordinary meaningâ€™ charge.  Petitionerâ€™s attorneys \r\n  again asked that the thirty-year parole eligibility charge be given, and the \r\n  judge again declined. \r\nOn direct appeal, petitioner argued the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to \r\n  give the parole eligibility charge was a violation of petitionerâ€™s Due Process \r\n  and Eighth Amendment rights.  The Court held the issue was not properly preserved \r\n  for review since petitioner failed to assert any constitutional basis for the \r\n  charge at trial.  State v. McWee, supra.  Despite this issue preservation \r\n  bar, the majority opined that petitionerâ€™s Due Process rights were not violated \r\n  since he was not entitled to the charge because petitioner was, in fact, parole \r\n  eligible.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe extraordinary relief afforded by Butler habeas corpus \r\n  is available â€œto those who have, for whatever reason, been utterly failed by \r\n  our criminal justice system.â€  State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d \r\n  315 (1991).  While â€œnot every intervening decision, nor every constitutional \r\n  error at trial will justify issuance of the writ,â€ it will issue â€œwhere there \r\n  has been a violation which, in the setting, constitutes a denial of fundamental \r\n  fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.â€  Butler v. State, \r\n  supra.\r\nIn this case, petitioner relies on the particular events that occurred \r\n  at his trial and on the evolution of the law regarding parole eligibility charges \r\n  to argue that his sentencing proceeding was, in hindsight, fundamentally unfair.  \r\n  Since this is a capital case, the Court must be especially concerned with the \r\n  reliability of the juryâ€™s sentencing decision.  As we recognized when granting \r\n  another capital inmate resentencing upon a Butler petition, the United \r\n  States Supreme Court has held â€œ the qualitative difference between death and \r\n  other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability when the death sentence \r\n  is imposed.â€  Tucker v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 483, 552 S.E.2d 712 (2001) citing \r\n  Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 108 S.Ct. 546, 98 L.Ed. 2d 568 (1988) \r\n  (internal citations omitted).\r\nPetitioner points to the fact that a number of jurors, sua sponte, \r\n  raised the issue of parole eligibility during voir dire.  He also notes \r\n  that, despite the trial judgeâ€™s prophylactic â€˜plain and ordinary meaningâ€™ charge \r\n  during the initial sentencing phase instructions, the jury returned almost immediately \r\n  with a parole eligibility question.  Thus, the record establishes that petitionerâ€™s \r\n  jurors began their sentencing deliberations with a discussion of parole eligibility \r\n  despite being instructed that it was not to be a factor in their decision.\r\nThe majority holds that this Court already considered petitionerâ€™s \r\n  present claim, and denied it on direct appeal.  They characterize petitionerâ€™s \r\n  claim as a â€œconstitutional requirement that a parole eligible defendant receive \r\n  a parole eligibility instruction.â€  I agree that this was the Due Process claim \r\n  the Court considered and rejected on direct appeal, and I agree that petitioner \r\n  had no constitutional entitlement to such a charge.  I believe petitionerâ€™s \r\n  current claim is different:  Whether the denial of petitionerâ€™s jury charge \r\n  request denied him the fundamental fairness guaranteed by the Due Process Clause?  \r\n  I would hold that it did.\r\nThe majority goes on to hold that petitionerâ€™s claim is both factually \r\n  and legally distinguishable from Butler v. State.  I find the differences \r\n  unremarkable.\r\nIn Butler, the Court granted relief in part, because, after \r\n  Butlerâ€™s direct appeal had been decided, the Court issued several opinions holding \r\n  that a defendantâ€™s Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the trial judge \r\n  coerced the defendantâ€™s decision whether to testify.  Butler v. State, \r\n  supra.  Here, after petitionerâ€™s direct appeal had been decided, this \r\n  Court explicitly held that it was misconduct for a juror to fail to â€œrely solely \r\n  upon the Courtâ€™s instructions for the law.â€  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. \r\n  59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000).\r\nThe majority discounts the impact of the intervening Harris \r\n  decision on petitionerâ€™s claim, noting that â€œit has always been the law that \r\n  a jury must confine its consideration to the law as given by the trial judge.â€  \r\n  The majority finds further support for this long-standing truth in our standard \r\n  jury charge.  Thus, the majority distinguishes the facts upon which Horace Butler \r\n  received relief from those upon which petitioner bases his claim. \r\nThat a defendant could not, consistent with the State or Federal constitutions, \r\n  be coerced in deciding whether to testify at his criminal trial was well settled \r\n  before Butler was tried.  U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12; e.g., \r\n  State v. Gilbert, 273 S.C. 690, 258 S.E.2d 890 (1979).  In addition, \r\n  the standard jury instruction, charged to Butlerâ€™s jury, has since at least \r\n  1892 included language that no adverse inference may be drawn from a criminal \r\n  defendantâ€™s failure to testify.  State v. Howard, 35 S.C. 197, 14 S.E. \r\n  481 (1892).  \r\nIn my opinion, if this standard jury charge language did not negate the error \r\n  in Butlerâ€™s trial, then the standard jury instruction given in petitionerâ€™s \r\n  trial that â€˜the jury is to follow the lawâ€™ does not vitiate petitionerâ€™s claim.  \r\n  While it is speculative to assume that Butlerâ€™s jury disregarded this charge, \r\n  there can be no doubt that petitionerâ€™s jury disregarded its instructions.   \r\n  Further, while I recognize that the intervening jury misconduct decision in \r\n  State v. Harris, supra, did not represent a change in our law, \r\n  neither did the intervening decisions upon which the Court relied in granting \r\n  Butler relief.  Rather, in Butlerâ€™s case and in petitionerâ€™s case, the Courtâ€™s \r\n  intervening decisions identified particular acts as a violative of long-standing \r\n  principles of constitutional law.  Finally, it is somewhat misleading \r\n  for the majority to suggest that petitioner should, or could, have readily challenged \r\n  the juryâ€™s misconduct on direct appeal.  His attorneys lodged no such specific \r\n  objection to the juryâ€™s action, and thus no â€˜misconductâ€™ claim was preserved \r\n  for that appeal. [7]   E.g., State v. Dunbar, Â­Â­___ \r\n  S.C. ___, 587 S.E.2d 691 (2003) (issue must be raised and ruled upon to be preserved \r\n  for direct appeal).         \r\nIn addition to these â€˜unique and compelling circumstances,â€™  \r\n  [8]  petitioner also relies upon the General Assemblyâ€™s amendment of the \r\n  death penalty statute. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 2002).  The amended statute \r\n  provides that capital defendants are entitled to have their juries charged on \r\n  parole eligibility or ineligibility.  Trial judges must charge parole ineligibility \r\n  when requested by either the defendant or the State.  Â§ 16-3-20(A).  Further, \r\n  the statute now provides that â€œIn cases where the defendant is eligible for \r\n  parole, the judge must charge the applicable parole eligibility statute.â€  Id.  \r\n  As petitioner correctly points out, only individuals who committed a murder \r\n  before 1995 could be parole eligible. [9]   Petitioner contends that this \r\n  provision in the amended statute establishes that the legislature intended a \r\n  parole eligibility charge be given in cases where a pre-1996 capital murderer \r\n  is granted a resentencing after the amendmentâ€™s effective date.  See also \r\n  State v. Shafer, 352 S.C. 191, 573 S.E.2d 796 (2002) (Court indicated \r\n  Â§ 16-3-20 is to be given â€˜retroactiveâ€™ effect).  Upon retrial, petitioner has \r\n  the absolute right pursuant to Â§ 16-3-20(A) to request that his sentencing jury \r\n  be given accurate parole information.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nA Butler habeas corpus petition requires that this Court review \r\n  the merits of the petitionerâ€™s claim â€œin [its] setting.â€  While Butler \r\n  relief is not confined to those inmates under a sentence of death, the Court \r\n  must continue to be mindful when reviewing a claim that a capital sentencing \r\n  proceeding was â€˜fundamentally unfairâ€™ of the qualitative differences between \r\n  a death sentence and other criminal punishments, and of the greater degree of \r\n  reliability the Constitution requires before this sentence may be imposed.  \r\n  Lowenfield v. Phelps, supra;  Tucker v. Catoe, supra.  \r\n  I do not suggest that the Court should relax the Butler requirement that \r\n  â€œthe universal sense of justiceâ€ be shocked before the writ will issue, but \r\n  merely to emphasize that the setting of this petitionerâ€™s claim is a capital \r\n  sentencing proceeding.\r\nIn addition to this setting, petitionerâ€™s case involves incontrovertible \r\n  evidence of what we now know to be â€˜juror misconductâ€™:  the juryâ€™s injection \r\n  of parole eligibility into its deliberations in the face of a prophylactic â€˜plain \r\n  and ordinary meaningâ€™ charge.  Further, the General Assembly has now declared \r\n  that all capital sentencing juries shall, upon request, be charged accurate \r\n  parole eligibility information.  Petitioner has been unrelenting in seeking \r\n  just such a charge. \r\nOn direct appeal, the Court rejected petitionerâ€™s Due Process claim because \r\n  he was not entitled under that constitutional provision to the jury charge he \r\n  sought.  The question we are asked to decide now is different:  Whether the \r\n  denial of petitionerâ€™s jury charge request was, in the setting, fundamentally \r\n  unfair.  Because of â€œthe unique and compelling circumstances of this case,â€ \r\n  I would grant the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  To do otherwise would \r\n  result in an â€˜utter failure of our criminal justice system,â€™ which provides \r\n  for a Butler petition in order to permit this Court a final opportunity \r\n  to review the fundamental fairness of a criminal proceeding.\r\nI respectfully dissent.\r\nActing Justice G. Thomas \r\n  Cooper, Jr., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The Court relied on cases holding that where a capital defendant is parole \r\n    ineligible and his future dangerousness is at issue, due process requires \r\n    a charge on parole ineligibility.  See Simmons v. South Carolina, \r\n    512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994); State v. Tucker, \r\n    319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995) cert. denied 516 U.S. 1080, \r\n    116 S.Ct. 789, 133 L.Ed.2d 739 (1996); State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. \r\n    377, 447 S.E.2d 862 (1994), cert. denied 513 U.S. 1166, 115 \r\n    S.Ct. 1136, 130 L.Ed.2d 1096 (1995), overruled on other \r\n    grounds, State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995).   \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    At some point, Butlerâ€™s federal reviews were exhausted.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    See also standard language which appears in jury charges (â€œAs \r\n    the presiding judge, I am the sole judge of the law of this case, and it is \r\n    your duty as jurors to accept and apply the law as I now state it to you.  \r\n    If you already have any idea as to what the law is or what the law ought to \r\n    be and it does not agree with what I now tell you the law is, you must abandon \r\n    this idea because you are sworn to accept the law and apply the law exactly \r\n    as I state it to you.â€).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    Approximately eight years after petitionerâ€™s trial, the General Assembly amended \r\n    the capital sentencing statute to provide that the trial judge must charge \r\n    the applicable parole eligibility statute when requested by the defendant.  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 2002).  The amendment, generated after years \r\n    of legal debate concerning the relevance of parole ineligibility, does \r\n    not, under the circumstances presented here, constitute a denial of fundamental \r\n    fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  At the time of his capital trial, petitioner would \r\n    have been parole eligible after serving thirty years had his sentencing jury \r\n    found an aggravating circumstance, but returned a life sentence.  Following \r\n    this trial, however, petitioner pled guilty to a second murder and received \r\n    a thirty-year sentence.  This second conviction for a violent offense renders \r\n    petitioner parole ineligible.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. \r\n    2002).  As the result of this second plea, petitioner will not be eligible \r\n    for parole if his resentencing jury returns a life sentence.  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  I say this not to fault petitionerâ€™s trial attorneys.  \r\n    When the jury returned with their parole eligibility question almost immediately \r\n    after beginning deliberations, the attorneys used this question as the basis \r\n    for (yet again) seeking a parole charge.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  Petitionerâ€™s repeated requests for a parole eligibility \r\n    charge; a trial jury, with an overt interest in this issue, unable to accept \r\n    the judgeâ€™s instructions not to consider it; and our intervening juror misconduct \r\n    decision.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]   1995 Act No. 83 (possible sentences for murder \r\n    are death, life without the possibility of parole, or thirty year mandatory \r\n    minimum, also without the possibility of parole).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to Rules 4(f)(4) of Rule 413 and 502, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-01-23-01","description":"The Supreme Court corrects technical errors in Rule 4(f)(4) of Rules 413 and 502, SCACR.","date":"2004-01-27","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntitled Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina   \r\nRE: Amendments to \r\n  Rules 4(f)(4) of Rule 413 and 502, SCACR.\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n Two errors have been \r\n  found in the amendments to Rule 413 and 502 approved this last summer and effective \r\n  September 1.
