We reverse and remand\r\nthis matter for an evidentiary hearing. Further, for the benefit of the bench and the\r\nbar, we clarify the proper legal standard for claims involving juror misconduct.\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted for first-degree burglary and assault and battery with intent\r\nto kill. Petitioner's case was called to trial on June 14, 2005. During voir dire, at\r\ndefense counsel's request, the trial judge asked the potential jurors if they were\r\nrelated by blood or marriage to any person employed in the Seventh Circuit\r\nSolicitor's office. Seven potential jurors responded affirmatively; however, Juror\r\n84, who ultimately served on the final jury panel, did not respond or disclose that\r\nher cousin was married to the Seventh Circuit Solicitor. The defense exercised\r\nonly four of its ten peremptory strikes during the jury selection process. At the\r\nconclusion of his trial, Petitioner was convicted of both offenses.\r\n\r\nFollowing the dismissal of his direct appeal and first PCR application, Petitioner\r\nreviewed a fellow inmate's case in November 2009 and discovered the inmate's\r\ntrial took place the day after Petitioner's. The inmate's trial was before a different\r\ntrial judge but in the same courthouse. During voir dire for the inmate's trial, Juror\r\n84―the same juror who served on the final panel in Petitioner's trial―advised the\r\ncourt that her cousin was married to the Seventh Circuit Solicitor.\r\n\r\nA few days after making this discovery, Petitioner filed his second PCR\r\napplication, arguing he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by an\r\nimpartial and objective jury. In support of his claim, Petitioner submitted an\r\nexcerpt of the voir dire transcript wherein Juror 84 revealed her relationship to the\r\nSolicitor and a copy of defense counsel's requested voir dire from his own trial,\r\nwhich included the specific question to which Juror 84 failed to respond.\r\nPetitioner argued that Juror 84's concealment deprived him of information material\r\nto his intelligent use of peremptory challenges, which, in turn, deprived him of his\r\nconstitutional right to trial by an impartial jury. Petitioner averred that, if he had\r\nbeen aware of the juror's relationship to the Solicitor at trial, his use of peremptory\r\nchallenges would have been different. Petitioner further argued he could not have\r\npreviously raised this issue because the juror's concealment of her relationship to\r\n\nthe Solicitor, in and of itself, rendered the information unavailable to him until four\r\nyears after trial when he discovered the information in a fellow inmate's case file.\r\nAs noted, this occurred after both his direct appeal and first PCR application were\r\ndismissed. Petitioner further contended his claim fell within the \"discovery rule\"\r\nexception to the one-year limitation period and was therefore timely.\r\n\r\nThe State filed a motion to dismiss Petitioner's PCR application, arguing it was\r\nsuccessive and barred by the statute of limitations. Regarding successiveness, the\r\nState claimed Petitioner failed to present sufficient reason why he could not have\r\nraised the current allegations in his previous PCR application. Further, the State\r\ncontended the application was untimely because it was not filed within the one-\r\nyear limitation period applicable to PCR actions. The State also contended\r\nPetitioner's claim \"that he has discovered evidence that he was not tried by a fair\r\nand impartial jury lack[ed] merit\" because Petitioner failed to provide any\r\ncorroborating information or demonstrate how his allegations satisfied the five-\r\npronged test for newly discovered evidence.1\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge granted the State's motion for summary dismissal, finding\r\nPetitioner's claim was untimely because it was not filed within one year of trial.\r\nThe PCR judge also found Petitioner's claim was successive because it could have\r\nbeen raised in his first PCR application and failed to prove a claim based on newly\r\ndiscovered evidence. Specifically, the PCR judge found that, because Petitioner\r\nfailed to \"offer any detail as to how this information would have affected his trial\r\nhad it been known at that time, or how and when it was discovered,\" Petitioner\r\n\r\n1   See, e.g., Clark v. State, 315 S.C. 385, 434 S.E.2d 266 (1993). Clark provides:\r\n\r\n         To obtain a new trial based on after discovered evidence, the party\r\n         must show that the evidence:\r\n           (1) would probably change the result if a new trial is had;\r\n           (2) has been discovered since trial;\r\n           (3) could not have been discovered before trial;\r\n           (4) is material to the issue of guilt or innocence; and\r\n           (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.\r\n\r\nId. at 387-88, 434 S.E.2d at 267 (citing Hayden v. State, 278 S.C. 610, 299 S.E.2d\r\n854 (1983)).\r\n\nfailed to establish \"sufficient reason\" why the current allegations could not have\r\nbeen raised in his previous PCR application. We granted certiorari to review the\r\nPCR judge's summary dismissal of Petitioner's claim.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\n                                          A.\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues his second PCR application should not have been summarily\r\ndismissed and asks this Court to reverse and remand this matter for a hearing. We\r\nfind summary dismissal was error because genuine issues of material fact exist as\r\nto whether Petitioner's claim is successive or barred by the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nA PCR application ordinarily must be filed within one year after a conviction or, if\r\na direct appeal is taken, one year after the remittitur is sent to the trial court. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 17-27-45(A) (2003). However, section 17-27-45(C) provides that if a\r\nPCR applicant discovers \"material facts not previously presented and heard that\r\nrequire[] vacation of [his] conviction or sentence,\" he may file a PCR application\r\n\"within one year after the date of actual discovery . . . or after the date when the\r\nfacts could have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\"\r\n\r\nA PCR applicant must allege all available grounds for relief in his original\r\napplication; any ground not raised in the original application may not be the basis\r\nfor subsequent applications unless the court finds a ground for relief asserted\r\nwhich, for sufficient reason, was not raised in the original application. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 17-27-90.\r\n\r\n\"The [PCR] court may grant a motion by either party for summary disposition of\r\nthe [PCR] application when . . . there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\r\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 17-27-\r\n70(c). When considering the State's motion for summary dismissal, where no\r\nevidentiary hearing has been held, the PCR judge must assume facts presented by\r\nthe applicant are true and view those facts in the light most favorable to the\r\napplicant. Leamon v. State, 363 S.C. 432, 434, 611 S.E.2d 494, 495 (2005) (citing\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 17-27-80). Where an applicant alleges facts that would establish\r\nan exception to either the statute of limitations or the prohibition against successive\r\n\n PCR applications and those facts are not conclusively refuted by the record before\r\nthe PCR court, a question of fact is raised which can only be resolved by a hearing.\r\nCf. Delaney v. State, 269 S.C. 555, 556, 238 S.E.2d 679, 679 (1977).\r\n\r\nAs to the timeliness issue, we conclude the PCR judge misconstrued section 17-27-\r\n45(A) in finding Petitioner was required to file his claim within one year after his\r\ntrial, rather than one year after the remittitur was sent from his direct appeal. The\r\ntime limitation in § 17-27-45(A) provides that, where a defendant appeals his\r\nconviction (as Petitioner did), the one-year period begins the date the remittitur is\r\nsent by the appellate court—not the date of conviction. Further, the PCR judge\r\napparently overlooked the discovery rule in section 17-27-45(C), which allows one\r\nyear after the discovery of \"material facts not previously presented and heard that\r\nrequire[] vacation of the conviction or sentence\" to file a PCR application.\r\nPetitioner argued he did not discover the juror's misconduct until November 2009,\r\nand he promptly filed his second PCR application after making that discovery.\r\nBecause Petitioner's claim that he is entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule is\r\nnot conclusively refuted by the record, the PCR judge erred by summarily\r\ndismissing Petitioner's claim.\r\n\r\nWe also find a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether Petitioner's claim is\r\nsuccessive under section 17-27-90, which permits an applicant to file a subsequent\r\nPCR application only if the applicant demonstrates a sufficient reason why the\r\nclaims asserted therein were not asserted previously. Petitioner avers he has\r\ndemonstrated sufficient reason why his claim was not included in his first PCR\r\napplication in that the juror's misconduct was not discovered until after his first\r\nPCR application was dismissed. However, the State contends the juror's\r\nmisconduct could have been discovered earlier through the exercise of due\r\ndiligence and, therefore, Petitioner has failed to state a \"sufficient reason.\" Based\r\non this factual dispute, a hearing is necessary to resolve this critical issue.\r\n\r\nAlthough Petitioner's PCR claim may ultimately prove to be untimely, successive,\r\nor perhaps unsuccessful on the merits, the PCR judge erred in granting the State's\r\nmotion for summary dismissal because genuine issues of material fact exist as to\r\nwhether Petitioner's PCR claim is successive or untimely. See Leamon, 363 S.C. at\r\n434, 611 S.E.2d at 495 (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 17-27-70(b)-(c)) (noting summary\r\ndismissal of a PCR application without a hearing is appropriate only when it is\r\napparent on the face of the application that (1) there is no need for a hearing to\r\ndevelop any facts and (2) the applicant is not entitled to relief).\r\n\n                                          B.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the bench and bar, we address the frequent but erroneous\r\napplication of the standard newly discovered evidence framework in summarily\r\ndismissing PCR claims involving juror misconduct. Where a PCR applicant\r\nalleges juror misconduct, we reject application of the Clark five-pronged newly\r\ndiscovered evidence standard, as it does not lend itself to properly evaluating a\r\nclaim of juror misconduct. In addition, the Clark framework is not conducive for\r\ndetermining whether a PCR applicant is entitled to a hearing where intentional\r\njuror concealment is alleged.\r\n\r\nThe standard test governing newly discovered evidence is properly applied when\r\nrelief is sought based on evidence discovered post-trial that is material to the\r\naccused's guilt or innocence. See, e.g., State v. South, 310 S.C. 504, 507, 427\r\nS.E.2d 666, 668 (1993) (noting that to obtain a new trial based on newly\r\ndiscovered evidence, the evidence must be material to the issue of guilt or\r\ninnocence). However, juror misconduct discovered post-trial is not properly\r\nconsidered \"newly discovered evidence\"; rather, it is a separate basis for a new\r\ntrial. See, e.g., State v. Sheppard, 582 A.2d 116, 118 (Vt. 1990) (noting evidence\r\nof juror misconduct is not properly considered newly discovered evidence because\r\nit has no bearing on the issue of innocence or guilt and does not concern the\r\nsubstance of the State's case or an accused's defense).\r\n\r\nBecause juror misconduct is a separate basis for a new trial, it is governed by a\r\nseparate standard. Provided a claim is timely raised, a new trial is warranted on the\r\nbasis of juror misconduct if it is shown that (1) the juror intentionally concealed\r\ninformation; and (2) the information concealed would have supported a challenge\r\nfor cause or would have been a material factor in the use of the party's peremptory\r\nchallenges. See State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 587-89, 550 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001)\r\n(finding that a juror's intentional failure to disclose a relationship gives rise to an\r\ninference of bias and rejecting the State's argument that a new trial should be\r\nwarranted only where an individual shows he was prejudiced by the juror's failure\r\nto disclose information); State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 145-46, 502 S.E.2d 99, 106-\r\n07 (1998) (recognizing that trial judges and attorneys cannot fulfill their duty to\r\nscreen out biased jurors without accurate information and finding that the first\r\ninquiry in the juror disqualification analysis is whether the juror intentionally\r\nconcealed information during voir dire). Further, evaluating the merits of a juror\r\n\nmisconduct claim is a fact-intensive inquiry, which is most appropriately\r\nconducted after a hearing. See State v. Sparkman, 358 S.C. 491, 496, 596 S.E.2d\r\n375, 377 (2004) (\"Whether a juror's failure to respond [during voir dire] is\r\nintentional is a fact intensive determination that must be made on a case-by-case\r\nbasis.\").\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the context of PCR allegations involving juror misconduct, the\r\nstandard five-pronged newly discovered evidence test, as set forth in Clark, has no\r\napplication and should not be used as the basis for summary dismissal. Rather,\r\njuror concealment claims are governed by the analysis set forth in Woods, and such\r\ncase-by-case determinations are most appropriately made after a hearing, which\r\nallows the factual circumstances to be more fully developed.\r\n\r\n                                        III.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we find the PCR judge erred in summarily dismissing\r\nPetitioner's application because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether\r\nhis claim is successive or time-barred. Thus, we reverse the dismissal of\r\nPetitioner's second PCR application and remand the matter for a hearing. If, upon\r\nremand, the court determines Petitioner's claim is not untimely or successive, the\r\ncourt shall consider the merits of the second PCR application.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27215","title":"Hampton Friends v.

Appellant Hampton Friends of the Arts is a\r\nnon-profit eleemosynary corporation whose main purpose is to promote the arts in\r\nHampton County, South Carolina. Appellant challenges the Administrative Law\r\n\nCourt's (ALC) finding that real property it acquired in March 2008 was subject to\r\n2008 property taxes because the property was subject to taxes on December 31,\r\n2007. Appellant contends that, as a non-profit corporation, it was entitled to a\r\nproperty tax exemption for the 2008 tax year. We disagree and affirm the ALC.\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\nIn March 2008, Appellant purchased real property in Hampton County. It is\r\nundisputed that prior to Appellant's purchase, the property was subject to property\r\ntaxes on December 31, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe seller, which owned the property on December 31, 2007, paid only a pro-rata\r\nportion of the 2008 property taxes, although it was statutorily responsible for all of\r\nthe 2008 taxes. Appellant received a letter from the Hampton County\r\nAdministrator in June 2009 which erroneously informed Appellant that it was\r\nresponsible for the 2008 property taxes. Appellant, believing it was responsible for\r\na portion of the 2008 taxes, sought an exemption as a non-profit corporation.1 The\r\nDepartment of Revenue (DOR) denied an exemption for the 2008 property taxes,\r\nbut approved an exemption for the 2009 property taxes and subsequent years. At\r\nsome point in the process, Appellant tendered to Hampton County under protest\r\nwhat it believed was its pro-rata share of the property taxes and penalties for the\r\n2008 tax year.\r\n\r\nIn response to Appellant's protest, DOR issued a final agency determination\r\nfinding that the property was not exempt from ad valorem property taxes for the\r\n2008 tax year. DOR explained that the tax status of property is determined by the\r\nstatus of the owner of record as of December 31st of the preceding year. Because\r\nthe property was owned by a non-exempt entity and therefore was subject to\r\ntaxation on December 31, 2007, DOR determined the property was not exempt\r\nfrom the 2008 property taxes.\r\n\r\nAppellant appealed DOR's determination to the ALC.2 The ALC affirmed DOR's\r\ndetermination that Appellant was not entitled to an exemption for its portion of the\r\n2008 property taxes. The ALC concluded the pertinent date for determining\r\n1Section 12-37-220(A)(4) of the South Carolina Code states that \"all property of\r\nall charitable trusts and foundations used exclusively for charitable and public\r\npurposes\" is exempt from ad valorem taxation.\r\n2   Hampton County was not made a party to this action.\r\n\nwhether a property may be taxed is December 31st of the previous year.\r\nAdditionally, the ALC held that the owner of the property as of December 31,\r\n2007, was statutorily liable for the ad valorem property taxes for the 2008 year.\r\nThus, the ALC held Appellant was not statutorily liable for the 2008 property\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is now before this Court. A reviewing court may reverse the decision\r\nof the ALC where it is in violation of a statutory provision or it is affected by an\r\nerror of law. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B)(a), (d) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\nAppellant contends that if property is acquired by a non-profit corporation prior to\r\nad valorem taxes actually being levied, the property is exempt from that tax year.\r\nThus, Appellant avers that, because it acquired the property prior to the tax levy for\r\nthe 2008 tax year, the property became exempt and no tax is owed. We disagree,\r\nfor the law is clear that property tax liability is determined as of December 31st of\r\nthe preceding year, regardless of a subsequent transfer to an exempt corporation or\r\nwhen the tax was actually levied.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina statutory scheme generally determines tax liability on property\r\nowned as of December 31st of the preceding year. See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-37-\r\n610 (2000) (stating each person is liable to pay taxes and assessments on real\r\nproperty that he owns as of December 31st of the year preceding the tax year); S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 12-37-900 (requiring taxpayers to deliver to the county a statement of\r\nall real estate possessed or controlled on December 31st of the previous year); S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 12-49-20 (providing a lien shall attach to real property on December\r\n31st of the previous year for taxes to be paid during the ensuing year); see also\r\nLindsey v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 302 S.C. 274, 275, 395 S.E.2d 184, 186 n.1 (1990)\r\n(\"The pertinent date to determine the value of property for a given tax year is\r\nDecember 31st of the preceding year.\"). Thus, we find the statute's plain language\r\nends the inquiry. See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n(2000) (\"Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the court's place to change the\r\nmeaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.\").\r\n\r\nAppellant's reliance on Town of Myrtle Beach v. Holliday is misplaced. 203 S.C.\r\n25, 26 S.E.2d 12 (1943). In Holliday, the Horry County tax collector\r\nunsuccessfully sought to assess property taxes against real and personal property\r\nacquired by the town of Myrtle Beach. Holliday is limited to governmental\r\nacquisitions. Id. at 14 (holding that taxes assessed against property for the year in\r\n\nwhich it is acquired by a political subdivision of the state and being used for public\r\npurposes cease to be collectible). Furthermore, we reject any suggestion that\r\nHolliday's reach extends beyond government entities to include private, non-profit\r\ncorporations. See id. (noting exemptions of the property of municipal corporations\r\nare liberally construed because it has never been the policy of this state to tax its\r\nown agencies and instrumentalities of government).\r\n\r\nWe further note that in 1999, the legislature amended section 12-37-220 to add\r\nsubsection (D), which mandates that when a church acquires property, such\r\nproperty immediately becomes exempt from taxation. Thus, subsection (D) grants\r\nchurches the very exemption Appellant now seeks. If Holliday had the expansive\r\nreach Appellant urges, then there would have been no need for the legislature to\r\nenact subsection (D). Thus, we reject Appellant's expansive interpretation of\r\nHolliday. See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 86, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000)\r\n(stating \"[t]he canon of construction 'expressio unius est exclusion alterius' or\r\n'inclusio unius est exclusion alterius' holds that 'to express or include one thing\r\nimplies the exclusion of another, or of the alternative[]'\" (quoting Black's Law\r\nDictionary 602 (7th ed. 1999))).\r\n\r\nPursuant to settled law, the 2008 tax status of the Hampton County property was\r\ndetermined on December 31, 2007. Because the property was subject to property\r\ntaxes as of December 31, 2007, the property is subject to 2008 property taxes. We\r\ntherefore affirm the ALC.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Appellant alternatively seeks a refund of the 2008 taxes it paid to Hampton\r\nCounty because it was not the owner of the property as of December 31, 2007.\r\nAlthough the ALC correctly held, and the parties have stipulated, that Appellant\r\nwas not statutorily responsible for the 2008 property taxes, Appellant's basis for\r\nprotesting its tax liability was an exemption as a non-profit, not an assertion\r\nregarding lack of ownership as of December 31, 2007. Thus, we find the issue of\r\nAppellant's entitlement to a refund based upon lack of ownership is not preserved\r\nfor appellate review. See Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 348 S.C.\r\n507, 519, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002) (noting an appellate court may not consider\r\nissues not raised to and ruled upon by the ALC). Accordingly, we do not reach\r\nthis issue. We emphasize, however, that our refusal to address the refund issue is\r\nwithout prejudice to whatever rights Appellant may have, if any, to seek relief in\r\nconnection with the 2008 taxes paid to Hampton County.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27216","title":"SunTrust Bank v.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of an admonition, public reprimand, or definite suspension not to\r\nexceed sixty (60) days. Respondent further agrees to pay the costs incurred by\r\nODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) in the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of this matter within thirty (30) days of the\r\nimposition of a sanction and to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program\r\nEthics School within one (1) year of the imposition of a sanction. We accept the\r\nAgreement and issue a public reprimand. In addition, within thirty (30) days of the\r\ndate of this opinion respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the\r\nCommission in the investigation and prosecution of this matter and, within one (1)\r\nyear of the date of this opinion, shall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\nRespondent's Client is a financial services and equipment leasing company.\r\nClient's customers, Borrowers, agreed to provide a collateral mortgage against real\r\nestate owned in connection with an equipment lease transaction. On January 16,\r\n2008, Client retained respondent to 1) provide a title search on the real property\r\nshowing all encumbrances, liens, and outstanding taxes and 2) record the\r\nmortgage. Respondent recorded the mortgage and conditional assignment of leases\r\nand rents on January 24, 2008. He then sent the recorded documents to Client as\r\nwell as an email to Client stating, \"[t]he title was updated by our office. No liens\r\nor other encumbrances.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the property later went into foreclosure, Client learned there were several\r\nsenior liens on the property. Specifically, there were converted judgments against\r\none of the two Borrowers in the amounts of $2,646.05, $3,616.05, and $11,747.91.\r\nOn September 1, 2009, Client contacted respondent requesting a copy of the title\r\nreport. Respondent responded that he would send a copy to Client as soon as\r\npossible. Client made additional requests on September 14, 2009, and September\r\n21, 2009. In a responsive email, respondent stated: \"I can tell you that we filed\r\nand recorded a mortgage on January 24th, 2008. Title was clear at that time.\"\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that he did not perform a title search of the property and did not\r\nprepare a title report. Client foreclosed on Borrowers' property and purchased the\r\nproperty at a foreclosure sale. After purchasing the property, the payoffs on the\r\njudgments were $4,311.55, $4,015.70, and $14,870.20. Client filed suit against\r\nrespondent. The suit settled.\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges he did not fully perform the services he was hired to\r\nperform and that his communications to Client were inaccurate and misleading.\r\nHe maintains, however, that he never intended to mislead Client. His recollection\r\nis that, because Client and the Borrowers were anxious to conclude the transaction,\r\nhe was instructed by Client's employee, who served as his contact, that a title\r\nsearch, though originally ordered, was no longer needed. Respondent\r\nacknowledges that Client's employee does not share his recollection. Despite his\r\nunderstanding that a title search was no longer needed, respondent submits he took\r\naction to confirm that the Borrowers owned the property. He further represents\r\nthat he had someone performing services at the county register of mesne\r\nconveyances to confirm that Borrowers owned the property. He reports that same\r\nperson, whose name he cannot recall, also told him the lien book showed no\r\n\nencumbrances against the property. Finally, after foreclosure commenced and\r\nClient requested a copy of the title report, respondent admits he did not consult his\r\nfile before reporting that the title was clear at the time he submitted the mortgage\r\nfor recording.\r\n\r\nRespondent further admits he overbilled his Client by $10.00 for filing fees.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rules 1.2 (lawyer shall\r\nabide by client's decisions concerning objectives of representation and shall consult\r\nwith the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (lawyer\r\nshall act with reasonable diligence in representing client); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall\r\nnot charge unreasonable amount for expenses); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\nmisrepresentation).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion respondent shall pay the costs\r\nincurred by ODC and the Commission in the investigation and prosecution of this\r\nmatter and, within one (1) year of the date of this opinion, complete the Legal\r\nEthics and Practice Program Ethics School. Respondent shall provide the\r\nCommission with certification of his completion of the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School no later than ten (10) days after the conclusion of the\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27218","title":"In the Matter of Michael DuPree","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27218.pdf","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspends a lawyer.","date":"2013-02-13","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n            In the Matter of P.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a definite suspension ranging from nine (9) months to one (1)\r\nyear. He requests the suspension be made retroactive to April 18, 2012, the date of\r\nhis interim suspension. In the Matter of Dupree, 398 S.C. 111, 727 S.E.2d 739\r\n(2012). Respondent also agrees to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and\r\nprosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the\r\nCommission) within thirty (30) days of the imposition of a sanction and, further, to\r\ncomplete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School within six (6)\r\nmonths of the imposition of a sanction, to comply with the terms of his two (2)\r\n\nyear monitoring contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers,1 and to insure quarterly\r\nreports from his treating physician regarding his diagnosis, treatment compliance,\r\nand prognosis are filed with the Commission for two (2) years. We accept the\r\nAgreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for nine\r\n(9) months, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, with conditions as\r\nstated hereafter in this opinion. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as\r\nfollows.                               Facts\r\n\r\nWhile vacationing in Utah, respondent was a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled\r\nover by law enforcement on March 22, 2012. Utah Highway Patrol Trooper David\r\nWurtz asked the driver for his license, vehicle registration, proof of insurance, and\r\nother information. Trooper Wurtz began to ask the driver about whether he had\r\nbeen drinking. Respondent repeatedly interrupted and told the driver not to answer\r\nthe trooper's questions. Respondent told Trooper Wurtz he was a lawyer and that\r\nthe driver did not have to do what the trooper asked.\r\n\r\nTrooper Wurtz called for backup and other troopers arrived on the scene. When\r\nTrooper Wurtz requested the driver exit the vehicle, respondent, who was\r\nobviously intoxicated, became belligerent, repeatedly used profanity, and refused\r\nto cooperate with the troopers' requests to calm down. Respondent again reminded\r\nthe troopers he was a lawyer. When the troopers told respondent to stay in the\r\nvehicle, he tried to get out. A few minutes later, when the troopers asked\r\nrespondent to get out of the vehicle so it could be towed, respondent refused and\r\nlocked the vehicle doors every time the troopers unlocked the doors. Respondent\r\ncontinued to berate the troopers and call them derogatory names.\r\n\r\nThe troopers were required to use force to remove respondent from the vehicle.\r\nOne of the troopers deployed his TASER, but it did not function properly. When\r\nthe troopers managed to remove respondent from the vehicle, respondent attacked\r\nthe troopers. During the attack, respondent struck Trooper Wurtz in the mouth and\r\nbit him on the arm. Eventually, respondent was subdued and taken into custody.\r\nHe was arrested and charged with two counts of assault on a police officer,\r\ndisorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and public intoxication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On April 20, 2012, respondent executed a two year monitoring contract with\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nLawyers Helping Lawyers.\r\n\nOn September 12, 2012, respondent, through counsel, pled guilty to two counts of\r\nassault, one count of interference with a peace officer making a lawful arrest, and\r\none count of failure to disclose identity, all misdemeanors. The pleas were entered\r\nnunc pro tunc to March 22, 2012, the date of respondent's arrest. Respondent was\r\nsentenced to one hundred and eighty (180) days on each charge, concurrent. The\r\nsentences were stayed and respondent was placed on probation for six (6) months\r\nunder the following conditions: maintaining good behavior and no violation of any\r\nlaws, payment of a $1,500.00 fine, payment of $840.52 to the Utah Worker's\r\nCompensation Fund, receipt of a substance abuse evaluation and completion of all\r\nrecommended treatment, delivery of two letters of apology, one to Trooper Wurtz\r\nand one to another trooper, and service of one (1) day in the Summit County Jail\r\nwith credit for one (1) day previously served. On September 17, 2012, the Third\r\nDistrict Court in and for Summit County, Utah, found the conditions had been\r\nsatisfied.                             Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provision of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(b) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to commit criminal act that reflects adversely\r\non lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute\r\nadministration of justice or to bring courts or legal profession into disrepute or\r\nconduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to violate oath of office taken to practice law in\r\nthis state and contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR).\r\n\r\n                                   Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe Court has viewed the dash camera video recording of the vehicle stop and\r\nrespondent's ensuing response. Given respondent's repeated use of profanity and\r\nhis combative, hostile, and belligerent attitude, we find the troopers exercised\r\nextreme restraint in their treatment of respondent. Respondent's criminal acts and\r\nhis complete disrespect for law enforcement warrant a suspension from the practice\r\nof law.\r\n\nThis situation underscores the negative affect of alcohol on good judgment. At\r\noral argument, respondent testified he began drinking alcohol on the morning of\r\nthe incident and \"drank to oblivion.\" 2 We emphasize alcohol use does not excuse\r\nor mitigate respondent's misconduct.\r\n\r\nHowever, respondent is contrite and appears earnestly determined to overcome his\r\nalcoholism. Prior to his interim suspension, respondent voluntarily entered into an\r\nintensive outpatient therapy program at the Medical University of South Carolina,\r\ncontacted lawyers to serve as personal mentors, and began attending Alcoholics\r\nAnonymous. Respondent sought counseling from his minster and a therapist.\r\nRespondent contacted Lawyers Helping Lawyers, entered into a monitoring\r\ncontract, and has willingly \"told his story\" to other lawyers at the request of\r\nLawyers Helping Lawyers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend\r\nrespondent from the practice of law in this state for nine (9) months, retroactive to\r\nApril 18, 2012, the date of his interim suspension. Respondent shall pay the costs\r\nincurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\nCommission within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion and shall complete\r\nthe Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School within six (6) months of the\r\ndate of this opinion. Further, respondent shall comply with the terms of his two (2)\r\nyear monitoring contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers and shall insure that\r\nquarterly reports from his treating physician regarding his diagnosis, treatment\r\ncompliance, and prognosis are filed with the Commission for two (2) years.\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\nwith the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\nPLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Court requested the parties appear for oral argument.\r\n2\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27219","title":"Mendenall v.

Hines, both of\r\n           Charleston, for Defendants.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: We certified the following question from the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of South Carolina:\r\n\n      Does the \"dual persona\" doctrine allow an injured employee to bring\r\n      an action in tort against his employer as a successor in interest who,\r\n      through a corporate merger, received all liabilities of a predecessor\r\n      corporation that never employed the injured person but allegedly\r\n      performed the negligent acts that later caused the employee's injuries,\r\n      or is such action barred by the exclusivity provision of the South\r\n      Carolina Workers' Compensation Act?\r\n\r\nWe answer this question only insofar as acknowledging that South Carolina\r\nrecognizes the dual persona doctrine. However, we do not decide whether the dual\r\npersona doctrine is applicable to this case, as that determination is one properly\r\nmade by the United States District Court. I.\r\n\r\nWalterboro Veneer, Inc., (Walterboro) was a South Carolina corporation that\r\nowned and operated a wood product manufacturing plant in Colleton County. It\r\nappears that in 2003, Walterboro designed and constructed a cement vat, \"Vat #3,\"\r\nfor the purpose of soaking hardwood logs in a highly heated solution prior to\r\nmilling. Thereafter, through a series of mergers, Anderson Hardwood Floors,\r\nLLC, (Anderson) became the surviving entity, assuming all liabilities.1 As a result\r\nof these mergers, the former physical plant and operation of Walterboro continued\r\nunder the Anderson name.\r\n\r\nIn January 2008, Everette Mendenall was hired to work at the Colleton County\r\nplant formerly owned and operated by Walterboro. Tragically, four months into\r\nhis employment, Mendenall fell into Vat #3 while he was attempting to access a\r\nsteam leak for repairs. The solution in the vat was heated to approximately 193\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit and severely burned ninety percent of Mendenall's body, which\r\neventually resulted in his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 33-11-106(a)(1) (2006), when a merger takes\r\neffect, \"every other corporation party to the merger merges into the surviving entity\r\nand the separate existence of every corporation except the surviving entity ceases.\"\r\nThe surviving entity has all liabilities of each corporation party to the merger\r\n(including potential lawsuit liability) and the surviving entity may be substituted in\r\nthe proceeding for the corporation whose existence ceased. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n33-11-106(a)(3).\r\n\nBecause Mendenall was injured and ultimately died from the work-related injury,\r\nhe received workers' compensation benefits. Mendenall's wife (Plaintiff), as\r\npersonal representative of her husband's estate, filed a complaint in state court\r\nalleging wrongful death and survival actions against Walterboro, Anderson, and\r\nthe previously existing corporate entities (collectively \"Defendants\"). Essentially,\r\nPlaintiff alleged that Mendenall's fall was the result of Vat #3's faulty design and\r\nconstruction; the failure to warn of Vat #3's dangerous conditions; and the\r\nnegligent maintenance of Vat #3 after notice of its hazardous conditions.\r\n\r\nDefendants removed the case to federal court in May 2011 and subsequently\r\nmoved to dismiss the case, arguing they were immune under the South Carolina\r\nWorkers' Compensation Act (the Act).2 Each defendant sought dismissal based on\r\nthe Act's exclusivity provision.3\r\n\r\nPlaintiff opposed dismissal, arguing injured employees are not barred from filing\r\ncivil actions against third parties. Thus, since Mendenall was never employed by\r\nWalterboro, Plaintiff argued Walterboro's inchoate liability for defectively\r\ndesigning and constructing Vat #3 did not derive from any employment\r\nrelationship. Rather, according to Plaintiff, Walterboro's liability arose\r\nindependently as a third party and passed to Anderson through the series of\r\nmergers. Therefore, based on the \"dual persona\" doctrine, Plaintiff contended\r\nAnderson should be liable for the allegedly tortious acts of its predecessors\r\nbecause of its dual persona, both as Mendenall's employer and as the successor in\r\ninterest to the third-party liabilities of Walterboro.\r\n\r\nThe federal district court certified the above question for our consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 42-1-10 to -19-50 (Supp. 2012).\r\n3   The Act's exclusivity provision states:\r\n\r\n         The rights and remedies granted by this Title to an employee . . . shall\r\n         exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal\r\n         representative, parents, dependents or next of kin as against his\r\n         employer, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury,\r\n         loss of service or death.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-540.\r\n\n                                        II. \n\r\n\r\nThe Act is a comprehensive scheme created \"to provide compensation to\r\nemployees injured by accidents arising out of and in the course of their\r\nemployment.\" Parker v. Williams & Madjanik, Inc., 275 S.C. 65, 69—70, 267\r\nS.E.2d 524, 526 (1980). The concept of workers' compensation is \"founded upon\r\nrecognition of the advisability, from the standpoint of society as well as of\r\nemployer and employee, of discarding the common law idea of tort liability in the\r\nemployer-employee relationship and of substituting therefor the principle of\r\nliability on the part of the employer, regardless of fault, to compensate the\r\nemployee, in predetermined amounts based upon his wages, for loss of earnings\r\nresulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\"\r\nId. (quoting Case v. Hermitage Cotton Mills, 236 S.C. 515, 530—531, 115 S.E.2d\r\n57, 66 (1960)). \"The employee receives the right to swift and sure compensation;\r\nthe employer receives immunity from tort actions by the employee.\" Id. \"This\r\nquid pro quo approach to [workers'] compensation has worked to the advantage of\r\nsociety as well as the employee and the employer.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, section 42-1-540 of the Act is an exclusivity provision,\r\ndisallowing tort suits against the employer and limiting the injured employee's\r\nrights and remedies to those provided by the Act. However, by its terms, the\r\nexclusive remedy provision of the Act limits the employee's remedy \"as against his\r\nemployer.\" Thus, where the injury is due to a third party's negligence, a plaintiff\r\ncan collect workers' compensation benefits and sue the third party responsible for\r\ncausing the injuries. Yet, some jurisdictions recognize narrow exceptions which\r\npermit an employer to be sued in tort.\r\n\r\nThese recognized exceptions are premised on the notion that the employee is not\r\nsuing his employer, but rather a separate legal entity that allegedly caused his\r\ninjury. See Tatum v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 346 S.C. 194, 205, 552 S.E.2d 18, 24\r\n(2001). These doctrines are the \"dual capacity\" doctrine and the related \"dual\r\npersona\" doctrine. \"Under the 'dual capacity' doctrine, an employer becomes\r\nvulnerable to suit as a third party 'if he occupies, in addition to his capacity as\r\nemployer, a second capacity that confers on him obligations independent to those\r\nimposed on him as employer.'\" Id. at 203, 552 S.E.2d at 23 (quoting 2A Larson\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Law § 72:80 (1976)). Under the dual persona doctrine,\r\n\"[a]n employer may become a third person, vulnerable to tort suit by an employee,\r\nif—and only if—it possesses a second persona so completely independent from\r\nand unrelated to its status as employer that by established standards the law\r\n\nrecognizes that persona as a separate legal person.\" 6 Larson's Workers'\r\nCompensation Law § 113.01[1] (Matthew Bender, Rev. Ed. 2012). \"While the\r\n'dual persona' doctrine recognizes different identities, the 'dual capacity' doctrine\r\nrecognizes different activities or relationships.\" Tatum, 346 S.C. at 203, 552\r\nS.E.2d at 23 (noting Larson disfavors the dual capacity doctrine but suggests the\r\ndual persona doctrine is more favorable). This Court has considered and rejected\r\nthe dual capacity doctrine. Johnson v. Rental Uniform Serv. of Greenville, 316\r\nS.C. 70, 70, 447 S.E.2d 184, 185 (1994). However, this Court has neither accepted\r\nnor rejected the dual persona doctrine.4 Today, we accept the dual persona\r\ndoctrine as an exception to the Act's exclusivity provision.\r\n\r\nThe dual persona doctrine is a narrow exception, applicable only where the second\r\nset of obligations that forms the basis of the tort suit is entirely independent of the\r\ndefendant's obligations as an employer. See Larson, supra, § 113.01[4]. Where\r\nthose sets of obligations are intertwined such that they cannot be logically\r\nseparated, application of the dual persona doctrine is inappropriate. See id.\r\nProfessor Larson explains:\r\n\r\n      If the dual persona doctrine is to apply, it must be possible to say that\r\n      the duty arose solely from the nonemployer persona . . . . For only in\r\n      such a case can the second persona be really distinct from the\r\n      employer persona. In other words, it is not enough . . . that the second\r\n      persona impose additional duties. They must be totally separate from\r\n      and unrelated to those of the employment.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nThe dual persona doctrine will apply only in truly exceptional situations. See, e.g.,\r\nHerbolsheimer v. SMS Holding Co., 608 N.W.2d 487, 493 (Mich. Ct. App. 2000)\r\n(\"These exceptional situations are found only where there is a genuine case of a\r\nseparate legal personality and the relationship between the cause of action and the\r\n\r\n4This Court discussed the dual persona doctrine in Tatum v. Medical University of\r\nSouth Carolina, 346 S.C. 194, 552 S.E.2d 18 (2001). However, this Court did not\r\naccept or reject the dual persona doctrine in Tatum because a majority of the Court\r\nfound that, in any event, the dual persona doctrine was inapplicable to the facts\r\npresented. Id. at 206, 552 S.E.2d at 24. Although the Tatum majority's discussion\r\nof the dual persona doctrine is correct, its application of the law to the facts of that\r\ncase was erroneous.\r\n\nplaintiff's employment is no more than incidental.\"). We agree with analytical\r\nframework and reasoning of the Herbolsheimer court, which stated:\r\n\r\n      We are unprepared to . . . assume that a predecessor company in our\r\n      case is automatically a third party that can be sued through the\r\n      successor company that happens to also be the employer. . . . Instead,\r\n      we must look to see if there are separate obligations created by the\r\n      predecessor that can form the basis of the dual-persona suit. Simply\r\n      being a successor in liability does not make a company liable—there\r\n      must be an allegedly viable legal claim against the predecessor in\r\n      order for the case to survive a motion for summary disposition.\r\n\r\nId. at 496 (emphasis added). We further agree with the proposition that \"if the\r\nplaintiff[s] could not have sued the predecessor in tort if the merger had not\r\noccurred, they cannot sue the [successor] in tort.\" Van Doren v. Coe Press Equip.\r\nCorp., 592 F. Supp. 2d 776, 801 (E.D. Pa. 2008). \"This rationale is based on the\r\nidea that the dual persona doctrine should not be applied to allow 'a merger to\r\nincrease, rather than preserve, inchoate liability.'\" Id. (quoting Braga v. Genlyte\r\nGroup, Inc., 420 F.3d 35, 44—45 (1st Cir. 2005)).\r\n\r\nWe emphasize that, under South Carolina law, whether the dual persona doctrine\r\napplies in a particular case turns on whether the duty claimed to have been\r\nbreached is distinct from those duties owed by virtue of the employer's persona as\r\nsuch. In this case, that determination lies with the federal court.\r\n\r\n                                        III.\r\n\r\nWe find South Carolina recognizes the dual persona doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27220","title":"State v.

Her\r\ndeath was the result of asphyxiation. The State sought the death penalty against\r\nAppellant based on a prior murder conviction. It is stipulated that Appellant was\r\ncompetent to stand trial.\r\n\r\nThe State presented overwhelming evidence of Appellant's guilt. At the close of\r\nthe State's case, the trial court properly informed Appellant of his right to testify or\r\nnot to testify. Appellant elected to testify, yet counsel refused to call him to the\r\nstand. Despite Appellant's persistence, the trial court acquiesced in counsel's\r\ndecision and refused to allow Appellant to testify. Appellant was convicted of\r\nmurder and ultimately sentenced to death.  II.\r\n\r\n                                           A.\r\n\r\n                    The Colloquy and the Trial Court's Ruling\r\n\r\nOn appeal Appellant presents a host of challenges. Because we believe the trial\r\ncourt erred in refusing to allow Appellant to testify and that such error is structural,\r\nwe reluctantly reverse Appellant's murder conviction and death sentence and\r\nremand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the trial court's questioning of Appellant at the close of the State's\r\ncase: The Court: We have now reached or are approaching the stage in the\r\n           trial where you may present your defense. You have the right\r\n           to claim the protections given to you by the Fifth Amendment\r\n           to the Constitution of the United States. This amendment states\r\n           in pertinent part, no person shall be compelled in any criminal\r\n           case to be a witness against themselves. Do you understand\r\n           this?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: This means that you cannot be required to testify in this\r\n\n       case. You have the right to testify on your own behalf;\r\n       however, no one can make you testify. This is a personal right,\r\n       and no one can waive this right except you. Do you understand\r\n       this?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nThe Court: If you decide to testify, this decision on your part must be\r\n     freely, voluntarily and intelligently made with knowledge of the\r\n     protections given to you by the Fifth Amendment and the\r\n     consequences of your decision to testify. Do you understand\r\n     that?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Court: If you decide not to testify, I will instruct the jurors that\r\n     they cannot give the fact that you did not testify any\r\n     consideration whatsoever and that there is to be absolutely no\r\n     prejudices to you because you did not testify. It is left entirely\r\n     up to you whether or not to testify. Do you understand?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Court: You may talk with your attorney or anyone else about\r\n     this, but it will be your final decision—or the final decision will\r\n     be left entirely up to you. Do you understand that?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Do you understand what I've explained to you?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Do you have any questions about what I've explained to\r\n     you?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: No, sir.\r\n\nThe Court: Have you discussed with your lawyer whether you should\r\n     testify or not?\r\n\r\n[Guardian ad Litem]: Excuse me, Your Honor. He just asked if we\r\n     could have a small break. He needs to go to the restroom and\r\n     he would like to ask a couple of questions of us.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Certainly. All right. We'll take a short break. When\r\n     you're ready to return, of course, let me know.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nThe Court: Is the [Appellant] ready to proceed?\r\n\r\n[Guardian ad Litem]: He is, Your Honor. He had a couple questions\r\n     and we've answered them, and he wishes to proceed on to finish\r\n     answering the questions.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Very good. . . . Have you discussed with your lawyer\r\n     whether you should or you should not testify?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Do you wish to testify?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Court: You do wish to testify?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n[Guardian ad Litem]: Thank you, Your Honor. In discussions with\r\n     [Appellant], he has indicated to me that apparently he does wish\r\n     to testify, but he would like to do so after lunch if he could. His\r\n     lunch is being delivered to him.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Very well.\r\n\n....\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, [Appellant] has indicated to the\r\n      Court that he wishes to take the stand on his own behalf. That\r\n      is something [Co-Counsel] and I have explained to him on\r\n      innumerable occasions was not in his best interest. This is the\r\n      same scheme of things that occurred in the Asha Wiley case,\r\n      exactly the same thing. Your Honor, I would like to be able to\r\n      tell the Court as an officer of the Court—and I do so with full\r\n      knowledge of the Court's responsibilities—[Co-Counsel] and I\r\n      will refuse to call him to the stand.\r\n\r\n       If the Court wishes to call him under Rule 614, the\r\n       extraordinary circumstances that 614 notices, that obviously\r\n       would be the Court's option. [Co-Counsel] and I, however, feel\r\n       that under our constitutional oath as his attorneys, we cannot\r\n       put him on the stand without him harming his case so\r\n       irreparably as to void any meaningful consideration to guilt or\r\n       innocence in this matter.\r\n\r\n       . . . But if that is [Appellant's] wish, we will respectfully and\r\n       honorably decline the opportunity to call him.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nThe Court: All right. I'm going to go along—inasmuch as\r\n     [Appellant] has to consider these matters over lunch, I'm going\r\n     to have the other matter to consider, whether or not I will\r\n     exercise under the appropriate rule to call him as the Court's\r\n     witness. All right. So you have three things to consider now.\r\n     So any questions, [Appellant]?\r\n\r\n[Appellant]: (No response)\r\n\r\nThe Court: All right. Let me restate the three things you need to\r\n     consider. One is whether you wish to testify as a witness.\r\n     Two, whether you wish to give the final argument after the case\r\n     is closed. And three, knowing that your attorneys would\r\n\n            decline to call you as a witness, whether you want the Court to\r\n            call you as a witness. Those are the three things that you need\r\n            to consider. Any questions?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: No, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: Very good. I'll see you after lunch.\r\n\r\n(R. 2186-95).\r\n\r\nFollowing the lunch recess, the trial proceedings continued as follows:\r\n\r\n      [Defense Counsel]: Judge, if I could just briefly—we talked briefly at\r\n            the bench about my request for a continuance to get a\r\n            psychiatrist here to determine the competency of [Appellant] to\r\n            make this decision [about whether to testify]. I concede to the\r\n            Court that we don't have a case in the country that says we're\r\n            allowed to do that, but this is a rather unique situation that I\r\n            would make that request. In the alternative I would request that\r\n            the Court have [Appellant] proffer his testimony to make sure\r\n            that it's not going to be the kind of testimony that would erode\r\n            the integrity of these proceedings.\r\n\r\n      The Court: I understand. On the first, I understand that he has been\r\n           examined.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n            All right. And on the second, I think that's how we're going to\r\n            proceed.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n            I'm going to ask the Defendant if he wishes to testify. And if he\r\n            tells me so, I'm going to call him as a Court's witness. And he's\r\n            going to be on the stand, and he's going to be under oath. I\r\n            have no idea what he wants to testify to. It's his right, his\r\n            absolute right, to testify if he wants to, provided that his\r\n            testimony is material, relevant, and the probative value\r\n            outweighs any prejudice to his case. In making that decision,\r\n\n              I'll hear what he says. . . . [Appellant], do you understand your\r\n              right to testify or not to testify under our Constitution?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: Have you discussed with your lawyer and others whether\r\n           you should testify or not testify?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: And what has their advice been? What has their advice\r\n           been? What have they advised you?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Not to testify.\r\n\r\n      The Court: Now, I'm going to ask you—because it is your decision—\r\n           do you wish to testify?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right. You understand that whatever you have to say\r\n           must be relevant, admissible, and its probative value, meaning\r\n           its value to the decision of the issues in this particular case,\r\n           must outweigh any prejudicial value. You understand?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Yes, sir. \n\r\n\r\n      ....\n\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right. And again, I understand that the Defense has \n\r\n           advised [Appellant] not to take the stand and testify?\n\r\n\r\n      [Defense Counsel]: We have, Your Honor, yes, sir. \n\r\n\r\n(R. 2193-98).\r\n\r\nThereafter, outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge called Appellant as a\r\ncourt's witness, first asking Appellant to proffer his testimony. The in camera\r\nexamination by the trial judge is as follows:\r\n\nQ. All right. You understand that you are under oath?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nQ. And you are the defendant in this case?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nQ. And you wish to testify?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. What's the testimony you wish to give?\r\n\r\nA. About the murders in Anderson County.\r\n\r\nQ. Pardon?\r\n\r\nA. The murders in Anderson County, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. Murders? Both murders?\r\n\r\nA. Right.\r\n\r\nQ. \tNo. What's the testimony you want to give us about the death of\r\n      Kwana Burns?\r\n\r\nA. Okay. That will be fine, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. What do you want to testify to?\r\n\r\nA. To what happened, sir.\r\n\r\nQ. Pardon?\r\n\r\nA. To what happened.\r\n\r\nQ. And what are you going to testify to?\r\n\n      A. About the killing of Kwana Burns.\r\n\r\n      Q. You're what?\r\n\r\n      A. The killing of Kwana Burns.\r\n\r\n      Q. \tWhat are you going to testify to? What is the testimony you're\r\n           going to give?\r\n\r\n      A. I just said it, Judge.\r\n\r\n      Q. \tIf that's all you say, that's no probative value. I want to hear your\r\n              testimony. I want to find out if it's relative [sic], material and\r\n              non-prejudicial.\r\n\r\n      A. That is my testimony, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n      Q. Then you don't testify.\r\n\r\n(R. 2199-2200).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge determined Appellant would not be called as a court's witness based\r\non the outcome of the proffer. The trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n      In light of [Appellant's] reluctance to offer anything in a particular\r\n      way or of a particular nature that would actually be material to the\r\n      charges in this indictment and any of the issues raised in this matter\r\n      other than a generalization, and being asked on more than one time to\r\n      make or to give testimony that would be relevant, material and\r\n      probative without prejudicial value outweighing that probative value,\r\n      the Court finds that [Appellant] has exercised his right to testify and\r\n      declined to testify to anything that would be helpful to the jury in\r\n      reaching the issues in this case.\r\n\r\n      Having so exercised his rights and declined to give anything of\r\n      material value to the jury, in determining the issues of the case as\r\n      required by [Rules] 401 and 402, [SCRE], the Court finds that\r\n      whatever probative value [of] the generalization without any\r\n      specificity . . . is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\n\n      prejudice, confusion of the issues or misleading the jury, and also\r\n      undue delay, waste of time, and needless presentation. Rule 403,\r\n      South Carolina Rules of Evidence.\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      This is the guilt phase when the proof must be upon the State beyond\r\n      a reasonable doubt or something that is material, relevant and\r\n      probative not exceeded by the prejudicial value. So I do find that—\r\n      and I have tried to give [Appellant] every opportunity to testify to\r\n      something that would be admissible.\r\n\r\n      A defendant, like any other witness, if he testifies, he has the right to\r\n      testify under our rules of evidence and procedure in law and not to—\r\n      what is it—use it as a forum to do anything he would like. I don't\r\n      know if he wanted to do that or not, but I asked him at least once,\r\n      maybe twice or three times, what would be his testimony, what would\r\n      he proffer, what would he offer. And that’s the same thing that I'm\r\n      going to have to know before I permit any testimony.\r\n\r\n(R. 2201-03).\r\n\r\nThrough his Guardian ad Litem, Appellant timely objected to the trial court's\r\nruling:\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Your Honor, I just want to, for the record, I just want to\r\n           go ahead and object to the Court's decision under Rule—excuse\r\n           me—under the Constitution's Sixth and Fourteenth\r\n           Amendments.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right. What was the testimony you were going to\r\n           give?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: As I said, Your Honor, I was going to testify about—\r\n\r\n      The Court: What is that testimony? What is that testimony?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: About the details of the case.\r\n\r\n      The Court: What are the details?\r\n\n      [Appellant]: That's for me to say on the stand, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n      The Court: Sir?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: That's for me to say on the stand, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n      The Court: No, sir. Unfortunately—or rather fortunately, it's not for\r\n           you to testify to anything you want to, but it has to be\r\n           something—remember those three things, material, relevant,\r\n           and not prejudicial or the probative value not outweighed by the\r\n           prejudice.\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: Your Honor, I never said I was going to testify to\r\n           anything. That was you saying.\r\n\r\n      The Court: It's not mine, sir. It's the law. Anything else?\r\n\r\n      [Appellant]: No, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right. I'll note your objection. Thank you very much.\r\n           Anything else? I note that the State feels that the Court has\r\n           erred too in—what is it—limiting the testimony of [Appellant]\r\n           only to those matters that would be relevant, material, and\r\n           probative value outweighed—not outweighed by the prejudice.\r\n\r\n(R. pp. 2203-05).\r\n\r\nAppellant was not permitted to testify. The defense rested without presenting any\r\nevidence, and the jury deliberated only eleven minutes before returning a guilty\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nWhen proceedings reconvened two days later for the penalty phase of Appellant's\r\ntrial, the trial judge sua sponte clarified his decision to prohibit Appellant from\r\ntestifying:\r\n\r\n      All right, there are certain matters that I need to clarify from our\r\n      proceedings Friday. The Court has a grave responsibility to assure\r\n      that justice be done in every case if it can be done according to law.\r\n      And Friday [Appellant] advised the Court that he chose to exercise his\r\n\nright to testify, and the Court permitted him to testify except the Court\r\ndid what it would do on any case out of the presence of the jury, have\r\nan in-camera hearing as to what the testimony might be. The reason\r\nfor that, of course, is our rules of evidence in South Carolina, and\r\nparticularly Rules 401, 402 and 403. Because it's not just what\r\nsomebody wants to say; it's whether what somebody wants to say is\r\nmaterial—or excuse me, relevant, material, and even if relevant, is\r\nthere any—if the prejudicial value outweighs any probative value to\r\nbe admissible.\r\n\r\nSo I trust the record will reflect—and I can't remember how many\r\ntimes I asked [Appellant], once he was on the stand—to proffer his\r\ntestimony as to what he wished to testify. And if my recollection is\r\ncorrect, it was to a general matter of, about the death of the victim.\r\nObviously he did not give any specifics as to what would be\r\npresented, so the Court had no way to rule on the admissibility of such\r\nevidence. And no evidence or no testimony was suggested or was\r\noffered that the Court could let it go forward to the jury. The Court\r\nmade every effort to see if there was something that would be\r\nadmissible under our rules of evidence, and [Appellant] declined to\r\ngive the Court any assistance in that matter, and therefore, disallowed\r\nhis—just did not permit him to testify to something that the Court\r\ncould not, in response to its duty to see that justice is done in every\r\ncase, could exercise that awesome responsibility.\r\n\r\nI do note that—what is it—the right of the defendant to testify is well\r\nestablished in [Rock] v. Arkansas, . . . a 1987 case. The court there\r\nknew or addressed the situation when there was a per se rule against\r\nadmissibility. In other words, the rule in Arkansas at the time was\r\nthat, I think, it was post-hypnotic testimony would not be admissible\r\nper se. In other words, without consideration. There the court said\r\nthat that was a violation of the defendant's right to testify. In so doing,\r\nthe—not only did the majority, five of the [United States] Supreme\r\nCourt at that time, noted—note that in the exercise of this right, the\r\naccused, as is required of the state, must comply with established rules\r\nof procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and\r\nreliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. . . . The\r\nConstitution does not in any way relieve a defendant from compliance\r\nwith, quote, rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both\r\nfairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\r\n\n      The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, its well in light of the\r\n      grave responsibility to assure that justice is served, complied in its\r\n      opinion with its duty. I might note that also, considering the nature of\r\n      this particular Defendant's propensity to say things that would\r\n      obviously not be in his best interest, although he would like to do it\r\n      perhaps or has done it in the past, this Court does not feel that this\r\n      would be in . . . [Appellant's] best interest and would be prejudicial.\r\n      And which I say, 401 is relevant evidence, 402 is material to the\r\n      particular issues, and 403, Rule 403, although relevant, evidence may\r\n      be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n      danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\r\n      jury. And in this case, since nothing was offered that would be any\r\n      different from what had already been addressed in the—as far as\r\n      evidence is concerned, the Court found that even that, if anything,\r\n      would be cumulative.\r\n\r\n      So as far as the efforts to have [Appellant] exercise his rights were not\r\n      successful. The Court stands by its ruling.\r\n\r\n(R. 2249-53).\r\n\r\nAs noted, Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death.\r\n\r\n                                           B.\r\n\r\n                           Preliminary Procedural Issues\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in failing to honor his request to testify in his\r\nown defense and that such error is not subject to harmless-error analysis. With\r\ngreat respect for the able trial judge, we are constrained to agree.\r\n\r\nThe State presents two arguments to avoid this issue on direct review, preferring\r\nthat it be considered in a post-conviction relief (PCR) proceeding. First, the State\r\nargues that because the objection to the trial court's failure to call Appellant as a\r\ncourt's witness was made by Appellant and his Guardian ad Litem and not by\r\ndefense counsel, Appellant's claim is not preserved for appellate review based on\r\nthe prohibition against hybrid representation. The State next argues that it was not\r\nthe trial court's responsibility to call Appellant as a witness; rather, Appellant's\r\nright to testify in his own defense was denied by defense counsel's refusal to call\r\n\nhim as a witness for strategic reasons. Therefore, the State argues once again that\r\nthe appropriate procedure for reviewing counsel's strategic decision is through the\r\nPCR process. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"There is no constitutional right to hybrid representation either at trial or on\r\nappeal.\" Jones v. State, 348 S.C. 13, 14, 558 S.E.2d 517, 517 (2002); see State v.\r\nStuckey, 333 S.C. 56, 57-58, 508 S.E.2d 564, 564 (1998) (finding there is no right\r\nto hybrid representation under either the United States or the South Carolina\r\nconstitutions and refusing to consider substantive documents not submitted through\r\ncounsel). We find it is inappropriate to invoke the prohibition against hybrid\r\nrepresentation here based on the absence of an objection by counsel, particularly\r\nsince counsel acknowledged to the trial court Appellant's desire to testify yet\r\nexpressly refused to comply with those wishes. Moreover, we are presented with a\r\nunique situation involving the appointment of a Guardian ad Litem to assist\r\nAppellant. Appellant, directly and through his guardian, objected to the trial\r\ncourt's refusal to permit him to testify. 1 We further note that the State, to its\r\nconsiderable credit, urged the trial court to honor Appellant's request to exercise\r\nhis constitutional right to testify. We fully appreciate the State's issue preservation\r\nargument and its concomitant desire to have this issue vetted in a post-conviction\r\nrelief action where a petitioner must typically establish prejudice resulting from\r\nconstitutionally deficient representation. Given the circumstances of this case,\r\nhowever, we find the issue is preserved for direct review\r\n\r\nNext, regarding the State's argument that Appellant's claim is not a trial court error\r\nand therefore not reviewable on direct appeal, we acknowledge there is no absolute\r\nrule as to whether a denial of the right to testify is properly analyzed as a\r\nconstitutional error on direct appeal or as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\r\nin the context of a PCR proceeding. See, e.g., United States v. Teague, 953 F.2d\r\n1525, 1535 (11th Cir. 1992) (\"Where the defendant claims that this right [to testify]\r\nwas violated by defense counsel, this claim is properly framed as a claim of\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.\"); Ortega v. O'Leary, 843 F.2d 258, 263 (7th Cir.\r\n1988) (reviewing trial court's denial of petitioner's request to testify in the habeas\r\ncorpus context and acknowledging that such an error was reviewable on direct\r\nappeal); Passos-Paternina v. United States, 12 F.Supp.2d 231, 240 (D.P.R. 1998)\r\n\r\n1We reiterate Appellant's timely and specific objection to the trial court's ruling:\r\n\"Your Honor, I just want to, for the record, I just want to go ahead and object to the\r\nCourt's decision under Rule—excuse me—under the Constitution's Sixth and\r\nFourteenth Amendments.\" (R. 2203-04).\r\n\n(recognizing that the right to testify exists independently of the right to counsel and\r\nstating \"[r]egardless of whether the denial of the right to testify can be ascribed to\r\ndefense counsel's conduct, the deprivation complained of is not effective assistance\r\nbut the right to testify, and the right to testify itself is constitutionally protected\");\r\nRossignol v. State, 274 P.3d 1, 7 (Idaho Ct. App. 2012) (\"[T]he issue of the failure\r\nof a defendant to testify may be viewed . . . either as a claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel or as a claim of a deprivation of a constitutional right. . . .\r\n[T]he appropriate inquiry depends on how the claim is pled and argued . . . .\").\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances before us, we find Appellant's claim is proper for review\r\non direct appeal. The record before the Court is adequately developed to permit\r\nfull consideration of Appellant's claim. Indeed, the pertinent facts are\r\nundisputed—Appellant was properly informed of his right to testify, sought to\r\ninvoke it, and was prevented from doing so through the refusal of both counsel and\r\nthe trial court to call him as a witness during the guilt phase of his capital murder\r\ntrial. A post-conviction relief hearing is unwarranted because it is not necessary to\r\nresolve a factual dispute and would not aid in our application of the law. Further,\r\nAppellant's claim is (and has consistently been) presented not as an ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel claim, but rather, as an error committed by the trial court in\r\nexcluding Appellant's testimony, which is not an appropriate basis for an\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Wolfe v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 162, 485\r\nS.E.2d 367, 369 n.2 (1997) (\"[T]rial court error does not constitute an appropriate\r\nbasis for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.\") Accordingly, we\r\nconclude review on direct appeal is proper and turn now to the merits of the claim.\r\n\r\n                                           C.\r\n\r\n                      The Exclusion of Appellant's Testimony\r\n\r\nThe right of a criminally accused to testify or not to testify is fundamental. Rock v.\r\nArkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 52 (1987) (\"[F]undamental to a personal defense . . . is an\r\naccused's right to present his own version of the events in his own words.\"\r\n(emphasis added)). \"Every criminal defendant is privileged to testify in his own\r\ndefense, or to refuse to do so.\" Id. at 53 (quoting Harris v. New York, 401 U.S.\r\n222, 230 (1971)). \"The right to testify on one's own behalf at a criminal trial has\r\nsources in several provisions of the Constitution.\" Id. at 51. \"It is one of the rights\r\nthat 'are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process.'\" Id. (quoting\r\nFaretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819 n.15 (1975)). \"The right to testify is also\r\nfound in the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which grants a\r\ndefendant the right to call 'witnesses in his favor,' a right that is guaranteed in the\r\n\ncriminal courts of the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. at 52 (citing\r\nWashington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967)). \"The opportunity to testify is also a\r\nnecessary corollary to the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against compelled\r\ntestimony.\" Id. \"'The choice of whether to testify in one's own defense . . . is an\r\nexercise of [that] constitutional privilege.'\" Id. at 53 (quoting Harris, 401 U.S. at\r\n230) (omission in original). \"'A person's right . . . to be heard in his defense—a\r\nright to his day in court—[is] basic in our system of jurisprudence; . . . .'\"\r\nChambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 294 (1973) (quoting In re Oliver, 333 U.S.\r\n257, 273 (1948) (emphasis omitted)).\r\n\r\nHowever, the right to present testimony is not without limitation. \"The right 'may,\r\nin appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal\r\ntrial process.'\" Rock, 483 U.S. at 55 (quoting Chambers, 410 U.S. at 295). \"But\r\nrestrictions of a defendant's right to testify may not be arbitrary or disproportionate\r\nto the purposes they are designed to serve.\" Id. at 55-56. \"In applying its\r\nevidentiary rules a State must evaluate whether the interests served by a rule justify\r\nthe limitation imposed on the defendant's constitutional right to testify.\" Id. at 56.\r\nEvidence rules which \"'infringe upon a weighty interest of the accused'\" but fail to\r\nserve any legitimate interest are arbitrary. Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 S.C.\r\n319, 324-26 (2006) (quoting United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998)).\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the record that defense counsel actively thwarted Appellant's desire\r\nto testify. Although, as a practical matter, preventing Appellant from testifying\r\nmay have been an advantageous strategic decision, it had no basis in the law. The\r\ncircumstances of this case are particularly disturbing, given that Appellant\r\ndisagreed with counsel's recommendation not to testify, unambiguously indicated\r\nto the trial court that he wished to take the stand, and vociferously objected to the\r\ntrial court's decision not to permit him to testify. It is also clear from the record\r\nthat the trial judge appeared willing to call Appellant as a court's witness, but\r\nultimately declined to do so because during the peculiar proffer procedure,\r\nAppellant indicated his intention to testify about the crime. It is apparent the trial\r\ncourt, like defense counsel, was operating under the paternalistic belief that it\r\nwanted to protect Appellant from potentially undermining his own defense.2\r\n\r\n2We recognize that counsel for an accused has a duty to prevent false testimony.\r\nHere, Appellant's attorneys refused to call him to the stand because they felt that\r\nhis proposed testimony, though relevant, would not be to his advantage. This is\r\nnot a decision for defense counsel to make. While defense counsel will provide the\r\naccused with his or her best judgment and recommendation, the ultimate decision\r\n\nTo be sure, Appellant's testimony may have been prejudicial to his case but that\r\ncannot serve as a basis for the trial court to prevent him from taking the stand. The\r\ntrial court's thorough colloquy with Appellant demonstrates the trial court well\r\nunderstood the fundamental nature of the right to testify and that the decision\r\nrested solely with Appellant. See Rock, 483 U.S. at 50 (\"[P]ermitting a defendant\r\nto testify advances both the 'detection of guilt' and 'the protection of innocence.'\"\r\n(quoting Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570, 581 (1961))); Jones v. Barnes, 463\r\nU.S. 745, 751 (1983) (\"It is also recognized that the accused has the ultimate\r\nauthority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding the case, as to whether\r\nto plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal.\").\r\n\r\nOther than a paternalistic desire to protect Appellant from himself, there was no\r\nbasis upon which the trial court could have appropriately found Appellant's\r\ntestimony to be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. Rather, we find the logical\r\nrelevancy of Appellant's testimony is self-evident—it pertained to the killing of the\r\nvictim, which was the precise basis for the prosecution. Indeed, it is difficult to\r\nfathom anything more logically connected to the fundamental issue in this capital\r\nmurder trial than a defendant's own testimony about the killing. See United States\r\nv. Walker, 772 F.2d 1172, 1179 (5th Cir. 1985) (\"Where the very point of a trial is\r\nto determine whether an individual was involved in criminal activity, the testimony\r\nof the individual himself must be considered of prime importance.\"); see also\r\nMcKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 177 (1984) (\"[T]he right to speak for oneself\r\nentails more than the opportunity to add one's voice to a cacophony of others.\").\r\nThis is particularly true given the lenient standard for admissibility—namely, that\r\nevidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact . . .\r\nmore probable or less probable . . . .\" Rule 401, SCRE (emphasis added); see State\r\nv. Wiles, 383 S.C. 151, 158, 679 S.E.2d 172, 176 (2009) (\"Evidence is relevant and\r\nadmissible if it tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in\r\ncontroversy.\"); State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 134-35, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682 (2000)\r\n(finding accused's statements were \"highly probative\" of whether the accused\r\ncommitted the crime charged and noting \"as a general rule\" such evidence is\r\nadmissible). Therefore, we find the trial court erred in preventing Appellant from\r\ntestifying on the basis of relevance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof whether an accused will testify in his or her defense rests exclusively with the\r\naccused.\r\n\nFurther, although the trial judge relied upon Rule 403, SCRE, as an additional\r\nbasis for excluding Appellant's testimony, it is clear his ruling was erroneously\r\nbased upon his concern that Appellant's testimony would be prejudicial to\r\nAppellant. Again, while this concern may have been well founded, it is not a\r\nproper basis for disallowing the testimony of the accused. Thus, we find it was\r\nerror to exclude Appellant's testimony pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE. See State v.\r\nStokes, 381 S.C. 390, 404, 673 S.E.2d 434, 441 (2008) (\"'Unfair prejudice [within\r\nthe meaning of Rule 403, SCRE,] means an undue tendency to suggest a decision\r\non an improper basis.'\") (quoting State v. Dickerson, 341 S.C. 391, 400, 535 S.E.2d\r\n119, 123 (2000)). Regardless of whether a defendant's decision to testify is to his\r\nown detriment, \"it 'must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is\r\nthe lifeblood of the law.'\" Dearybury v. State, 367 S.C. 34, 39, 625 S.C. 212, 215\r\n(2006) (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834); see also Boyd v. United States, 586\r\nA.2d 670, 673 (D.C. Ct. App. 1991) (\"Although a defendant who chooses to testify\r\nmay actually decrease his or her chance of acquittal, nonetheless, 'the wisdom or\r\nunwisdom of the defendant's choice does not diminish his right to make it.'\"\r\n(quoting People v. Curtis, 681 P.2d 504, 513 (Colo. 1984))); United States v.\r\nSchrock, 855 F.2d 327, 335 (6th Cir. 1988) (\"Unfair prejudice as used in Rule 403\r\ndoes not mean the damage to a defendant's case that results from legitimate\r\nprobative force of the evidence.\"); People v. Dist. Ct. of El Paso Cnty., 869 P.2d\r\n1281, 1286 (Colo. 1994) (\"Proffered evidence should therefore not be excluded by\r\nthe [trial] court as unfairly prejudicial simply because it damages the defendant's\r\ncase.\").\r\n\r\nIt is true that \"well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude\r\nevidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair\r\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.\" Holmes, 547\r\nU.S. at 326. It is also true \"that the Constitution permits judges 'to exclude\r\nevidence that is repetitive, only marginally relevant' or poses an undue risk of\r\n'harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.'\" Id. However, it is also clear\r\nthat \"the Constitution . . . prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules\r\nthat serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends they are\r\nasserted to promote . . . .\" Id. Here, because the trial court committed an error of\r\nlaw in finding Appellant's testimony was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial, such\r\nerroneous application of the Rules of Evidence cannot serve any legitimate state\r\npurpose. Having determined that the trial court's decision to prevent Appellant's\r\ntestimony violated the rules of evidence and the United States Constitution, we\r\nnow consider whether such error requires reversal.\r\n\nWe emphasize Appellant does not challenge the legitimate purposes served by\r\nRules 401, 402, or 403, SCRE. Nor does Appellant contend any of those\r\nevidentiary rules in and of themselves arbitrarily restrict his right to testify.\r\nRather, Appellant claims the trial court arbitrarily misapplied those rules, and in\r\ncommitting that error of law, the trial court unconstitutionally prevented Appellant\r\nfrom testifying during his own trial. Thus, we need not address whether proper\r\napplication of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence impermissibly restricts a\r\ndefendant's constitutional right to testify.3 Rather, the narrow issue before the\r\nCourt is this: Does the erroneous application of evidentiary rules which results in\r\nthe wholesale exclusion of a defendant's testimony constitute a structural error not\r\nsubject to harmless-error analysis?\r\n\r\nThe State asserts that the denial of a defendant's right to testify does not in all cases\r\nrender a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or call into question the reliability of\r\nthe trial as a vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. Rather, the State argues,\r\nsuch an error is appropriately characterized as a \"trial error\" which is subject to the\r\nharmless-error doctrine. We disagree.\r\n\r\nMost trial errors, even those which violate a defendant's constitutional rights, are\r\nsubject to harmless-error analysis. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306-\r\n07 (1991) (recognizing that most constitutional errors are subject to harmless-error\r\nanalysis and do not automatically require reversal of a conviction) (citing\r\nChapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23 (1967)). Indeed, \"the harmless-error\r\ndoctrine is essential to preserve the 'principle that the central purpose of a criminal\r\ntrial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence, and\r\npromotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying\r\nfairness of the trial rather than the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial\r\nerror.'\" Id. at 306-08 (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681\r\n(1986)).\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the strong interests upon which the harmless-error doctrine is\r\nbased, there are certain constitutional rights which are \"'so basic to a fair trial that\r\ntheir infraction can never be treated as harmless error.'\" Id. (quoting Chapman,\r\n\r\n3We do not suggest that a defendant's testimony is not subject to the rules of\r\nevidence. Indeed, our findings should not be taken as a restriction of the trial\r\ncourt's ability to constrain a defendant's testimony based on a proper application of\r\nevidentiary rules.\r\n\n386 U.S. at 23). \"These are structural defects in the constitution of the trial\r\nmechanism, which defy analysis by 'harmless-error' standards\" and which \"affect[]\r\nthe framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the\r\ntrial process itself.\" Id. at 309-10. \"'Without these basic protections, a criminal\r\ntrial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or\r\ninnocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.'\"\r\nId. at 310 (quoting Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 577-78 (1986)). Essentially, an\r\nerror is structural if it is \"the type of error which transcends the criminal process.\"\r\nId. at 311.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has found \"an error to be 'structural,' and thus subject to\r\nautomatic reversal only in a very limited class of cases.\" Neder v. United States,\r\n527 U.S. 1, 8 (1999) (quoting Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 468 (1997));\r\nsee also United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 150 (2006) (erroneous\r\ndisqualification of counsel of choice); Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993)\r\n(defective reasonable-doubt instruction); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254 (1986)\r\n(racial discrimination in selection of grand jury); Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39\r\n(1984) (denial of public trial); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984) (denial\r\nof self-representation at trial); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963)\r\n(complete denial of counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927) (biased trial\r\njudge).\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether a trial court's improper\r\nrefusal to permit a defendant to testify in his own defense is a structural error or\r\none which is subject to harmless-error analysis. We find this error is not amenable\r\nto harmless-error analysis and requires reversal without a particularized prejudice\r\ninquiry. See Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 150 (\"We have little trouble concluding\r\nthat erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice, 'with consequences that\r\nare necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, unquestionably qualifies as\r\nstructural error.' . . . Harmless-error analysis in such a context would be a\r\nspeculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe.\"\r\n(quoting Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 282)); see also Neder, 527 U.S. at 8-9 (\"[Structural]\r\nerrors deprive defendants of 'basic protections' without which 'a criminal trial\r\ncannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or\r\ninnocence and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.'\"\r\n(quoting Rose, 478 U.S. at 577-78)); Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 281-82 (\"Denial of the\r\nright to a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is . . . a 'basic protection'\r\nwhose precise effects are unmeasurable, but without which a criminal trial cannot\r\nreliably serve its function.

Walker, 772\r\nF.2d 1172 (5th Cir. 1985) (reversing defendant's conviction and remanding the\r\ncase for a new trial where the trial court abused its discretion in denying\r\ndefendant's motion to reopen trial to allow defendant to testify which was made\r\nafter the defense rested but before closing arguments or jury instructions); State v.\r\nHampton, 818 So.2d 720, 729 (La. 2002) (\"Rock thus spoke of the right to testify\r\nas among those rights that 'are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary\r\nprocess.' Therefore, such language unmistakably places the defendant's right to\r\ntestify among those protections without which a criminal trial is 'structurally\r\nflawed.'\" (quoting Rock, 483 U.S. at 52)); State v. Dauzart, 769 So.2d 1206, 1210\r\n(La. 2000) (\"No matter how daunting the task, the accused therefore has the right\r\nto face jurors and address them directly without regard to the probabilities of\r\nsuccess.

The denial itself is sufficient.\").\r\n\nIn sum, we are persuaded that the right of an accused to testify in his defense is\r\nfundamental to the trial process and transcends a mere evidentiary ruling. An\r\naccused's right to testify \"is either respected or denied; its deprivation cannot be\r\nharmless.\" McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 177 n.8. As such, the error is structural4 in that\r\nit is \"'so basic to a fair trial that [its] infraction can never be treated as harmless\r\nerror.'\" Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 289 (quoting Chapman, 386 U.S. at 23).\r\n\r\n                                          III.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse Appellant's conviction and sentence and decline to reach\r\nthe remaining issues, save one. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\nInc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing that an appellate\r\ncourt need not address remaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is\r\ndispositive). The one issue we elect to address concerns the admissibility of\r\nmitigation evidence offered by Appellant during the sentencing phase of the trial.\r\nAppellant presented the expert testimony of Dr. Nicholas Cooper-Lewiter, from\r\nwhom defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony that Appellant had been\r\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder. The State objected, arguing Dr. Cooper-Lewiter\r\nwas not qualified to diagnose Appellant with any mental illness. The trial judge\r\nsustained the State's objection, finding bipolar disorder is \"a medical condition that\r\nrequires expert testimony,\" and that Dr. Cooper-Lewiter was not qualified to\r\ndiagnose such a condition because he did not possess a medical degree. The State\r\nnow concedes the trial court erred in excluding Dr. Cooper-Lewiter's testimony as\r\nto Appellant's bipolar disorder diagnosis but urges us to find the error harmless.\r\nGiven the necessity of a new trial, we do not reach the question of harmless error.\r\nWe do find, however, that the proffered testimony was clearly admissible and\r\nremind the State and the bench that due process requires that defendants be\r\naccorded considerable latitude in the presentation of mitigation evidence. See\r\nPorter v. McCollum, 130 S.Ct. 447, 454-55 (2009) (finding even where mental\r\nhealth evidence does not rise to the level of establishing a statutory mitigating\r\ncircumstance, it may nonetheless be considered based on constitutional\r\nrequirement that \"'the sentence in capital cases must be permitted to consider any\r\nrelevant mitigating factor'\" (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 112\r\n(1982))); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 5 (1986) (noting that where the\r\n\r\n4 A trial court's discretion in the conduct of the trial and the admission of evidence\r\nis in no manner diminished merely because the underlying assignment of error\r\nrelates to a matter deemed structural. The finding of a structural error simply\r\nrenders the harmless error doctrine unavailable on appellate review.\r\n\nprosecution specifically relies on an aggravating factor, it is not only Lockett and\r\nEddings that require that a defendant \"be afforded an opportunity to introduce\r\nevidence on this point; it is also the elemental due process requirement that a\r\ndefendant not be sentenced to death 'on the basis of information which he had no\r\nopportunity to deny or explain'\" (quoting Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 362\r\n(1977))).\r\n\r\nThis matter is remanded for a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27221","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n                FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      Kiawah Island is a barrier island fronting the Atlantic Ocean with over\r\nten miles of beachfront. The island is bounded on the south by the Atlantic\r\n\nOcean, on the east by the Stono River Inlet, on the north by the Kiawah\r\nRiver, and on the west by the Kiawah River where the river enters the\r\nAtlantic through Captain Sam's Inlet. The Spit is located adjacent to Captain\r\nSam's Inlet at the southwest end of Kiawah Island. The Spit is a sandy land\r\nformation surrounded on three sides by water—the Atlantic Ocean, Captain\r\nSam's Inlet, and the Kiawah River. Respondent owns Captain Sam's\r\npeninsula.\r\n      In 1999, the Office of Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)\r\nestablished a baseline and building set back line twenty feet landward based\r\non information that the Spit had accreted, or grown, and had not been subject\r\nto any significant, measurable erosion between 1959 and 1999. The\r\nmovement of the baseline prompted Respondent to consider development of\r\nthe Spit. On February 29, 2008, Respondent submitted an application to\r\nDHEC for a permit to construct a combination bulkhead and revetment in the\r\narea. The application sought authorization to construct a 2,783 foot bulkhead\r\nand 2,783 foot by 40 foot articulated concrete block revetment on the\r\nshoreline of the Kiawah River.\r\n       On December 18, 2008, DHEC issued a conditional permit approving\r\nthe construction of the erosion control structure for a distance of 270 feet.\r\nDHEC refused the permit request for the remaining 2,513 feet based on its\r\nconcerns regarding cumulative negative impacts, including interference with\r\nnatural inlet formation and possible adverse effects on wintering piping\r\nplovers. DHEC also determined that the project was contrary to the policies\r\nset forth in the Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP). Respondent\r\nrequested a final review conference by the DHEC Board (the Board), but the\r\nBoard declined to hold a review conference.\r\n      Respondent then requested a contested case hearing before the ALC,\r\nand challenged the denial of the construction of a bulkhead and revetment\r\nalong the remaining 2,513 feet. The Coastal Conservation League (CCL)\r\nopposed the construction of any bulkhead or revetment on the Spit, and also\r\nrequested a contested case hearing challenging the decision to authorize the\r\n270 foot structure, but supporting denial of the remainder. The cases were\r\n\nconsolidated. The ALC granted Respondent's permit to construct the\r\nbulkhead and revetment, subject to certain conditions reducing and altering\r\nits size. DHEC and CCL (collectively, Appellants) appealed the ALC's\r\norder. This Court reversed the ALC and remanded the issue in a decision\r\npublished November 21, 2011. We subsequently granted Respondent's\r\npetition for rehearing, and accepted an amicus brief from the Savannah River\r\nMaritime Commission (the SRMC). We now withdraw our initial opinion,\r\nand issue this opinion, affirming the decision of the ALC.\r\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n         The issues in this case are consolidated and clarified as follows:\r\n  I.\t       Whether the ALC erred in failing to defer to DHEC's interpretation\r\n            of the applicable statutes and regulations and whether the ALC had\r\n            the authority to modify the proposed bulkhead/revetment.\r\n\r\n  II.\t      Whether substantial evidence supports the ALC's findings that the\r\n            proposed bulkhead/revetment complies with the Coastal Zone\r\n            Management Act (CZMA) and the CZMP.\r\n\r\n  III.\t Whether the ALC erred in concluding that potential long-range\r\n        cumulative impacts on the adjacent upland area should not be\r\n        considered in a critical area permitting decision pursuant to\r\n        regulation 30-11 of the South Carolina Code of Regulations, and\r\n        whether substantial evidence supports the ALC's finding that the\r\n        proposed bulkhead and revetment comply with regulation 30-12 of\r\n        the South Carolina Code of Regulations.\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n      In an appeal from an ALC decision, the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA) provides the appropriate standard of review. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-\r\n610(B) (Supp. 2011). This Court will only reverse the decision of an ALC if\r\nthat decision is:\r\n\n         (a)in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\r\n         (b)in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n\r\n         (c)made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\r\n         (d)affected by other error of law;\r\n\r\n         (e)clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\n            substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n\r\n         (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of\r\n             discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\nId. \"The Court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the\r\n[ALC] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\" Id. In\r\ndetermining whether the ALC's decision was supported by substantial\r\nevidence, this Court need only find, looking at the entire record on appeal,\r\nevidence from which reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion that\r\nthe ALC reached. Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 389 S.C. 1,\r\n9–10, 698 S.E.2d 612, 617 (2010).LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n   I.\t      Whether the ALC erred in not deferring to DHEC, and whether\r\n            the ALC had the authority to modify the proposed construction.\r\n\r\n   A. Deference\r\n      Appellants claim that the ALC erred in failing to defer to DHEC's\r\nconclusions in this case, and improperly focused on the fact that DHEC did\r\nnot conduct a final review process formally adopting the \"staff's\" findings.\r\nRespondent and the SRMC, assert the challenged permitting decision was\r\nthat of the DHEC staff, because the DHEC Board never acted on the\r\n\npermitting decision. Thus, the decision was not entitled to deference as a\r\nmatter of law. We disagree.\r\n       Courts defer to the relevant administrative agency's decisions with\r\nrespect to its own regulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.\r\nS.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control,\r\n363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005). \"[The Board], not OCRM staff,\r\nis entitled to deference from the courts.\" Id. Section 44-1-60(F) of the South\r\nCarolina Code provides, \"If a final review conference is not conducted within\r\nsixty days, the department decision becomes the final agency decision, and an\r\napplicant . . . may request a contested case hearing before the [ALC].\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 44-1-60(F) (Supp. 2011).\r\n       In South Carolina Coastal Conservation League v. South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control, 363 S.C. 67, 70, 610\r\nS.E.2d 482, 484 (2005), LandTech of Charleston, L.L.C. (LandTech) applied\r\nto OCRM for a permit to build a bridge across the marshes of the Wando\r\nRiver to Park Island in the Town of Mount Pleasant. OCRM staff deemed\r\nPark Island a small island and determined the access-to-small islands\r\nregulation, regulation 30-12(N) of the South Carolina Code of Regulations,\r\napplied. Id. LandTech claimed that the application was governed by the\r\ntransportation-projects regulation, regulation 30-12(F). Id. at 71, 610 S.E.2d\r\nat 484. OCRM disagreed, processed the application under the more stringent\r\nsmall island regulation, and granted the permit. Id. CCL objected and\r\nrequested a hearing before the ALC. Id. The ALC held that the application\r\nwas actually governed by the transportation projects regulation, but upheld\r\nthe permit. Id. CCL appealed to the Panel, which affirmed without analysis.\r\nId. at 72, 610 S.E.2d at 484. CCL then appealed to the circuit court which\r\nreversed. Id. The court found that Park Island was in fact governed by the\r\naccess-to-small islands regulation, but that issuance of the permit did not\r\ncomply with the regulation. Id. This Court held that the circuit court should\r\nhave deferred to the Panel's decision because, \"there was no compelling\r\nreason to overrule the Panel's decision that the Transportation Regulation\r\ngoverned.\" Id. at 75, 610 S.E.2d at 486.\r\n\n       In the instant case, DHEC's decision to refuse to conduct a Final\r\nReview Conference, pursuant to section 44-1-60(F) of the South Carolina\r\nCode, is analogous to the Panel decision in Coastal to affirm the ALC's\r\ndecision without analysis. In both situations, regardless of the mechanism,\r\nthe staff decision became the agency decision and was entitled to deference.\r\nThus, the appropriate question is not whether DHEC's decision was entitled\r\nto deference, but instead whether there was a compelling reason for the ALJ\r\nnot to defer to this decision.\r\n       Where the plain language of the statute is contrary to the agency's\r\ninterpretation, the Court will reject the agency's interpretation. Brown v. Bi-\r\nLo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003). In Brown, the\r\nemployee sustained a compensable injury while working for the employer.\r\nId. at 438, 581 S.E.2d at 837. Several years later a question arose whether\r\nmedical treatment sought by the employee for subsequent falls was related to\r\nthe injury and thus, whether the employer was required to pay for medical\r\ntreatment. Id. The employer hired a rehabilitation nurse to contact the\r\nemployee's treating physicians regarding the nature of her conditions. Id.\r\nThe employee's attorney wrote a letter to the rehabilitation nurse and the\r\ntreating physicians threatening legal action if they discussed the employee's\r\nmedical condition. Id. The employer complained to the Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission (the Commission) which ordered the employee's\r\nattorney to cease and desist from obstructing contact. Id.\r\n      This Court held that the South Carolina Workers Compensation Act\r\nrequired physicians to provide employers with pertinent information\r\nregarding the treatment of a compensation claimant, but mandated the\r\nexchange of existing information, and did not authorize other ex parte\r\nmethods of communication such as that sought by the employer. Id. at 439–\r\n40, 581 S.E.2d at 838. Thus, the Court reversed because the Commission's\r\nconclusions in the case were affected by an error of law. Id. at 441, 581\r\nS.E.2d at 839 (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380 (A)(6) (Supp. 2002)).\r\n      In this case, the ALC noted significant and compelling reasons why\r\ndeference to DHEC's interpretation of the CZMA, and associated statutes and\r\nregulations, would be improper. For example, as discussed infra, the ALC\r\n\ndisagreed that regulation 30-11(C) authorized DHEC to account for the\r\nimpact of the proposed project outside the actual areas where DHEC has\r\ndirect permitting authority. This Court's prior decisions and substantial\r\nevidence in the Record support that determination. In other words, the ALC\r\nowed no deference to DHEC's interpretation of statutes and regulations that\r\nwere erroneous or controlled by an error of law.\r\n     B. Modification\r\n      Furthermore, the ALC did not exceed its authority by modifying the\r\nstructure requested by Respondent. As described previously, Respondent\r\nsought authorization to construct a 2,783 foot bulkhead and a 2,783 foot by\r\n40 foot articulated concrete block revetment. DHEC approved a structure of\r\n270 feet and refused the request for the remaining 2,513 feet. The ALC\r\nconcluded that the full extent of the proposed structure was not currently\r\nnecessary to stabilize the river bank:\r\n        In many locations along the western section, the bulkhead may\r\n        not be necessary and an ACB mat much shorter in width than\r\n        forty feet may well suffice to stabilize the riverbank . . . . More\r\n        specifically, the western section is best suited now and perhaps\r\n        permanently to the soft approach.\r\n      The ALC deleted DHEC's size restriction, and instituted different\r\nspecial conditions limiting the size of the structure.1\r\n\r\n\r\n1   The ALC limited the structure in the following pertinent parts:\r\n        1. Provided:\r\n\r\n        (i)\t   That care is used in the installation of the requested erosion\r\n               control structure near its eastern end, adjacent to\r\n               Beachwalker Park, to avoid covering marsh grass, where\r\n               practical, unless necessary to prevent significant upland\r\n               erosion;\r\n\n      Appellants argue that the ALC exceeded its authority and committed an\r\nerror of law:\r\n      After determining that the structure applied for by [Respondent]\r\n      was not necessary, rather than affirming [DHEC]'s decision, the\r\n      ALC went on to design an erosion control structure for\r\n      [Respondent] . . . . The ALC relied upon off-the-cuff testimony . .\r\n      . . If the structure designed by the ALC were to be constructed,\r\n      neither DHEC nor interested members of the public would be\r\n      able to determine whether it is constructed in accordance with the\r\n      permit, as it is unclear what the ALC authorizes.\r\n      As Respondent and the SRMC correctly note, the General Assembly\r\nhas broadly defined the authority of the ALC. The ALC has the same \"power\r\nat chambers or in open hearing as do circuit court judges\" and the authority to\r\nissue writs necessary to give effect to its jurisdiction. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-\r\n630 (2005) (granting circuit judges the power to grant, decline, or modify\r\ninjunctions). The ALC presides over hearings of all contested cases and must\r\n\r\n\r\n      (ii)\t That, for the portion of the proposed erosion control\r\n            structure to be located west of survey point \"F\" on\r\n            [Respondent]'s Exhibit 77, a bulkhead shall not be used\r\n            where the vertical face of the escarpment is less than 24\r\n            inches;\r\n\r\n      (iii)\t That for this same western section of the proposed erosion\r\n             control structure, the ACB mat shall be no greater than\r\n             eight feet in width; and,\r\n\r\n      (iv)\t That [Respondent] shall submit final construction plans to\r\n            [DHEC] consistent with the permit requested, as modified\r\n            and approved by the [ALC], before commencing initial\r\n            construction of the erosion control structure.\r\n\nissue a decision in a final written order. Id. § 1-23-505(3) (Supp. 2011). If\r\nthe ALC's final order is not appealed in accordance with the provisions of\r\nsection 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code, the certified order has the same\r\neffect as a judgment of the court where filed and may be recorded, enforced,\r\nor satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of that court. Id. § 1-23-600(I)\r\n(Supp. 2011).\r\n       The ALC is the ultimate fact finder in a contested case, and is not\r\nrestricted by the findings of the administrative agency. Risher v. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Health and Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 207–08, 712 S.E.2d 428, 433\r\n(2011). Additionally, in a contested case proceeding, the ALC sits de novo.\r\nBrown v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560\r\nS.E.2d 410, 413 (2002). It is unlikely the General Assembly intended to vest\r\nthe ALC with broad authority to hear permit disputes, and conduct a trial on\r\nthe dispute, but then restrain the court from issuing a decision which reflects\r\nthe best outcome gleaned from that trial. See B & A Dev., Inc. v. Georgetown\r\nCnty., 372 S.C. 261, 268–69, 641 S.E.2d 888, 893 (2007) (recognizing the\r\nprinciple that when the legislature intends to confine expansive authority, it\r\nwill expressly provide for such a limitation).\r\n      In the instant case, the ALC held a de novo review of the partial denial\r\nof Respondent's permit. The evidence and testimony before the ALC in this\r\nmatter amounted to a Record six volumes and 2,380 pages in length. The\r\nALC then ordered approval of the permit issued by DHEC with modifications\r\nbased on evidence presented during the review. The ALC did not enlarge or\r\notherwise approve a permit substantially different than that requested by\r\nRespondent, or originally reviewed by DHEC. The ALC acted in accordance\r\nwith its authority as conferred and defined by the General Assembly.\r\n   II.\t   Whether substantial evidence supports the ALC's findings that\r\n          the proposed bulkhead/revetment complies with the CZMA and\r\n          the CZMP.\r\n      Appellants argue that the proposed project violates the plain language\r\nof the CZMA, and that the ALC erred in concluding that the proposed\r\n\nbulkhead/revetment structure complies with sections 48-39-20,-30, and -150\r\nof the South Carolina Code. We disagree.\r\n   A. The CZMA\r\n      The CZMA provides, \"Critical areas shall be used to provide the\r\ncombination of uses which will insure the maximum benefit to the people,\r\nbut not necessarily a combination of uses that will generate measurable\r\nmaximum dollar benefits.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-30(D) (2008). Critical\r\nareas include coastal waters, tidelands, beaches, and dune systems. Id. § 48-\r\n39-10 (2008). Section 48-39-150 of the South Carolina Code sets forth ten\r\ngeneral considerations that OCRM must take into account when reviewing\r\nany permit concerning activity in a critical area. Id. § 48-39-150. Section\r\n48-39-150 also states that \"the Department will be guided by the policy\r\nstatements in Sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30,\" along with the ten\r\nconsiderations. Id. § 48-39-150 (2008).\r\n       The ALC listed all of the relevant considerations of section 48-39-150\r\nand then explained why the evidence presented in the case demonstrated that\r\nthe proposed construction complied with those considerations and would not\r\nhave \"adverse environmental impacts.\" The ALC then analyzed the proposed\r\nconstruction in light of the policy statements of sections 48-39-20 and 30 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code. In section 48-39-20, the General Assembly noted\r\nthat the coastal zone is rich in a variety of natural, commercial, recreational,\r\nand industrial resources. Id. § 48-39-20 (2008). The General Assembly\r\nobserved that ill-planned development threatened to destroy important\r\necological, cultural, and natural characteristics, as well as, industrial and\r\neconomic values. Id.§ 48-39-20(E). Thus, the legislature enacted regulations\r\nin light of competing demands between the urgent need to protect natural\r\nsystems in the coastal zone \"while balancing economic interests.\" Id. at 48-\r\n39-20(F). In section 48-39-30, the General Assembly declared the state\r\npolicy of protecting the quality of the coastal environment and promoting the\r\neconomic improvement of the coastal zone. Id. § 48-39-30(A). Two\r\nsubsections of that section are particularly pertinent:\r\n\n      (B) Specific state policies to be followed in the implementation\r\n      of this chapter are:\r\n        (1) To promote economic and social improvement of the\r\n            citizens of this State and to encourage development of\r\n            coastal resources in order to achieve such improvement\r\n            with due consideration for the environment and within the\r\n            framework of a coastal planning program that is designed\r\n            to protect the sensitive and fragile areas from inappropriate\r\n            development.\r\n      ....\r\n      (D) Critical areas shall be used to provide the combination of\r\n      uses which will insure the maximum benefit to the people, but\r\n      not necessarily a combination of uses which will generate\r\n      measureable maximum dollar benefits.\r\nId. § 48-39-30.\r\n      The ALC noted the policy considerations of the CZMA and concluded:\r\n      These policy statements require a balancing of economic\r\n      development benefits and environmental preservation. Even\r\n      though the focus of the inquiry is on the effects of the project,\r\n      neither the bulkhead/revetment nor the potential limited\r\n      residential development will result in any significant harm to the\r\n      public resources or marine or other plant or animal life, nor\r\n      significantly impair public access to critical areas . . . . The\r\n      potential residential development is not ill-planned and will be\r\n      implemented in a low density, environmentally sensitive manner.\r\n      It will be subject to local, state, and possibly federal permitting\r\n      requirements. Neither the proposed bulkhead/revetment nor the\r\n      potential limited residential development transgresses the policies\r\n      set forth in these two statutes.\r\n     Appellants fail to recognize the ALC's thorough findings of fact\r\nsupporting the conclusions regarding sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30. The\r\n\nALC engaged in an extensive analysis regarding the erosion issues facing the\r\nSpit and the consequences this erosion would have on Respondent's ability to\r\nprevent the loss of further upland, and concluded:\r\n      Moreover, evidence did not establish that there was a feasible\r\n      alternative to the bulkhead/revetment that would stabilize the\r\n      river shoreline and prevent the continued erosion of KDP's\r\n      upland . . . . That evidence clearly establishes a need for erosion\r\n      control along the disputed shoreline.\r\n       The ALC also examined both the testimony regarding possible adverse\r\neffects on marine resources and wildlife, and a detailed analysis of the facts\r\npresented regarding wintering piping plovers, a threatened species under the\r\nEndangered Species Act, and diamond-back terrapins. In this regard, the\r\nALC noted that there had never been a single sighting of a piping plover in\r\nthe proposed construction area. The ALC also observed that the United\r\nStates Fish and Wildlife Service propounded a final determination of the\r\ncritical habitat for piping plovers. That final determination specified the\r\ncritical area of piping plover habitat as extending one mile north of Captain\r\nSam's inlet, but not extending above the building setback line on the Spit.\r\nThe ALC cited this fact in rejecting DHEC's contention that future residential\r\ndevelopment, apart from the proposed project itself, would have an adverse\r\neffect on the piping plover. Therefore, if the proposed project and residential\r\ndevelopment do not occur in critical plover habitat, or in close proximity, it is\r\nunlikely to have an adverse effect.\r\n       The ALC noted that the diamond-back terrapin has not been listed as an\r\nendangered or threatened species in South Carolina. Moreover, the testing\r\ndata relied upon by CCL's expert was gathered more than fifteen years before\r\nthe sharp decline in the terrapin population in tidal creeks surrounding\r\nKiawah. CCL's expert could not testify to a reasonable degree of certainty\r\nthat the proposed construction would have any significant effect on terrapins.\r\n      The preceding findings of fact regarding the impact of the proposed\r\nproject, and the absence of feasible alternatives, demonstrate the substantial\r\n\nevidence in the Record supporting the ALC's conclusion that the project\r\ncomplies with the CZMA.\r\n   B. The CZMP\r\n      Appellants also claim that that the proposed activity contravenes the\r\nCZMP, including the plan's policies for public open space and the protection\r\nof barrier islands, dune areas (outside the critical area), erosion control, and\r\nbeach and shoreline access.\r\n      DHEC developed the CZMP for the coastal zone as required by the\r\nCZMA. See S.C. Code § 48-39-80 (2008). All state and federal permits\r\nmust be reviewed for compliance with the CZMP. Spectre LLC v. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Health and Envtl. Control, 386 S.C. 357, 360, 688 S.E.2d at 844, 845\r\n(2010). The CZMP classifies barrier islands as areas of special significance\r\nand dune areas, which fall landward of the beach zones, as areas of \"special\r\nresource significance.\" Thus, project proposals for barrier islands \"must\r\ndemonstrate reasonable precautions to prevent or limit any direct negative\r\nimpacts on adjacent critical areas.\" CZMP Chapter III (C)(3)(XII)(A)(2).\r\nAdditionally, project proposals for sand dune areas in close proximity to\r\nthose dunes in critical areas must also comply with these same direct\r\nprecautions. Id. Chapter III (B). The CZMP also sets forth a policy of\r\nincreasing the amount of public space in the coastal zone, and protecting\r\nthose areas in the coastal zone which are inhabited by endangered or\r\nthreatened species. Id.\r\n   The ALC concluded that the proposed project did not contravene the\r\nCZMP: The development techniques and safeguards [Respondent]\r\n      intends to implement are consonant with the policies in the\r\n      CZMP. More specifically, I find the low density development . .\r\n      . that would be employed in the residential development of [the\r\n      Spit] entail [sic] reasonable precautions. No evidence was offered\r\n      to alter this important point. The many rows of dunes seaward of\r\n      the setback line would remain essentially intact on a permanent\r\n      basis to enjoy for their beauty and protection, thereby preserving\r\n\n     the strong natural protections deemed desirable by the policies in\r\n     the CZMP.\r\n     ....\r\n     The potential residential development on private property will\r\n     also not impair public open space at Beachwalker Park or along\r\n     the beach. Finally, the developable area of Captain Sam's\r\n     peninsula is well outside . . . boundaries of designated critical\r\n     habitat . . . . It is thus not a Geographic Area of Particular\r\n     Concern (GAPC) under the CZMP.\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n      The ALC's findings on this issue are well supported. The Record\r\ncontains evidence of the \"environmentally-friendly\" nature of the proposed\r\nresidential development. Respondent placed before the court evidence of the\r\nproposed structure's effect on public access, and the lack of adverse impact\r\non critical habitats. Thus, reasonable minds could conclude from the\r\nevidence in the Record that Respondent's proposed construction complies\r\nwith the CZMA and the CZMP.\r\n  III.\t Whether the ALC erred regarding the consideration of potential\r\n        long-range cumulative impacts, and whether the ALC correctly\r\n        found that the proposed bulkhead/revetment complies with\r\n        regulations 30-11, and 30-12 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n        Regulations.\r\n\r\n  A. Regulation 30-11(C)(1)\r\n      Appellants argue that the ALC misconstrued regulation 30-11(C)(1) of\r\nthe South Carolina Code of Regulations, and erroneously concluded that\r\nDHEC lacked authority to consider impacts \"outside critical areas when\r\nreviewing applications to alter or utilize critical areas.\" We disagree.\r\n     Regulation 30-11(C) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n     Further Guidelines: In the fulfilling of its responsibility under\r\n     Section 48-39-150, the Department must in part base its decisions\r\n     regarding permit applications on the policies specified in Sections\r\n     48-39-20 and 48-39-30, and thus, be guided by the following:\r\n     (1) The extent to which long range cumulative effects of the \n\r\n         project may result within the context of other possible \n\r\n         development and the general character of the area. \n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-11(C)(1) (1999).\r\n       Appellants argue that the \"area\" referred to under this regulation\r\nextends beyond the critical area to adjacent upland. According to Appellants,\r\nthe declarations of section 48-39-20 and -30 of the South Carolina Code\r\nindicate the \"General Assembly's intent that [DHEC], when acting on critical\r\narea permit applications, would not just protect and restore or enhance the\r\ncritical areas, but rather that the Department would protect . . . all of the\r\nresources within the coastal zone.\"\r\n     The ALC concluded that DHEC misconstrued its authority:\r\n     In other words, the area for which [DHEC] has regulatory\r\n     authority is the critical area, not the high ground outside the\r\n     critical area. Construing this provision otherwise would lead to a\r\n     substantial expansion of [DHEC]'s authority to regulate the\r\n     development of entire communities. Conceivably, [DHEC] could\r\n     deny critical area permits near towns or cities simply because it\r\n     believes the permits would facilitate upland sprawl and general\r\n     over-development . . . . [DHEC] avers that it has the authority\r\n     through coastal permitting to deny upland development even\r\n     against the Town's approval of that development through its\r\n     zoning process. If the General Assembly had intended to\r\n     authorize such a considerable expansion of [DHEC]'s authority it\r\n     is inconceivable that it would have done so with such general\r\n     language.\r\n\n       We agree with the ALC's conclusion. The importance of the coastal\r\nzone is undisputed, as evidenced by the robust statutory regime of the\r\nCZMA. However, the expansive power sought by DHEC is not reflected\r\nwithin that framework. Administrative agencies possess only those powers\r\nexpressly conferred or necessarily implied to effectively fulfill the duties with\r\nwhich they are charged. See Captain's Quarters Motor Inn, Inc. v. S.C.\r\nCoastal Council, 306 S.C. 488, 490, 413 S.E.2d 13, 14 (1991). Appellants'\r\nargument lacks a necessary link between the critical permit authority of\r\nregulation 30-11(C) and the fulfilling of DHEC's responsibility under the\r\nCZMA. Appellants rely on this statutory language to justify their position\r\nthat critical area permits may be denied due to possible development outside\r\nan actual critical area, but within the coastal zone. However, there is no\r\nevidence that the General Assembly intended such a reading.2\r\n\r\n\r\n2Our decision in Spectre, LLC v. South Carolina Department of Health and\r\nEnvironmental Control, 386 S.C. 357, 688 S.E.2d 844 (2010), is consistent\r\nwith this holding. In that case, DHEC denied Spectre's storm-water/land\r\ndisturbance permit because the department found it inconsistent with various\r\nprovisions of the CZMP, including the following:\r\n      (1)In the coastal zone, OCRM review and certification of permit\r\n         applications for commercial buildings will be based on the\r\n         following policies:\r\n      (b) Commercial proposals which require fill or other permanent\r\n          alteration of . . . wetlands will be denied unless no feasible\r\n          alternatives exist and the facility is water-dependent . . . . The\r\n          cumulative impacts of the commercial activity which exists or\r\n          is likely to exist in the area will be considered.\r\nId. at 364–65, 688 S.E.2d at 847–48.\r\n      Spectre appealed and in reversing DHEC, the ALC held that the CZMP\r\ndid not apply to the property in question. Id. at 362, 688 S.E.2d at 846. This\r\nCourt reversed, finding that the language of the CZMP set forth broad\r\n\njurisdiction over the coastal zone, thereby supporting DHEC's interpretation\r\nof the CZMP regarding the Spectre site. Id. at 369, 688 S.E.2d at 850.\r\n       Spectre sought to fill isolated freshwater wetlands for commercial\r\ndevelopment. The CZMP specifically prohibited this activity, and most\r\ncommercial construction requiring fill of freshwater wetlands. Moreover,\r\nunlike the present case, any adverse effects arose from the immediate impact\r\nof the proposed fill, and not later development which might have occurred if\r\nthe fill permit had been granted. In the instant case, as the ALC observed,\r\nDHEC did not deny the proposed bulkhead/revetment permit based on\r\nimmediate adverse impacts on the critical area, but instead upon an\r\nassumption that the revetment would lead to residential development of the\r\nupland portion of the Spit. While Spectre made it clear that the CZMP had\r\nthe full force of law, the case did not hold that the CZMP authorizes DHEC\r\nto deny critical area permits because of the effects of later development of the\r\nupland area simply because of its location within the coastal zone.\r\n       In Spectre, this Court noted DHEC's indirect authority and then pointed\r\nto a provision of the CZMP which explicitly sanctioned, and served to\r\nlegitimize, DHEC's denial of the permit. No such language exists here. Had\r\nthe General Assembly intended to grant DHEC the power to deny critical\r\narea permits based on possible upland construction, or permitting authority\r\nsuperior to that of almost all local zoning laws within the coastal zone,\r\nspecific and enabling language would have been provided. Simply put,\r\nDHEC's explicit statutory power narrows and confines the department's\r\nindirect authority over the coastal zone.\r\n      According to the dissent, there is a parallel in the instant case. Section\r\n48-39-150(A) directs DHEC to base its permitting decision in part on the\r\npolicies specified in sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30, and ten general\r\nconsiderations. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-150(A) (2008). Subsection 10\r\nrequires DHEC to consider the extent to which the \"proposed use could affect\r\nthe value and enjoyment of adjacent landowners.\" Id. § 48-39-150(A)(10).\r\nThus, necessarily, the dissent argues that subsection 10's language provides\r\ndirect permitting authority over the entire coastal zone via regulation 30-\r\n\n       Our recent decision in Murphy v. South Carolina Department of Health\r\nand Environmental Control, 396 S.C. 633, 723 S.E.2d 191 (2012), is\r\ninstructive. In that case, proposed renovations to Chapin High School\r\nrequired filling a portion of a stream on the property. Id. at 636, 723 S.E.2d\r\nat 193. DHEC issued a permit to District 5 of Lexington and Richland\r\nCounties authorizing the project. Id. at 636–38, 723 S.E.2d at 193–94.\r\nRegulation 61–101 of the South Carolina Code of Regulations requires\r\nDHEC to deny certification if the proposed activity permanently alters the\r\naquatic ecosystem in the vicinity of the project, or if there is a \"feasible\r\nalternative\" with less adverse consequences. Id. at 637, 723 S.E.2d at 193\r\n(citing S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61–101.F.5(a) & (b) (Supp. 2011)). Kim\r\nMurphy, a nearby resident, claimed that in considering the vicinity of the\r\nproject under regulation 61–101, DHECs inquiry should have been limited to\r\nthe actual 727 feet of stream to be filled. Id. at 638, 723 S.E.2d at 194. The\r\nALC rejected this claim, and affirmed the certification. Id. Murphy\r\nappealed. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11(C). Reasonable minds may differ as to whether language referring to the\r\n\"value and enjoyment of adjacent landowners\" is analogous to the type of\r\nexplicit mandate we cited in Specter. To the extent the dissent argues that it\r\ndoes, we disagree. However, there can be no difference of opinion as to\r\nwhether that subsection constitutes enabling language granting DHEC\r\nsupreme permitting authority throughout the broadly defined coastal zone. It\r\nclearly cannot.\r\n       Section 48-39-150 is mentioned in Part II, A only with general\r\nreference to the ten general considerations provided for by the statute. Thus,\r\nit is unclear as to how this provision might serve as the basis of that section.\r\nIn fact, Part II, A is grounded in a description of the ALC's cogent findings\r\nregarding the erosion issues within the critical area, and the impact of the\r\nconstruction on marine resources and wildlife within that area. Nevertheless,\r\nbringing clarity to this point is of no moment with respect to the crucial\r\nissues of this case.\r\n\n      Although the regulation did not define the term vicinity, this Court\r\n\"interprets an undefined term in accordance with its usual and customary\r\nmeaning.\" Id., 723 S.E.2d at 640. Thus, we concluded:\r\n      Merriam–Webster defines vicinity as meaning \"the quality or\r\n      state of being near: proximity\" . . . . Using this accepted meaning\r\n      of the word vicinity, the regulation clearly includes more than\r\n      just the project; it logically incorporates the surrounding area.\r\n      Moreover, a reading to the contrary would render it impossible to\r\n      ever obtain a certification to fill a portion of a stream as the\r\n      functions and values of that area would always necessarily be\r\n      eliminated.\r\nId. (citation omitted).\r\n       In enacting regulation 61–101, the General Assembly intended for\r\nDHEC to consider the impacts proposed construction might have on the\r\nsurrounding area, and thus provided the term vicinity in the regulation.\r\nHowever, regulation 30–11 does not contain such language, and the use of\r\nthe term area, and to what it refers, is not ambiguous. Comm'rs of Pub.\r\nWorks v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 372 S.C. 351, 361, 641\r\nS.E.2d 763, 768 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"We find the statute is ambiguous and,\r\ntherefore, defer to the Board's interpretation.\"). Therefore, the ALC correctly\r\nconcluded that regulation 30-11 does not authorize DHEC to deny a critical\r\narea permit based on its assessment of impacts outside that critical area.\r\n      The ALC concluded that the potential residential development would\r\n\"not have deleterious impacts even if the [c]ourt were to consider the effects\r\nof the potential residential development.\" Moreover, the ALC concluded\r\nthat: [T]he numerous measures and safeguards [Respondent] intends\r\n      to utilize in its development of Captain Sam's demonstrate that\r\n      this limited residential use would be sensitively planned,\r\n      responsive to the natural features of the peninsula, attentive to its\r\n      flora and fauna, and without significant negative effects in the\r\n      critical area . . . . [T]he [c]ourt concludes that there was no\r\n\n      evidence adduced that the residential development would have\r\n      any material adverse environmental effects on the upland.\r\n      Appellants claimed that any residential development at all is per se ill-\r\nplanned and should be denied under the regulation. However, the ALC may\r\nchoose between conflicting evidence, and that decision is no less supported\r\nby substantial evidence. See Coastal, 363 S.C. at 77, 610 S.E.2d at 487\r\n(\"The record contains conflicting evidence concerning the direct and\r\ncumulative effects of building the bridge to Park Island. The evidence that\r\nthe effects will be minimal constitutes substantial evidence supporting the\r\nfinding that the permit complies with the Effects Regulation.\"). Thus, the\r\nALC did not err in refusing to consider impacts outside the critical area under\r\nregulation 30–11(C), and substantial evidence in the record supports the\r\nALC's decision that the proposed project complies with that regulation.3\r\n\r\n3 We recognize the dissent's contrary position with respect to our\r\ninterpretation of regulation 30-11(C). However, we respectfully disagree\r\nwith the notion that we seek to \"have it both ways.\" Instead, we simply have\r\na different view of \"incorporation.\" Regulation 30-11(C) clearly references\r\nsections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30. However, this reference does not translate\r\ninto a grant of permitting authority outside that enumerated by the regulation.\r\nThus, the General Assembly delineated the agency's authority by\r\npromulgating three specified criteria to guide its decision making process.\r\nHad the General Assembly actually incorporated sections 48-39-20 and 48-\r\n39-30 to the extent the dissent suggests, subsections (1)–(3) would likely\r\nhave been unnecessary.\r\n\r\n       In addition, the dissent misapprehends our reliance on regulation 61-\r\n101. It is quite obvious that we do not intend to apply the substance of a\r\nwater quality certification regulation to the facts of the instant case. Instead,\r\ncareful reading of our analysis demonstrates that the General Assembly saw\r\nfit to provide in regulation 61-101 the appropriate term in directing DHEC to\r\nconsider the impacts of proposed construction on the surrounding area. If the\r\nGeneral Assembly intended for DHEC to do the same pursuant to regulation\r\n30-11(C), similar language would have been provided. Contrary to the\r\n\n   B. Regulation 30-12(C)\r\n      The ALC did not err in concluding that the proposed revetment met the\r\nspecific criteria for bulkheads and revetments set forth in regulation 30-12(C)\r\nof the South Carolina Code of Regulations.\r\n        Regulation 30-12(C) provides in pertinent part:\r\n        (c) Bulkheads and revetments will be prohibited where\r\n            marshlands are adequately serving as an erosion buffer, where\r\n            adjacent property could be detrimentally affected by erosion\r\n            or sedimentation or where public access is adversely affected\r\n            unless upland is being lost due to tidally induced erosion.\r\n        (d) Bulkheads and revetments will be prohibited where public\r\n            access is adversely affected unless no feasible alternative\r\n            exists.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(C) (2008).\r\n      Thus, bulkheads and revetments will be prohibited where they restrict\r\npublic access unless upland is being lost to tidally induced erosion, or no\r\nfeasible alternative to the installation of the structure exists.\r\n   i.      Adverse Effects on Public Access\r\n      The ALC concluded that the proposed structure would degrade public\r\nuse of the shoreline, but not eliminate public access. The ALC's order states,\r\n\"Nevertheless, there are other sandy landing spots at low tide in the\r\nimmediate vicinity in general and specifically as a result of the reduction of\r\nthe mat as ordered below.\"\r\n\r\ndissent's opinion, we do not conclude that regulation 30-11(C) should contain\r\nthe word \"vicinity\" or any specific word at all. That is a legislative\r\ndetermination. Instead, we merely assert that the word \"area,\" as used in\r\nregulation 30-11(C), is unambiguous and refers only to the \"critical area\"\r\ngoverned by the regulation. Thus, we described our reasoning in Murphy as\r\n\"instructive.\"\r\n\n       Appellants argue that the ALC's conclusion that some elimination of\r\npublic access is acceptable ignores a \"plain standard of whether public access\r\nis affected period.\" Appellants assert that the regulatory standard does not\r\nallow any adverse effect on public access. However, this interpretation is\r\ninconsistent with the balancing of economic and environmental uses in the\r\ncoastal zone. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-30 (2008) (\"The General\r\nAssembly declares the basic state policy in the implementation of this chapter\r\nis to protect the quality of the coastal environment and to promote the\r\neconomic and social improvement of the coastal zone.\"). The ALC noted\r\nthat public use in the area was \"limited.\" The evidence demonstrates that\r\neven this characterization may be generous.\r\n       Appellants entered into evidence pictures of a party of kayakers on the\r\nbank of the area of the proposed revetment. However, the persons depicted\r\nin the photographs were attending a planned event to pay for CCL legal\r\nexpenses to contest the granting of the permit at issue in this case. Evidence\r\npresented at the hearing confirmed that the sandy bank of the Kiawah River\r\nwould continue for up to 1500 feet beyond the end of the revetment, and that\r\nthe structure would not significantly impact or eliminate public access. The\r\nOCRM project manager testified:\r\n      Q: I recall in your deposition and in your decision document you\r\n          said that you determined that the specific project standards\r\n          found in regulation 30-12(C) do not bar this project; do you\r\n          recall that?\r\n      A: Yeah, the 30-12(C) is the specific regulation that talks about\r\n         bulkheads. \n\r\n      ....\n\r\n      A: And I didn't feel that the regulation gave me the guidance that\r\n         would require me to out and out deny this permit application.\r\n      Q: Why?\r\n      A: Well, I think to some extent the structure will affect public\r\n         access, but I didn't conclude that it's going to be adversely\r\n\n            affected to the level where the entire structure should be\r\n            denied.\r\n         Q: Okay. What did you conclude?\r\n         ....\r\n         A: That there might be some minimal adverse effect on public\r\n            access that was not strong enough to bar the permit from\r\n            being issued.\r\n         Q: Based on the specific project standards?\r\n         A: Yes, based . . . yea, just based on that regulation. \t other\r\n                                                                 In\r\n            words, I could not read 30-12(C) and conclude that I had to\r\n            deny this permit.\r\n       We agree with Respondent's view that Appellants incorrectly equate\r\ntheir ability to access the area subject to the revetment with the public ability\r\nto use that area. As Respondent notes, \"There is no contention that the public\r\ncould not enter upon this area, even if the public's recreational use of the area\r\nwould be slightly modified.\"\r\n       Substantial evidence in the Record supports the ALC's determination\r\nthat the proposed structure did not adversely affect public use pursuant to the\r\nregulation. However, even if public access is affected, the demonstrated loss\r\nof upland and lack of feasible alternatives to the proposed structure support\r\nthe ALC's determination that the project plainly satisfies regulation 30-12.\r\n   ii.     Loss of Upland\r\n      Appellants also argue that Respondent is not losing upland property.\r\nHowever, Respondent presented a horde of evidence demonstrating their loss\r\nof upland due to tidally induced erosion. One witness for Respondent, a\r\nlicensed surveyor, testified that the current distance between what he\r\ndetermined to be the critical line boundary and the setback line in 2009 was\r\n66 feet. In April 2005, the distance was 90 feet, and in September 2002, the\r\ndistance was 104 feet. From 2002 to 2009, the distance has moved\r\n\napproximately 38 feet. The witness also calculated that Respondent lost\r\napproximately 49,856 square feet of upland between September 2002 and\r\nOctober 2008.\r\n     Another witness for Respondent, a licensed engineer, explained the\r\nproposed structure's extension onto the shoreline area:\r\n      Q: Why does the block have to go out that far?\r\n      A: Well, because this is the zone of erosion and we believe that\r\n         the shoreline is going to continue to erode. There's some\r\n         velocity erosion occurring along here, as well, as the erosions\r\n         coming—and that's part of what's causing this whole\r\n         phenomenon.\r\n      In response, Appellants claim that the Spit is accreting, and that it has\r\nactually increased 63.24 acres between 1974 and 2009. Appellants also\r\nclaim that Respondent's own expert, a coastal geologist, testified that the Spit\r\nwill continue to grow for 20–25 years. However, Appellants present an\r\nincomplete recitation of this testimony.\r\n       The expert testified that he expected the oceanfront side of the Spit to\r\ncontinue to sustain itself from incoming sand from the nearby Stono Inlet, but\r\nthat the stretch of bank on the Kiawah River side, the location of\r\nRespondent's upland, was eroding. He further stated that the proposed\r\nconstruction would slow or stop erosion, as is the intended purpose, while at\r\nthe same time posing no danger to Captain Sam's Inlet. Appellants simply do\r\nnot demonstrate a lack of evidence of upland erosion, or that the ALC erred\r\nin assessing Respondent's evidence. Moreover, Appellants urge this Court to\r\nadopt an interpretation of the evidence which runs afoul of the clear language\r\nof section 48-39-30 of the South Carolina Code. That section provides:\r\n      In the implementation of this chapter, no government agency\r\n      shall adopt a rule or regulation or issue any order that is unduly\r\n      restrictive so as to constitute a taking of property without the\r\n      payment of just compensation in violation of the Constitution of\r\n      this State or of the United States.\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-30 (C) (2008).\r\n      The Record supports a view that upland has been lost to tidal erosion,\r\nand to hold otherwise would appear to come close to denying Respondent the\r\nuse of its upland property without just compensation.4\r\n    iii.      Feasible Alternatives\r\n      Appellants argue that the ALC made a conclusory finding that there\r\nwere no feasible alternatives to the proposed structure, and failed to provide\r\nany evidentiary support for this finding.\r\n      Regulation 30-12(C)(1)(d) provides that bulkheads and revetments will\r\nbe prohibited where public access is adversely affected unless no feasible\r\nalternative exists. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(C)(1)(d) (2008). Respondent\r\npresented evidence that the proposed structure is the most environmentally-\r\nsensitive solution. Specifically, Respondent's project engineer testified\r\nregarding alternative systems:\r\n           We looked at . . . a number of alternatives investigated [sic],\r\n           bulkhead, riprap, to geo-tubes, a number of things that could have\r\n           been used, and it was our recommendation that they use the\r\n           concrete mats . . . . [F]rom all the systems that we were aware of,\r\n4 In Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 304 S.C. 376, 379–82, 404\r\nS.E.2d 895, 897–98 (1991), the General Assembly enacted legislation that\r\nprevented development seaward of setback lines, in an effort to protect the\r\nstate's beach and dune environment in the interest of the public. An affected\r\nlandowner claimed that the legislation was a regulatory taking without just\r\ncompensation because he was unable to construct more than a walkway on\r\nhis property. Id. This Court upheld the regulation, and the United States\r\nSupreme Court reversed. Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003,\r\n1028 (1992). The Supreme Court refused to allow a taking without\r\ncompensation based solely on the public's interest in preserving the beach\r\narea, and remanded the case to this Court for a determination as to whether a\r\nprinciple of common law nuisance or property existed for denying the\r\nlandowner's intended use of his property. Id.\r\n\n      it seemed like that is the softest most compatible system out there\r\n      . . . . We've seen them used in other locations where they become\r\n      completely naturalized. It's kind of in keeping with the whole\r\n      essence of Kiawah where . . . we also need engineering solutions\r\n      that blend with the environment we're creating.\r\n      The ALC also noted:\r\n      CCL urged that the \"alternative\" is to do nothing and leave the\r\n      property as status quo since, they suggested, little erosion may\r\n      have occurred in the last 10-12 months. However, the testimony .\r\n      . . clearly established a trend of continuous and significant\r\n      shoreline erosion along the riverbank for several decades. That\r\n      evidence clearly establishes a need for erosion control along the\r\n      disputed shoreline.\r\n      The ALC determined that Respondent lost upland due to tidal erosion,\r\nand that no feasible alternatives existed to stop continuing loss. The\r\nregulation contemplates an adverse impact on public access when these\r\nconditions are met. Therefore, the ALC did not err in the application of\r\nregulation of 30-12, and substantial evidence in the Record supports the\r\ncourt's determinations.        CONCLUSION\r\n      The essence of Appellants' argument is rooted in dissatisfaction with\r\nthe verbiage and structure of the ALC's order, and not in actual errors of law\r\nor the absence of substantial evidence. The ALC acted within the permissible\r\nscope of its authority in modifying the existing permit to include a structure\r\nno larger than that requested by Respondent or initially reviewed by DHEC.\r\nOn appeal of a contested case, we must affirm the ALC if the findings are\r\nsupported by substantial evidence. Comm'rs. of Pub. Works, 372 S.C. at\r\n357–58, 641 S.E.2d at 766.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\nBEATTY, J., concurs. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in result in a\r\nseparate opinion. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in\r\nwhich HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I concur in result. I write separately because I\r\nagree with Justice Pleicones that the administrative law court (ALC) erred in\r\nits construction of the relevant statutes and regulations. As Justice Pleicones\r\npersuasively articulates, \"permitting decisions are not to be made in a\r\nvacuum.\" For example, Reg. 30-11 speaks broadly to the parameters of what\r\nthe Office of Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) should consider in\r\nassessing whether to issue a permit in the critical area, as OCRM must\r\nconsider \"the general character of the area.\" Reg. 30-11(C)(1). Subsection\r\n(B) of Reg. 30-11 further mandates that OCRM must be guided by the broad\r\npolicies found in §§ 48-39-20 and -30, including \"the urgent need to protect\r\nand give high priority to natural systems in the coastal zone while balancing\r\neconomic interests.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-20(F). Thus, the ALC\r\nerred in construing the law to restrict the Department of Health and\r\nEnvironmental Control's consideration to the permit's effect on the critical\r\narea only. The dissent's view of legislative intent fits like a glove with the\r\nstatutory and regulatory language, as well as the common sense\r\nunderstanding that a project in a critical area may indeed have a profound\r\nimpact on the surrounding area.\r\nHowever, unlike the dissent, I do not believe the error requires reversal. This\r\nis so because, in my judgment, the learned trial judge further and carefully\r\nconsidered the evidence concerning the effect of the permit on the \"uplands,\"\r\nand found the permit was properly granted under what I believe to be the\r\nproper construction of the relevant law:\r\n      Additionally, in this instance, the potential residential\r\n      development will not have deleterious impacts even if the Court\r\n      were to consider the effects of the potential residential\r\n      development. OCRM and [Coastal Conservation League] do not\r\n      challenge KDP's history of environmentally sensitive\r\n      development methods, permit adherence record, or any of the\r\n      specific strategies, methods, and approaches that KDP will use in\r\n      its limited presidential development of Captain Sam's. Rather,\r\n      they urge that any residential development at all, regardless of\r\n\n      safeguards and protections, on the now-undeveloped Captain\r\n      Sam's highland peninsula along the ocean and river, is per se \"ill-\r\n      planned.\" The Court concludes that the numerous measures and\r\n      safeguards KDP intends to utilize in its development of Captain\r\n      Sam's demonstrate that this limited residential use would be\r\n      sensitively planned, responsive to the natural features of the\r\n      peninsula, attentive to its flora and fauna, and without significant\r\n      negative effects on the critical area. Even though consideration\r\n      of the effects of the upland is beyond the purview of the\r\n      regulation, the Court concludes that there was no evidence\r\n      adduced that the residential development would have any\r\n      material adverse environmental effects on the upland.\r\nThese additional findings of the ALC are supported by substantial evidence.\r\nAs a result, while I agree with the analytical framework and view of\r\nlegislative intent as set forth in the dissent, I would affirm the ALC in result\r\nonly due to its secondary findings under the proper legal framework.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent because, in my opinion, this\r\nappeal presents legal questions of regulatory and statutory interpretation and\r\nnot, as the majority views it, questions of substantial evidence. In my\r\nopinion, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) committed an error of law in\r\ninterpreting 23A S.C. Reg. 30-11(C), and the error requires we reverse the\r\nappealed order and remand for further proceedings. Moreover, the entirety of\r\nthe order is affected by the ALJ's erroneous view of the balancing required by\r\nstatutes in the coastal permitting process, an error which also mandates\r\nreversal and reconsideration.\r\nThe Spit is part of South Carolina's coastal zone,5 and the structure which is\r\nat issue here would be constructed in the critical area.6 It is the policy of the\r\nState to balance development in the coastal zone with concern for sensitive\r\nand fragile coastal areas.7\r\nUnder the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), appellant Department of\r\nHealth and Environmental Control (DHEC), through the Office of Coastal\r\nResource Management (OCRM), was required to develop a comprehensive\r\ncoastal management program (CMP) for the coastal zone, and was given the\r\nresponsibility to enforce and administer the CMP. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-\r\n80 (2008); Spectre, LLC v. South Carolina Dep't of Health and Enviro. Cont.,\r\n386 S.C. 357, 688 S.E.2d 844 (2010). DHEC was also required by statute to\r\nenact rules and regulations to enforce the CMP. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-80.\r\nSection 48-39-150 states the general considerations to be used by OCRM in\r\ndetermining whether to issue a permit for construction in the critical area, and\r\nreiterates that the policies found in § 48-39-20 and § 48-39-30 must be\r\nhonored. The General Assembly required that, in determining whether to\r\npermit erosion devices such as the ones at issue here, OCRM must act in the\r\nmanner it \"deem[ed] most advantageous to the State\" in order to promote\r\npublic health, safety, and welfare; to protect public and private property from\r\nbeach and shore destruction; and to ensure the continued use of tidelands,\r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-10(B).\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n6 S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-10(J).\n\r\n7 S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-30(B)(1); 49-39-20(F).\n\r\n\nsubmerged lands, and waters for public purposes. S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-\r\n120(F).\r\nOCRM is charged with two separate, but interrelated responsibilities. As\r\nexplained in the CMP,\r\n            Two types of management authority are granted in two\r\n            specific areas of the State. [OCRM]8 has direct control\r\n            through a permit program over critical areas…Direct\r\n            permitting authority is specifically limited to these critical\r\n            areas. Indirect management authority of coastal resources\r\n            is granted to [OCRM] in…the coastal zone….\"\r\n            CMP, Chapter II, cited in Spectre, LLC, supra.\r\nPursuant to the authority granted it by the CZMA, DHEC has promulgated\r\npermitting regulations \"to guide the wise preservation and utilization of\r\ncoastal resources.\" Regulation 30-11 is entitled \"General Guidelines for All\r\nCritical Areas.\" Subsection (B) restates the general considerations for\r\npermitting in critical areas found in § 48-39-150, and specifically states that\r\n\"In assessing the potential impacts of projects in the critical area, [OCRM]\r\nwill be guided by the policy statements in Sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30 . .\r\n. .\" Subsection (C), entitled \"Further Guidelines\" reiterates that OCRM's\r\npermit decisions in the critical areas must be based in part on the policies in\r\n§§ 48-39-20 and-30, and specifically requires that OCRM take into\r\nconsideration:\r\n            (1) The extent to which long-range, cumulative effects of\r\n            the project may result within the context of other possible\r\n            developments and the general character of the area.\r\n            Reg. 30-11 C(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8The CMP refers to the Coastal Council, which was abolished in 1994 when its\r\nauthority was transferred to OCRM. See 1993 Act. No. 181.\r\n\nRead in its entirety, Reg. 30-11 is consistent with the two-prong management\r\napproach stated in the CMP. While OCRM's permitting authority is limited\r\nto critical areas, it is charged with managing the entire coastal zone, and thus\r\npermitting decisions are not to be made in a vacuum. For example, Reg. 30-\r\n11(B)\r\nspecifically provides that in assessing the potential impact of critical area\r\nprojects, OCRM must be guided by the CZMA policies found in §§ 48-39-20\r\nand -30, both of which are concerned with the coastal zone and its\r\nvulnerability to manmade alterations. See § 48-39-20(B), (D), (E), and (F); §\r\n48-39-30(A), (B)(1), (2), (5), and (E). Reg. 30-11(C) reiterates the need for\r\nthe public policies found in these two statutes to be considered in making\r\npermitting decisions pursuant to § 48-39-150, the statute governing this\r\nbulkhead and revetment. Subsection (C)(1) specifically refers to the long-\r\nrange cumulative effects of permitting a project in the critical area \"within the\r\ncontext of other possible development and the general character of the area.\"\r\nBoth appellants contend the ALC misconstrued Reg. 30-11(C)(1) and\r\nmisunderstood and misapplied the CZMA. I agree.\r\nA. CZMA\r\nThe majority first discusses the ALC's application of the CZMA, that is, §§\r\n48-39-20 and -30. See Part II A, supra. In holding that the ALC correctly\r\nfound that \"the proposed construction\" met the policy concerns expressed in\r\nthe statutes, the ALC and the majority focus not solely on the\r\nbulkhead/revetment erosion device sought to be permitted, but also on\r\nwhether the \"potential limited residential development transgresses the\r\npolicies set forth in these two statutes.\" As the majority notes, the ALC\r\nweighed the cost of permitting construction of an erosion control device in a\r\ncritical area against the benefit to KDP if it can build on the reinforced Spit. I\r\nstrongly disagree with the ALC's and the majority's focus on the potential\r\neconomic benefit to a private landowner if the proposed bulkhead/revetment\r\nis built, rather than on the benefit, if any, to the public at large of such\r\nconstruction.\r\n\nWe have long held that a purely economic benefit is insufficient as a matter\r\nof law to establish an overriding public interest and \"does not meet the stated\r\npurpose of the [CZMA] to protect, restore, or enhance resources of the State's\r\ncoastal zone for present and succeeding generations. This public interest\r\nmust counterbalance the good of economic improvement. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 48-39-30(B)(1) and (2).\" South Carolina Wildlife Fed. v. South\r\nCarolina Coastal Council, 296 S.C. 187, 371 S.E.2d 521 (1988); see also 330\r\nConcord Street Neighborhood Ass'n v. Campsen, 309 S.C. 514, 424 S.E.2d\r\n538 (Ct. App. 1992). The ALC and the majority misunderstand and misapply\r\nthe balancing test required by CZMA, allowing a \"purely economic benefit\"\r\ninuring only to a private landowner to outweigh our State's public policy\r\nmandate that \"[c]ritical areas shall be used to provide the combination of uses\r\nwhich will insure the maximum benefit to the people, but not necessarily a\r\ncombination of uses which will generate measurable maximum dollar\r\nbenefits.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-30(D). This error in construction and\r\napplication of the CZMA mandates reversal.\r\nB. Regulation 30-11(C)\r\nThe majority concludes that \"there is no evidence that the General Assembly\r\nintended that critical area permits may be denied due to possible development\r\noutside an actual critical area but within the coastal zone,\" and that appellants\r\nfailed to establish \"a necessary link between the critical permit authority of\r\nRegulation 30-11(C) and the fulfilling of DHEC's responsibility under the\r\nCZMA.\" In my opinion, \"the missing link\" is found in the language of the\r\nRegulation 30-11(C) itself, which specifically references the policies found in\r\n§ 48-39-20 and § 48-39-30, i.e., the CZMA. As explained below, I cannot\r\nreconcile the majority's discussion of § 48-39-20 and -30 in Part II A with its\r\nanalysis in Part III of Regulation 30-11(C)(1).\r\nIn construing §§ 48-39-20 and 48-39-30, the majority considers KDP's\r\nresidential development plans for the upland areas of the Spit, part of the\r\ncoastal zone, not just the erosion control issue, a critical area project, to be\r\nthe proper subject of inquiry. See Part II A, supra. When called upon to\r\ninterpret Reg. 30-11, however, the majority holds that there is no evidence\r\nthat the General Assembly intended for OCRM to consider anything other\r\n\nthan the bulkhead/revetment's impact on the critical area itself. See Part III\r\nA, supra. This holding ignores that Reg. 30-11 itself requires DHEC to be\r\nguided by, and base its decisions at least in part \"on the policies specified in\r\nSections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30 . . . .\" Reg. 30-11(B); Reg. 30-11(C). The\r\nmajority cannot have it both ways, first holding that the residential\r\ndevelopment is the proper focus under the statutes, but also that under Reg.\r\n30-11, which specifically incorporates these two statutes, only the\r\nbulkhead/revetment's impact on the critical area may be considered. The\r\nALC's order is affected by an error of law in that he misapprehended the\r\nproper scope of inquiry under Reg. 30-11. This error requires reversal.\r\nIn my opinion, the majority also errs when it adopts the ALC's narrow\r\nreading of the term \"area\" as used in Reg. 30-11(C)(1). \"Critical Area\" is a\r\ndefined term in Regulation 30. See Reg. 30-1(D)(15). The majority ignores\r\nthat when the regulation refers to a \"critical area\" it uses both words, and that\r\nto read \"area\" as \"critical area\" in this subsection deprives OCRM of its\r\nstatutory obligation to enforce the public policy of this State in the coastal\r\nzone.9 Thus, when Reg. 30-11 uses the term \"Critical Area,\" it is referring to\r\na specific defined term. \"Critical Area\" is not the same as \"Area\" when used\r\nin this regulation. Young v. SCDHEC, 383 S.C. 452, 680 S.E.2d 784 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009) [ALC properly considered area surrounding proposed dock site\r\nunder Reg. 30-11(C)(1)]. Since the ALJ's decision was controlled by his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The majority finds much comfort in the fact that 25A Reg. 61-101 (2011), which\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nis titled \"Water Quality Certification,\" and which \"establishes procedures and\r\npolicies for implementing State water quality certification requirements of Section\r\n401 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1341\" instructs DHEC to take into\r\nconsideration the impact of the proposed project on \"the aquatic ecosystem in the\r\nvicinity of the project.\" The majority concludes that since Reg. 30-11 does not use\r\nthe term \"vicinity\" as does Reg. 61-101, and since \"area\" is not an ambiguous term,\r\nDHEC cannot deny a permit based on its assessment of impacts outside the critical\r\narea. I fail to see the relevance of a term used in the water quality regulation to a\r\nCoastal Division regulation, especially a regulation that requires DHEC to \"to be\r\nguided by . . . long-range, cumulative effects of the [bulkhead/revetment on] . . .\r\nthe general character of the area.\"\r\n\nerroneous belief that all permitting decisions in the critical area must be\r\ndecided in a vacuum, this error of law requires we reverse and remand.\r\nIn determining that he could not consider the impact beyond the critical area,\r\nthe ALJ also opined that to do so would allow OCRM to \"deny critical area\r\npermits near towns or cities simply because it believes the permits would\r\nfacilitate upland sprawl and general over-development.\" He went on to state,\r\n\"In fact, [an OCRM witness] testified he denied the revetment . . . other than\r\nadjacent to Beachwalker Park, because he believed potential residential\r\ndevelopment would destroy the pristine habitat of Captain Sam's. Thus\r\n[OCRM] avers that it has the authority through coastal permitting to deny\r\nupland development even against [municipal] approval of that development\r\nthrough its zoning process.\" In my opinion, by law OCRM must take into\r\naccount the impact of any critical area permit on upland sprawl, general\r\noverdevelopment, and pristine habitats since Reg. 30-11(C) specifically\r\nincorporates the policies found in §§ 48-39-20 and -30, as well as specifying\r\nthat the regulation is in aid of fulfilling DHEC's permitting responsibility\r\nunder § 48-39-150.10 As the ALJ is the fact finder in this proceeding,11 he too\r\nis charged with these duties and responsibilities.\r\nFurther, the ALC misapprehends the interplay between the DHEC permitting\r\nprocess and local zoning laws. The granting of an OCRM permit does not\r\npreempt local zoning requirements any more than a project permitted by local\r\n\r\n\r\n   The majority reads Spectre LLC to limit DHEC's authority to deny critical area\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\npermits based upon possible future construction to situations when such a\r\nconsideration is \"explicitly sanctioned.\" Assuming that such an explicit sanction\r\nby the General Assembly is required, I refer the reader to S.C. Code Ann. § 48-39-\r\n150(A) (2008), which reiterates that the decision on any critical area permit must\r\nbe based in part upon \"the policies specified in Sections 48-39-20 and 48-39-30\"\r\nand § 48-39-150(A)(10), requiring permitting decisions to consider \"The extent to\r\nwhich the proposed use could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners.\"\r\nThus, consideration of a critical area permit's effect on future use of property\r\noutside the critical area itself is \"sanctioned,\" and in fact is the basis of the\r\nmajority's analysis in Part II A of its opinion.\r\n   S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-600(A) (Supp. 2010).\r\n11\r\n\nzoning ordinances is exempt from state environmental regulation. See\r\nRockville Haven LLC v. Town of Rockville, 394 S.C. 1, 714 S.E.2d 277\r\n(2011). Local zoning ordinances serve one purpose in the coastal zone, while\r\nState statutes, the CMP, and regulations serve another. The ALJ's order is\r\naffected by an error of law requiring reversal.\r\nI would reverse and remand as the ALJ's order rests on a fundamental\r\nmisunderstanding of the role of OCRM in managing the State's coastal zone,\r\nand of the considerations pertinent to issuance of a permit for an erosion\r\ncontrol device in the critical area. The ALJ's errors of law require that he\r\nreevaluate the evidence and reexamine his findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw using the correct legal standards. Moreover, despite the dissent's\r\nrepeated specific references to OCRM's permitting authority in the critical\r\narea, more than ten by my count, the majority insists that I would give the\r\nagency \"direct permitting authority over the entire coastal zone.\" I am\r\ncompelled to respond to the majority's patently erroneous characterization of\r\nmy position.\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27223","title":"Landers v.

Respondent Christopher Landers\r\nserved as Appellant Atlantic Bank & Trust's executive vice president pursuant to\r\nan employment contract. The contract contained a broad arbitration provision,\r\n\nrequiring arbitration of \"any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this\r\ncontract, or breach thereof.\" In the underlying action, in which Landers alleges\r\nfive causes of action, Landers claims he was constructively terminated from his\r\nemployment as a result of Appellant Neal Arnold's tortious conduct towards\r\nhim. Appellants moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the employment\r\ncontract. The trial court found that only Landers' breach of contract claim was\r\nsubject to the arbitration provision, while his other four causes of action comprised\r\nof several tort and corporate claims were not within the scope of the arbitration\r\nclause. We disagree.\r\n\r\nLanders' pleadings provide a clear nexus between his claims and the employment\r\ncontract sufficient to establish a significant relationship to the employment\r\nagreement. We find the claims are within the scope of the agreement's broad\r\narbitration provision. Thus, we reverse the trial court's order and hold that all of\r\nLanders' causes of action must be arbitrated.\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Landers and two other individuals founded Atlantic Bank & Trust\r\n(Bank).1 Landers purchased 50,000 shares of common stock of Bank's holding\r\ncompany, Atlantic Banc Holdings, Inc. (Holding Company). On February 20,\r\n2007, Landers and Bank entered into a written employment agreement\r\n(Agreement). The Agreement contained an arbitration provision which stated:\r\n\"Except matters contemplated by Section 17 below [Applicable Law and Choice of\r\nForum], any controversy or claim arising out of relating to this contract, or the\r\nbreach thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration . . . .\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe Agreement provided for an initial term of three years' employment for Landers\r\n\r\n1Bank is a federally-chartered savings bank with branches in South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. In June 2011, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a former federal\r\nagency under the United States Department of Treasury, took possession of the\r\nbusiness and property of Bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance\r\nCorporation (FDIC) as its receiver. In April 2012, the FDIC disallowed Landers'\r\nclaim he submitted pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(5) (2006). However,\r\nsubsection (d)(6) permits a claimant, as a matter of right, to continue an action\r\ncommenced before the appointment of the receiver. Neither the FDIC nor\r\nAppellants oppose the action's continuation before this Court.\r\n\nas Executive Vice President and Chief Mortgage Officer and automatic extensions\r\nfor successive one-year terms unless either party gave written notice of an intent\r\nnot to extend the contract. The Agreement also stated that after Holding Company\r\nestablished a stock incentive plan, Landers was to receive an option to purchase\r\n65,000 shares of common stock of Holding Company and provided for a lump-sum\r\npayment of 2.99 times Landers' base pay in the event his employment was\r\nterminated within one year after a change of control.2\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Agreement, Landers was to perform his duties \"subject to the\r\ndirection of the [CEO]\" and \"diligently follow and implement all reasonable and\r\nlawful management policies and decisions communicated to him by the [CEO].\"\r\nLanders was required to \"devote substantially all of his time, energy and skill\r\nduring regular business hours to the performance of the duties of his\r\nemployment . . . and faithfully and industriously perform such duties.\" Finally, the\r\nAgreement expresses what constituted termination for \"cause\" and Landers was\r\nauthorized to terminate the Agreement for cause based upon \"a material diminution\r\nin the powers, responsibilities, duties or compensation of [Landers]\" thereunder.\r\n\r\nBank, like most, suffered financial hardship as a result of the economic collapse in\r\nthe fall of 2008. In May 2009, Bank's Board of Directors (Board) hired Neal\r\nArnold to serve as CEO and Landers voluntarily accepted the position of\r\npresident.3 Thereafter, Arnold began soliciting out-of-state investors to\r\nrecapitalize Bank. Landers claims he was assured by Arnold that his job was safe\r\ndespite the impending recapitalization. According to Landers, however, since\r\nArnold's arrival, he was \"systematically and deliberately stripped of his authority\"\r\nas president. Landers contends Arnold began a campaign to \"discredit, belittle,\r\ndemean, and constructively terminate\" him. Arnold and other executives stated\r\n\"Landers had ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder] and was incompetent to perform\r\nhis job\" and \"incapable of effectively communicating with anyone in performing\r\nhis job.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2Under the Agreement, a reorganization that results in current stockholders of\r\nBank or Holding Company immediately prior thereto owning less than fifty\r\npercent (50%) of the combined voting power constitutes a change of control.\r\n3Landers began serving as Bank's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in October of\r\n2008.\r\n\nLanders alleges that these and other statements were made in front of numerous co-\r\nworkers. He also claims Arnold's behavior towards him was verbally abusive,\r\ndemeaning, and generally unprofessional and improper. According to Landers,\r\nArnold routinely called him offensive names and used unseemly language towards\r\nhim in front of upper-level management and other co-workers. In one instance,\r\nLanders contends Arnold even threatened him in a highly aggressive and volatile\r\nmanner when Landers came to the defense of a junior co-worker. Beginning in\r\nSeptember 2009, Landers alleges he was forced to sign in and out whenever he left\r\nthe office and was required by Arnold to enlist the help of other management\r\npersonnel when communicating with a certain client because Arnold asserted he\r\nwas not capable of handling these discussions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Landers contends Arnold steadily and purposefully provided\r\nincorrect information to him about the status of Bank's management. Landers\r\nclaims he was not permitted to see documentation regarding the recapitalization or\r\ntakeover despite repeatedly asking for such information. The pertinent documents\r\nrevealed a new management team and Board, neither of which listed Landers as a\r\nmember. Landers also asserts Arnold repeatedly assured him that he would be\r\nentitled to receive payment for the \"Change in Control\" pursuant to the Agreement,\r\nwhich Appellants now refuse. According to Landers, Appellants also refuse to\r\noffer him stock options to which he is entitled under the Agreement.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 2009, Landers sent a letter to Arnold \"recognizing his\r\nconstructive termination.\" Landers expressed he was writing the letter \"as a result\r\nof [Arnold's] actions over the past six months, especially those over the last 30\r\ndays.\" In the letter, Landers claims Arnold \"acted to effectively destroy [his]\r\nauthority and ability to perform [his] job.\" In one section, the letter states:\r\n\r\n      You have made a concerted effort to undermine my authority,\r\n      removed much of my authority, changed my duties, have defamed me\r\n      in front of co-workers, and generally made it impossible for me to\r\n      perform as President. You continue to withhold vital information and\r\n      misrepresent facts. As a result, you have effectively terminated me\r\n      from my position as President of Atlantic Bank.\r\n\r\nArnold accepted Landers' letter of constructive termination several days later.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2010, Bank and Holding Company sent a Notice of Special Meeting\r\nand Proxy to their shareholders. The Notice contained information regarding new\r\n\ninvestors and proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation. According to\r\nLanders, the Notice and Proxy Statement contained incomplete and misleading\r\ninformation concerning the effect the recapitalization would have on shareholders\r\nof common stock.4 Landers alleges he was \"forced out\" of Bank as a result of the\r\nconcerns that he expressed regarding Arnold's campaign to provide incorrect\r\ninformation about the recapitalization. In his complaint, Landers states: \"As a\r\nresult of Landers' concerns, and in an effort to eliminate Landers as a potential\r\nproblem, he was stripped of much of his authority as President, defamed, and then\r\nterminated by Atlantic Bank.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, Landers contends he was excluded from his role as a director on the Board\r\nin \"an ongoing effort to freeze [him] out and strip him of his authority.\" According\r\nto Landers, when he was not permitted to call in to a special Board meeting in May\r\n2010, he went to the meeting in person and was asked to recuse himself. Landers\r\nrefused to recuse himself and claims he was ejected from the meeting. Landers\r\nalleges he is no longer provided necessary information or authority to serve in his\r\ncapacity as a director.5\r\n\r\nLanders commenced this action in January 2010. In his complaint, Landers'\r\nasserted five causes of action: (i) breach of contract/constructive termination; (ii)\r\nslander/slander per se; (iii) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (iv) illegal\r\nproxy solicitation pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 33-7-220(i) (Supp. 2011);6 and (v)\r\n\r\n4Landers contends the proposed transaction and amendments to the Articles of\r\nIncorporation would allow the takeover company, through appointed directors, to\r\npay dividends on its preferred stock but not the common stock. It would also allow\r\ndirectors to take other actions detrimental to the common shareholders, including\r\nLanders, and force their share values to zero.\r\n5Appellants admit Landers was asked to recuse himself from the Board meeting\r\ndue to the ongoing litigation and the potential conflict of interest. Appellants\r\ncontend Landers tendered his resignation from the Board in June 2010.\r\n6   The text of the statute reads:\r\n\r\n         A proxy may not be solicited on the basis of any proxy statement or\r\n         other communication, written or oral, containing a statement which, at\r\n         the time and in light of the circumstances under which it was made,\r\n         was false or misleading with respect to a material fact or which omits\r\n\nwrongful expulsion as a director. Appellants moved to compel arbitration pursuant\r\nto the arbitration clause contained in the Agreement and to dismiss or stay the\r\naction. The trial court ordered arbitration for Landers' breach of\r\ncontract/constructive termination claim. However, the trial court denied\r\nAppellants' motion to compel arbitration as to the remaining causes of action. In\r\ndoing so, the court found there was not a significant relationship between the\r\nclaims and the Agreement. Alternatively, the court found the allegations\r\nunderlying the claims were unforeseeable at the time the parties entered into the\r\nAgreement. Thus, the trial court stayed the breach of contract claim and ordered\r\nthat the remaining four claims proceed to court.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\n\"The question of arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination\r\nunless the parties provide otherwise.\" Partain v. Upstate Automotive Group, 386\r\nS.C. 488, 491, 689 S.E.2d 602, 603 (2010). \"The determination of whether a claim\r\nis subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.\" Id. (citing Gissel v. Hart,\r\n382 S.C. 235, 240, 676 S.E.2d 320, 323) (2009)). However, in deciding whether\r\nthe parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration, a court is not\r\nto rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims. Zabinski v.

Once it is determined that the FAA applies to a dispute, federal\r\nsubstantive law regarding arbitrability controls. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\r\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 US. 614, 626 (1985) (\"[T]he first task of a court\r\nasked to compel arbitration of a dispute is to determine whether the parties agreed\r\nto arbitrate that dispute.

Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995)\r\n(\"When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter . . . courts\r\ngenerally . . . should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation\r\nof contracts.\"). Although the intention of parties is relevant, as a matter of policy,\r\narbitration agreements are liberally construed in favor of arbitrability. Am.\r\nRecovery, 96 F.3d at 94.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of this state and federal law to favor arbitration and \"any doubts\r\nconcerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of\r\narbitration.\" Id. at 92 (citing Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Co.,\r\n460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983)); accord Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 118.\r\n\"'The heavy presumption of arbitrability requires that when the scope of the\r\narbitration clause is open to question, a court must decide the question in favor of\r\narbitration.'\" Am. Recovery, 96 F.3d at 94 (quoting Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v.\r\nMonumental Life Ins. Co., 867 F.2d 809, 812 (4th Cir. 1989)). Such a presumption\r\nis strengthened when an arbitration clause is broadly written. AT&T Tech., Inc. v.\r\nCommc'ns Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643, 650 (1986). Therefore, \"'unless it may\r\nbe said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an\r\ninterpretation that covers the asserted dispute[,]'\" arbitration must generally be\r\nordered. Am. Recovery, 96 F.3d at 92 (quoting Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co.,\r\n363 U.S. at 582-83); Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 119.\r\n\r\nA clause which provides for arbitration of all disputes \"arising out of or relating to\"\r\nthe contract is construed broadly. See, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin\r\nMfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 398 (1967) (labeling as \"broad\" a clause that required\r\narbitration of \"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this\r\nAgreement\"). Courts have held that such broad clauses are \"capable of an\r\nexpansive reach.\" Am. Recovery Corp., 96 F.3d at 93. Both the Fourth Circuit\r\nCourt of Appeals and this Court have held that the sweeping language of broad\r\narbitration clauses applies to disputes in which a significant relationship exists\r\nbetween the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is\r\n\ncontained. J.J. Ryan & Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Textile, S.A., 863 F.2d 315,\r\n319 (4th Cir. 1988); Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119. Thus, the scope\r\nof the clause does \"not limit arbitration to the literal interpretation or performance\r\nof the contract [, but] embraces every dispute between the parties having a\r\nsignificant relationship to the contract.\" J.J. Ryan, 863 F.2d at 321. In applying\r\nthis standard, this Court \"must determine whether the factual allegations\r\nunderlying the claim are within the scope of the arbitration clause, regardless of the\r\nlegal label assigned to the claim.\" Id. at 319; Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 53 S.E.2d\r\nat 118.\r\n\r\nIt is within this framework that we must determine whether Landers' claims are\r\nwithin the scope of the Agreement's arbitration clause.\r\n\r\n                                         A.\r\n\r\nLanders contends that the tort claims of slander and intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress are not within the scope of the arbitration clause.7 Specifically,\r\nLanders asserts they are not subject to arbitration because they do not require\r\nreference to or construction of the Agreement. We disagree and find Landers' tort\r\nclaims bear a significant relationship to the Agreement, such that they must be\r\narbitrated.\r\n\r\nIn support of his contention, Landers suggests the situation before us is\r\nindistinguishable from McMahon v. RMS Electronics, Inc., 618 F. Supp. 189\r\n(S.D.N.Y. 1985). In that case, after McMahon's employment was terminated by\r\nRMS, he brought a lawsuit alleging eight causes of action, including three\r\ndefamation claims. McMahon alleged that one week before his termination, the\r\npresident of RMS stated to another employee that McMahon was the \"company\r\ndrunk\" and was \"interfering with the president's operation of the company.\" The\r\nNew York district court denied RMS's motion to compel arbitration as to this\r\ndefamation claim. The court stated \"although the statements regarding McMahon's\r\ndrinking habits may be relevant to his claim of wrongful termination, the resolution\r\nof the defamation claim does not require reference to the underlying contract\" and\r\n\"does not require an interpretation of the contractual agreement between the two\r\n\r\n7 Because Landers expressly states in his complaint that the slanderous statements\r\nwere encompassed in his claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, we\r\nfind it appropriate to analyze the related claims together.\r\n\nparties.\" Id. at 193. The court further stated \"the defamation claim is not arbitrable\r\nsimply because the statements were made during the term of McMahon's\r\nemployment.\" Id.\r\n\r\nWe find McMahon unpersuasive. Certainly, arbitration is only required where the\r\nparties have contracted for it, and \"the exact content of the allegedly defamatory\r\nstatement must be closely examined to see whether it extends to matters beyond\r\nthe parties' contractual relationship.\" Leadertex, Inc. v. Morganton Dyeing &\r\nFinishing Corp., 67 F.3d 20 (2d Cir. 1995); see also Brown v. Coleman Co., 220\r\nF.3d 1180, 1184 (10th Cir. 2000) (finding that a defamatory explanation which\r\ndealt with the termination of plaintiff's employment and his supposed violation of\r\nhis employment contract was within the scope of a broad arbitration clause).\r\nHowever, under the expansive reach of the FAA a tort claim need not raise an\r\nissue that requires reference to or the construction of some portion of the contract\r\nin order to be encompassed by a broadly-worded arbitration clause. See J.J. Ryan,\r\n863 F.2d at 321 (finding that under the significant relationship test, broad\r\narbitration clause does not limit arbitration to literal interpretation or performance\r\nof the contract).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the allegedly defamatory statements made in McMahon related to the\r\nemployee's general character, whereas here, Landers asserts that the alleged\r\ntortious conduct and defamatory statements of Arnold directly related to Landers'\r\nability to perform his duties with Bank. Cf. Fleck v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 891\r\nF.2d 1047 (2d Cir. 1989) (statements that broker had lost his license and was\r\n\"basically a criminal\" were relevant to job performance and within the scope of\r\narbitration clause arising out of employment or termination of employment, but not\r\nstatement that broker was disbarred by lawyer). Landers alleges outrageous\r\nstatements and conduct that \"generally made it impossible for [him] to perform as\r\nPresident.\" He asserts the alleged tortious conduct of Arnold \"discredit[ed],\r\nbelittle[d], demean[ed], and constructively terminate[d]\" him. Furthermore, he\r\nclaims the statements were intended to create an impression he was \"incapable of\r\nperforming his job effectively.\"\r\n\r\nWe find Landers' tort claims bear a significant relationship to the Agreement. The\r\nAgreement contains not only monetary rights and obligations, but also articulates\r\nthe duties and obligations of Landers and provides that Landers is subject to the\r\ndirection of the employer, requiring him to diligently follow and implement all\r\npolicies and decisions of the employer. Furthermore, the Agreement contemplates\r\nwhat constitutes cause for termination, including a \"material diminution in []\r\n\npowers, responsibilities, duties or compensation.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in light of the breadth of the Agreement and the particular manner in which\r\nLanders has pled his underlying factual allegations, we find Landers' tort claims\r\nsignificantly relate to the Agreement. The perceived inability to perform one's job\r\ncertainly relates to an employment contract.8 Even assuming the arbitrability of the\r\nclaims was in doubt, which it is not, we cannot say with positive assurance that the\r\narbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that Landers' slander and\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claims are covered by the clause. Thus,\r\nwe reverse the trial court's order denying Appellants' motion to compel the causes\r\nof action of slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\n\r\n                                         B.\r\n\r\nLanders also contends that his corporate claims of illegal proxy solicitation and\r\nwrongful expulsion as director are not within the scope of the arbitration\r\nprovision. Certainly, the question of whether Landers' corporate claims are within\r\nthe scope of the arbitration clause is admittedly closer than his tort claims\r\ndiscussed above. However, we find untenable Landers' assertion that these\r\ncorporate claims do not bear a significant relationship to the terms and conditions\r\nof his employment contract or any breach thereof. In any event, we cannot say\r\nwith positive assurance that such claims are not within the scope of the arbitration\r\n\r\n8 See Gillepsie v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., No. 08-689, 2009 WL 890579\r\n(W.D. Pa. March 30, 2009) (finding broad arbitration clause applied to claims of\r\nsexual harassment and retaliation because the claims related to employee's business\r\nrelationship with Colonial, not merely disputes relating to specific provisions of\r\nthe contract in accordance with South Carolina law); Smith v. Cato, No. 3:05CV99,\r\n2006 WL 1285521 (W.D.N.C. May 9, 2006) (finding plaintiff's defamation claim,\r\nwhich was based on allegations of employee's gross negligence and misconduct as\r\nthe grounds for termination, bore a significant relationship to the employment\r\nagreement); Orcutt v. Kettering Radiologists, Inc., 199 F. Supp. 2d 746 (S.D. Ohio\r\n2002) (finding claims based on discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that\r\noccurred during the course of employment clearly arose out of or related to\r\nplaintiff's employment agreement); Stanton v. Prudential Ins., Co., No. 98-4989,\r\n1999 WL 236603 (E.D. Pa. April 20, 1999) (noting that tort claim of intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress was arbitrable since it arose directly from the\r\ncircumstances leading to plaintiff's termination from employment).\r\n\nclause within the Agreement. Thus, we hold these claims are also subject to\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nIllegal Proxy Solicitation\r\n\r\nThe essence of Landers' illegal proxy solicitation claim is that the proxy statement\r\nissued by Bank was materially misleading as to the effect the recapitalization could\r\nhave on the common shareholders, including Landers.\r\n\r\nAlthough Landers' status as a shareholder did not originally derive from the\r\nAgreement,9 the Agreement does in fact contemplate his status as a shareholder.\r\nBy Landers' own allegation, Appellants were required to grant him an option to\r\npurchase 65,000 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the Agreement.10\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Agreement's arbitration clause mandates arbitration of \"any\r\ncontroversy or claim arising out of relating to this contract, or the breach thereof.\"\r\n(emphasis added). Landers' allegations provide a direct link between his status as a\r\nshareholder and the purported breach of the Agreement. Specifically, Landers\r\nclaims that \"because [he] stated his concerns and sought complete, accurate\r\ninformation regarding the transactions [including recapitalization and amendments\r\nto the Articles of Incorporation] and its potentially adverse effects, he was forced\r\nout of Atlantic Bank causing him further injury.\" Landers further states, \"But for\r\nthe proxy solicitation and other misleading information, [he] would not have\r\nquestioned the material omissions leading to his termination.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOldroyd v. Emira Sav. Bank, FSB, 134 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 1998) is instructive here.\r\nIn Oldroyd, the plaintiff, a former vice president of a bank, alleged he was\r\nwrongfully discharged because he informed the United States Treasury Department\r\nof illegal loan activity occurring at the bank. In finding the plaintiff's retaliatory\r\ndischarge subject to arbitration, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated:\r\n\r\n         In alleging retaliatory discharge, Oldroyd asserts that he was\r\n         unlawfully terminated by his employer because he informed [the\r\n\r\n9According to the Record, Landers purchased 50,000 shares of stock when he\r\nfounded Bank, not pursuant to any provision in the Agreement.\r\n10   Landers alleges Appellants have refused to grant him such option.\r\n\n      Treasury Department] of the illegal loan activity occurring at ESB.\r\n      Inasmuch as more than half of Oldroyd's employment contract relates\r\n      to the subject of termination from employment, there can be no doubt\r\n      that a retaliatory discharge claim touches matters covered by the\r\n      employment contract. For example, the contract addresses such\r\n      matters as what constitutes \"cause\" for termination, benefits to be\r\n      provided after termination, notice requirements for termination,\r\n      termination upon change of control, and related matters. Accordingly,\r\n      we conclude that since Oldroyd alleges that he was terminated under\r\n      circumstances giving rise to a retaliatory discharge claim, such claim\r\n      touched matters covered by the employment agreement and therefore\r\n      is clearly within the scope of the agreement's arbitration clause.\r\n\r\n134 F.3d at 77.\r\n\r\nSimilarly here, Landers' pleadings link the alleged illegal proxy solicitation to his\r\nwrongful termination and the resulting breach of the Agreement. Thus, we\r\nconclude his illegal proxy solicitation claim is significantly related to the\r\nAgreement. Moreover, this Court cannot say with positive assurance that the\r\nproxy cause of action is not within the scope of the arbitration clause. Because\r\nany doubt must be resolved in favor of arbitration, we reverse the trial court and\r\nfind Landers' illegal proxy solicitation claim must be arbitrated.\r\n\r\nWrongful Expulsion as Director\r\n\r\nWith regard to his wrongful expulsion claim, Landers asserts that he was \"frozen\r\nout\" of and improperly excluded from his role as a member of the Board since\r\nfiling the initial summons and complaint on January 21, 2010. He contends his\r\nposition has materially changed, such that he has suffered a reduction in duties and\r\nauthorities in his capacity as director.\r\n\r\nLanders' pleadings do not inform the Court how he came to be a director and\r\nnothing in the Agreement contemplates Landers' position as a director. Thus, we\r\nare compelled to conclude that his status as a director does not derive from the\r\nAgreement. Nonetheless, Landers asserts that he was wrongfully expelled\r\nbecause he filed suit for breach of the Agreement. As we previously referenced,\r\nthe Agreement mandates arbitration of any claim arising out of or relating to the\r\nbreach of the Agreement. By Landers' own contention, the breach of the\r\nAgreement resulted in his expulsion as a director. Similar to Landers' proxy\r\n\nsolicitation claim, we find the wrongful expulsion claim bears a significant\r\nrelationship to the Agreement or breach thereof. See Oldroyd, 134 F.3d at 77\r\n(finding that because plaintiff alleged he was terminated under circumstances that\r\ngave rise to a retaliatory discharge claim, the claim touched matters covered by the\r\nemployment contract and thus was within the scope of the contract's arbitration\r\nclause). Thus, we reverse the trial court's order denying Appellants' motion to\r\ncompel arbitration of the wrongful expulsion as director claim.\r\n\r\nWe stress that our decision today is driven by the strong policy favoring\r\narbitration, the nature of the Agreement, and Landers' underlying factual\r\nallegations. Certainly, we recognize that even the broadest of clauses have their\r\nlimitations. However, Landers has essentially pled himself into a corner with\r\nrespect to each of his claims. Indeed, he has provided a clear nexus between the\r\nunderlying factual allegations of each of his claims and his inability to perform the\r\nemployment Agreement and the alleged breach thereof, such that all of his causes\r\nof action bear a significant relationship to the Agreement. Thus, we reverse the\r\ntrial court with respect to Landers' remaining four causes of action and hold that\r\neach is to be arbitrated.11 In doing so, we also reject the trial court's alternative\r\nruling that the claims are not subject to arbitration because they were not\r\nforeseeable.                              C.\r\n\r\nWe take this occasion to revisit federal jurisprudence regarding the analytical\r\nframework to determine whether a broad arbitration clause encompasses certain\r\nclaims. In the last several decades, two terms—supposedly synonymous—have\r\nemerged as leading phraseologies in the analysis. Some jurisdictions, including\r\nthis Court and the Fourth Circuit, utilize the \"significant relationship\" term, which\r\nwe have employed today. Others have preferred the \"touch matters\" phrase,\r\nholding that broad arbitration clauses encompass all claims that \"touch matters\"\r\ncovered by the contract or agreement. See, e.g., 3M Co. v. Amtex Sec., Inc., 542\r\nF.3d 1193, 1199 (8th Cir. 2008) (noting the liberal federal policy favoring\r\narbitration requires that a court send a claim to arbitration \"when presented with a\r\n\r\n11 We find it unnecessary to address Appellants' remaining argument regarding the\r\npropriety of the potential stay of any non-arbitrable claims. See Futch v.\r\nMcAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999)\r\n(appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue\r\nis dispositive).\r\n\nbroad arbitration clause . . . as long as the underlying factual allegations simply\r\n'touch matters covered by' the arbitration provision\"); Brayman Constr. Corp. v.\r\nHome Ins. Co., 319 F.3d 622, 626 (3d Cir. 2003) (\"[I]f the allegations underlying\r\nthe claims 'touch matters' covered by an arbitration clause in a contract, then those\r\nclaims must be arbitrated, whatever the legal labels attached to them.\").\r\n\r\nIn theory, the two terms are interchangeable. See Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., 175\r\nF.3d 716 (9th Cir. 1999) (broad clause reaches every dispute having a significant\r\nrelationship to the contract and all disputes having their genesis in the contract and\r\nthe allegations only need \"touch matters\" covered by the contract); Pennzoil\r\nExploration & Prod. Co. v. Ramco Energy Ltd., 139 F.3d 1061 (5th Cir. 1998)\r\n(discussing that broad arbitration clauses embrace all disputes between the parties\r\nhaving a significant relationship to the contract and holding it is only necessary\r\nthat the dispute touch matters covered by the agreement to be arbitrable).\r\n\r\nYet, over time and in the context of certain cases, it appears a tension has\r\ndeveloped regarding interpretations of the two terms. The phrase \"significant\r\nrelationship\" has arguably evolved to impose an enhanced burden on the party\r\nseeking to compel arbitration. Conversely, \"touch matters\" has been increasingly\r\nconstrued as requiring a lesser showing on the party desiring arbitration. This\r\ntension surrounding the tests for arbitrability and the policy favoring arbitration has\r\nbeen candidly acknowledged by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \"We\r\nrecognize that requiring a significant relationship in order to compel arbitration . . .\r\nappears to be at odds with the language of the [] arbitration clause, which only\r\nrequires that the [] claims \"relate to\" the [agreement]. We recognize as well that to\r\nrequire such a significant relationship may appear to be in tension with the\r\nSupreme Court's mandate that we apply the ordinary tools of contract interpretation\r\nin construing an arbitration agreement, and resolve any ambiguities in favor of\r\narbitration.\" Wachovia Bank Nat'l Assoc. v. Schmidt, 445 F.3d 762, 767 n.5 (4th\r\nCir. 2006) (emphasis in original)).\r\n\r\nWe believe that these terms—\"significant relationship\" and \"touch matters\"—were\r\nnever intended to be separate and independent tests for analyzing the scope of a\r\nbroad arbitration clause. We employ the \"significant relationship\" term today only\r\nbecause it is in keeping with our jurisprudence. We merely observe that the two\r\nterms were not intended to differ in any meaningful way. Nonetheless, we note\r\nthat if ever there did appear to be an appreciable conflict between the two\r\nphraseologies in the future, given the text of the FAA, the United States Supreme\r\nCourt's interpretation of such, and the strong policy favoring arbitration, we would\r\n\nnecessarily find that the \"touch matters\" term hues more closely to Congressional\r\nintent concerning the FAA.              IV.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we reverse the trial court with respect to each of Landers' remaining\r\nfour causes of action and hold that each is subject to arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED. \n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27224","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\n                     FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On April 8, 2005, at approximately 3:30 a.m., Appellant called his friend,\r\nseventy-four year old Henry Turner (the Victim), and falsely informed him that\r\nAppellant's father had died. Appellant arrived at the Victim's residence around\r\n4:00 a.m. Later that morning, the Victim drove to a nearby McDonald's restaurant\r\nfor breakfast. After returning with breakfast, sometime later that morning, the\r\nVictim was shaving in front of his bathroom mirror. Appellant approached the\r\nVictim from behind with a gun and a pillow as a silencer, and shot him in the back.\r\nAppellant then struck the Victim in the head, and fatally shot him in the chest.\r\n\r\n      Appellant stole the Victim's gray Mazda truck and fled the scene. On the\r\nevening of April 8, Appellant visited Columbia's Vista district. Appellant held\r\nhimself out as a resident of New York City, visiting South Carolina to close a \"big\r\ndeal.\" Appellant proceeded to spend large amounts of cash and buy drinks for\r\nseveral people he met that night.\r\n\r\n       On April 9, Appellant travelled to Augusta, Georgia and visited Surrey\r\nTavern. There, Appellant met a woman, and convinced her that he was a\r\nbusinessman in town for The Master's Golf Tournament. Appellant and the\r\nwoman spent the next several days together, and Appellant stayed at her apartment.\r\nThe two attended church services together on Sunday, April 10, and she introduced\r\nAppellant to her co-workers on Monday, April 11. Appellant left the woman's\r\napartment at approximately 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 12. Later that day, the\r\nwoman recognized Appellant's picture in the newspaper with a headline alerting\r\nher to his alleged involvement in the Victim's murder. She notified police and\r\nassisted in Appellant's arrest. Appellant possessed the Victim's vehicle at the time\r\nof his arrest. Police searched the vehicle and recovered a bag containing a .357\r\nMagnum caliber double-action revolver, .38 caliber bullets, and a checkbook\r\nbelonging to the Victim. Testing later revealed that the .357 Magnum fired the\r\nbullets recovered from the Victim's body.\r\n\r\n       On August 25, 2005, the Horry County Grand Jury indicted Appellant for\r\nthe Victim's murder and armed robbery. The case proceeded to trial, and Appellant\r\nrelied on an insanity defense. Specifically, Appellant averred that he suffered from\r\ncentral nervous system dysfunction, and at the time of the Victim's murder he did\r\nnot understand \"legal right from wrong.\" On November 16, 2009, a jury found\r\nAppellant guilty of murder and armed robbery. Three days later, following the\r\nconclusion of the trial's penalty phase, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n\nthe existence of the requisite statutory aggravating circumstance and recommended\r\nthe trial court sentence Appellant to death. Consequently, the trial court sentenced\r\nAppellant to the maximum twenty years' imprisonment for armed robbery and to\r\ndeath by lethal injection for the Victim's murder.\r\n\r\n                                  ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\nI.\t     Whether the trial court erred by instructing the jury that malice could\r\n        be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon where Appellant\r\n        presented an insanity defense.\r\n\r\nII.\t    Whether the trial court erred in accepting Appellant's waiver of his\r\n        trial counsel's conflict of interest where that counsel was subject to a\r\n        pending accusation of ineffective assistance of counsel for his\r\n        representation of Appellant in a prior capital murder case.\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Whether the trial court erred in refusing to disqualify a juror who\r\n        acknowledged she knew that Appellant received the death penalty for\r\n        a prior capital murder, and stated unequivocally that she would vote to\r\n        impose death in every instance where the State proved an aggravating\r\n        circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIV.\t    Whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to grant a\r\n        change of venue.\r\n\r\nV.\t     Whether the trial court erred by allowing all jurors over sixty-five to\r\n        opt out of jury service.\r\n\r\nVI.\t    Whether the trial court erred by ruling that Appellant's execution did\r\n        not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\n                                    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n                       I.     Jury Instruction on Inferred Malice\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could\r\ninfer malice from the use of a deadly weapon where Appellant presented an\r\ninsanity defense. We agree.\r\n\n       A jury charge instructing that malice may be inferred from the use of a\r\ndeadly weapon is no longer good law in South Carolina where evidence is\r\npresented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse, or justify the homicide. State v.\r\nBelcher, 385 S.C. 597, 600, 685 S.E.2d 802, 803–04 (2009). In Belcher, the jury\r\nconvicted the defendant of murder and possession of a firearm during the\r\ncommission of a violent crime. Id. at 600, 685 S.E.2d at 803. During a gathering\r\nof family and friends, the victim and another man began arguing. The defendant\r\nintervened, and later shot and killed the victim. Id. at 601, 685 S.E.2d at 805.\r\n\r\n       Testimony at trial demonstrated conflicting versions of the event. Id. The\r\nState's evidence tended to show that after the defendant confronted the victim, the\r\ndefendant retrieved a gun and without justification, fatally shot the victim. Id. The\r\ndefendant presented evidence that the victim confronted him without provocation,\r\nand with a gun, following the apparent resolution of the argument. Id. The\r\ndefendant claimed he subsequently retrieved a gun and fired on the victim as he\r\napproached. Id. In accordance with long-standing practice, the trial court\r\ninstructed the jury that \"malice may be inferred by the use of a deadly weapon,\"\r\nand the jury convicted the defendant of murder. Id.\r\n\r\n      This Court reversed, and rejected the traditional jury instruction as\r\ninconsistent with our policy-making role in the common law:\r\n\r\n      The use of the term \"intentional\" is instructive. Say for example, a\r\n      homicide occurs by the use of a deadly weapon under circumstances\r\n      warranting a self-defense instruction. The killing would be\r\n      intentional, yet under our currently sanctioned charge, the jury would\r\n      be permitted to find malice merely because \"if one intentionally kills\r\n      another with a deadly weapon, the implication of malice may arise.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 610, 685 S.E.2d at 809 (citing State v. Elmore, 279 S.C. 417, 421, 308 S.E.2d\r\n781, 809 (1983), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 69\r\nn.5, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 n.5 (1991)). The Court also held that the error in Belcher\r\ncould not be considered harmless:\r\n\r\n      Evidence of self-defense was presented, thereby highlighting the\r\n      prejudice resulting from the charge. It is entirely conceivable that the\r\n      only evidence of malice was [the defendant]'s use of a handgun. We\r\n      need go no further than saying we cannot conclude the error was\r\n      harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\nId. at 611–12, 685 S.E.2d at 809–10 (\"In many, if not most, murder cases the\r\n[inferred malice from the use of a deadly weapon] charge will be harmless, even if\r\ncouched in terms of a presumption . . . . Obviously[,] when a defendant walks into\r\na store [and] shoots and robs the clerk, a charge that the jury may infer malice is\r\nnot prejudicial to the defendant.\" (alterations in original)).\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, Appellant presented evidence he had a brain abnormality.\r\nA psychiatric expert testified that he performed a psychiatric evaluation and\r\nneurological exam on Appellant, and that Appellant demonstrated mild signs\r\nconsistent with brain dysfunction, including central nervous system dysfunction.\r\nAccording to this expert, Appellant also demonstrated the typical signs of anti-\r\nsocial personality disorder or psychopathy, and at the time of the crime, \"you could\r\nargue\" Appellant did not understand moral or legal right from wrong, as his brain\r\ncould not process the events. In other words:\r\n\r\n      Based on the interview, the review of the records, the neurological\r\n      evaluation, the brain-imaging evaluation, and the fact that he has\r\n      received diagnoses of anti-social personality disorder . . . and the—\r\n      limitations or impairments that anti-socials or psychopaths have, one\r\n      of the major ones they have is an appreciation for the wrongfulness, or\r\n      the moral wrongfulness and legal wrongfulness of their actions at the\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n        An expert in physiological psychology testified that Appellant suffered\r\ndamage to the frontal lobe of his brain from two separate incidents. The first\r\nincident occurred during Appellant's birth when his brain received a reduced\r\noxygen supply. The second incident occurred during Appellant's teen-age years\r\nwhen he received a blow to the back of his head from a beer bottle, driving his\r\nbrain forward. Appellant presented psychiatric testimony that he had diminished\r\nor lowered function of his brain in the frontal lobe areas, and that there \"could\" be\r\na causal connection between diminished function in the frontal lobe and mental\r\nillness. An expert in neuropsychology and neuroimaging testified that scans of the\r\nright hemisphere of Appellant's brain exhibited damage. According to this expert,\r\nthe damage occurred in the medial gray matter of Appellant's brain at four standard\r\ndeviations below normal, and an individual with this type of \"extreme\" damage\r\nwould have some type of temporal lobe epilepsy. A medical doctor with expertise\r\nin Positron Imaging Tomography (P.E.T.) scans and neuropsychiatric disorder\r\ntestified regarding the actual injury to Appellant's frontal lobe. This expert\r\ntestified that the damaged lobe of Appellant's brain played an important role in\r\nimpulse control, judgment, and empathy. In fact, he stated, \"This abnormally low\r\n\nfunction or abnormality or injury would significantly compromise and impair an\r\nindividual's ability to exercise judgment, impulse control, control of aggression.\"\r\n      The trial court in this case issued a jury instruction regarding both express\r\nand implied malice:\r\n\r\n      Malice aforethought could either be express or implied. Express\r\n      malice is shown when a person speaks words which express hatred or\r\n      ill-will for another, or when the person prepared beforehand to do the\r\n      act which was later accomplished. Malice can be inferred from a\r\n      conduct showing a total disregard for human life. Inferred malice\r\n      may also arise when the deed is done with a deadly weapon.\r\n\r\n        Appellant's trial counsel took exception to the trial court's instruction, and\r\nargued that Belcher prevented an inferred malice charge, \"[W]e would assert that,\r\nin this case, that insanity too is a self-defense, and we would think that the same\r\nrationale would apply to this case, and we would ask that charge be deleted, and\r\nthey be so instructed, and that portion of that be deleted.\" The trial court overruled\r\ntrial counsel's objection, and decided to include the objected-to portion of the\r\ncharge:\r\n\r\n      I have read thoroughly State [v.] Belcher, [385 S.C. 597, 685 S.E.2d\r\n      802 (2009)] decided by the South Carolina Supreme Court in\r\n      October—on October 12, 2009. I find nothing, absolutely nothing in\r\n      the Supreme Court opinion that would so indicate—certainly doesn't\r\n      direct, but even indicate, in any way, that it would be proper under\r\n      these circumstances for the [c]ourt to charge—or delete that as far as\r\n      the inference of malice. The Supreme Court didn't indicate that in the\r\n      slightest. Now—so I respectfully decline to do that.\r\n\r\n       It is unclear what this Court could have included in Belcher to better indicate\r\nto the trial court the impropriety of an instruction that malice could be inferred\r\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon in this case. Appellant certainly presented\r\nevidence which could have reduced, mitigated, or excused the Victim's murder.\r\nThe language of Belcher is clear, that when this type of evidence is submitted, an\r\ninstruction regarding inferred malice from the use of a deadly weapon is improper.\r\nSee Belcher, 385 S.C. at 612 n.10, 685 S.E.2d at 810 n.10 (\"We overrule all cases\r\ninvolving a homicide or charge of assault and battery with intent to kill where two\r\nfactors co-exist: (1) approval of the jury instruction that malice may be inferred\r\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon; and (2) evidence was presented that, if believed,\r\nwould have reduced, mitigated, excused, or justified the homicide or the charged\r\n\n[assault and battery with intent to kill.]\") Thus, the trial court erred. However, we\r\nmust determine whether that error requires reversal.\r\nHarmless Error\r\n\r\n      Errors, including erroneous jury instructions, are subject to a harmless error\r\nanalysis. Belcher, 385 S.C. at 611, 685 S.E.2d at 809. Jury instructions should be\r\nconsidered as a whole, and if as a whole, they are free from error, any isolated\r\nportions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error. State v.\r\nAleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 27, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2000).\r\n\r\n       In Belcher, we observed that often in murder cases there will be\r\noverwhelming evidence of malice, apart from the use of a deadly weapon. Id. at\r\nn.8 (\"In many, if not most, murder cases the [inferred malice from the use of a\r\ndeadly weapon] charge will be harmless, even if couched in terms of a\r\npresumption . . . . Obviously[,] when a defendant walks into a store [and] shoots\r\nand robs the clerk, a charge that the jury may infer malice is not prejudicial to the\r\ndefendant.\" (alteration in original)). The instant case is similar.\r\n\r\n       The State presented uncontested evidence that Appellant shot the Victim, his\r\nelderly and unarmed friend, in the back using a pillow as a silencer. Appellant\r\nthen robbed the Victim, and for the next several days used his automobile to travel\r\nacross the state, where he engaged in social activities and drinking. Authorities\r\napprehended Appellant in possession of the Victim's vehicle and the gun used in\r\nthe murder. Thus, the evidence of malice in this case is not limited to Appellant's\r\nuse of a deadly weapon. See Belcher, 385 S.C. at 612, 685 S.E.2d at 810 (\"It is\r\nentirely conceivable that the only evidence of malice was Belcher's use of a\r\nhandgun.\").\r\n\r\n       Additionally, we must consider the jury instruction as a whole, and if as a\r\nwhole the instruction is free from error, any isolated portions which may be\r\nmisleading do not constitute reversible error. Aleksey, 343 S.C. at 27, 538 S.E.2d\r\nat 251. This Court will not reverse a trial court's decision regarding a jury\r\ninstruction absent an abuse of discretion. Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529\r\nS.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, the trial court issued a jury instruction consistent with\r\nevidence presented by both the State and Appellant. The trial court charged the\r\njury that they could return verdicts of not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity,\r\nguilty but mentally ill, and guilty. Therefore, if the jury believed that Appellant\r\ncould not distinguish moral or legal right from wrong, they could have found him\r\n\nnot guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, the jury could have found that\r\nAppellant's mental disease or defect prevented him from conforming his conduct to\r\nthe requirements of the law, regardless of whether he could make the necessary\r\nmoral or legal distinctions. Nothing in the trial court's inferred malice charge\r\nwould have prevented the jury from reaching either of these conclusions.\r\n\r\n       The trial court instructed the jury that inferred malice may arise when the\r\n\"deed is done with a deadly weapon.\" The trial court also stated that malice \"can\r\nbe inferred from conduct showing total disregard for human life.\" Appellant only\r\ncontests the \"deadly weapon\" language. However, if the jury rejected Appellant's\r\ninsanity defense, which it did, the jury could also find that Appellant's conduct\r\nshowed a total disregard for human life. Thus, Appellant could not have suffered\r\nprejudice from any separate inference that his use of a deadly weapon also gave\r\nrise to an inference of malice.\r\n\r\n      Therefore, although the trial court's charge in this case failed to comply with\r\nBelcher, this does not constitute reversible error.\r\n\r\n                      II.    Trial Counsel's Conflict of Interest\r\n\r\n       Prior to this trial, a jury found Appellant guilty of a separate murder and\r\nrecommended a sentence of death. State v. Stanko, 376 S.C. 571, 573, 658 S.E.2d\r\n94, 95 (2008). William Diggs represented Appellant at that trial, and Appellant\r\nrequested that Diggs represent him in the instant case, as well. However,\r\nAppellant also filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) application collaterally\r\nattacking Diggs's prior representation on the ground that he provided ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel. Appellant argues that this gave rise to a conflict of interest,\r\nand that the trial court erred in accepting Appellant's \"inadequate\" waiver of this\r\nconflict. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       On November 15, 2006, the trial court held a hearing to determine\r\nAppellant's representation in this case. Diggs stated at that hearing that he did not\r\nknow of any reason that would preclude his availability for appointment.\r\nAppellant spoke at that hearing, expressing his satisfaction with Diggs's efforts in\r\nthe prior trial and requesting Diggs represent him a second time:\r\n\r\n      So, what I'm saying to you is if you choose to appoint [Diggs] as\r\n      counsel I have no problem with that and would greatly appreciate it\r\n      actually . . . . I'm familiar with the law. I'm not an idiot to the law and\r\n\n      I don't and would not raise any kind of argument concerning . . . his\r\n      representation.\r\n\r\n       On December 8, 2008, the PCR court held a hearing regarding Appellant's\r\nPCR application. At that hearing, Appellant explained his desire to proceed with a\r\nPCR application against Diggs, but at the same time retain his representation in the\r\ninstant case:\r\n\r\n      The conundrum that I have is that: In the same sense, this [PCR] may\r\n      have allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against him. My\r\n      argument is . . . just because I feel he may have been ineffective in the\r\n      first case does not mean that he'll make those same ineffective\r\n      mistakes in the second; because he's learned from them, or may see\r\n      them differently. So my conundrum is I don't want to lose him;\r\n      because I believe in him. He knows my case. He's the one who had\r\n      the test ordered and found out everything that was wrong with my\r\n      medial frontal lobe. I don't want to lose him.\r\n\r\n       The trial court next conducted a hearing on March 4, 2009, to discuss the\r\npotential conflict arising from the PCR application and trial counsel's continued\r\nrepresentation. The trial judge noted that the continued representation could be a\r\n\"downright\" disqualification of Diggs as trial counsel. However, Appellant\r\nexplained that he filed the PCR application to \"stop the death watch\" after this\r\nCourt turned down his direct appeal. Appellant insisted that the court allow him to\r\nretain Diggs as trial counsel:\r\n\r\n      I can't say, Your Honor, this is what I'm going to file, but if we play\r\n      worst case scenario and I did file ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n      against [Diggs] on any issues, understanding the Strickland\r\n      [Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687–89 (1984)] two-prong\r\n      test, but that's still prerequisite that I wouldn't trust or believe in him\r\n      to handle this case, (A) if he did commit errors that, let's say, he even\r\n      determined as being errors, by looking at that case, I believe that\r\n      [Diggs] would say, \"Maybe I should have done this differently,\" and\r\n      in this particular case, which is going use a very similar defense,\r\n      wouldn't he have learned from that? (B) Even if I did file them, is it\r\n      not a situation where it would have no effect on this case as long as I\r\n      do trust and believe in him and his efforts toward this case?\r\n\n       The trial court responded by explicitly asking Appellant whether he wanted\r\nto retain Diggs:\r\n\r\n      The Court: If I understand you correctly that you want [Diggs] to\r\n                 remain as lead counsel and remain as one of your\r\n                 attorneys in this particular case?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes.\r\n\r\n      Appellant continued an unprompted monologue requesting that Diggs\r\nrepresent him regardless of the pending PCR application:\r\n\r\n      [B]efore I jump away, I'm going to use an analogy. (A) There's a\r\n      Solicitor that was in this case and that has been sanctioned by the\r\n      State for previous misconducts [sic], but he is still a Solicitor. (B) I'm\r\n      going to use a baseball analogy. If you have Derek Jeter, and in the\r\n      ninth inning of the final game of the World Series he commits an error\r\n      that costs the Yankees the game, that doesn't mean that you don't want\r\n      him back starting next season, and I do. One thing about [Diggs] is he\r\n      does believe in my case and he understands it's a very in-depth case\r\n      concerning the defect in my brain, and I would ask—what I don't want\r\n      to do is say, \"Well, Your Honor, is the only way that I can keep\r\n      [Diggs] is to say that I'm going to waive any [claim]?\r\n\r\n       To this the trial court responded: \"No sir. I'm not asking you to do that.\"\r\nThe trial court then asked Diggs whether he found any conflict in his continued\r\nrepresentation of Appellant. Diggs responded that he did not, but that the trial\r\ncourt may want to revisit the issue if it appeared later that the PCR theories and the\r\ntheories used in the instant trial worked to undermine Appellant's case:\r\n\r\n      Based upon the—your statements to the Court, and the Court's\r\n      questioning of [Appellant], [Appellant]'s statements to me, that I will\r\n      keep [Diggs] as counsel here in this particular matter with the ability\r\n      for the Court to re-visit in the future should there be any issues in the\r\n      amended application that either gives the Court any concern, or\r\n      [Appellant], or [Diggs] concerns as to [Diggs] continued\r\n      representation in this matter.\r\n\r\n     On June 5, 2009, the trial court heard the State's Motion to Review Status of\r\nCounsel. The State took issue with what it believed to be an \"apparent direct\r\n\nconflict of interest,\" based on the filing of Appellant's PCR application against\r\nDiggs. Diggs stated that he did not feel the PCR application had impacted his\r\nrelationship with Appellant, his ability to communicate with him, or his ability to\r\neffectively represent him in any way. Appellant stated that he had the opportunity\r\nto confer with his PCR attorneys, but that nothing had changed regarding his desire\r\nto retain Diggs.\r\n\r\n      The trial court then engaged in a detailed colloquy with Appellant regarding\r\nthe potential conflict:\r\n\r\n      The Court: Do you continue to want to have [Diggs] represent you in\r\n                 this action?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes sir, I do.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right sir, and do you feel that there is a free and open\r\n                 communication between you and [Diggs] despite the fact\r\n                 that the [PCR] application has been filed?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes, sir, there is.\r\n\r\n      The Court: And you are able to fully discuss all issues that you deem\r\n                 necessary with him?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right sir, and have you found in any way that he is\r\n                 unresponsive to you or in any way . . . harboring any ill\r\n                 feelings to you because of the filing of the [PCR]\r\n                 application?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Not only is he not now, but I do not believe that when we\r\n                 file the supplemental . . . there will be any problems at that\r\n                 time.\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      Appellant: The issues that we're going to raise that have him in it have\r\n                 nothing to do with any issues that would create a conflict\r\n                 or any argument or I feel cause any communicative\r\n                 problems between [Diggs] and myself. They're more at\r\n\n                   trial situations that should have been objected to, things of\r\n                   that nature, and there is, there are two issues. But sir, I do\r\n                   not believe that [Diggs] and I are going to have any\r\n                   problems presenting the second trial.\r\n\r\n      Thus, the trial court concluded that Appellant \"more than expressed\" full and\r\ncomplete confidence in Diggs's abilities, and permitted Diggs to continue his\r\nrepresentation of Appellant.\r\n\r\n   A. Preservation\r\n\r\n       Appellant's argument that the trial court erred regarding an apparent conflict\r\nby his trial counsel is unpreserved. This Court has explained the rationale\r\nunderlying issue preservation as follows:\r\n\r\n      The losing party must first try to convince the lower court it has ruled\r\n      wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the appellate court that\r\n      the lower court erred. This principle underlies the long-established\r\n      preservation requirement that the losing party generally must both\r\n      present his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling\r\n      before an appellate court will review those arguments.\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      Imposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to\r\n      enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all\r\n      relevant facts, law, and arguments.\r\n\r\nI'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724–25\r\n(2000) (citing Roche v. S.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm'n, 263 S.C. 451,\r\n211 S.E.2d 243 (1975)). This explanation is especially pertinent to this case.\r\n\r\n       Appellant did not object to the appointment of Diggs as counsel, but instead\r\nemphatically requested that Diggs continue to represent him. Additionally, both\r\nthe trial court and the PCR court questioned Appellant as to the wisdom of\r\ncontinuing with Diggs as trial counsel, and verified that Appellant had no\r\nobjections to this arrangement. Appellant never raised a single objection. Thus, he\r\navoided the critical first step of preservation: convincing the trial court that it ruled\r\nincorrectly. Appellant cannot argue now on direct appeal that the trial court erred\r\nin acquiescing to his express and informed desire.\r\n\n   B. Waiver\r\n\r\n        Even if Appellant had somehow preserved his arguments for our review, the\r\ntrial court did not err. To the extent that this situation gave rise to a conflict of\r\ninterest, implicating any constitutional right, Appellant was fully informed of that\r\nconflict. Appellant's extensive endorsement of Diggs's continued representation\r\nconstituted a valid waiver. See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970)\r\n(\"Waivers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be knowing,\r\nintelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and\r\nlikely consequences.\"). Appellant cannot now complain of an error which his own\r\nconduct induced. See State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, 455, 385 S.E.2d 827, 829\r\n(1989) (\"The record in this case clearly establishes that any shortage of time to\r\nprepare a defense was not the fault of the trial judge or the State, but rather the\r\nfault of [the defendant] in failing to act.\").\r\n\r\n      Appellant's argument regarding trial counsel's alleged conflict is\r\nunpreserved. The lack of preservation notwithstanding, the Record demonstrates a\r\nknowing and intelligent waiver of any possible conflict.\r\n\r\n                             III.   Juror Disqualification\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to disqualify a juror\r\nwith prior knowledge of Appellant's unrelated crimes who stated unequivocally\r\nthat she would vote to impose the death penalty in every instance in which the\r\nState proved an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n       A prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his views on capital\r\npunishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as\r\na juror in accordance with instructions and his oath. State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283,\r\n290–91, 621 S.E.2d 883, 886 (2005). When reviewing the trial court's\r\nqualification of prospective jurors, the responses of the challenged juror must be\r\nexamined in light of the entire voir dire. Id. at 291, 621 S.E.2d at 886. The\r\ndetermination of whether a juror is qualified to serve in a capital case is within the\r\nsole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on appeal unless wholly\r\nunsupported by the evidence. Id. A juror's disqualification will not be disturbed\r\non appeal if there is a reasonable basis from which the trial court could have\r\n\nconcluded that the juror would not have been able to faithfully discharge his\r\nresponsibilities as a juror under the law. Id. at 291, 621 S.E.2d at 887.\r\n\r\n   A. Prior knowledge\r\n\r\n       Juror #480 stated during voir dire that she remembered that Appellant\r\n\"murdered his girlfriend, and left the daughter for dead.\" She also stated she heard\r\nthat following these crimes, Appellant \"murdered a man in Conway.\" The trial\r\ncourt then asked Juror #480 if she could leave her prior knowledge \"outside the\r\ncourtroom,\" and Juror #480 indicated that she could:\r\n\r\n      The Court: You are coming into the courtroom, you listen to all of the\r\n                 facts and evidence presented in this case, make your\r\n                 decision based on the facts and evidence in this case, the\r\n                 law the Court would give to you, and don't let anything\r\n                 that you think you might know about it in the past affect\r\n                 your decision in any way. You understand that?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: Yes sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: Can you do that?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: Yes sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right, Ma'am. Can you follow the law that the Court\r\n                 would give to you? Even if for some reason you didn't\r\n                 agree with it could you follow the law that the Court\r\n                 would give to you in this case?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: Yes sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: All right, Ma'am. When you heard about this matter in the\r\n                 past do you remember forming any kind of opinion or\r\n                 belief at that point in time when you heard about it in the\r\n                 past?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: No sir. I really don't remember much about it, and just\r\n                 kind of wiped it out.\r\n\n       According to Appellant, Juror #480's prior knowledge was the equivalent of\r\nplacing improper character evidence and evidence of Appellant's prior death\r\nsentence before the jury. Appellant asserts, \"If the solicitor in the present case\r\nbrought up evidence of [Appellant's] prior crimes and death sentence [] during the\r\nguilt phase of this trial, it would have been grounds for a mistrial. There is no\r\ndifference in seating a juror who knows this information from the outset. To\r\nbelieve the juror in this case did not convey this information to the other jurors,\r\nespecially when she was not instructed otherwise, denies the frailty of human\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\n       Appellant relies on People v. Davis, 452 N.E.2d 525 (Ill. 1983), in support\r\nof his argument. However, Davis is inapplicable. In that case, an Illinois jury\r\nfound Davis guilty of murder. Id. at 527. In a separate, bifurcated sentencing\r\nhearing, the jury unanimously determined that the necessary aggravating factors\r\nexisted, and that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to preclude\r\nimposition of the death penalty. Id. Davis argued that the trial court erred in\r\nallowing the prosecution to inform the jury that he had received the death penalty\r\nfor an unrelated murder. Id. at 536. To establish the aggravating factor that\r\ndefendant had murdered two or more individuals, the State introduced certified\r\ncopies of Davis's prior murder convictions. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Illinois Supreme Court reversed Davis's conviction. The court found\r\nthat introduction of this evidence may have improperly influenced the jury in two\r\nrespects. Id. at 537. First, if a juror had any uncertainty as to whether Davis\r\nqualified for the death sentence, the knowledge that twelve other people previously\r\ndetermined that he did could have swayed that decision. Id. Second, the jury's\r\nawareness of Davis's prior death sentence could diminish its sense of responsibility\r\nand mitigate the serious consequences of its decision. Id. Put another way, the\r\njurors may have considered their own decision much less significant than they\r\notherwise would. Id.\r\n\r\n       The facts of the instant case are markedly different from those of Davis. The\r\nState did not present evidence of Appellant's prior death penalty conviction to the\r\njury. Although the juror in this case admitted that she had prior knowledge of the\r\nconviction, the court established that Juror #480 could place that prior knowledge\r\naside and decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial.\r\n\r\n     Appellant's trial counsel also questioned Juror #480 concerning her prior\r\nknowledge:\r\n\n      Diggs: Okay. And let's assume that's correct for a moment and you\r\n             are selected to serve on this jury, would having knowledge\r\n             about a prior death sentence undermine your ability to be\r\n             responsible in terms of the—filling the juror responsibilities in\r\n             this case, in other words, would you feel like we are just kind\r\n             of going through the motions here for no good reason.\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: No sir, because I think this is, what, an entirely different\r\n                  matter.\r\n\r\n       Juror #480's unequivocal answers to the trial court's and trial counsel's\r\nquestions prevent us from finding that the trial court's qualification of the juror was\r\n\"wholly\" unsupported by the evidence. The court in Davis reversed over concerns\r\nabout the impact the introduction of a prior death sentence might have had on the\r\njury. But here, Juror #480's statements show a lack of clarity regarding Appellant's\r\nprior crimes, and there is nothing to suggest that knowledge of those crimes would\r\nhave any bearing on her jury service. Thus, Appellant fails to demonstrate that\r\nJuror #480's prior knowledge improperly affected the verdict, or that the trial court\r\nerred in concluding that Juror #480 could faithfully discharge her responsibilities\r\nas a juror.\r\n\r\n   B. Predisposition\r\n\r\n        Appellant argues that the trial court erred in qualifying Juror #480 because\r\nof the juror's unequivocal response that she would vote for death in every case\r\nwhere the State proved murder beyond a reasonable doubt, coupled with an\r\naggravating circumstance proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Juror #480's initial\r\nstatements demonstrate a troubling likelihood that her view on this issue would\r\nhave substantially impaired her performance as a juror. However, we find that the\r\ntrial court sufficiently rehabilitated Juror #480.\r\n\r\n       In State v. Lindsay, 372 S.C. 185, 642 S.E.2d 557 (2007), the Court analyzed\r\nthe trial court's decision to disqualify a juror who expressed an equivocal view\r\nregarding the death penalty. In that case, the trial court asked Juror K if he could\r\nimpose the death penalty. Id. at 190, 642 S.E.2d at 560. Juror K responded that he\r\n\"didn't really know\" if he could or not. Id. During subsequent voir dire by trial\r\ncounsel, Juror K stated that he could listen to both sides in the penalty phase and\r\nrender the most appropriate penalty, be that life imprisonment or death. Id.\r\nHowever, when questioned by the State, Juror K equivocated, and admitted that, in\r\nhis view, life without parole was a more serious punishment than the death penalty.\r\n\nId. at 190–91, 642 S.E.2d at 560. Juror K stated that regardless of the facts of a\r\nparticular case, he would most likely choose life imprisonment as a punishment\r\nrather than death. Id. at 191, 641 S.E.2d at 560. The trial court found that Juror\r\nK's views on the death penalty would substantially impair his ability to follow the\r\nlaw as instructed. Id. at 192, 642 S.E.2d at 561 (\"He further noted that when asked\r\nabout giving the death penalty, Juror K 'took a very big deep [breath] and exhaled\r\nas if he were very uncertain as to whether or not he could do that.'\"). This Court\r\nfound that Juror K's equivocal views and noted hesitation provided a reasonable\r\nbasis for the trial court's conclusion. Id. at 193, 642 S.E.2d at 561 (\"Considering\r\nthe voir dire as a whole, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\r\nexcusing the juror.\")\r\n\r\n       In State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157 (1990), the defendant\r\nargued that two jurors should have been disqualified because their responses\r\nduring voir dire indicated a predisposition towards the death penalty. This Court\r\nheld that the \"ultimate consideration is that the juror be unbiased, impartial and\r\nable to carry out the law as it is explained to him.\" Id. at 354, 392 S.E.2d at 161.\r\nDespite one juror's disconcerting responses, the juror indicated she would wait\r\nuntil she had been presented with the \"entire picture.\" Id. In addition, the juror\r\nexpressed a willingness to \"follow the law,\" and a respect for mitigating\r\ncircumstances. Id. Thus, the Court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in qualifying the juror. Id. (finding that the other juror was an alternate\r\nand any error in seating that juror would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).\r\n\r\n      Appellant's trial counsel questioned Juror #480 regarding her ability to\r\nconsider life imprisonment without parole even if the State proved murder and an\r\naggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt:\r\n\r\n      Diggs: I want you to tell me, once you are on the jury, and you have\r\n            concluded that there was guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and\r\n            then we move into the sentencing phase, and the State begins to\r\n            present evidence of an aggravating circumstance, which is what\r\n            the Judge is going to tell you they are required to do in order to\r\n            ask for a death sentence, okay, and then we get to the end of\r\n            that hearing and you believe the State did, indeed, present\r\n            evidence in this case of an aggravating circumstance, coupled\r\n            with murder, would you be predisposed in that situation to vote\r\n            death as opposed to life imprisonment?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: Yes sir.\r\n\n      Diggs: Okay. And would you do that—without knowing specific facts\r\n             would it be fair to say you would be in that position in every\r\n             case?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: Well, that's where you said specific facts.\r\n\r\n      Diggs: Yes Ma'am. Without any specific facts, just that foundation,\r\n             that two-tiered foundation, so to speak, murder you found\r\n             beyond a reasonable doubt, and then on top of that an\r\n             aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, you\r\n             would—in every case where those two factors were combined,\r\n             would vote death?\r\n\r\n      Juror #480: Yes sir.\r\n\r\n       Following this exchange the trial court questioned Juror #480. The trial\r\ncourt explained to Juror #480 that just because an aggravating circumstance is\r\nfound, this does not mean that the jury automatically recommends a sentence of\r\ndeath. Juror #480 answered that she could vote to impose life imprisonment or\r\ndeath if the State proved an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nJuror #480 also stated that she understood that the jury could not even consider the\r\ndeath penalty if the State failed to prove an aggravating circumstance. Juror #480\r\nanswered affirmatively that she could follow the trial court's instruction and apply\r\nthe law to facts of the case.\r\n\r\n       This Court's decisions in Green and Lindsay lead us to the conclusion that\r\nthe trial court did not err in this case. During trial counsel's voir dire, Juror #480\r\nstated that she would always vote to impose the death penalty when murder and a\r\nstatutory aggravating circumstance were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nHowever, within that same colloquy she stated that she could consider all of the\r\nevidence in the case and render any one of the four verdicts she felt was best\r\nsupported by the evidence. Moreover, Juror #480 responded to the trial court's\r\nmethodical questioning with an affirmative response that she could in fact consider\r\nlife imprisonment and the death penalty equally only if the State proved the\r\nrequisite statutory aggravating circumstance. Ultimately, there is evidence in the\r\nRecord to support the trial court's decision to qualify Juror #480. Her answers on\r\nthe whole demonstrate an ability and willingness to be impartial and carry out the\r\nlaw as explained to her. Although Juror #480 gave two contradictory answers\r\n\nduring voir dire, the overall balance of her answers does not demonstrate the type\r\nof equivocation evident in Lindsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IV.    Refusal to Grant Change of Venue\r\n\r\n       As referenced in Issue II, a jury in neighboring Georgetown County\r\nconvicted Appellant of murder, and recommended death, prior to the trial of the\r\ninstant case. Of the one hundred and twelve potential jurors questioned by the trial\r\ncourt, fifty-six knew about Appellant through pretrial publicity. According to\r\nAppellant, of the forty-five qualified jurors, twenty-seven knew about Appellant's\r\nprevious trial, conviction, and death sentence. Of the seated jurors, at least eight\r\nknew the Appellant by name, and as discussed previously, Juror #480 knew of his\r\nprior conviction and sentence. Based on these facts, Appellant argues that the trial\r\ncourt erred in refusing to grant a change of venue. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       A motion to change venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\r\njudge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Sheppard\r\nv. State, 357 S.C. 646, 654, 594 S.E.2d 462, 467 (2004). When a trial judge bases\r\nthe denial of a motion for a change of venue because of pretrial publicity upon an\r\nadequate voir dire examination of the jurors, his decision will not be disturbed\r\nabsent extraordinary circumstances. State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 502, 388\r\nS.E.2d 816, 821 (1990), overruled on other grounds by State v. Evans, 371 S.C. 27,\r\n30, 637 S.E.2d 313, 315 (2006). A denial of a change of venue is not error if the\r\njurors are found to have the ability to set aside any impressions or opinions and\r\nrender a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial. State v. Tucker, 334 S.C.\r\n1, 14, 512 S.E.2d 99, 106 (1999). It is the defendant's burden to demonstrate actual\r\njuror prejudice as a result of pretrial publicity. Caldwell, 300 S.C. at 494, 388\r\nS.E.2d at 816.\r\n\r\n        In State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2007), the defendant\r\nrequested a change of venue due to pre-trial publicity regarding his connection to\r\ntwo murders. In September 2002, the body of a woman was found in Spartanburg.\r\nId. at 411, 645 S.E.2d at 907. The victim had been strangled, and the crime went\r\nunsolved until the defendant's arrest for a February 2003 murder. Id.\r\nSubsequently, an investigation revealed that semen found on the victim's body\r\nmatched the defendant's DNA. Id.\r\n\n       Trial counsel moved for a change of venue, noting that thirty-nine members\r\nof the sixty-eight person jury pool had heard something about the case, and seven\r\nof the twelve jurors seated had some knowledge of the case. Id. at 412, 645 S.E.2d\r\nat 907–08. The trial court concluded that all jurors who had any prior knowledge\r\nof the case indicated they could set aside any information, and denied trial\r\ncounsel's motion. Id. at 412, 645 S.E.2d at 908.\r\n       In reviewing Evins's appeal, this Court found the United States Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723 (1963), instructive. In that\r\ncase, the people of Calcasieu Parish in Lake Charles, Louisiana, were \"exposed\r\nrepeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of the defendant personally confessing in\r\ndetail to the crimes for which he was later charged.\" Id. at 726. In addition, three\r\nmembers of the jury had watched the defendant's televised \"interview\" in which he\r\nconfessed to the sheriff, and two members of the jury were \"honorary\" deputy\r\nsheriffs themselves. Id. at 725. The failure to change venue in that case\r\ncompromised the defendant's due process rights. Id. at 727.\r\n\r\n       Clearly the facts of the instant case are more similar to those of Evins than of\r\nRideau. In denying Appellant's change of venue motion, the trial court concluded\r\nthat the vast majority of the jurors knew nothing about the case:\r\n\r\n      A few of them know [Appellant's] name. That's on the questionnaire\r\n      they were given . . . . It's no kind of pretrial publicity of any kind.\r\n      And the one person that said they had some kind of information,\r\n      again, without equivocation of any kind, indicated that they could set\r\n      it aside.\r\n\r\n       This finding is similar to the trial court's conclusion in Evins that all\r\nmembers of the jury with any knowledge of the murder due to pretrial publicity\r\nindicated they could set that knowledge aside. Evins, 373 S.C. at 413, 645 S.E.2d\r\nat 908. Interestingly, the defendant in Evins, as here, seized on statements by one\r\njuror that she had read about his prior crimes, and overstated the juror's knowledge:\r\n\r\n      The juror testified on voir dire that the only thing she heard was that\r\n      the crime had taken place; she specifically testified that she knew no\r\n      details, did not know the location, she had formed no opinion, could\r\n      put aside what she had heard, and could be fair and impartial.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\n       In the instant case, Appellant fails to present even one juror who stated he or\r\nshe could not ignore exposure to pretrial publicity prior to serving as a juror. In the\r\ncase of Juror #480, she did not claim to know specific details of the instant case or\r\nAppellant's prior conviction, and stated that she could be fair and impartial.\r\nAppellant advances broad and unsupported arguments regarding the publicity of\r\nthis case, but fails to meet his burden of demonstrating actual juror prejudice as a\r\nresult of that publicity. See Sheppard, 357 S.C. at 655, 594 S.E.2d at 468 (\"Mere\r\nexposure to pretrial publicity does not automatically disqualify a prospective juror.\r\nInstead the relevant question is not whether the community remembered the case,\r\nbut whether the jurors had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially\r\nthe guilt of the defendant.\"). The Record does not support a finding that the trial\r\ncourt ignored actual juror prejudice related to pretrial publicity, and thus, the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's motion to change venue.\r\n\r\n                                 V.     Juror Opt Out\r\n\r\n       Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in excusing eighty-five perspective\r\njurors pursuant to section 14-7-840 of the South Carolina Code. Section 14-7-840\r\nallows any person age sixty-five or over to avoid jury service. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n14-7-840 (Supp. 2011). Appellant argues that allowing these individuals an\r\nexemption from jury service violates the \"fair cross-section\" requirement of the\r\nSixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The Sixth Amendment requires that a person charged with a crime be able to\r\ndraw from a fair cross-section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S.\r\n522, 530 (1975). To establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section\r\nrequirement, a defendant must show that (1) the group alleged to be excluded is a\r\ndistinctive group in the community; (2) the representation of this group in the\r\nvenire from which the juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\r\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (3) this underrepresentation is due\r\nto systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. Duren v.\r\nMissouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364 (1979). A \"distinctive\" group has been defined as one\r\nthat: (1) shows a quality or attribute that defines or limits membership in the group;\r\n(2) possesses a cohesiveness of ideas, attitudes, or experiences that distinguishes\r\nthe purported group from the rest of society; and (3) shares a community of interest\r\nthat may not be represented in other segments of the population. State v. Price,\r\n272 S.E.2d 103, 109 (N.C. 1980).\r\n\r\n      Section 14-7-840 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\n      No person is exempt from service as a juror in any court of this State\r\n      except men and women sixty-five years of age or over. Notaries\r\n      public are not considered state officers and are not exempt under this\r\n      section. A person exempt under this section may be excused upon\r\n      telephone confirmation of date of birth and age to the clerk of court or\r\n      the chief magistrate. The jury commissioners shall not excuse or\r\n      disqualify a juror under this section. The clerk of court shall maintain\r\n      a list of persons excused by the court and the reasons the juror was\r\n      determined to be excused.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-840 (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      In the instant case, the trial court excused eighty-five prospective jurors who\r\nchose to take advantage of their statutory exemption. Trial counsel objected on the\r\ngrounds that \"sixty-five is not what sixty-five used to be,\" and that section 14-7-\r\n840 was unconstitutional. The trial court rejected trial counsel's argument, and\r\nexcused the jurors.\r\n\r\n       In Duren, the United States Supreme Court explained the test that must be\r\nperformed in analyzing an alleged violation of the fair cross-section requirement.\r\nIn that case, a jury convicted Duren of first degree murder and armed robbery.\r\nDuren, 439 U.S. at 360. At the time of trial, Missouri law granted women, who so\r\nrequested, an automatic exemption from jury service. Id. (citing M.Rev.Stat. §\r\n494.031(2) (Supp. 1978)). Duren contended that this law violated his right to a\r\ntrial by a jury chosen from a cross-section of his community. Id. The Supreme\r\nCourt agreed.\r\n\r\n       First, the Supreme Court held that (1) women were sufficiently numerous\r\nand distinct from men, and if they were systematically eliminated from jury panels,\r\nthe Sixth Amendment's cross-section requirement could not be satisfied. Id. at 364\r\n(citing Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 531 (1975)). Second, the Court noted\r\nDuren's statistical evidence that women constituted fifty-four percent of the\r\ncommunity, but jury venires contained approximately fifteen percent women. Id.\r\nat 365–66. The Supreme Court found that these venires were not \"reasonably\r\nrepresentative\" of the community, and such a gross discrepancy between the\r\npercentages of women in the community and those participating in jury service\r\nmandated the conclusion that women were not fairly represented in the source\r\nfrom which juries were drawn in the community. Id. at 366. Finally, Duren\r\ndemonstrated that this large discrepancy occurred in every weekly venire for nearly\r\n\na year. Id. The Supreme Court agreed that this indicated that the cause of the\r\nunderrepresentation was systematic. Id. at 367.\r\n\r\n       Appellant cannot establish a prima facie case under the Duren test. There is\r\nno evidence before this Court that persons age sixty-five or over are \"distinctive.\"\r\nAppellant states that a community of persons aged sixty-five or older are\r\nsignificantly different than a community comprised of all citizens, and that this\r\nparticular group of citizens holds the same generational values and experiences,\r\nand lived through some of the same major world and national events. However,\r\nAppellant fails to cite any authority for the proposition that having lived through\r\nthe same major events would yield monolithic values and experiences. Persons\r\naged sixty-five or older obviously share a quality that limits membership in the\r\ngroup, but Appellant cannot demonstrate that this group as a whole possesses a\r\ncohesiveness of ideas, attitudes, or experiences that distinguishes them from the\r\nrest of society, or that these persons share a community of interest not represented\r\nin other segments of the population. See Price, 272 S.E.2d at 109 (outlining the\r\ndefinition of a distinctive group).\r\n\r\n       Additionally, Appellant fails to present any statistical evidence that the\r\npercentage of persons aged sixty-five years or older who participate in jury\r\nselection is not a reasonable representation of the community, or that any alleged\r\nunderrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury\r\nselection process. Thus, there is no basis for a conclusion that the trial court's\r\nexcusal of potential jurors pursuant to section 14-7-840 of the South Carolina Code\r\nviolated his constitutional right to a jury constituting a fair cross-section of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n       In addition, based on the preceding analysis, we take this opportunity to hold\r\nthat, for the purposes of section 14-7-480, persons age sixty-five or older are not a\r\ndistinctive group. See, e.g., Brewer v. Nix, 963 F.2d 1111, 1112–13 (8th Cir. 1992)\r\n(\"We conclude that this falls far short of proving the type of distinctive group\r\nrequired for a prima facie case under Duren. The age parameters of the group are\r\ntoo arbitrary, and its supposed distinctive characteristics are too general and ill-\r\ndefined, to satisfy the Duren standards.\") (holding that Iowa law exempting\r\npersons sixty-five or older from jury service did not violate the Sixth Amendment);\r\nSilagy v. Peters, 905 F.2d 986, 1010–11 (7th Cir. 1990) (holding that persons\r\nseventy years of age or older did not constitute a \"distinctive\" group for purposes\r\nof the Sixth Amendment); United States v. Lynch, 792 F.2d 269, 271–72 (1st Cir.\r\n1986) (\"None of this evidence, however, undercuts our decision in Barber, [Barber\r\nv. Ponte, 772 F.2d 982 (1st Cir. 1985)] that persons age 18 to 34 do not sufficiently\r\n\nblend into one 'cognizable group' so as to permit the making of a prima facie case\r\nof juror discrimination simply by showing that the venire underrepresents persons\r\nfalling within the broad spectrum of those ages.\"); State v. Rodgers, 562 S.E.2d\r\n859, 876–78 (N.C. 2002) (holding that citizens aged sixty-five or over do not\r\nconstitute a distinctive group for purposes of the Sixth Amendment);\r\nCommonwealth v. Bastarache, 414 N.E.2d 984, 992 n.10 (Mass. 1980)\r\n(\"Classifications based on age have been rejected as an 'identifiable group' (for\r\nequal protection purposes) or as a 'distinctive' group (for Sixth Amendment\r\npurposes) in virtually every Federal case that has dealt with the question.\").\r\n\r\n                         VI.    Cruel and Unusual Punishment\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred in ruling that his execution would\r\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit \"a\r\nnarrow category of the most serious crimes\" and whose extreme culpability makes\r\nthem \"the most deserving of execution.\" Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 568\r\n(2005) (citation omitted). There are a number of crimes that beyond question are\r\nsevere, yet the death penalty may not be imposed for their commission. See, e.g.,\r\nCoker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 598 (1977) (\"We have the abiding conviction that\r\nthe death penalty . . . is an excessive penalty for the rapist who, as such, does not\r\ntake human life.\") (citation omitted); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 797 (1982)\r\n(holding that the death penalty may not be applied to a defendant who aids and\r\nabets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who\r\ndoes not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal\r\nforce will be employed). The Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and\r\nunusual punishment is viewed through the \"evolving standards of decency that\r\nmark the progress of a maturing society.\" Roper, 543 U.S. at 560–61 (citing Trop\r\nv. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100–01 (1958)). These evolving standards prohibit the\r\nexecution of the juvenile defendants and the intellectually disabled.1 See Atkins v.\r\n1 See Act of October 5, 2010 (Rosa’s Law), Pub. L. No. 111-256, 124 Stat 2643\r\n(2010), codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq (\"(1) a reference to 'an intellectual\r\ndisability' shall mean a condition previously referred to as 'mental retardation,' or a\r\nvariation of this term, and shall have the same meaning with respect to programs,\r\nor qualifications for programs, for individuals with such a condition; and (2) a\r\nreference to individuals with intellectual disabilities shall mean individuals who\r\nwere previously referred to as individuals who are 'individuals with mental\r\nretardation' or 'the mentally retarded,' or variations of those terms.\"); see also S.C.\r\n\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321 (\"Construing and applying the Eighth Amendment in\r\nthe light of our 'evolving standards of decency,' we therefore conclude that such\r\npunishment is excessive and that the Constitution 'places a substantive restriction\r\non the State's power to take the life' of a [intellectually disabled] offender.\");\r\nRoper, 543 U.S. at 575 (\"The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid\r\nimposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when\r\ntheir crimes were committed.\"). Section 44-20-30 of the South Carolina Code\r\ndefines an intellectual disability as \"significantly sub-average general intellectual\r\nfunctioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested\r\nduring the developmental period.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 44-20-30 (Supp. 2011). In\r\nFranklin v. Maynard, 356 S.C. 276, 278–79, 588 S.E.2d 604, 605 (2003), this\r\nCourt approved this statutory definition as applicable to the death penalty context.\r\n\r\n       The threshold determination in this analysis is whether Appellant's alleged\r\nmental condition places him within the class of offender that may not executed. As\r\ndiscussed in Issue I, supra, Appellant presented expert testimony, as part of an\r\ninsanity defense, that he suffered from central nervous system dysfunction and\r\ndiminished or lowered function of his brain in the frontal lobe area. In addition,\r\none of Appellant's experts testified that scans of the right hemisphere of\r\nAppellant's brain exhibited damage in the medial gray matter of Appellant's brain\r\nat four standard deviations below normal. The expert testified that this type of\r\ndamage is not seen in \"normal\" people, and an individual with this type of\r\n\"extreme\" damage would have some type of temporal lobe epilepsy.\r\n\r\n       However, the State presented compelling counter testimony. An expert in\r\nForensic Psychology testified that she conducted a detailed review of Appellant's\r\npersonal and criminal history and interviewed Appellant for approximately\r\nseventeen hours. The expert diagnosed Appellant as having a severe personality\r\ndisorder. She pointed out in her testimony that evidence of mental disease or\r\ndefect manifested only by repeated criminal or other anti-social conduct is not\r\nsufficient to establish the defense of insanity. The expert's description of Appellant\r\ndoes not depict an intellectually disabled individual:\r\n\r\nCode Ann. § 44-20-30 (Supp. 2011), amended by 2011 Act No. 47, § 13 (2011)\r\n(\"SECTION 13. In Sections 1 through 6 of this act, the terms 'intellectual\r\ndisability' and 'person with intellectual disability' have replaced and have the same\r\nmeanings as the former terms 'mental retardation' and 'mentally retarded.'\").\r\n\n       I think he's a highly narcissistic, entitled person, who really feels\r\n       special. I think he, throughout his life, has not really wanted to work\r\n       very hard, so he's done a lot of illegal activities for quick gain. He's a\r\n       very, very smart person, but I would say that, rather than applying\r\n       himself . . . he would look for the fast deal . . . . Why he doesn't have a\r\n       conscience, I don't know. I don't think anybody can tell you why he\r\n       doesn't have a conscience.\r\n       An expert in neurology and neuropsychiatry testified that the white matter\r\ndamage and prefrontal atrophy claimed by Appellant's experts was simply \"not\r\nthere.\" Moreover, the expert testified directly to the possible occurrence of brain\r\ndamage during Appellant's birth. According to that expert's review of Appellant's\r\nmedical records, Appellant received the maximum ten points in the Apgar test\r\ngiven to newborns almost immediately following birth. A diagnostic imager\r\nprovided expert testimony that the images of Appellant's brain demonstrated no\r\nabnormalities and were \"perfectly normal.\" This expert's testimony regarding\r\nAppellant's brain scan is illuminating. The expert explained the usual procedure of\r\na P.E.T. scan, and how Appellant's scan differed from that procedure. According\r\nto this expert's testimony, patients are normally placed in a controlled environment\r\nfor approximately one hour prior to the scan. This sequestration ensures a standard\r\nbrain scan by preventing, as much as possible, exposure to external stimuli.\r\nHowever, in Appellant's case, his trial counsel altered the standard pre-scan\r\nroutine. Appellant's trial counsel arranged for a psychologist to administer a\r\ncomputer-generated test to Appellant both before and during the pre-scan routine.\r\nThis test required Appellant to sit in front of a computer screen and click a mouse\r\nin response to \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. This caused certain areas of Appellant's\r\nbrain to appear irregular. However, when the expert accounted for the disruption\r\nto the pre-scan routine, Appellant's scan appeared normal.\r\n\r\n       Appellant has an intelligence quotient of 143, and a history of criminal\r\nbehavior consistent with that of a confidence man. Moreover, Appellant's trial\r\ncounsel admitted there was no definitive evidence of an intellectual disability,\r\nstating, \"Your honor, hypofrontality is what some experts say is the condition this\r\ndefendant has.\" While expert testimony in this case may demonstrate Appellant's\r\ninability to adapt, the Record does not show that he is of significant sub-average\r\nintellectual functioning.\r\n\r\n      However, Appellant's trial counsel argued that preventing the State from\r\nexecuting individuals with Appellant's alleged brain dysfunction simply\r\nrepresented a logical step in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence:\r\n\n      It should be declared unconstitutional and say, \"Look, we've taken the\r\n      step in terms of [intellectual disability]. We've taken the step in terms\r\n      of age, recognizing that the brain has got to function properly, and in\r\n      those two cases, the [intellectual disability] and the young age, it\r\n      doesn't, so we're not going to execute those people,\" and we shouldn't.\r\n\r\n       Appellant renews that argument in asking this Court to expand the United\r\nStates Supreme Court's rationale in prohibiting execution as a punishment for\r\ncertain offenders. However, trial counsel's argument oversimplifies the underlying\r\nreasoning for the Eighth Amendment prohibition on executing juveniles and the\r\nintellectually disabled.\r\n\r\n       In Roper, the Supreme Court articulated three differences between juveniles\r\nand adults which demonstrate that juveniles cannot reliably be classified as among\r\nthe worst offenders. Id. at 569. First, scientific and sociological evidence\r\ndemonstrates that a \"lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of\r\nresponsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more\r\nunderstandable among the young.\" Id. (citation omitted). This often results in\r\nimpetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions. Id. (\"[A]dolescents are\r\noverrepresented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior.\"\r\n(citation omitted)). Second, juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences\r\nand outside pressures. Id. (\"This is explained in part by the prevailing\r\ncircumstance that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over\r\ntheir own environment.\" (citation omitted)). Third, the character of a juvenile is\r\nnot as well informed as that of an adult. Id. at 570 (\"The personality traits of\r\njuveniles are more transitory, less fixed.\" (citation omitted)). In addition,\r\naccording to the Supreme Court, the two distinct social purposes served by the\r\ndeath penalty, retribution and deterrence, are not served by a minor's execution. Id.\r\nat 571 (\"Retribution is not proportional if the law's most severe penalty is imposed\r\non one whose culpability or blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree,\r\nby reason of youth and immaturity.\"). The Court also cited the glaring fact that at\r\nthe time of the decision, the United States stood alone as the only country in the\r\nworld that continued to officially sanction the juvenile death penalty. Id. at 575.\r\n\r\n        In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), the Supreme Court relied on a\r\nclinical definition of intellectual disability which required not only sub-average\r\nintellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as\r\ncommunication, self-care, and self-direction that manifested before age eighteen.\r\nId. at 318. Contrary to trial counsel's assertion in the instant case, the Supreme\r\n\nCourt's decision did not rely on a simple finding that an intellectually disabled\r\ndefendant's brain did not function properly. The Supreme Court found that these\r\npersons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are\r\ncompetent to stand trial. Id. However, their diminished capacity frustrated the\r\nretributive and deterrent goals of capital punishment. Id.\r\n\r\n       Following the resumption of the death penalty, the Supreme Court\r\nmaintained that the punishment applied only to the most serious crimes. Id. at 319.\r\nThus, the Court reasoned that if the \"culpability of the average murderer is often\r\ninsufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State[,] the lesser\r\nculpability of the [intellectually disabled] offender surely does not merit that form\r\nof retribution.\" Id. (\"Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks\r\nto ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion\r\nfor the [intellectually disabled] is appropriate.\"). With respect to deterrence, the\r\nCourt had previously held that capital punishment could only serve as a deterrent\r\nwhen murder \"is the result of premeditation and deliberation.\" Id. (citation\r\nomitted). The Court held that this sort of calculation stood at the opposite end of\r\nthe spectrum from the behavior of the intellectually disabled. Id. at 319–20. In\r\naddition, this disability was also found to increase the risk that the death penalty\r\nwould be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. Id.\r\nat 320. More specifically, these defendants are more susceptible to false\r\nconfessions, are less able to provide meaningful assistance to their counsel, and\r\ntheir demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their\r\ncrimes. Id. at 320–21.\r\n\r\n      Appellant's alleged mental abnormalities do not demonstrate an inability to\r\ncommunicate or care for himself adequately, or sub-average intellectual\r\nfunctioning. Instead, his above average intelligence, and behavior before and after\r\nthe Victim's murder, demonstrate an ability to formulate and execute deliberate\r\nplans. See Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 799 (1982) (holding that capital\r\npunishment can only serve as deterrent when murder is the result of premeditation\r\nand deliberation). Thus, his behavior in this case stands at the opposite end of the\r\nspectrum from the behavior of an intellectually disabled person. See Atkins, 536\r\nU.S. at 319–20 (analyzing the mental capabilities of intellectually disabled\r\noffenders). There is simply no justification for finding Appellant's alleged\r\ncondition similar to those individuals who may not be executed lawfully.2\r\n\r\n2The decisions by other jurisdictions cited by Appellant are not persuasive. For\r\nexample, the Florida Supreme Court has reversed death penalty convictions based\r\non mental illnesses whose symptoms do not align closely with our state's definition\r\n\n      The trial court properly denied Appellant's motion pursuant to existing law,\r\nand did not err in refusing to find that Appellant's death sentence violates the\r\nEighth Amendment.                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Appellant's conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.\r\nconcurs in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof intellectual disability. However, even those cases involve debilitating mental\r\nillnesses of the type inapposite that of Appellant.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27225","title":"EnerSys Delaware v.

Harper, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE HEARN: This case presents the question of whether the denial\r\nof a motion to disqualify an attorney is immediately appealable. We hold it is not\r\nand dismiss the case as interlocutory.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      From 2002 through 2004, George Harper and his law firm at that time,\r\nJackson Lewis, represented EnerSys Delaware, Inc. in a variety of employment\r\nand labor law matters. Harper served as EnerSys' attorney of record in at least five\r\nemployment-related lawsuits during this time. However, the relationship between\r\nJackson Lewis and EnerSys deteriorated in 2004 when EnerSys brought a\r\n\nmalpractice claim against the firm based on some labor-related legal advice that it\r\nclaimed resulted in fraudulent testimony.\r\n\r\n      In 2011, EnerSys filed this action against a former EnerSys employee,\r\nTammy Hopkins, alleging six causes of action including breach of contract based\r\non violations of the confidentiality agreement and various computer use policies\r\nand agreements, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of\r\ncontract accompanied by a fraudulent act. EnerSys claimed Hopkins had\r\ntransmitted confidential information, including confidential payroll information,\r\noutside of EnerSys and to her personal e-mail account. When EnerSys learned that\r\nHopkins had retained Harper to represent her, it moved to have him disqualified\r\npursuant to Rule 1.9(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nThe circuit court denied the motion, concluding that Harper's previous assistance in\r\ndeveloping EnerSys' litigation strategy was insufficient grounds upon which to\r\ndisqualify him due to the dissimilarities of his previous representations and the\r\ncurrent suit. EnerSys then filed this appeal.\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n      \"The right of appeal arises from and is controlled by statutory law.\" Hagood\r\nv. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005). Generally, a party\r\nmay only appeal from a final judgment, and piecemeal appeals should be avoided\r\nbecause most errors can be corrected through a new trial. Id. at 194–195, 607\r\nS.E.2d at 708. Whether an order issued prior to or during trial is immediately\r\nappealable is governed primarily by Section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(1979 & Supp. 2012). Id. at 195, 607 S.E.2d at 708.\r\n\r\n      Section 14-3-330 provides this Court with appellate jurisdiction over:\r\n\r\n      (1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case\r\n      involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common\r\n      pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or\r\n      removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final\r\n      judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until\r\n      final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final\r\n      judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily\r\n      affecting the judgment not before appealed from;\r\n\r\n      (2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such\r\n      order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from\r\n      which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants\r\n\n      or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or\r\n      any pleading in any action;\r\n\r\n      (3) A final order affecting a substantial right made in any special\r\n      proceeding or upon a summary application in any action after\r\n      judgment; and\r\n\r\n      (4) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas\r\n      granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction or granting,\r\n      continuing, modifying, or refusing the appointment of a receiver.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, an order must fall within one of the enumerated subsections to be\r\nimmediately appealable. State v. Wilson, 387 S.C. 597, 600, 693 S.E.2d 923, 924\r\n(2010).\r\n\r\n      In this appeal, the order does not affect the merits of the action; hence,\r\nsubsection (1) would not apply. Similarly, the order was not made in a special\r\nproceeding and does not relate to an injunction or appointment of a receiver, and\r\ntherefore, subsections (3) and (4) are likewise inapplicable. Thus, we must\r\ndetermine whether the order denying the disqualification of an attorney affects a\r\nsubstantial right such that the order is immediately appealable under subsection\r\n(2).   In Hagood, we considered as an issue of first impression whether an order\r\ngranting a motion to disqualify counsel in a civil trial was immediately appealable.\r\nHagood, 362 S.C. at 194, 607 S.E.2d at 708. We held that it is, finding such an\r\norder affected the substantial right of the party to have an attorney of one's\r\nchoosing and was therefore appealable pursuant to section 14-3-330(2). Id. at 197-\r\n98, 607 S.E.2d at 710. In concluding the right to retain counsel of one's choosing\r\nis a substantial right for the purposes of appealability, we noted:\r\n\r\n      (1) the importance of the party's right to counsel of his choice in an\r\n      adversarial system; (2) the importance of the attorney-client\r\n      relationship, which demands a confidential, trusting relationship that\r\n      often develops over time; (3) the unfairness in requiring a party to pay\r\n      another attorney to become familiar with a case and repeat preparatory\r\n      actions already completed by the preferred attorney; and (4) an appeal\r\n      after final judgment would not adequately protect a party's interests\r\n      because it would be difficult or impossible for a litigant or an\r\n      appellate court to ascertain whether prejudice resulted from the lack of\r\n      a preferred attorney.\r\n\nId at 197, 607 S.E.2d at 710.\r\n\r\n      Then, in Wilson, we considered whether the grant of a defendant's motion to\r\ndisqualify a solicitor was immediately appealable by the State. 387 S.C. at 599,\r\n693 S.E.2d at 924. We held the pretrial order was not appealable and distinguished\r\nHagood, noting that the policy considerations of the right of a party to retain\r\ncounsel of his choosing and the development of an attorney-client relationship are\r\nnot factors when considering the disqualification of an assistant solicitor. Id. at\r\n602-03, 693 S.E.2d at 926.\r\n\r\n       As in Wilson, we find here that the policy considerations that drove our\r\nholding in Hagood—such as the right of having an attorney of one's choosing, the\r\nimportance of the attorney-client privilege, and the unfairness of having to pay to\r\nbring a new attorney up to speed on the case—are not implicated. EnerSys\r\ncontends the denial of this disqualification motion implicates its substantial right to\r\na fair trial, arguing that if Harper shared confidences he learned through his prior\r\nrepresentation, a new trial would not provide an adequate remedy. We disagree\r\nbecause in our view, this ostensible danger can be redressed equally as well after\r\ntrial as through an immediate appeal. Moreover, depending upon the outcome at\r\ntrial, EnerSys may find an appeal is not necessary. We therefore find no\r\nsubstantial right has been affected by the order, and thus subsection (2) of section\r\n14-3-330 is inapplicable. Accordingly, we hold an order denying a motion to\r\ndisqualify an attorney is not immediately appealable.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.\r\nMoore, concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27226","title":"Farmer v.

Farmer v. Florence Cty.\r\n\r\n\r\n    S.C. Code Ann. § 39-15-1195 (Supp. 2009).\r\n1\r\n\nSheriff's Office, 390 S.C. 358, 701 S.E.2d 48 (Ct. App. 2010). We now vacate that\r\nopinion, and hold the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss respondent's suit.\r\n\r\n                                       FACTS\r\n\r\nRespondent operated a retail store in Florence County. On August 30, 2007,\r\nFlorence County Sheriff's Office (petitioner) executed a search warrant and seized\r\nthe store's inventory, consisting of clothing, shoes, movie DVDs, and music CDs.\r\nRespondent was subsequently indicted in January 2008 for one count of trafficking\r\nin counterfeit goods in violation of S.C. Code Ann. § 39-15-1190 and one count of\r\nillegal distribution of recordings in violation of S.C. Code Ann. §§ 16-11-930 and -\r\n940 (2003). On January 23, 2008, respondent pled guilty to illegally distributing\r\nnot more than 25 audiotapes or more than 10 videos in violation of § 16-11-940(C)\r\nand the counterfeit goods indictment was dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn early February 2008, respondent's attorney wrote a letter to petitioner seeking\r\nreturn of the allegedly counterfeit goods. In March 2008, counsel sent a second\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nRespondent sued petitioner on May 30, 2008, approximately nine months after the\r\ngoods were seized (August 30, 2007), and approximately four months after\r\nrespondent pled guilty to piracy and the counterfeit goods charge was dismissed\r\n(January 23, 2008). Respondent's complaint alleged:\r\n\r\n             (1) negligence per se for failing to initiate forfeiture proceedings\r\n                within a \"reasonable time\" as provided by § 39-15-1195(B);\r\n\r\n             (2) negligence in breaching a \"heightened duty\" to return the goods in\r\n                a timely manner;\r\n\r\n             (3) conversion; and\r\n\r\n             (4) civil conspiracy among petitioner's agents.\r\n\r\nRespondent sought special, actual, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as\r\nlost profits and interest.\r\n\r\nPetitioner answered, alleging among other things that the complaint failed to state a\r\ncause of action, that it was immune under the Tort Claims Act (TCA), that\r\nrespondent had not exhausted his administrative remedies, and that it had not been\r\n\nnegligent but in any case, respondent's comparative negligence exceeded that of\r\npetitioner. Respondent filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking return of the\r\ncounterfeit goods and special damages in the form of lost profits and interest\r\nthereon. Petitioner subsequently filed its own summary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court heard arguments on the summary judgment motions and asked\r\neach party to prepare a proposed order. The judge eventually signed an order that\r\ndid not grant either party the summary judgment it sought, but represented what\r\nthe trial judge deemed \"obviously a reasonable compromise.\" The order required\r\npetitioner to return the alleged counterfeit goods finding petitioner \"simply cannot\r\nhold [respondent's] property unless it is being held for use in a criminal\r\nproceeding.\" The order cautioned respondent about criminal charges if the goods\r\nare in fact counterfeit, and declined any damages hearing if the goods \"are returned\r\nin substantially the same condition as when seized.\" The other causes of action\r\nwere dismissed, the court specifically stating, \"the applicability of the [TCA]\r\nwhich remedy [respondent] should pursue, etc., are not mentioned.\" Both\r\npetitioner and respondent appealed.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the requirement that petitioner return the\r\ngoods to respondent, and remanded the question whether petitioner was entitled to\r\nsummary judgment on respondent's \"private causes of action.\" We granted\r\npetitioner's request for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUE\r\n\r\n             Did the lower courts err in not dismissing respondent's suit?\r\n\r\n                                    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSince this case presents a novel statutory interpretation question, we begin with a\r\nreview of the statutory scheme applicable to the facts of this case.\r\n\r\nSection 39-15-1195 is titled \"Seizure and forfeiture; storage and maintenance of\r\nseized property; reports to prosecuting agencies; return of seized items.\"\r\nSubsection A provides that upon a violation of § 39-15-1190, which prohibits\r\npossession, transportation or distribution of counterfeit property, \"all items bearing\r\nthe counterfeit mark\" are \"subject to seizure by and forfeiture to any law\r\nenforcement agency . . . .\" § 39-15-1195(A)(1). Property subject to forfeiture may\r\nbe seized by the department having authority upon a warrant issued by a court\r\nhaving jurisdiction over the property. § 39-15-1195(B). The law enforcement\r\n\nagency seizing the property is deemed to have custody of the property [§ 39-15-\r\n1195(D)] which it must take reasonable steps to maintain [§ 39-15-1195(F)], and\r\nthe agency must make a report of the items seized to the \"appropriate prosecution\r\nagency\" \"within 10 days or a reasonable period of time after the seizure.\" § 39-15-\r\n1195(G).\r\n\r\nThus, under § 39-15-1195, petitioner had the duty to take reasonable steps to\r\nmaintain the property seized from respondent's store, and to make a timely report\r\nto the \"appropriate prosecution agency.\" § 39-15-1195(F) and (G). There is no\r\nallegation by respondent that petitioner breached either duty. Further, while\r\npetitioner is deemed to have custody of the property, the property is not subject to\r\nreplevin.2 § 39-15-1195(D). The seized property is \"subject only to the orders of\r\nthe court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceedings.\" § 39-15-1195(D).\r\n\"Proceedings pursuant to Section 44-33-530 regarding forfeiture and disposition\r\nmust be instituted within a reasonable time with regard to the seized property.\" §\r\n39-15-1195(C).\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-530(a) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n             Forfeiture of property must be accomplished by petition of the\r\n             Attorney General or his designee or the circuit solicitor or his\r\n             designee to the court of common pleas for the jurisdiction\r\n             where the items were seized. The petition must be submitted to\r\n             the court within a reasonable time period following seizure and\r\n             shall set forth the facts upon which the seizure was made. The\r\n             petition shall describe the property and include the names of all\r\n             owners of record and lienholders of record . . . . A copy of the\r\n             petition must be sent to each law enforcement agency which has\r\n             notified the petitioner of its involvement in effecting the\r\n             seizure. Notice of hearing or rule to show cause must be\r\n             directed to all persons with interests in the property listed in the\r\n             petition, including law enforcement agencies which have\r\n             notified the petitioner of their involvement in effecting the\r\n             seizure. Owners of record and lienholders of record may be\r\n\r\n \"Replevin was an action to recover the possession of specific chattels, together\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nwith damages for their unlawful detention. Trover was an action for damages\r\narising out of the unlawful conversion of personal property.\" Reynolds v. Philips,\r\n72 S.C. 32, 51 S.E. 523 (1905). The claim and delivery statutes (now codified at\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §§15-69-10 et seq.) combine trover and replevin. Id.\r\n\n             served by certified mail, to the last known address as appears in\r\n             the records of the governmental agency which records the title\r\n             or lien.\r\n\r\n             The judge shall determine whether the property is subject to\r\n             forfeiture and order the forfeiture confirmed . . . .\r\n\r\nSince respondent's goods were seized in Florence County, the Florence County\r\ncourt of common pleas has jurisdiction over any forfeiture-related proceedings. §\r\n39-15-1195(D); § 44-53-320(a).\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that while it has custody of respondent's seized property, the\r\nobligation to initiate a forfeiture action in a reasonable time rests with \"the\r\nAttorney General or his designee or the circuit solicitor or his designee\" and not\r\nwith the law enforcement agency that executed the warrant. § 44-53-530(a). We\r\nagree. Further, the Court of Appeals acknowledged as much, relying in its opinion\r\non § 44-53-530. The opinion, however, then states that § 39-15-1195(C) requires\r\nlaw enforcement to institute forfeiture proceedings \"within a reasonable time\" and\r\nconcludes petitioner did not \"discharge[e] its statutorily mandated responsibility to\r\ncommence forfeiture proceedings in a timely manner.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with petitioner that it has no statutory authority, much less \"mandated\r\nresponsibility\" to commence forfeiture proceedings. While § 39-15-1195(C) does\r\nnot explicitly identify the party who is to bring the forfeiture proceedings, it does\r\nstate, \"proceedings pursuant to Section 44-53-530 regarding forfeiture and\r\ndisposition must be instituted within a reasonable time.\" As § 44-53-530(a) states,\r\nand as the Court of Appeals initially recognized, forfeiture proceedings are brought\r\nby \"the appropriate prosecution authority\" with notice to law enforcement. The\r\nCourt of Appeals erred in finding petitioner breached a statutory duty by failing to\r\nbring forfeiture proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals also held that petitioner's failure to fulfill its duty to institute\r\na forfeiture proceeding within a reasonable time relieved respondent of his\r\n\"option\" to bring his own action under § 39-15-1195(H)(1). This subsection\r\nprovides:    An owner may apply to the court of common pleas for the\r\n             return of an item seized pursuant to the provisions of this\r\n             chapter. Notice of hearing or rule to show cause accompanied\r\n             by a copy of the application must be directed to all persons and\r\n\n             agencies entitled to notice as provided in Section 44-53-530. If\r\n             the court denies the application, the hearing may proceed as a\r\n             forfeiture hearing held pursuant to the provisions of Section 44-\r\n             53-530.\r\n\r\nWe find that (H) does not represent an \"option,\" but is instead the sole method by\r\nwhich an owner may demand that the prosecuting agency either have law\r\nenforcement return the property or institute a forfeiture proceeding.\r\n\r\nRespondent contends that a full reading of § 39-15-1195(H) indicates it only\r\napplies to innocent owners. Specifically, respondent relies on (H)(2), which allows\r\na court to return a seized item if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of\r\nevidence that he was \"innocent\" with respect to the use of the property. The\r\nthreshold question, whether in a forfeiture initiated by the responsible prosecutorial\r\nagency or in an owner's § 39-15-1195(H) action, is whether the property is subject\r\nto forfeiture. At that juncture, the determination is made whether the property is\r\ncontraband per se or derivative contraband. See Mims Amusement Co. v. SLED,\r\n366 S.C. 1, 621 S.E.2d 344 (2005) (contraband per se is illegal to possess and\r\ntherefore not susceptible of ownership while derivative contraband is ordinarily\r\nlegal to possess but forfeitable if an instrumentality of a crime). Only if\r\ncontraband is derivative is the owner's knowledge relevant under (H)(2) because\r\nonly derivative contraband can be returned to an innocent owner. Subsection H\r\nwas available to respondent.\r\n\r\nFinally, it appears that the Court of Appeals' decision was driven in large part by\r\nits concerns for respondent's due process rights. As petitioner rightly points out,\r\nrespondent never asserted any constitutional deprivation either at the circuit court\r\nor in his appellate court briefs. While courts should construe statutes as\r\nconstitutional if possible, there was no reason to reach the due process question\r\nhere.3\r\n\r\n While not properly before the Court, we briefly address the issue in order to\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\ndispel any uncertainty created by the Court of Appeals. Were § 39-15-1195 and §\r\n44-53-530 actually subjected to a due process challenge, it appears that both would\r\nsurvive such a challenge by the owner of the seized property. This Court has held\r\nthe most due process requires is a post-seizure opportunity for an innocent owner\r\n\"to come forward and show, if he can, why the res should not be forfeited . . . .\"\r\nState v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872\r\n(2000) (internal citation omitted). Further, whether a prosecutorial delay in\r\ninstituting forfeiture proceedings violates the owner's due process right is a fact-\r\n\nPetitioner also argues that the circuit court erred when it stated that law\r\nenforcement \"simply cannot hold [respondent's] property unless it is being held for\r\nuse in a criminal proceeding\" and that the Court of Appeals compounded the error\r\nby repeating this statement without comment. We agree. Seized property can be\r\nheld for other than criminal prosecution purposes, as civil forfeiture is available\r\neven where no criminal proceeding is contemplated. Moreover, even if a criminal\r\ndefendant is acquitted or charges are dropped, contraband per se (e.g., illegal\r\ndrugs, counterfeit goods) is never returnable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nRespondent's remedy under these circumstances is found in § 39-15-1195(H).\r\nInstead of exercising that option, he chose instead to bring this replevin action, a\r\nremedy specifically forbidden by § 39-15-1195(D). The circuit court erred in not\r\ndismissing respondent's suit, and the Court of Appeals compounded the error. We\r\nhave been informed that petitioner no longer has custody of the seized property,\r\nand express our disappointment that it failed to safeguard the property during the\r\npendency of this matter. Since respondent's attorney acknowledged at oral\r\nargument that respondent could not establish that the seized goods were not\r\ncounterfeit within the meaning of § 39-15-1190, however, we need not address\r\nwhether he would otherwise have a remedy against petitioner. For the reasons\r\ngiven above, the decision of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the decision of\r\nthe circuit court reversed.\r\n\r\nVACATED AND REVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nintensive inquiry subject to the same considerations applicable to a constitutional\r\nspeedy trial claim. United States v. $8,850, 461 U.S. 555 (1983) (length of delay,\r\nreason for delay, owner's assertion of right, and prejudice). Obviously no due\r\nprocess claim was made here. Moreover, the Court of Appeals erred in relying on\r\ntwo federal cases involving a statute that provided no owner-initiated option, and\r\nfurther misread Moore v. Timmerman, 276 S.C. 104, 276 S.E.2d 280 (1984), which\r\nmerely reiterates that an owner of seized property must have an opportunity to be\r\nheard.\r\n\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREGDE, JJ., concur.

Peace, of Greenwood, for\r\nRespondent.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Andrew Lee Harrison (Appellant) contends that the\r\ntrial court erred in refusing to find that the penalty portion of section 56-5-1210 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code offends the Eighth Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On the morning of September 27, 2009, Appellant picked up a 2003 Ford F­\r\n350 truck from Wilson's Auto Sales for detailing. Appellant drove the truck a short\r\ndistance in Greenwood County on U.S. Route 25 (Highway 25), a highway\r\ncomprised of two northbound and southbound lanes. Appellant travelled to\r\nParson's Used Cars to perform the detailing work. At approximately 3:00 p.m.,\r\nAppellant completed the detailing work and exited Parson's by making a right turn\r\nonto the southbound lane of Highway 25.\r\n\r\n       Gary Tims (the Victim) and Daniel Gantt were travelling on Highway 25 in\r\nthe same direction as Appellant, and in the left lane. The Victim and Gantt were\r\nboth riding motorcycles. Gantt rode approximately one \"bike length\" behind the\r\nVictim. Appellant entered Highway 25, but instead of utilizing the right lane,\r\npulled his vehicle into the left lane. The Victim lost temporary control of his\r\nmotorcycle and shifted to the right lane to avoid Appellant's vehicle. However,\r\nAppellant simultaneously switched to the right lane and the Victim struck the rear\r\nof Appellant's truck. The Victim's motorcycle \"flipped over,\" and the Victim\r\nlanded in the highway. Appellant did not stop, but continued driving on Highway\r\n25. Gantt followed Appellant until Appellant pulled over approximately one-half\r\nmile from the accident. Gantt informed Appellant that the Victim was \"laying [sic]\r\ndown in the highway,\" and that Gantt did not know whether the Victim was \"dead\r\nor alive.\" Appellant inspected the damage to the truck and stated that he did not\r\npossess a valid driver's license, because his driver's license had been suspended.\r\nAppellant agreed to return to the scene of the accident. However, once Gantt\r\ndeparted to return to the scene, Appellant travelled in the opposite direction. It is\r\nundisputed that Appellant never returned to the scene of the accident. Law\r\nenforcement officers later located Appellant hiding in the closet of a vacant house\r\nand placed him in custody.\r\n\r\n      The Greenwood County Grand Jury indicted Appellant for driving under\r\nsuspension, in violation of section 56-1-0460 of the South Carolina Code and\r\nleaving the scene with death, in violation of section 56-5-1210 of the South\r\nCarolina Code. A jury convicted Appellant of both charges. The trial court\r\nsentenced Appellant to twenty years' imprisonment for leaving the scene with\r\n\ndeath, and a concurrent sentence of six months' imprisonment for driving under\r\nsuspension. Appellant argues that section 56-5-1210 is unconstitutional, and\r\nappealed his conviction pursuant to Rule 203(d), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      Whether the trial court erred in finding that the penalty portion of section 56­\r\n      5-1210 of the South Carolina Code does not offend the Eighth Amendment's\r\n      prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       This Court has a very limited scope of review in cases involving a\r\nconstitutional challenge to a statute. Joytime Distrib. & Amusement Co. v. State,\r\n338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d 647, 651 (1999). All statutes are presumed\r\nconstitutional and will, if possible, be construed so as to render them valid. Davis\r\nv. Cnty. of Greenville, 332 S.C. 73, 77, 470 S.E.2d 94, 96 (1996).

We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which applies\r\nagainst the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: \"Excessive\r\nbail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\r\npunishments inflicted.\" U.S. CONST. amend.

The Proportionality Principle\r\n\r\n       The United States Supreme Court first recognized a constitutional principle\r\nof proportionality in Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910). In that case the\r\ndefendant had been convicted of falsifying a public document and sentenced to\r\nfifteen years of \"cadena temporal,\" a type of imprisonment including hard labor in\r\n\nchains, and permanent civil disabilities. Id. at 367. The Supreme Court held the\r\npunishment cruel and unusual because it was not graduated and proportioned to\r\noffense, and therefore violated the Eighth Amendment. Id. In Robinson v.\r\nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962), the Supreme Court held a 90-day sentence for the\r\ncrime of \"addicted to the use of narcotics,\" excessive despite the fact that such a\r\nshort sentence is not, in the abstract, cruel or unusual. Id. at 667. However, the\r\nSupreme Court looked at the actual nature of the crime in finding, \"Even one day\r\nin prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a\r\ncommon cold.\"1 Id.\r\n\r\n       In Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), the Supreme Court applied the\r\nproportionality principle to a felony prison term. In that case, the defendant pled\r\nguilty to check fraud. Id. at 281. At the time of his conviction, South Dakota law\r\nprovided for a maximum punishment of five years' imprisonment and a $5,000\r\nfine. Id. However, the defendant was sentenced pursuant to the state's recidivist\r\nstatute due to his six previous non-felony convictions. Id. (citing S.D. Codified\r\nLaws § 32-23-4 (1976)). The recidivist statute mandated that a defendant\r\nconvicted of three prior felonies, in addition to the principal felony, receive life\r\nimprisonment. Id. at 281–82 (\"The maximum penalty for a 'Class 1 felony' was\r\nlife imprisonment in the state penitentiary and a $25,000 fine.\"). Following\r\nexhaustion of his state appeals, the defendant sought habeas relief. Id. at 283–84.\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held the defendant's\r\nsentence \"grossly disproportionate to the nature of the offense,\" and ordered the\r\nDistrict Court to issue the writ unless the State resentenced the defendant. Id. at\r\n284. The Supreme Court affirmed, and provided \"objective factors\" to guide\r\ncourts in reviewing the proportionality of sentences under the Eighth Amendment.\r\n\r\n       First, courts should look to the gravity of the offense and the harshness of\r\nthe penalty. Id. at 290–91. Second, it may be helpful to compare the sentence to\r\nsentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction. Id. at 291. If more\r\nserious crimes carry the same penalty, or less serious penalties, then that is some\r\nindication that the punishment at issue may be excessive. Id. Third, courts may\r\nalso compare the sentences imposed for the commission of the same crime in other\r\n\r\n Later, the Supreme Court applied the proportionality principle to hold capital\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\npunishment excessive in certain circumstances. See Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S.\r\n782, 798–801 (1982) (finding the death penalty an excessive punishment for felony\r\nmurder when defendant did not take life, attempt to take life, or intend that life be\r\ntaken or that lethal force be used); Coker v. Ga., 433 U.S. 584, 592 (1977) (holding\r\nthe death penalty excessive punishment for the crime of rape).\r\n\njurisdictions. Id. at 291–92 (\"In Enmund [v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982)], the\r\nCourt conducted an extensive review of capital punishment statutes and\r\ndetermined that 'only about a third of American jurisdictions would ever permit a\r\ndefendant [such as Enmund] to be sentenced to die.'\" (alterations in original)). The\r\nCourt applied these objective criteria to the defendant's crime and found that he\r\nreceived the \"penultimate sentence for relatively minor criminal conduct.\" Id. at\r\n303 (\"He has been treated more harshly than other criminals in the State who have\r\ncommitted more serious crimes. He has been treated more harshly than he would\r\nhave been in any other jurisdiction, with the possible exception of a single state.\r\nWe conclude that his sentence is significantly disproportionate to his crime, and is\r\ntherefore prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\").\r\n\r\n       Solem appeared to stand for a continued, if not strengthened, Eighth\r\nAmendment prohibition against disproportional sentences. However, in Harmelin\r\nv. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), the Supreme Court narrowed, significantly at\r\npoints, its proportionality guidance.\r\n\r\n       In Harmelin, the petitioner was convicted of possessing more than 650\r\ngrams of cocaine and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without\r\nthe possibility of parole. 501 U.S. at 961. The petitioner claimed that his sentence\r\nviolated the Eighth Amendment because it was \"significantly disproportionate\" to\r\nthe crime he committed, and because the sentencing court was statutorily required\r\nto impose the term of imprisonment without taking into account the particularized\r\ncircumstances of the crime and of the criminal. Id. at 961–62.\r\n\r\n       Justice Scalia delivered the Court's decision in a four part opinion, and\r\nconcluded that the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality review. Id. at\r\n965 (\"We have addressed anew, and in greater detail, the question whether the\r\nEighth Amendment contains a proportionality guarantee—with particular attention\r\nto the background of the Eighth Amendment (which Solem discussed in only two\r\npages.)\").\r\n\r\n       In Parts I and II of the opinion, Justice Scalia rejected the notion that the\r\nframers of the Federal Constitution intended the Eighth Amendment to prohibit\r\ndisproportionate punishments. Justice Scalia noted specifically that state\r\nconstitutions at the time contained such provisions, but the framers of the Federal\r\nConstitution specifically chose not to include such a guarantee. Id. 978–85 (\"Both\r\nthe New Hampshire Constitution, adopted 8 years before ratification of the Eighth\r\nAmendment, and the Ohio Constitution, adopted 12 years after, contain, in separate\r\nprovisions, a prohibition of 'cruel and unusual punishments' . . . and a requirement\r\n\nthat 'all penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offence.'\" (emphasis\r\nin original)). In Part III of the opinion, Justice Scalia expressed his disapproval\r\nthat 20th century Supreme Court jurisprudence did not directly reflect the idea that\r\nthe Eighth Amendment does not contain a proportionality requirement. Id. at 990.\r\nJustice Scalia's point of view on this issue can be succinctly summarized: A\r\nsentence within statutory limits is not cruel and unusual punishment, but to the\r\nextent the Court applied a proportionality review to capital punishment, \"death is\r\ndifferent,\" and courts should \"leave it there,\" and not extend it further. Id. at 992–\r\n93. In Part IV of the opinion, Justice Scalia analyzed the petitioner's claim that\r\nimposition of a severe punishment without consideration of mitigating factors,\r\nsuch as lack of prior felony convictions, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\r\nId. at 994. The Supreme Court had previously held that a capital sentence is cruel\r\nand unusual if it is imposed without an individualized determination that the\r\npunishment is \"appropriate.\" Id. at 995. However, according to Justice Scalia,\r\neven a severe sentence, such as life without the possibility of parole, cannot\r\ncompare with the finality and irrevocability of death. Id. at 995–96. Thus, the\r\nSupreme Court declined to extend the individualized sentencing analysis outside\r\nthe capital context. Id.\r\n\r\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist joined Justice Scalia in Parts I–IV of the opinion.\r\nJustices Kennedy, O'Connor, and Souter joined Justice Scalia in Part IV of the\r\nopinion. Justice Kennedy wrote separately, concurring in part and concurring in\r\nthe judgment. Id. at 996. Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter joined Justice\r\nKennedy's concurrence. Id. Justices White, Marshall, Stevens, and Blackmun\r\ndissented. Id. at 1009–29.\r\n\r\n      Justice Kennedy's concurrence adhered to a narrow proportionality principle:\r\n\r\n      All of these principles—the primacy of the legislature, the variety of\r\n      legitimate penological schemes, the nature of our federal system, and\r\n      the requirement that proportionality review be guided by objective\r\n      factors—inform the final one: The Eighth Amendment does not\r\n      require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. Rather, it\r\n      forbids only extreme sentences that are \"grossly disproportionate\" to\r\n      the crime.\r\n\r\nId. at 998, 1001 (citation omitted).\r\n\n       Justice Kennedy wrote that Solem did not announce a rigid three-part test,\r\nbut instead considered comparative factors after analyzing the gravity of the\r\noffense and the harshness of the penalty.\r\n\r\n      Solem is best understood as holding that comparative analysis within\r\n      and between jurisdictions is not always relevant to proportionality\r\n      review. The [Solem] Court stated that \"it may be helpful to compare\r\n      sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction,\" and\r\n      that \"courts may find it useful to compare sentences imposed for\r\n      commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\" It did not\r\n      mandate such inquires.\r\n\r\nId. at 1004 (\"In fact, Solem stated that in determining unconstitutional\r\ndisproportionality, 'no one factor will be dispositive in a given case.'\") (citation\r\nomitted). Thus, Justice Kennedy concluded:\r\n\r\n      A better reading of our cases leads to the conclusion that\r\n      intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional analyses are appropriate only\r\n      in the rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime\r\n      committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross\r\n      disproportionality.\r\n\r\nId. at 1005.\r\n\r\n       This Court has yet to definitively reconcile the Solem factors with Harmelin.\r\nIn State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 543 S.E.2d 541 (2001), the defendant challenged\r\nsection 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code. See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-25-45\r\n(Supp. 2011) (\"Life sentence for person convicted of certain crimes\"). The\r\ndefendant asserted, inter alia, that the statute constituted cruel and unusual\r\npunishment. Id. at 56, 543 S.E.2d at 544–45. We analyzed the defendant's claim\r\npursuant to Solem, but acknowledged that this exercise may not have been\r\nnecessary due to Harmelin:\r\n\r\n      It is questionable, in light of the United States Supreme Court's\r\n      opinion in Harmelin v. Michigan, whether the stringent three-factor\r\n      Solem inquiry remains mandated in \"cruel and unusual punishment\"\r\n      cases. However, we need not decide the matter here since, in our\r\n      view, even the more stringent test of Solem is met in this case.\r\n\nId. at 56 n.11, 543 S.E.2d at 545 n.11 (citation omitted); see State v. McKnight, 352\r\nS.C. 635, 652 n.7, 576 S.E.2d 168, 177 n.7 (2003) (\"It is questionable, in light of\r\nthe United States Supreme Court's opinion in Harmelin v. Michigan, whether the\r\nstringent three-factor Solem inquiry remains mandated in 'cruel and unusual\r\npunishment' cases.\" (citing State v. Brannon, 341 S.C. 271, 533 S.E.2d 345 Ct.\r\nApp. 2000)).\r\n\r\n       However, we now hold that Justice Kennedy's concurrence is the controlling\r\nlaw of Harmelin, and represents a significant constraint on the Solem test. See\r\nHawkins v. Haggert, 200 F.3d 1279, 1282 n.1 (10th Cir. 1999) (\"The controlling\r\nposition is the one 'taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the\r\nnarrowest grounds.'\") (citing Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977)).\r\nThe decisions of federal circuit courts addressing the proportionality principle\r\nreflect this view. United States v. MacEwan, 445 F.3d 237, 248 (3d Cir. 2006)\r\n(\"Consequently, in assessing such a challenge, the first proportionality factor acts\r\nas a gateway or threshold. If the defendant fails to show a gross imbalance\r\nbetween the crime and the sentence, our analysis is at an end.\"); McGruder v.\r\nPuckett, 954 F.2d 313, 314 (5th Cir. 1992); McCullough v. Singletary, 967 F.2d\r\n530, 535 (11th Cir. 1992) (\"The Fifth Circuit held that if a determination was made\r\nthat a sentence was grossly disproportionate after comparing the sentence to the\r\noffense, only then would the remaining Solem factors be considered. We agree\r\nwith the McGruder analysis.\") (citation omitted); United States v. Bland, 961 F.2d\r\n123, 129 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"We conclude that Justice Kennedy's view that the eighth\r\namendment 'forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the\r\ncrime' is the rule of Harmelin.\"); United States v. Hooper, 941 F.2d 419, 422 (6th\r\nCir. 1991) (\"Hooper's ten-month jail term easily survives the 'narrow\r\nproportionality principle' applied by the Harmelin plurality, the opinion that is, we\r\nbelieve, binding upon us.\"); United States v. Johnson, 944 F.2d 396, 409 (8th Cir.\r\n1991) (declining to find gross disproportionality and \"in light of Harmelin,\"\r\nfinding a proportionality review unnecessary); see also Clark v. State, 981 A.2d\r\n710, 712 (Md. 2009) (\"The submission invokes a two-step analysis. First, we must\r\n'determine whether the sentence appears to be grossly disproportionate.' If so, then\r\nwe should 'engage in a more detailed Solem [v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983)] type\r\nanalysis.'\") (citations omitted); Dunaway v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 663 S.E.2d\r\n117, 132 (Va. 2008) (\"Thus, we examine the sentence at issue in relation to the\r\ncrime only for \"gross disproportionality. Only if we find such gross disparity will\r\nwe proceed further with the analysis.\")2\r\n\r\n2We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit appears to\r\ncontinue to apply the full Solem test:\r\n\n       We find that the foregoing authority demonstrates the proper articulation of\r\nproportionality review as discussed in Harmelin and Somelin. Thus, in analyzing\r\nproportionality under the Eight Amendment outside the capital context, South\r\nCarolina courts shall first determine whether a comparison between the sentence\r\nand the crime committed gives rise to an inference of gross disproportionality. If\r\nno such inference is present, the analysis ends. In the rare instance that this\r\nthreshold comparison gives rise to such an inference, intrajurisdictional and\r\ninterjurisdictional analysis is appropriate. Courts may then look to whether more\r\nserious crimes carry the same penalty, or more serious penalties, and the sentences\r\nimposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions. Courts should\r\nuse this comparative analysis to confirm the gross disproportionality inference, and\r\nnot to develop an inference when one did not initially exist. See Harmelin, 501\r\nU.S. at 1005 (\"The proper role for comparative analysis of sentences, then, is to\r\nvalidate an initial judgment that a sentence is grossly disproportionate to a crime.\r\nThis conclusion neither 'eviscerates' Solem, nor 'abandons its second and third\r\nfactors.'\"). Having articulated the proper framework for Eighth Amendment\r\nproportionality review, we turn to the facts of Appellant's case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      It may be somewhat unclear, in light of the Supreme Court's decision\r\n      in Harmelin, whether Solem's three-part proportionality test is still\r\n      relevant in noncapital cases. Indeed as noted above, the Harmelin\r\n      Court issued three separate, and somewhat conflicting, opinions\r\n      discussing the scope of the Eighth Amendment's proportionality\r\n      guarantee, which ranged from a virtual repudiation of Solem . . . to a\r\n      recognition of a \"narrow\" proportionality doctrine . . . to an explicit\r\n      approval of Solem . . . . Despite the Court's conflicting opinions on the\r\n      issue, however, the continuing applicability of the Solem test is\r\n      indicated by the fact that a majority of the Harmelin Court either\r\n      declined expressly to overrule Solem or explicitly approved of Solem.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Kratsas, 45 F.3d 63, 67 (4th Cir. 1995) (rejecting the\r\ndefendant's claim that a sentence of life without parole for conspiracy to\r\ndistribute and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of\r\ncocaine is disproportionate punishment under the Eighth Amendment).\r\nHowever, Justice Kennedy's concurrence explicitly narrowed Solem. Thus\r\nwe decline to follow the Fourth Circuit's precedent regarding Solem and\r\nHarmelin.\r\n\n                        B. Proportionality of Section 56-5-1210\r\n\r\n       Under section 56-5-1210 of the South Carolina Code, the driver of a vehicle\r\ninvolved in an accident resulting in injury or death must immediately stop their\r\nvehicle at the scene of the accident or as close to the accident as possible. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 56-5-210(A) (2006). In the event that death occurs from the accident,\r\na person who fails to stop or comply with the requirements of section 56-5-1210 is\r\nguilty of a felony. Id. § 56-5-1210(A)(3). Upon conviction, the defendant must be\r\nimprisoned for at least one year, but not more than twenty-five years, and fined\r\nbetween $10,000 and $25,000 dollars. Id.\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the gravity of the offense in this case is not\r\nproportionate to the severity of the punishment. According to Appellant, \"the\r\nunlawful conduct is the same whether leaving the accident scene results in property\r\ndamage to an unattended vehicle or death of another party involved in the\r\naccident.\" Additionally, Appellant avers that the statute does not require a\r\ndefendant to have caused the accident to be charged with leaving the scene, \"and\r\nthe penalty adjusts based on the result rather than on the underlying conduct of\r\nleaving.\" Appellant may raise valid points demonstrating the statutes possible\r\nweaknesses. However, the proper inquiry is not whether the General Assembly\r\ncrafted the most correct or just scheme to address the covered conduct, but instead\r\nwhether the General Assembly could rationally conclude that the conduct poses a\r\nrisk substantial enough to support the penalty portion of the statute.\r\n\r\n       In 1996, the General Assembly amended section 56-5-1210 to provide for\r\nthe current penalties for leaving the scene of the accident where death occurs. The\r\nalarming facts regarding South Carolina road and vehicle safety support the\r\nGeneral Assembly's decision to allow a possibly severe penalty in the event an\r\nindividual decides to leave the scene of an accident in which death results. In\r\n1995, South Carolina had over 125,000 automobile collisions, and 882 of those\r\ncollisions resulted in death. SOUTH CAROLINA BUDGET AND CONTROL BOARD,\r\nSouth Carolina Statistical Abstract, South Carolina Traffic Collisions, Fatalities,\r\nNon-Fatal Injuries, Mileage Death Rate and Vehicle Miles of Travel (1970-2005),\r\navailable at http://abstract.sc.gov/chapter16/transport6.php. The next year, there\r\nwere over 120,000 collisions, and 930 deaths related to those collisions. Id. Over\r\nthe next ten years, the number of collisions per year fell below 100,000 only once,\r\nand the number of fatalities remained constant at over 900 per year. Id.\r\n\r\n      More recent statistics demonstrate an equally troubling picture. In 2006,\r\nSouth Carolina tied for fifth worst in the nation in terms of traffic fatalities per 100\r\n\nmillion vehicle miles. UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU,\r\nhttp://www.census.gov/statab/ranks/rank39.html (last visited Oct. 24, 2012).\r\nAccording to the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, approximately\r\n106,864 automobile accidents occurred in South Carolina in 2009, and of those,\r\n48,303 resulted in non-fatal injury and 894 resulted in death. SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nTRAFFIC COLLISION FACT BOOK (2009), available at\r\nhttp://www.scdps.gov/ohs/2009TrafficCollisionFactBook.pdf. In 2009, forty-two\r\npercent of all traffic deaths in South Carolina resulted from driving under the\r\ninfluence of alcohol. Id. at 76. Only two states in the nation reported higher totals.\r\nId. This limited summary alone supports the General Assembly's decision to create\r\na statute that deters individuals from leaving the scene of a vehicular accident.\r\n\r\n       The structure of the statute itself addresses Appellant's argument. Section\r\n56-5-1210 gives the trial court broad discretion to account for the unique facts and\r\ncircumstances of individual cases. If an individual leaves the scene of the accident,\r\nthe conduct is technically the same, whether property damage or death results.\r\nHowever, the statute does not provide the same penalty for that conduct. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 56-5-1210(A)(1)–(3) (2006). Depending on the circumstances of the\r\nparticular accident, the trial court may choose to sentence a defendant to as little as\r\none year in jail, even if death occurs. Id. § 56-5-1210(A)(3).\r\n\r\n       However, Appellant's actions appear to be just the type the General\r\nAssembly intended to punish when enacting section 56-5-1210. Appellant\r\noperated a motor vehicle without a driver's license. He negligently placed that\r\nvehicle in front of the Victim so that he was unable to avoid a collision.\r\nSubsequently, Appellant did not stop to consider the accident at all until a third\r\nparty followed him some distance down the road. Appellant expressed more\r\nconcern regarding possible damage to his vehicle than to the Victim, and refused to\r\nreturn to the scene of the crime. In sum, Appellant caused an accident, left the\r\nscene of that accident, and when confronted with the possibility that the other party\r\nto the accident had been severely injured or killed, refused to return to the scene of\r\nthe accident. Despite Appellant's reprehensible behavior, the trial court did not\r\nsentence him to the maximum punishment under the statute.\r\n\r\n      The trial court balanced Appellant's behavior, prior criminal history, and\r\nabsence of intent:\r\n\r\n      I understand that there was no intent to cause this accident, I\r\n      understand that you did not set out on this particular day to injure [the\r\n      Victim] or anyone else, for that matter. The inescapable fact, though .\r\n\n      . . is that in reality you caused this accident by being present where\r\n      you had no business to be and that you were driving a car, sir . . . . I\r\n      also have to consider your criminal history. I count [twenty-seven]\r\n      offenses. A lot of these, I agree with your attorney, they happened\r\n      when you were young and I understand . . . how young people can\r\n      make mistakes . . . I just can't disregard it . . . because you have\r\n      demonstrated over and over again a pattern of being unable to not\r\n      only obey the law but to stay out from behind the wheel of a car . . . .\r\n      It is my job to take all of this into consideration and work out some\r\n      sort of calculation, and I'm not all unsympathetic to the arguments of\r\n      counsel that you are being punished far in excess.\r\n\r\n        The trial court's statements at sentencing are the very embodiment of\r\nproportionality, and the court performed the analysis envisioned by the statute's\r\nbroad penalty provision and in sentencing Appellant based on the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the case. It is inexplicable that a statute's provisions which give a\r\ntrial court the discretion to sentence the defendant in proportion to the\r\ncircumstances of the case, could be found to give rise to an inference of gross\r\ndisproportionality.\r\n\r\n       The United States Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that the\r\nlegislature has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts\r\nany sentencing discretion. See, e.g., Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 467\r\n(1991); see also Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1006 (\"To set aside petitioner's mandatory\r\nsentence would require rejection not of the judgment of a single jurist, as in Solem,\r\nbut rather the collective wisdom of the Michigan Legislature, and, as a\r\nconsequence, the Michigan citizenry. We have never invalidated a penalty by a\r\nlegislature based only on the length of a sentence . . . we should do so only in the\r\nmost extreme circumstances.\"). Courts do not have to accept the wisdom of a\r\nlegislature's sentencing scheme, but merely accept the fact that arguments for or\r\nagainst a particular sentencing scheme are for the legislature to resolve. See\r\nHarmelin, 501 U.S. at 1007–08 (questioning the actual deterrent effect of the law's\r\nmandatory scheme, but refusing to find that it had no chance of success).\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing analysis, we find that the General Assembly could\r\nrationally conclude that leaving the scene of an accident where death results poses\r\na risk substantial enough to support the penalty portion of the statute. Thus, we\r\nhold that the penalty provision of section 56-5-1210 is not grossly disproportionate\r\nto the offense, and no further review is necessary. See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\nof Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate\r\n\ncourt need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is\r\ndispositive of the appeal). However, we continue our discussion to provide\r\nguidance on this previously unfamiliar analysis for the benefit of the bench and\r\nbar. See, e.g., Harris v. Anderson Cnty. Sheriff's Office, 381 S.C. 357, 364, 673\r\nS.E.2d 423, 427 (2009) (\"We broach this subject for the benefit of the bench and\r\nbar, as some adhere to the belief that section 47–3–110 liability against a dog\r\nowner incorporates negligence principles.\").\r\n\r\n   i. Intrajurisdictional Comparisons\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the penalty imposed under section 56-5-1210 is greater\r\nthan the penalty that can be imposed for more serious crimes under South Carolina\r\nlaw. If more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious\r\npenalties, that is some indication that the punishment at issue may be excessive.\r\nSolem, 463 U.S. at 291.\r\n\r\n        In Solem, where the defendant had been sentenced to a life sentence without\r\nparole for habitual nonviolent offenses, the Supreme Court considered the\r\nsentences that could be imposed on other criminals within the same jurisdiction.\r\nId. at 298. The Court found that:\r\n\r\n      In sum, there were a handful of crimes that were necessarily punished\r\n      by life imprisonment: murder, and, on a second or third offense,\r\n      treason, first degree manslaughter, first degree arson, and kidnapping.\r\n      There was a larger group for which life imprisonment was authorized\r\n      in the discretion of the sentencing judge. Finally, there was a large\r\n      group of very serious offenses for which life imprisonment was not\r\n      authorized, including a third offense of heroin dealing or aggravated\r\n      assault.\r\n\r\nId. at 298–99. Based on this review, the Court found that the defendant had been\r\ntreated \"in the same manner as, or more severely than,\" criminals who committed\r\nfar more serious crimes. Id. at 299.\r\n\r\n      Review of analogous provisions under the South Carolina Code tends to\r\nsupport the notion that section 56-5-1210 provides a penalty substantially similar\r\nto more serious offenses. For example, section 56-5-2910 of the South Carolina\r\nCode covers reckless vehicular homicide. That statute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n      When the death of a person ensues within three years as a proximate\r\n      result of injury received by the driving of a vehicle in reckless\r\n      disregard of the safety of others, the person operating the vehicle is\r\n      guilty of reckless vehicular homicide. A person who is convicted of,\r\n      pleads guilty to, or pleads nolo contendere to reckless vehicular\r\n      homicide is guilty of a felony, and must be fined not less than one\r\n      thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned\r\n      not more than ten years or both.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2910 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Section 56-5-2945 of the South Carolina Code mirrors section 56-5-1210's\r\npenalty provision, but for what is arguably a much more serious crime. Section\r\n56-5-2945 covers the offense of felony driving under the influence, and provides in\r\npertinent part:\r\n\r\n      (A) A person who, while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or the\r\n          combination of alcohol and drugs, drives a motor vehicle and\r\n          when driving a motor vehicle does any act forbidden by law or\r\n          neglects any duty imposed by law in the driving of the motor\r\n          vehicle, which act or neglect proximately causes great bodily\r\n          injury or death to a person other than himself, is guilty of the\r\n          offense of felony driving under the influence and, upon\r\n          conviction, must be punished:\r\n\r\n            (1) by a mandatory fine of not less than five thousand one\r\n                hundred dollars or more than ten thousand one hundred\r\n                dollars and mandatory imprisonment for not less than thirty\r\n                days nor more than fifteen years when great bodily injury\r\n                results;\r\n\r\n            (2) by a mandatory fine of not less than ten thousand one\r\n                hundred dollars nor more than twenty-five thousand one\r\n                hundred dollars and mandatory imprisonment for not less\r\n                than one year nor more than twenty-five years when death\r\n                results.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2945 (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). Thus, an individual\r\nwho causes the death of another either through reckless driving or driving while\r\nintoxicated may face the same or similar punishment as someone who leaves the\r\n\nscene of an accident where death results. However, a person convicted of\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter, a crime requiring a showing of criminal negligence,\r\nmay be imprisoned for no more than five years.3 At first glance, this appears to be\r\nthe very type of constitutionally impermissible disproportionality observed in\r\nSolem. Essentially, one could argue that an individual who leaves the scene of a\r\ndeadly accident for which they are technically not \"at fault,\" could receive a\r\nharsher penalty than someone who acts with reckless intent and a proven careless\r\ndisregard for the safety of others.\r\n\r\n       Harmelin cautions against drawing such conclusions based on bare\r\ncomparisons. According to Justice Kennedy, one of the key limits on\r\nproportionality review is that the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves\r\na substantial penological judgment, a judgment not best exercised by the courts.\r\nHarmelin, 501 U.S. at 998. In addition, the efficacy of any sentencing system\r\ncannot be assessed absent agreement about the purposes and objectives of the\r\npenal system. Id. at 998–1000. The responsibility for making these fundamental\r\nchoices and implementing them lies with the legislature. Id. at 999–1000. The\r\nGeneral Assembly's sentencing scheme reflects the complexity of circumstances\r\narising from dangerous traffic offenses, and allows the entity in the best position to\r\nassess the evidence, the trial court, discretion in determining the appropriate\r\npunishment. It is not irrational to conceive of a scenario in which leaving the\r\nscene of an accident resulting in death might call for a greater punishment than\r\ncausing a death due to felony driving under the influence. Thus, we refuse to\r\nconclude that the General Assembly must ignore valid factual and policy\r\nconsiderations in favor of abstract notions of proportionality.4\r\n\r\n      Moreover, offenders sentenced under section 56-5-1210 are not necessarily\r\nsubject to a harsher punishment than criminals convicted of more serious crimes.\r\nThe sentencing scheme merely allows the trial court discretion in balancing the\r\nmany factors at play in cases where operation of a motor vehicle results in death.\r\nOur analysis does not stand for the proposition that this Court cannot properly\r\ndraw a line between certain penalties, and decide that one penalty violates the\r\nEighth Amendment while another does not. See Solem, 463 U.S. at 294\r\n\r\n3   See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-60 (2003).\r\n4 The General Assembly may have concluded, for example, that an individual, who\r\nacted negligently, perhaps in the involuntary manslaughter context, deserves a\r\nlighter sentence than someone in Appellant's case who caused a death by\r\npurposeful conduct, and then refused to even acknowledge the resulting chaos.\r\n\n(\"Decisions of this kind, although troubling, are not unique to this area. The courts\r\nare constantly called upon to draw similar lines in a variety of contexts.\").\r\nHowever, in the instant case, the question before the Court is not one of fixed\r\npenalties. Instead, this Court is asked to draw a line which says that the General\r\nAssembly should give trial courts sentencing discretion with regard to some crimes\r\nand not others. This type of determination, and the conflicting interests and\r\ndisagreements of discretion and sentencing, are strictly questions of legislative\r\npolicy. See Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 998–99 (\"Thus 'reviewing courts . . . should\r\ngrant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily\r\npossess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes.'\"). An\r\nintrajurisdictional comparison in this case could not support an inference of gross\r\ndisproportionality.\r\n\r\n   ii.      Interjurisdictional Comparisons\r\n\r\n       Courts conducting a proportionality review may find it useful to compare the\r\nsentences imposed for commission of the crime in other jurisdictions. In Enmund\r\nv. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 801 (1983), the Supreme Court held that the death\r\npenalty was excessive for felony murder when the defendant did not take life,\r\nattempt to take life, or intend that life be taken or that lethal force be used. In that\r\ncase, the Court conducted an extensive review of capital punishment statutes and\r\ndetermined that \"only about a third of American jurisdictions would ever permit a\r\ndefendant [such as the defendant] to be sentenced to die.\" Id. at 792. Here,\r\nAppellant argues that other states impose less severe penalties for the leaving the\r\nscene of an accident where death results, and the majority of the country believes\r\nthat a penalty of ten years or less is appropriate for the offense in question.\r\nHowever, a review of those penalties merely demonstrates constitutionally\r\npermissible differences in the way different states choose to approach similar\r\nissues.For example, Appellant cites section 40-6-270 of the Georgia Code which\r\naddresses the duty of a driver in accidents involving personal injury or death. That\r\nstatute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n         (a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in\r\n             injury to or the death of any person or in damage to a vehicle\r\n             which is driven or attended by any person shall immediately stop\r\n             such vehicle at the scene of the accident or shall stop as close\r\n             thereto as possible and forthwith return to the scene of the accident\r\n             ....\r\n\n      (b) If such accident is the proximate cause of death or a serious injury,\r\n          any person knowingly failing to stop and comply with the\r\n          requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section shall be guilty\r\n          of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by\r\n          imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years.\r\n\r\nGa. Code Ann. § 40-6-270 (2011). However, depending on the circumstances of\r\nthe offense the penalty can rise to between three and fifteen years' imprisonment\r\npursuant to section 40-6-393 of the Georgia Code:\r\n\r\n      (b) Any driver of a motor vehicle who, without malice aforethought,\r\n          causes an accident which causes the death of another person and\r\n          leaves the scene of the accident in violation of subsection (b) of\r\n          Code Section 40-6-270 commits the offense of homicide by\r\n          vehicle in the first degree and, upon conviction thereof, shall be\r\n          punished by imprisonment for not less than three years nor more\r\n          than 15 years.\r\n\r\nId. § 40-6-393 (2011). The sentencing range of section 56-5-1210 is not\r\nsubstantially different than the penalty provided for by statute in neighboring\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n       Sentences for offenses similar to Appellant's vary from jurisdiction to\r\njurisdiction. Some states provide a lesser penalty than South Carolina. For\r\nexample, Delaware and Kentucky provide for a maximum five year sentence for\r\nthe offense. See Del. Code Ann. Title 21, §§ 4202–05 (2005 & Supp. 2010); Ky.\r\nRev. Stat. Ann. §§ 189.580, 189.990 (Lexis-Nexis 2009 & Supp. 2012), 532.020\r\n(Lexis-Nexis 2008). Offenders convicted in Maryland or Virginia may receive no\r\nmore than ten years' imprisonment. See Md. Code Ann., Transportation, § 20–102;\r\n27–113(c) (Lexis-Nexis 2009); Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-894 (2010), 18.2–10 (2009).\r\nIn Michigan and Nevada, an offender may receive up to fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 257.617 (West 2005); Nev. Rev.\r\nStat. Ann. § 484E.010 (Lexis-Nexis 2010). However, Nebraska provides a\r\nmaximum sentence of twenty years' imprisonment, and the Wisconsin statute\r\nprovides the same twenty-five year maximum as section 56-5-1210 of the South\r\nCarolina Code. See Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 60-697, 60-698 (Supp. 2011), 28-105\r\n(2008); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§ 346.67 (West 1998), 346.74 (West Supp. 2012),\r\n939.50 (West 2003). These varying sentencing schemes are indicative of different\r\nlegislative determinations and policy choices, but certainly not disproportionality.\r\n\n        The Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of a national penological\r\ntheory. Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 999. Different governments will inevitably attach\r\ndiffering weights to the traditional penological goals of retribution, deterrence,\r\nincapacitation, and rehabilitation. See id. (citing Mistretta v. United States, 488\r\nU.S. 361, 363–66 (1989); Williams v. N.Y., 337 U.S. 241, 248 (1949)). Diverse\r\nattitudes and perceptions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational,\r\nconclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison terms for particular crimes.\r\nId. (citing Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274 (1980)). The simple fact that a\r\nstate may have the most severe punishment for a particular crime does not by itself\r\nrender the punishment grossly disproportionate. Id. We find Justice Scalia's\r\nobservation in Harmelin instructive:\r\n\r\n      That a State is entitled to treat with stern disapproval an act that other\r\n      States punish with the mildest of sanctions follows a fortiori from the\r\n      undoubted fact that a State may criminalize an act that other States do\r\n      not criminalize at all. Indeed, a State may criminalize an act that\r\n      other States choose to reward—punishing, for example, the killing of\r\n      endangered wild animals for which other States are offering a bounty.\r\n      What greater disproportion could there be than that? \"Absent a\r\n      constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of\r\n      federalism, some State will always bear the distinction of treating\r\n      particular offenders more severely than any other State.\" Diversity\r\n      not only in policy, but in the means of implementing policy, is the\r\n      very raison d'être of our federal system.\r\n\r\nId. at 989–90 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). In preserving the narrow\r\nproportionality principle in Harmelin, the Supreme Court adhered to the notion\r\nexpressed in previous cases that severity alone does not render a sentence grossly\r\ndisproportionate:\r\n\r\n      By contrast, Rummel and Davis, decisions in which the Court upheld\r\n      sentences against proportionality attacks, did not credit such\r\n      comparative analyses. In rejecting this form of argument, Rummel\r\n      noted that \"even were we to assume that the statute employed against\r\n      Rummel was the most stringent found in the 50 states, that severity\r\n      hardly would render Rummel's punishment \"grossly disproportionate\"\r\n      to his offenses. Id. at 1005 (holding that intra-jurisdictional and inter-\r\n      jurisdictional analyses are appropriate only in the rare cases in which\r\n\n       a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence\r\n       imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality).\r\n       Appellant fails to demonstrate that section 56-5-1210's penalty provision is\r\nthe harshest in the United States. But, even if he could, that fact alone would not\r\nrender his punishment grossly disproportionate. Thus, an interjurisdictional\r\nanalysis does not demonstrate that section 56-5-1210 provides a penalty that is\r\nsignificantly harsher than other states, or that is unsupported by reasonable and\r\nrationally related policy objectives.\r\n\r\n       Appellant requests this Court to draw new and impermissible lines, (1)\r\ninstructing the General Assembly how and when to allow trial court discretion in\r\nsentencing and (2) directing the General Assembly adopt a sentencing structure in\r\nuniformity and harmony with an undefined number of states. This runs counter to\r\nthe well-accepted principle that, in analyzing proportionality, reviewing courts\r\nmust grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily\r\npossess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes. See Solem,\r\n463 U.S. at 290.                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      When the proportionality principle jurisprudence is applied to section 56-5­\r\n1210 it is not evident that its repugnance to the constitution is clear beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. See Westvaco Corp. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 321 S.C. 59, 62,\r\n467 S.E.2d 739, 741 (1995). Thus, we affirm the trial court's conclusion that\r\nsection 56-5-1210 of the South Carolina Code is constitutional.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, AND HEARN, JJ., concur.
