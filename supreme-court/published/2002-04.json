Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, and Assistant\r\nAttorney General W. Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by finding petitioner had\r\nreceived ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioner was convicted of one count of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor (CSC) and one count of a lewd act on a minor. He \r\n  was sentenced to respective imprisonment terms of fifteen years and five years, \r\n  to be served concurrently. On direct appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed his \r\n  convictions. State v. Legge, Op. No. 95-UP-225 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July \r\n  25, 1995). We denied a petition for a writ of certiorari from that decision.\r\n\r\nPetitioner then filed an application for post-conviction \r\n  relief. After a hearing, the PCR court found appellate counsel ineffective for \r\n  failing to raise an issue on appeal. The PCR court granted petitioner a review \r\n  of the issue pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 \r\n  (1974). (1) Petitioner's remaining allegations \r\n  were denied.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise an issue on appeal regarding testimony of petitioner's lack of remorse? (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nFor petitioner to be granted PCR as a result of \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show both: (1) that his counsel failed \r\n  to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms, \r\n  and (2) that he was prejudiced by his counsel's ineffective assistance. Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Brown \r\n  v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000).\r\n\r\nAppellate counsel was not ineffective for failing \r\n  to raise the lack of remorse issue. Had appellate counsel raised the issue, \r\n  it would not have been preserved for the appellate court's review. See \r\n  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209, cert. denied, \r\n  525 U.S. 1022, 119 S.Ct. 552, 142 L.Ed.2d 459 (1998) (issue must be raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by trial court to be preserved for review); State v. Dickman, \r\n  341 S.C. 293, 534 S.E.2d 268 (2000) (party may not argue one ground at trial \r\n  and an alternate ground on appeal).\r\n\r\nAt trial, trial counsel objected to Detective McPherson's \r\n  testimony on the ground that he was not competent to give testimony on petitioner's \r\n  demeanor and on  Miranda \r\n  (3) grounds. (4) However, at the PCR \r\n  hearing, petitioner stated he wanted appellate counsel to argue on appeal that \r\n  the testimony should have been objected to because the testimony was an attempt \r\n  to show petitioner lacked remorse. Because the issue would not have been preserved \r\n  for appeal, appellate counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to raise the \r\n  issue.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the PCR court's grant of \r\n  relief. (5)\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n1. We note the PCR court's grant \r\n  of the issue pursuant to White v. State is in error because petitioner \r\n  in fact had an appeal and, as such was not denied his right to an appeal. White \r\n  v. State is inapplicable because it provides the right to a belated \r\n  appeal when the applicant did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right \r\n  to an appeal. The State, however, did not raise this issue. \r\n2. The testimony of which petitioner \r\n  complains follows:\r\n \r\n  Detective Ken McPherson: I advised [petitioner] \r\n    that [the child] had told me that he had been sexually assaulted and that \r\n    he had named him . . . as the perpetrator.\r\n  Solicitor: . . . what reaction, if any, did you \r\n    observe from [petitioner]?\r\n  McPherson: He said that he didn't do it but he \r\n    would hope that we would find out who did.\r\n  Solicitor: And what concerns, if any did [petitioner] \r\n    register regarding the child's sexual abuse?\r\n  McPherson: He showed no concern towards his \r\n    child.  \r\n\r\n3. Miranda v. Arizona, \r\n  384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). \r\n4. Defense counsel's Miranda \r\n  objection was based on the allegation that the testimony was a comment on petitioner's \r\n  right to silence and that the testimony was meant to infer an admission of guilt. \r\n5. In any event, petitioner's \r\n  claim that the elicitation of the \"lack of concern\" testimony allowed the State \r\n  to introduce evidence that suggested he lacked remorse in violation of State \r\n  v. Reid, 324 S.C. 74, 476 S.E.2d 695 (1996), is without merit. In the instant \r\n  case, Detective McPherson's comment that petitioner \"showed no concern towards \r\n  his child\" does not rise to the level of being a comment on petitioner's lack \r\n  of remorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25435","title":"Quality Trailer Products v.

Chaplin Spencer, Jr., of Spencer &amp; Spencer, P.A., of Rock Hill, for respondent.\r\n      James B. Richardson, Jr., of Richardson &amp; Birdsong, of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae, Pro se.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Appellant I Corp. appeals the trial court's denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\") and its motion for new trial\r\nfollowing a jury verdict for Respondent Quality Trailer Products, Inc. (\"QTP\").  We dismiss the appeal as untimely.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nQTP brought suit against CSL Equipment Company, Inc. (\"CSL\") and I Corp.  QTP asserted causes of action against I Corp. for breach of the South Carolina\r\nBulk Transfers Act (\"The Act\"), (1) promissory estoppel, and successor liability.  The trial court granted I Corp.'s motion for directed verdict on QTP's claim\r\narising under the Act, and submitted the other two theories to the jury.  In its general verdict, the jury found I Corp. liable to QTP.  In addition, the trial court\r\nawarded QTP prejudgment interest.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the jury verdict, I Corp. made timely post trial motions for JNOV, and for a new trial (collectively, \"first motion\").  By order dated December 20, 1999,\r\nand filed December 21, 1999, the trial court denied the first motion.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1999, I Corp. filed a motion captioned as a motion to \"Alter, Amend or Reconsider Judgment and Findings Denying Defendant's Motion for\r\nJudgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Motion for New Trial\" (\"second motion\").  The caption of the second motion indicated it was made pursuant to\r\n\"S.C.R.Civ.P. 52, 59, and 60.\"   In fact, the second motion was almost a duplicate of the first motion.  The only changes I Corp. made were to caption the second\r\nmotion differently, and to change the relief sought to coincide with the second motion's caption.  The trial court recognized that the second motion was, in\r\nsubstance, identical to the first motion, and by order dated February 16, 2000, and filed February 21, 2000, denied the second motion.  I Corp. filed its notice of\r\nappeal on March 17, 2000.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid I Corp.'s second motion toll the time period for filing an appeal?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nRule 203(b)(1), SCACR, provides that a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas \r\n\r\n\r\nshall be served on all respondents within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.  When a timely motion for judgment\r\nn.o.v. (Rule 50, SCRCP), motion to alter or amend the judgment (Rules 52 and 59, SCRCP), or a motion for a new trial (Rule 59, SCRCP) has been made, the\r\ntime for appeal for all parties shall be stayed and shall run from receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying such motion. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn Coward Hund Const. Co., Inc. v. Ball Corp., \r\n  336 S.C. 1, 518 S.E.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1999), the Court of Appeals held that a \r\n  successive Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, following the denial of a similar motion, \r\n  did not toll the time for filing appeal, where the court's ruling on the first \r\n  such motion did not change its ruling at trial. The Court of Appeals noted that \r\n  Coward Hund did not challenge any new ruling in its second Rule 59 motion. The \r\n  Court of Appeals agreed with the prevailing federal rule that \"a second motion \r\n  for reconsideration is appropriate only if it challenges something that was \r\n  altered from the original judgment as a result of the initial motion for reconsideration.\" \r\n  Coward Hund Const. Co., Inc., at 3, 518 S.E.2d at 58.\r\n\r\nHere, the question is whether the filing of a successive motion, raising issues already raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge, stays the time to appeal.  We hold\r\nthat it does not.\r\n\r\nAlthough the caption identifies Rule 52, SCRCP, as one basis for the motion, that rule simply does not apply here.  Rule 52, SCRCP, provides that:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon .\r\n. . .  Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under Rules 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided in Rule 41(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Rule 41(b), SCRCP, does not apply to this case. (2)  Since this was an action tried by a jury, Rule 52, SCRCP, does not apply.\r\n\r\nDespite its caption, I Corp.'s second motion was not a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.  The motion did not ask the trial court to rule on an issue presented but not\r\nruled upon in any previous motion.  In its order denying the second motion, the trial court remarked that \"the [second] Motion is an exact compilation of the prior\r\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and motion for new trial with a few procedural alterations.  In sum, the Motion seeks the reversal of the Order,\r\nbut provides no additional assertion of fact or argument of law.\"  We agree with the trial court's interpretation of the second motion.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its caption, the second motion did not ask for relief available pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP.  Rule 60 allows a motion for relief from the judgment\r\nbased on a number of  specific grounds, including clerical mistake, other mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and fraud.  The\r\nsecond motion raised none of these grounds.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the rationale of Coward Hund \r\n  and hold that successive new trial motions or motions for JNOV \r\n  do not toll the time for serving notice of appeal. The time for filing appeal \r\n  is not extended by submitting the same motion under a different caption. \r\n  (3) See Mickle v. Blackmon, 255 S.C. 136, 140, 177 S.E.2d \r\n  548, 549 (1970) (treating motion based on its \"substance and effect\" rather \r\n  than how it is captioned by movant). See  also Sears v. Sears, \r\n  422 N.E.2d 610 (Ill. 1981) (a successive motion that was little more than a \r\n  slightly lengthened redraft of the first motion was improper and did not extend \r\n  the time for filing appeal); Boughton v. McAllister, 576 N.W.2d 94 (Iowa \r\n  1998) (a party should not be allowed to extend the time for appeal indefinitely \r\n  by filing successive motions that address the same issue). \r\n\r\nI Corp. argues on appeal that the second motion was required to preserve issues raised, but not ruled upon, in the trial court's order denying JNOV and new trial. \r\nThe second motion did not, however, identify a single issue raised but not ruled upon - it merely recites, verbatim, the arguments made in the earlier motions.  The\r\ntrial court's denial of the JNOV and new trial motions was a ruling on all issues raised, and preserved for appellate review all issues raised therein.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find that I Corp.'s second motion literally \r\n  recites the arguments previously raised and previously ruled upon by the trial \r\n  court in I Corp.'s first motion. The second motion was not, despite its caption, \r\n  an appropriate Rule 59(e) motion. It was simply a successive motion for JNOV \r\n  and new trial, and thus did not toll the time for serving the notice of appeal. \r\n  I Corp. did not serve its notice of intent to appeal within the time prescribed \r\n  in Rule 203, SCACR. We therefore dismiss the appeal as untimely. See \r\n  Mears v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 337 S.E.2d 206 (1985) (timely service of \r\n  the notice of intent to appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and this Court \r\n  has no authority to extend or expand the \r\n  time in which the notice of intent to appeal must be served). \r\n\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n1. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n36-6-101 through 111 (1976).  The legislature repealed the Act in toto effective July 1, 2001.\r\n2. Rule 41(b), SCRCP, applies to cases tried without a jury.  The rule requires the judge, as trier of fact, to make specific findings as provided in Rule 52(a),\r\nSCRCP, where the judge renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff. \r\n3. We do not intend to suggest \r\n  that I Corp.'s initial JNOV and new trial motions were not proper or did not \r\n  toll the time for serving the notice of appeal. Clearly they did. See \r\n  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR. However, the issue is whether the time for serving notice \r\n  of appeal is tolled by subsequently filing the same motion under a different \r\n  caption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25436","title":"State v.

Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  White was convicted of first-degree burglary and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole pursuant S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45\r\n(Supp.2000).  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite was charged with the August 21, 1999, burglary of a motel room at the Comfort Inn on Main Street in Columbia.  Immediately prior to the burglary, at\r\napproximately 10:30pm, White approached Deborah Sims, her boyfriend Jeffrey Walker, and Sims' son Richard, at the motel swimming pool.  Sims and her son\r\nwere staying at the motel while work was done on their home.  Sims' boyfriend gave White a cigarette and a couple of dollars, and White left.  Shortly thereafter,\r\nWhite was seen by the motel security guard going from room to room attempting to enter with a keycard.  Upon reaching room 203, which was registered to Sims,\r\nthe door opened and White entered.  White heard the security guard calling for help on her radio and fled from the room; he was apprehended by the guard in the\r\nlobby.  Sims advised the security guard that her son's room key, which had been hidden under a towel near the pool, was missing.  The jury convicted White of\r\nfirst-degree burglary.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Does application of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A) to White violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment? (1)\r\n\r\n2.  Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury on second and third-degree burglary?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state sought imposition of a sentence of life without parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A)(the Two-Strikes law) (2) based upon White's current\r\nconviction for first-degree burglary, a most serious offense, and the fact that he had two prior armed robbery convictions, which were also most serious offenses. (3) \r\nWhite contends imposition of life imprisonment without parole, under the facts of this case, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  His primary assertion is\r\nthat because he had spoken with the victims at the pool prior to stealing their room key, the only evidence is that he was attempting to enter a room which, at the\r\ntime, was not being used as a dwelling.  We disagree. \r\n\r\n  Temporary absence from a \"dwelling\" is irrelevant \r\n  to the charge of first-degree burglary. See&nbsp;State v. Ferebee, \r\n  273 S.C. 403, 257 S.E.2d 154 (1979)(temporary absence of occupants does not \r\n  prevent residence from being subject of a burglary; if occupants leave with \r\n  intent to return, breaking and entering during their absence constitutes burglary). \r\n  See also&nbsp;Gillum v. State 468 So.2d 856 (Miss. 1985)(temporary \r\n  absence from home does not destroy character of home as a \"dwelling\" subject \r\n  to burglary if dweller leaves with intent to return); People v. Fleetwood, \r\n  217 Cal. Rptr. 612 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 1985)( \"dwelling\" status \r\n  unaffected by temporary absence of occupant). \r\n\r\nFurther, Sims' boyfriend testified that Sims' son Richard had gone up to the room one time, and that both his children and Richard had been \"in and out\" of the\r\nroom all day.  Accordingly, regardless of the presence of the occupants in the room at the time of the crime, it remained a \"dwelling\" within the meaning of the\r\nburglary statute.   \r\n\r\nMoreover, application of the Two-Strikes law to \r\n  White does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Recently, in State \r\n  v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 543 S.E.2d 541 (2001), we rejected the defendant's \r\n  claim that imposition of life without parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 \r\n  constituted cruel and unusual punishment. There, we held the most serious nature \r\n  of armed robbery, when combined with the defendant's prior most serious offense \r\n  of assault and battery with intent to kill, was not disproportionate to a sentence \r\n  of life without parole; the sentence was proportionate to that of other criminals \r\n  in this state with a second most serious offense conviction; and life sentences \r\n  for armed robbery were imposed under recidivist laws in other states. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe sentencing here likewise withstands a cruel \r\n  and unusual punishment challenge. White has two prior convictions for the most \r\n  serious offense of armed robbery. Further, notwithstanding the motel room White \r\n  entered was unoccupied, the crime he committed is first-degree burglary, a most \r\n  serious offense. Given that a life sentence is possible for even first offense \r\n  first-degree burglary convictions, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(B), \r\n  a life sentence without parole for a recidivist with one or more previous convictions \r\n  of most serious offenses does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. As \r\n  in Jones, White's life sentence is proportionate to any other criminal \r\n  who has a second most serious conviction, and life sentences for first-degree \r\n  burglary under recidivist laws have withstood such a challenge before.  Cf.&nbsp;Tombrello \r\n  v. State, 421 So.2d 1319 (Ala.Crim.App.1982)(holding life imprisonment is \r\n  not cruel and unusual punishment for a first degree burglary conviction after \r\n  previous convictions). \r\n\r\nWe note that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  recently held application of the California Three-Strikes law, imposing 25-year-to-life \r\n  sentences for petty theft, constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the \r\n  Eighth Amendment. Brown v. Mayle, 2002 WL 187415 (9th Cir.) (Feb. 7, \r\n  2002). The Brown court relied upon its recent opinion in Andrade v. \r\n  California, 270 F.3d 743 (9th Cir. 2001), in which it held that \r\n  a 50-year-to-life sentence for two petty theft convictions violated the Eighth \r\n  Amendment. However, both Andrade and Brown were based upon the \r\n  fact that the core conduct for which the defendants had received their \"third \r\n  strike\" were not traditionally punishable as felonies, but were generally misdemeanor \r\n  first offenses with minimum jail sentences. (4) \r\n  Unlike those cases, White is charged with the violent felony offense of first-degree \r\n  burglary, punishable in-and-of itself by up to life imprisonment. Accordingly, \r\n  Brown and Andrade are inapposite. We hold the sentence here withstands \r\n  a cruel and unusual punishment challenge. Jones, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  CHARGE ON LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSES\r\nWhite next asserts the trial court erred in refusing to charge on the lesser-included offenses of second- and third-degree burglary.  Essentially, he claims that since\r\nthe hotel was a \"building\" the jury could have found he committed second or third-degree, rather than first-degree burglary.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B)(Supp. 2001), a person is guilty of second-degree burglary if he \"enters a building without consent and with intent to\r\ncommit a crime therein, and . . . [t]he entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\" (5)  White asserts that since a \"dwelling\" is also a \"building,\" he was entitled\r\nto a second-degree burglary charge.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe specifically rejected this contention in State \r\n  v. Goldenbaum, 294 S.C. 455, 365 S.E.2d 731 (1988)(where victim's apartment \r\n  was a \"dwelling,\" there was no evidence from which the jury could have inferred \r\n  defendant was guilty of second- or third-degree burglary). See&nbsp;also \r\n  State v. Bernsten, 295 S.C. 52, 367 S.E.2d 152 (1988)(lesser degrees \r\n  of burglary need not be submitted to the jury \r\n  when there is uncontroverted evidence that the structure entered was a dwelling).\r\n\r\nFinally, we find the trial court properly held \r\n  the motel room in question was being used as a dwelling under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§Â§ 16-11-10 and 16-11-310 (dwelling is defined to include any building in which \r\n  there sleeps a tenant or person who lodges there with a view to the protection \r\n  of property; for purposes of burglary statute, dwelling also means living quarters \r\n  of a building used or normally used for sleeping, living, or lodging by a person). \r\n  Accord State v. Hobgood, 434 S.E.2d 881 (N.C. 1993)(motel room \r\n  \"regularly and usually occupied by travelers for the purpose of sleeping\" is \r\n  considered a sleeping apartment). See also State v. Hussain, 942 \r\n  P.2d 1168 (Ariz. App. 1997)(motel room qualifies as a \"residential structure\" \r\n  within burglary statute); People v. Fleetwood, 217 Cal. Rptr. 612 (Cal. \r\n  App. 4th Dist. 1985)(historically and traditionally, hotel rooms \r\n  have been included within the definition of dwelling house); Commonwealth \r\n  v. Correia, 457 N.E.2d 648 (Mass. 1983)( motel constituted a \"dwelling house\" \r\n  within purview of statute prohibiting breaking and entering a dwelling house \r\n  in the nighttime). See also 3 Wharton's Criminal Law Â§ 335, at \r\n  208 (1980) (\"rooms of an inn, hotel, or lodging house\" regarded as dwelling \r\n  house). Further, as noted above, the fact that the \"dwelling\" was temporarily \r\n  unoccupied is irrelevant in light of the fact that the occupant intended to \r\n  return. State v. Ferebee, supra. See&nbsp;also&nbsp;State \r\n  v. Steadman, 257 S.C. 528, 186 S.E.2d 712 (1972)(upholding jury charge to \r\n  the effect that it is not necessary entire building be devoted to dwelling purposes, \r\n  nor that the dwelling area entered be constantly inhabited). \r\n\r\nHere, given that the motel room was a \"dwelling\" \r\n  as a matter of law, the trial court did not err in refusing the request to charge \r\n  second-degree burglary. State v. Goldenbaum, supra; State v. \r\n  Bernsten, supra. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n1.   S.C. CONST. Article I, Â§ 15; U.S. CONST. Amend VIII.   \r\n2.   That section provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, except in cases in which the death penalty is imposed, upon a conviction for a most serious offense as defined by this\r\nsection, a person must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole if that person has one or more prior convictions for:\r\n\r\n  \r\n(1) a most serious offense. . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n3.   White also had numerous other convictions which were not relied upon to enhance sentencing.\r\n4.  Unlike the recidivist statute \r\n  in question in Brown and Andrade, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 would \r\n  not impose a life sentence for the offenses of the defendants in those cases \r\n  as they were neither most serious nor serious offenses. \r\n5.   Under Â§ 16-11-312 (A), a person may also be found guilty of second-degree burglary if he or she enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a\r\ncrime therein.  However, where the dwelling is entered in the nighttime, the crime is first-degree burglary under Â§ 16-11-311.  It is undisputed the entering in this\r\ncase occurred in the nighttime.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25437","title":"Harris v.

We \r\n  now dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted by the State Grand Jury \r\n  for conspiracy to traffick 400 grams or more of cocaine under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 2000). He admitted he participated in a Miami-based \r\n  drug trafficking ring and was involved in transporting many kilos of cocaine \r\n  between 1990 and 1996. In exchange for his cooperation with law enforcement, \r\n  he was offered a plea agreement which he accepted. Under the agreement, petitioner \r\n  pled guilty to conspiracy to traffick ten to twenty-eight grams of cocaine, \r\n  first offense, in violation of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a). He was sentenced to ten \r\n  years and classified as a violent offender. In his PCR action, petitioner contested \r\n  his classification as a violent offender. The application for relief was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUE   \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is a conviction for conspiracy to traffick under \r\n    Â§ 44-53-370(e) properly classified as a violent offense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 2000), certain \r\n  offenses are defined as \"violent crimes.\" (1) \r\n  This section specifically includes \"drug trafficking as defined in Â§ 44-53-370(e)\" \r\n  as a violent crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Section 44-53-370(e)(2), under which petitioner \r\n    pled guilty, provides:\r\n\r\n  (e) Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, \r\n    cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides \r\n    financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires \r\n    to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State, \r\n    or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly \r\n    attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of. . . .\r\n\r\n  (2) ten grams or more of cocaine or any mixtures \r\n    containing cocaine, as provided in Section 44-53-210(b)(4), is guilty of \r\n    a felony which is known as \"trafficking in cocaine\" and, upon conviction, \r\n    must be punished as follows if the quantity involved is [specifying certain \r\n    amounts relevant to sentencing].\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). As defined in this section, there \r\n  is no distinction between conspiracy to traffick and the substantive offense \r\n  of trafficking. Further, \r\n\r\nÂ§ 44-53-370(e) provides that a person convicted \r\n  of conspiracy under this section must be sentenced with a full sentence and \r\n  not one-half of the sentence as otherwise provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 \r\n  (Supp. 2000) for conspiracy drug charges. (2) \r\n  The legislature clearly intended that conspiracy to traffick be treated as trafficking \r\n  under Â§ 44-53-370(e).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a conviction under Â§ 44-53-370(e), \r\n  whether for trafficking or conspiracy to traffick, is properly classified as \r\n  a violent crime under Â§ 16-1-60. Accordingly, petitioner is not entitled to \r\n  reclassification.\r\n\r\nDISMISSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This classification affects a defendant's parole status. \r\nSee, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-21-610 (Supp. 2000) (must serve at least \r\none-third of sentence for violent crime) and -645 (parole review every \r\ntwo years).

Walker, Jr., of Conway, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  \r\n  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits \r\n  misconduct and consents to a definite suspension of not less than thirty days \r\n  nor more than nine months. We accept the agreement and suspend respondent for \r\n  nine months from the date of this opinion.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nI. Social Security Administration Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent agreed to represent client in a workers' \r\n  compensation matter on July 15, 1997. Respondent and client executed a fee agreement \r\n  pertaining to the representation on the workers' compensation claim. Client \r\n  proceeded to file a pro se claim with the Social Security Administration (SSA) \r\n  for disability insurance benefits. On March 25, 1998, client received notice \r\n  his SSA claim was denied. He asked respondent to represent him in contesting \r\n  the denial by SSA. No separate fee agreement was executed.\r\n\r\nRespondent filed a request for reconsideration \r\n  of client's claim. Respondent also filed a form to appoint respondent as client's \r\n  representative. The form stated that respondent would not charge client a fee \r\n  unless it was approved by SSA, and that he would notify SSA if he chose not \r\n  to collect a fee.\r\n\r\nOn September 21, 1998, respondent settled client's \r\n  workers' compensation claim for $42,000 and was paid $10,500 as his fee. In \r\n  December 1998, client received notice that SSA was granting his claim, but reducing \r\n  the amount because of the workers' compensation award. On January 18, 1999, \r\n  respondent filed another Request for Reconsideration to adjust the monthly payment. \r\n  Respondent contacted SSA several times during the following months.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, 1999, respondent received notice \r\n  that SSA was requesting benefit calculations and an itemized list of attorney's \r\n  fees. On October 21, 1999, respondent sent SSA the requested benefit computations \r\n  and stated that he would forward the itemized attorney's fee bill later that \r\n  day. Respondent never sent the itemized attorney's fee bill.\r\n\r\nIn January 2000, respondent notified client that \r\n  he anticipated being suspended from the practice of law due to his failure to \r\n  file a state income tax return. As a result of the conversation, client agreed \r\n  to loan respondent $1,000. Client changed his mind when he arrived at respondent's \r\n  office. However, client again changed his mind after talking with respondent \r\n  and agreed to the loan. Respondent prepared a hand written promissory note dated \r\n  January 14, 2000. The note calls for respondent to repay the sum of $1,000 immediately \r\n  upon respondent's receipt of attorney's fees from the SSA.\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 2000, respondent received notice \r\n  that SSA raised client's monthly benefit and that $1,211 was withheld to pay \r\n  attorney's fees if needed. Respondent never submitted an invoice to SSA for \r\n  attorney's fees. In August 2000, client contacted another attorney to discuss \r\n  repayment of the $1,000 loan with respondent. Respondent indicated that because \r\n  he was suspended from the practice of law he was unable to prepare a statement \r\n  of attorney's fees. On March 14, 2001, after client had contacted Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel, respondent sent a letter to SSA waiving any attorney's fees and asking \r\n  that any funds withheld be sent to client.\r\n\r\nOn January 23, 2001, Disciplinary Counsel provided \r\n  notice of the complaint and requested a response from respondent. On February \r\n  23, 2001, after receiving no response, Disciplinary Counsel wrote respondent \r\n  a Treacy letter. (1) Respondent submitted an \r\n  untimely response on March 15, 2001.\r\n\r\nII. Construction Claim Matter\r\n\r\nClients retained respondent to represent them in \r\n  a dispute with a developer and general contractor concerning defects in the \r\n  construction of their residence. On March 12, 1990, respondent filed a summons \r\n  and complaint against the developer. On September 18, 1990, the court entered \r\n  an order of default against the developer and granted respondent's motion to \r\n  amend the pleadings to name the general contractor as an additional defendant. \r\n  The order deferred entering a judgment against the developer pending a hearing \r\n  on the merits.\r\n\r\nThereafter, respondent filed an amended complaint \r\n  naming the general contractor as a defendant. Because the case had been stricken \r\n  from the docket by agreement, it was reinstated and re-numbered. Before the \r\n  trial was completed, clients and the general contractor reached an agreement \r\n  whereby the contractor agreed to make repairs and make a cash payment to clients. \r\n  In return, clients agreed not to execute on any judgment which might subsequently \r\n  be obtained against the contractor in excess of $11,500. On May 15, 1992, an \r\n  order was signed confirming the agreement and entering a judgment against the \r\n  developer in the amount of $21,172. The order specifically stated that in the \r\n  event of a default by the contractor, clients would be entitled to petition \r\n  for judgment against the contractor, not to exceed $11,500.\r\n\r\nThe general contractor did not make the repairs \r\n  as required by the agreement. As a result, respondent filed a new suit against \r\n  the contractor asking for specific performance or, in the alternative, an award \r\n  of $11,500. When the contractor failed to file an answer, respondent filed an \r\n  affidavit and order of default. However, respondent did not subsequently apply \r\n  to the court for judgment against the general contractor or proceed with a damages \r\n  hearing. As a result, respondent failed to protect clients' interest by obtaining \r\n  and recording a judgment against the contractor.\r\n\r\nInstead, respondent filed another action entitled \r\n  \"Complaint for Examination of Defendant in Supplemental Proceedings\" under the \r\n  old docket number. He also filed an \"Affidavit to Obtain Order to Examine Defendant \r\n  in Supplemental Proceedings.\" The affidavit stated that a judgment was obtained \r\n  against the contractor in the sum of $11,500, based on the judgment dated May \r\n  15, 1992. Respondent admits he should have known that he never obtained a money \r\n  judgment against the general contractor, and that the order of May 15, entered \r\n  a judgment against the developer.\r\n\r\nRespondent did not collect any proceeds as a result \r\n  of the supplemental proceedings. Additionally, respondent dismissed the judgment \r\n  against the contractor on the separate suit stating that it had been settled. \r\n  Respondent admits he never consulted with clients prior to dismissing the action.\r\n\r\nAfter respondent's representation of clients ended, \r\n  a foreclosure action was brought against the general contractor. Clients submitted \r\n  a claim on any additional funds believing respondent had perfected a judgment \r\n  against the contractor for the $11,500 based on the May 15 judgment. The Master-In-Equity \r\n  ruled that the May 15 judgment was not a judgment against the contractor, but \r\n  solely against the developer. Therefore, the Master ruled clients did not have \r\n  a valid claim to any of the surplus funds.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2001, Disciplinary Counsel commenced \r\n  a preliminary investigation and requested respondent file a response. Respondent \r\n  failed to respond in a timely manner. On July 10, 2001, after receiving no response, \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel wrote respondent a Treacy letter. Respondent submitted \r\n  an untimely response on September 4, 2001.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a \r\n  lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer \r\n  shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, \r\n  and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are pursued); \r\n  Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about \r\n  the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; \r\n  a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit \r\n  the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); Rule 1.8 \r\n  (a lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client unless the \r\n  transaction and terms are fair and reasonable, the client is given the opportunity \r\n  to seek advice of independent counsel, and the client consents in writing); \r\n  Rule 8.1 (failing to respond to a lawful demand for information regarding a \r\n  disciplinary matter); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 8.4(d)(engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3)(failing to respond \r\n  to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in \r\n  conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts \r\n  or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon \r\n  admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that his actions \r\n  were in violation of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement and the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct. We therefore suspend respondent from the practice of \r\n  law for nine months. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent \r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied \r\n  with Rule 30, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n1.

Drayton, pro se, of Ridgeland.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\nRule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any  sanction deemed appropriate by this\r\nCourt.  We accept the Agreement and impose a definite suspension of ninety days from the practice of law.  The facts as admitted in the Agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nIn 1993, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of\r\nlaw because of his failure to complete the Continuing Legal Education requirements for the year 1992.  However, respondent did not surrender his certificate to\r\npractice law, as required by the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  Respondent remained suspended from the practice of law until 1999, when this Court\r\ngranted his petition for reinstatement. \r\n\r\nIn December 1997, during the course of his suspension, respondent assisted a non-custodial parent at a child support conference.  In connection with this\r\nconference, respondent negotiated with a representative from the South Carolina Department of Social Services and signed an order on behalf of the non-custodial\r\nparent.  Also in December 1997, respondent assisted a friend at a Rule to Show Cause hearing in family court and assisted in establishing a repayment plan.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute\r\nthe administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); Rule 7(a)(6)\r\n(violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state); and Rule 30(f) (a lawyer who has been suspended from the practice of law shall,\r\nwithin fifteen days after the suspension, surrender his or her certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of the Supreme Court).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that his actions in the aforementioned matters were in violation of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  We\r\ntherefore suspend respondent from the practice of law for ninety days.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\nClerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25440","title":"In the Matter of J.

Stephen McCormack, pro se, \r\n          of Ridgeland.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\nRule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE,\r\nRule 413, SCACR.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent, retroactive to the date respondent was placed on interim suspension. (1)  The facts as admitted\r\nin the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nRespondent represented client in a probate matter.  The Probate Court directed opposing counsel to remit $12,759.56 to client and/or the trust, for which client\r\nserved as trustee.  The Probate Court set forth specific directions concerning the distribution and use of these funds.   \r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Probate Court's order, opposing counsel issued a check made payable to respondent.  Respondent did not deposit the check into his escrow\r\nor trust account.  Instead, respondent deposited the check into a joint personal account held by himself and his mother.  \r\n\r\nFrom these funds, respondent paid himself a fee, as well as the  fee of another lawyer as directed by the Probate Court.  In violation of the Probate Court's order,\r\nrespondent then used the remaining funds for the benefit of himself and/or his mother.  \r\n\r\nUpon being confronted by client, respondent acknowledged that he had \"borrowed\" from the funds to pay his mother's mortgage.  Respondent has since repaid a\r\nportion of the money that he owes client; however, respondent still owes client approximately $4,946.25.  Respondent is currently unable to repay client the\r\nbalance due and has sought protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code.  \r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide\r\ncompetent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep\r\na client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall hold and\r\nsafeguard property of clients separate from the lawyer's own business or personal property; upon receiving funds in which a client has an interest, a lawyer shall\r\npromptly notify the client; a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client any funds that the client is entitled to receive); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); Rule 8.4(c)\r\n(engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). \r\n\r\nRespondent also admits that he violated the financial record keeping requirements found in Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.  Respondent shall not be entitled to seek\r\nreinstatement or readmission to the practice of law until he has fully repaid all funds owed client and/or the trust, including reasonable interest, and until he has\r\nreimbursed the Lawyer's Fund for Client Protection for any and all amounts paid, including reasonable interest, in connection with this matter.  Within fifteen\r\ndays of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and\r\nshall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General Nathan Kaminski, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n        Gregory A. Newell, pro se, \r\n          of Greenville.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule\r\n21, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension of nine\r\nmonths.  We accept the agreement.  The following facts are set forth in the agreement.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nIn the first matter, the client retained respondent in 1991 to handle a lawsuit against a realtor and warranty company.  Respondent failed to file the lawsuit within\r\nthe statute of limitations, failed to inform the client that the statute of limitations had run, and continued to assure the client that he was working on the case. \r\nRespondent ignored the client's repeated requests for information regarding the status of the case and requests to view the case file.\r\n\r\nIn the second matter, the client retained respondent to file an action for divorce and to gain custody of her minor child.  Respondent's failure to properly serve the\r\nhusband resulted in the dismissal of the divorce action.  Respondent re-filed the action, but failed to inform the client that the first suit had been dismissed.  \r\n\r\nIn a third matter, respondent was retained to represent the client in a personal injury case.  Respondent did not file the lawsuit until six days before the expiration\r\nof the statute of limitations, despite the client's belief that suit had been filed almost two years earlier.  As a result of respondent's delay in filing the lawsuit, the\r\nclient's case was called for trial five years after she retained respondent.  On the day the case was called for trial, respondent was out of town and had failed to ask\r\nfor the court's protection.  Respondent did communicate with the court and a continuance was granted; however, respondent failed to communicate directly with\r\nthe client.  The client's case was eventually settled, at which time respondent reduced his contingency fee by $1,500.\r\n\r\nIn a fourth matter, respondent was retained to file a bankruptcy petition.  Respondent failed to file the petition because the client had not paid respondent the filing\r\nfee.  However, respondent did not inform client that her petition had not been filed or his reason for not filing the petition.\r\n\r\nIn a fifth matter, respondent was appointed in a Post-Conviction Relief (PCR) matter.  Respondent failed to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of\r\nhis case and failed to comply with reasonable requests for information.\r\n\r\nIn two of these matters, the clients paid respondent non-refundable retainers.  Respondent has made only partial refunds of the retainers.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Counsel conducted separate preliminary investigations into each of these matters and requested\r\nthat respondent file responses to each client's\r\nallegations.  Respondent filed a response in only one matter.  In all other matters, respondent ignored Counsel's requests for information.  The Commission's\r\ninvestigative panel subsequently authorized a Full Investigation.  Disciplinary Counsel served respondent with a Notice of Full Investigation advising respondent\r\nof his duty to fully respond to the allegations contained therein.  Respondent failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (failing to provide\r\ncompetent representation to a client); Rule 1.2(a) (failing to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (failing to act with\r\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) (failing to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly\r\ncomply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 2.1 (failing to exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice); Rule 8.4(a)\r\n(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e)\r\n(engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to\r\nbring the courts or legal profession into disrepute); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nRespondent fully acknowledges that his actions in the aforementioned matters were in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement.  We hereby suspend respondent from the practice of law for nine months.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent\r\nshall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, Rule 413, SCACR.  Within thirty days of the date of this opinion,\r\nrespondent shall file an affidavit with the ODC showing that he has repaid all unearned or inequitable attorney fees referred to in the Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent and shall provide reasonable documentation thereof.  Respondent shall also make available for inspection and/or copying by the ODC or its investigators\r\nhis law firm financial records to determine compliance with this provision. \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25442","title":"State v.

Walker, Op. No. 2000-UP-608 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 10,\r\n  2000).&nbsp; We find Petitioner was entitled to a directed verdict and\r\n  reverse.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  &nbsp; \r\n  FACTS\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  In September 1997, Dr. George\r\n  Stretcher (&quot;Stretcher&quot;) discovered a number of marijuana plants growing on his\r\n  property and alerted the authorities.&nbsp; Police searched the area and found\r\n  five marijuana fields, three on Stretcher's property and two on adjacent\r\n  property owned by Mary Taylor.&nbsp; William Bennett (&quot;Bennett&quot;), an\r\n  investigator with the South Carolina Forestry Commission, installed a video\r\n  surveillance camera aimed at one of the fields.&nbsp; Bennett also visually\r\n  inspected all five fields.&nbsp; He found evidence that the plants in all the\r\n  fields except one had been fertilized.&nbsp; Soil had been piled up around the\r\n  bases of the plants, and a number of plants had been thinned out; Bennett\r\n  found culled marijuana plants discarded at the edge of the fields.&nbsp;\r\n  Additionally, Bennett noticed that tree limbs and other vegetation had been\r\n  cleared out around the fields allowing more light to penetrate.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  About a month after Stretcher's discovery, Charles Yates\r\n  (&quot;Yates&quot;) was deer hunting in the area\r\n  when Petitioner approached him in the woods.&nbsp; Petitioner was carrying a\r\n  black plastic bag.&nbsp; The bag appeared to Yates to be quite heavy.&nbsp;\r\n  Petitioner said he was lost and asked Yates for directions to the dirt road\r\n  that traversed the property.&nbsp; Yates gave Petitioner directions.&nbsp;\r\n  When Yates asked Petitioner to reveal the contents of the black bag,\r\n  Petitioner ran into the woods.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Suspicious of Petitioner's\r\n  activity, Yates called the police and reported the incident.&nbsp; Police\r\n  responded to the scene and Yates helped them search for Petitioner.&nbsp; The\r\n  police eventually discontinued the search and left the area.&nbsp; Later, as\r\n  Yates was driving home, he saw Petitioner standing in the dirt road.&nbsp;\r\n  Petitioner motioned for Yates to stop, and Yates complied.&nbsp; Yates agreed\r\n  to give Petitioner a ride.&nbsp; Later that evening, Yates again contacted the\r\n  police.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Very early the next day\r\n  Bennett checked the surveillance equipment he had previously installed, and\r\n  viewed the video tape.&nbsp; The tape depicted a man resembling Petitioner,\r\n  carrying a black bag, harvesting marijuana.&nbsp; The time code on the tape\r\n  indicated this activity occurred less than an hour before Yates reported\r\n  seeing Petitioner in the woods.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Later that morning, police\r\n  officers returned to the area, and encountered Petitioner on the dirt road.&nbsp;\r\n  They placed him under arrest.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner was indicted and\r\n  tried for trafficking marijuana, manufacturing marijuana, and two counts of\r\n  cultivating marijuana on the land of another.\r\n  [1] &nbsp; Following presentation of the State's evidence Petitioner moved\r\n  for a directed verdict on all charges.&nbsp; The trial court denied the\r\n  motion.&nbsp; The jury found Petitioner guilty on three counts, acquitting him\r\n  on the count charging cultivation of marijuana on the Taylor property.&nbsp;\r\n  Petitioner appealed.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed\r\n  the trafficking conviction and affirmed the two remaining convictions.&nbsp;\r\n  We granted certiorari to consider the conviction for cultivating marijuana on\r\n  the land of another.\r\n  [2] \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  ISSUE\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Did\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in determining Petitioner was not entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict on the charge of cultivating marijuana on the land of\r\n  another?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  &nbsp; \r\n  ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  A defendant is entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.&nbsp; State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36\r\n  (2001).&nbsp; In reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge is\r\n  concerned with the existence of the evidence, not with its weight.&nbsp; State\r\n  v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).&nbsp; On\r\n  appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the State.&nbsp; State v. Burdette,\r\n  335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999).&nbsp; &quot;When a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict is made in a criminal case where the State relies exclusively\r\n  on circumstantial evidence, the trial judge is required to submit the case to\r\n  the jury if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove\r\n  the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically\r\n  deduced.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256\r\n  (2001).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  South\r\n  Carolina Code Ann. ' 16-11-617 (Supp. 2001) provides that\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  It\r\n  is unlawful for a person to enter on the land of another for the purpose of\r\n  cultivating or attempting to cultivate marijuana.&nbsp; The provisions of this\r\n  section are cumulative to other provisions of law.&nbsp; To constitute a\r\n  violation of this section, a minimum of twenty-five marijuana plants\r\n  must be cultivated. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  The code does not define\r\n  &quot;cultivating&quot; or &quot;cultivate.&quot;&nbsp; Since it is a criminal statute, we must\r\n  construe ' 16-11-617 strictly against the State and in favor of the defendant.&nbsp;\r\n  Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, __ S.C. __, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Webster\r\n  defines &quot;cultivate&quot; as \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  1.&nbsp;\r\n  to prepare and use (soil or land) for growing crops; till&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; to\r\n  break up the surface soil (around plants) in order to destroy weeds, prevent\r\n  crusting, and preserve moisture&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; to grow (plants, crops, fish,\r\n  etc.) from seeds, bulbs, shoots, etc.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; to improve or develop\r\n  (plants) by various horticultural techniques&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; to improve by\r\n  care, training, or study; refine . . .&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; to promote the\r\n  development or growth of; acquire and develop . . .&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; to seek to\r\n  develop familiarity with; give one's attention to; pursue\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Webster's New World College\r\n  Dictionary 352 (4th ed. 1999).\r\n  &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  We do not agree with the\r\n  Court of Appeals that the videotape depicts &quot;a person cultivating the\r\n  plants.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n  The videotape shows a man matching Petitioner's description in a field of\r\n  marijuana, picking, or harvesting, the plants.&nbsp; The man in the video is\r\n  not tilling or breaking up the soil; he is not planting seeds, or\r\n  transplanting young marijuana plants; he is not applying fertilizer, or\r\n  otherwise preparing or improving the soil.&nbsp; Nothing in the video depicts\r\n  the cultivation of marijuana as that word is commonly defined.&nbsp;\r\n  Bennett's testimony that the fields were cultivated does not establish\r\n  Petitioner cultivated them.&nbsp; Yates' description of his encounter with\r\n  Petitioner, while it does suggest that Petitioner is the man shown in the\r\n  video harvesting marijuana, is not evidence that Petitioner cultivated\r\n  the crop. &nbsp;In fact, apart from his presence in the area, there is no\r\n  evidence connecting Petitioner with the cultivation of the marijuana.&nbsp; See\r\n  State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480 (1987) (where evidence\r\n  merely places defendant at scene of crime, but fails to show defendant\r\n  committed the crime charged, defendant is entitled to directed verdict). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Construing the evidence in\r\n  the light most favorable to the State, we find it merely raises a suspicion of\r\n  Petitioner's guilt.&nbsp; See State v.

Clare, of the Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant Attorney General W. Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: We granted certiorari to determine whether participation in a \"community supervision program\" (Program) as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§24-13-100 (Supp. 2001) is a collateral consequence of sentencing.  We hold that it is, and therefore affirm the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge's order denying\r\npetitioner relief.\r\n\r\nPetitioner pled guilty to second degree criminal sexual conduct, a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-653 (1985).  Under Â§24-13-100, all Class A, B, and C\r\nfelonies, and all \"exempt\" offenses which are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of twenty years or more are \"no parole offenses.\"  Second degree\r\ncriminal sexual conduct is a class C felony.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-1-90(C)(Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\nAn individual, such as petitioner, convicted of a \"no parole offense\" must serve 85% of \"the actual term of imprisonment imposed,\" less any part suspended,\r\nbefore becoming eligible for early release, discharge, or participation in the Program.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§24-13-150(A)(Supp. 2001).  All persons serving \"no\r\nparole\" sentences, except those under a death sentence or a life sentence, participate in the Program following their term of incarceration.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§24-21-560(A)(Supp. 2001).  Petitioner contends his plea was involuntary because his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to inform petitioner about the Program in\r\nadvising him whether to plead guilty.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn our view, the Program serves essentially the \r\n  same function for persons convicted of \"no parole offenses\" as parole does for \r\n  other inmates. It is well settled that parole eligibility is a collateral consequence \r\n  of sentencing, and that trial counsel need not advise a client of his parole \r\n  eligibility, Griffin v. Martin, 278 S.C. 620, 300 S.E.2d 482 (1983), \r\n  or ineligibility, Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000), \r\n  in order to render effective assistance. Petitioner's trial counsel was not \r\n  required to inform petitioner that, as a collateral consequence of his sentencing, \r\n  he would participate in the Program. Since he has not demonstrated that counsel \r\n  was ineffective, petitioner has not met his burden of showing the resulting \r\n  plea was involuntary. Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. 16, 546 S.E.2d 417 (2001).\r\n\r\nThe order denying petitioner's PCR application is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n         TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25444","title":"Parker v.

Shecut, III, (\"Bo\") did not oust his \r\n  co-tenant, Petitioner Anne S. Parker (\"Anne\"), from their jointly-owned beach \r\n  house. Parker v. Shecut, 340 S.C. 460, 531 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn October 1992 Mary Shecut died, leaving her estate of approximately $1.3 million dollars to her three children, Anne, Bo, and Defendant Winfield W. Shecut\r\n(\"Win\").  Mary's will named Bo and Win executors of the estate.  On April 6, 1993, Anne, Bo, and Win executed a written agreement (\"private agreement\")\r\ndelineating how the substantial real property inherited from their mother would be divided.  Under the private agreement, Win received the bulk of the family's\r\nfarm property adjacent to his own residence, while Anne and Bo received, as tenants in common, some farmland, a beach house at Edisto Island (which is at the\r\nheart of the issue on appeal), and a number of commercial properties in Orangeburg County.  Anne and Bo agreed to manage their properties together, and each\r\ndeposited $3,000.00 in a banking account under the name Shecut Investments.  The two apparently did not execute a partnership agreement or otherwise reduce\r\ntheir management agreement to writing.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence in the record suggests problems with the property arrangement between Anne and Bo began by early 1994.  On February 15, 1994, Anne wrote\r\nBo a letter offering to sever the co-tenancy in some of their joint property, with each receiving sole ownership of a portion.  She complained that some of the\r\nproperty was not \"being utilized equally between us.\"\r\n\r\nDespite Anne's complaints, she and Bo maintained the beach house as a rental property through 1995.  Anne presented evidence that the beach house generated\r\nthe following gross rents between 1993 and 1995:\r\n\r\nYEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  GROSS RECEIPTS\r\n\r\n1993&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n$8,497.00\r\n\r\n1994&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n$18,181.00\r\n\r\n1995&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n$19,841.00\r\n\r\nAccording to Bo, however, after taxes, insurances and other expenses, the beach house generated only $229.00 in income in 1995.  Bo included this amount on his\r\nincome taxes for 1995.  He testified that he claimed no income for the years 1993 and 1994.  A real estate appraiser, called by Anne, testified that the Edisto Island\r\nbeach house was a break-even rental property.  The appraiser added that the best use for the house, that is the most profitable use, was to sell it.\r\n\r\nDuring the years the beach house was rented, Anne took one-half of its depreciation on her income tax returns.  In 1995, Anne amended the agreement with Edisto\r\nRealty, the real estate company managing the beach house property, and had all rental checks mailed directly to her home in Atlanta. (1) Upon receipt of the rental\r\nchecks, Anne endorsed them over to the attorney for the mother's estate.  According to Bo, during the year Anne received rental checks, taxes and other expenses\r\non the property were not paid, and Edisto Realty had to pay some of the expenses on the beach house.  Bo also testified that he retrieved a check for about\r\n$4,000.00 from Edisto Realty in June 1995 and kept the check. \r\n\r\nIn January 1996 Bo, without consulting Anne, made the beach house his primary residence, and ceased renting the house.  Anne testified that Bo told her in March\r\n1996 that she was not welcome to use the beach house.  He also told her he changed the locks.  Prior to this time, Anne had access to the beach house when it was\r\nnot being rented.\r\n\r\nBo denied that he ever told Anne she was not welcome at the beach house.  He testified she was always welcome as long as \"she would behave.\"   Anne testified\r\nthat she visited the beach house as late as March 1997, and that she entered the house.  She added that while there, she was confronted by police.  She could not\r\nestablish that Bo called the police or was in any way responsible for the police showing up at the house.\r\n\r\nAnne visited the beach house on one occasion between May 1997 and November 1997 and discovered her keys no longer worked.  As of the date of the second\r\nhearing, November 12, 1997, Anne no longer had a working key or access to the beach house.\r\n\r\nBo changed the locks after the house was vandalized on June 13, 1997.  He admitted that after that date Anne no longer had a working key.  Based on a\r\nconversation he had with Win, Bo suspected Anne committed the vandalism.  Win testified that he had a telephone conversation with Anne wherein she admitted\r\nshe vandalized the beach house.  Anne denied vandalizing the house and maintained that she had not been at the house on or about June 13, 1997.\r\n\r\nFollowing the November 12, 1997, hearing, the master \r\n  ordered the property granted Anne and Bo in the private agreement divided in-kind, \r\n  with the exception of the beach house, which he ordered sold at public auction. \r\n  The proceeds were divided so as to equalize the in-kind distribution. \r\n  (2) The master found Bo had not committed ouster and awarded Anne \r\n  no rent for the time Bo was in exclusive possession of the house. The Court \r\n  of Appeals affirmed, finding that \"Anne offer[ed] no evidence of either ouster \r\n  or exclusion. Accordingly, Bo does not owe Anne anything for his use of the \r\n  beach house . . . .\" Parker v. Shecut, supra, at 496, 531 S.E.2d \r\n  at 566.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in determining Anne had failed to show ouster by Bo?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\"'Ouster' is the actual turning out or keeping \r\n  excluded a party entitled to possession of any real property.\" Freeman v. \r\n  Freeman, 323 S.C. 95, 99, 473 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1996). \"By actual \r\n  ouster is not meant a physical eviction, but a possession attended with such \r\n  circumstances as to evince a claim of exclusive right and title and a denial \r\n  of the right of the other tenants to participate in the profits.\" Woods v. \r\n  Bivens, 292 S.C. 76, 80, 354 S.E.2d 909, 912 (1987). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe acts relied upon to establish an ouster must be of an unequivocal nature, and so distinctly hostile to the rights of the other cotenants that the intention to\r\ndisseize is clear and unmistakable. . . .  Only in rare, extreme cases will the ouster by one cotenant of other cotenants be implied from exclusive possession and\r\ndealings with the property, such as collection of rents and improvement of the property. \r\n\r\n\r\nFreeman, supra, at 99, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  at 470 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nWhere one co-tenant has ousted the other co-tenant, \r\n  and kept them out by force, he is liable as a trespasser for the rental value \r\n  of the property beyond his ownership share. Jones v. Massey, 14 S.C. \r\n  292, 307-08 (1880). \r\n\r\nWe do not agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion \r\n  that Anne produced no evidence of ouster or exclusion. In our view, the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence demonstrates ouster. Bo's own testimony establishes that on \r\n  or about June 13, 1997, he changed the locks to the beach house. Further, he \r\n  testified that he had not given Anne a working key, nor did he have any intention \r\n  of giving Anne a key unless the master ordered him to do so. Bo's actions in \r\n  changing the locks and refusing to provide Anne with a key are so distinctly \r\n  hostile to Anne's rights that Bo's intention to disseize is clear and unmistakable. \r\n  See Freeman, supra. Further, Bo's actions clearly evince \r\n  his claim of exclusive right and a denial of Anne's right to use the property. \r\n  See Woods, supra. Accordingly, we find that Bo ousted Anne \r\n  on June 13, 1997. (3)\r\n\r\nBecause the evidence adduced at trial shows Anne was ousted from the beach house on June 13, 1997, we REVERSE the Court of Appeals' decision on this issue\r\nand REMAND to the master for a determination of damages, if any, due Anne from the date of ouster.  \r\n\r\nWe note that neither party appealed that portion \r\n  of the master's judgment ordering that the beach house be sold. Thus, Anne's \r\n  appeal did not stay the sale of the house, and it appears the sale should have \r\n  proceeded. See Rule 205, SCACR (\"Upon the service of the notice of appeal, the \r\n  appellate court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal . . . . Nothing \r\n  in these Rules shall prohibit the lower court . . . from proceeding with matters \r\n  not affected by the appeal.\"). Even had Anne or Bo appealed the sale, judgments \r\n  directing the sale of real property are not automatically stayed on appeal. \r\n  See Rule 225, SCACR; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-9-170 (1985). However, according to \r\n  representations made by both parties at oral argument, the beach house has yet \r\n  to be sold. On remand, the master is to proceed forthwith with the sale of the \r\n  beach house pursuant to his unappealed order.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Prior to this time rental checks had been mailed to Bo, payable to Shecut Investments.\r\n2. Specifically, the order practically awarded Bo $58,100 more of the proceeds of the beach house sale than Anne, not including attorney's fees.   \r\n3. We disagree with the holding implicit in the master's order that because Bo believed Anne vandalized the beach house, he was justified in excluding her from\r\nthe property.  A co-tenant's suspicion that another co-tenant has vandalized jointly-owned property does not permit the suspicious co-tenant to take the law into\r\nhis own hands and forcibly exclude his co-tenant.  If Bo believed his co-tenant Anne wasted the property, he should have sought to enjoin her from doing so,\r\nrather than resorting to self-help.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25451","title":"Condon v.

Thereafter, a request to\r\nintervene by certain Senators and Representatives of the General Assembly was granted.  An amicus curiae brief on behalf\r\nof the Officers of the House Democratic Caucus was permitted to be filed.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly passed Act 66, R.147, H.3687, the 2001 General Appropriations Act (Appropriations Act), on June\r\n21, 2001.  The General Assembly provided for base-line reductions to the recurring budgets of the State's colleges and\r\nuniversities.  In Part 1B, Proviso 72.109 of the Appropriations Act, the General Assembly ordered the State Treasurer to\r\ntransfer $38,500,000 from the Extended Care Maintenance Fund (Barnwell Fund), (1) in varying amounts, to the colleges and\r\nuniversities.  The General Assembly's appropriation from the Barnwell Fund reduced the impact of the base-line reductions\r\non the various colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2001, the Governor delivered his veto message regarding the Appropriations Act.  This message contained\r\nvetoes of the specific base-line reductions to the recurring budgets of each of the state colleges and universities. (2)  The\r\nbudgets of the colleges and universities were thus returned to their prior year funding level.  The effect of the vetoes was to\r\ncreate new expenditures in the approximate amount of $88,000,000.  Despite the reduction in spending through other\r\nvetoes, the expenditures established by the Governor's vetoes of the base-line reductions to the schools' recurring budgets\r\nleft the state budget approximately $23,000,000 out of balance.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this imbalance, the Governor included a statement in his veto message indicating that certain colleges and\r\nuniversities had agreed to return a total of $28,500,000 in funds appropriated pursuant to Proviso 72.109 of the\r\nAppropriations Act. (3)  The statement reads:\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I have vetoed the base budget reductions to higher education, the supplemental appropriations contained in Proviso\r\n72.109 are not necessary to reduce the cuts.  These appropriations, however, must be reduced in order to balance the state\r\nbudget.  I have not vetoed these items because the colleges and universities have agreed to return these amounts to the\r\ngeneral fund to accomplish this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nProviso 72.109 was not vetoed by the Governor for the above stated reason. (4)\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 2001, the South Carolina House of Representatives sustained the Governor's vetoes to the base-line reductions\r\nto the budgets of the colleges and universities.  The provisions of the Appropriations Act became law, including Proviso\r\n72.109.  Pursuant to Proviso 72.109, money was transferred from the Barnwell Fund to the colleges and universities on July\r\n2, 2001.  However, previously on June 26th, defendants, through the Commission on Higher Education, had requested the\r\nreturn of the Barnwell funds.  Accordingly, on July 2, 2001, a transfer of $28,500,000 was made from the accounts of the\r\ncolleges and universities to the General Fund in an account in the Governor's office.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nI.

To this end, the Attorney General shall assist and\r\nrepresent the Governor, but such power shall not be construed to authorize any action or proceeding against the General\r\nAssembly or the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General argues the only restriction imposed \r\n  by Art. IV, Â§ 15, is that the Attorney General cannot bring suit against the \r\n  General Assembly and the Supreme Court. He claims had a restriction been intended \r\n  for suits against the Governor, such a restriction would have been included \r\n  in the section. He cites to Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  578 (2000), for the proposition, \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" \r\n  or \"inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,\" i.e., \"to express \r\n  or include one thing implies the exclusion of another, or of the alternative.\" \r\n  The Attorney General misconstrues the constitutional provision. There is no \r\n  reason for the provision to mention suits against the Governor because it is \r\n  concerned with the Attorney General, through his assistance and representation \r\n  of the Governor, bringing actions on the Governor's behalf, against \r\n  the other branches of government. In any event, there are other authorities \r\n  which lead to the conclusion that the Attorney General is not prohibited from \r\n  bringing an action against the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly has elaborated on the Attorney General's duties in several statutes.  First, pursuant to S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 1-7-40 (Supp. 2001), the Attorney General must \r\n\r\n\r\nappear for the State in the Supreme Court and the court of appeals in the trial and argument of all causes, criminal and civil,\r\nin which the State is a party or interested, and in these causes in any other court or tribunal when required by the Governor\r\nor either branch of the General Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State is an interested party in this action.  The way in which public funds are handled and whether a violation of the\r\nseparation of powers doctrine has occurred are clearly questions in which the State has an interest.  By bringing the action\r\nagainst the Governor, the Attorney General is simply doing what the statute allows, which is to appear for the State before\r\nthe Supreme Court in the trial and argument of a cause in which the State is interested.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly has also provided that the Attorney General, upon written request of a State officer has a duty to\r\nappear and defend that officer when the officer is being prosecuted in a civil or criminal action, or other special proceeding,\r\ndue to an act done or omitted in good faith in the course of employment.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-50 (1986). (5)  The Attorney\r\nGeneral also must \"give his opinion upon questions of law submitted to him by either branch\" of the General Assembly or\r\nby the Governor.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-90 (1986).\r\n\r\nThere is no provision in the South Carolina Code or Constitution that explicitly prevents the Attorney General from\r\nbringing a civil action against the Governor.  Further, \r\n\r\n\r\n\"[a]s the chief law officer of the State, [the Attorney General] may, in the absence of some express legislative restriction to\r\nthe contrary, exercise all such power and authority as public interests may from time to time require, and may institute,\r\nconduct and maintain all such suits and proceedings as he deems necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the State, the\r\npreservation of order, and the protection of&nbsp; public rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nState ex rel. Daniel v. Broad River Power Co., 157 \r\n  S.C. 1, 68, 153 S.E. 537, 560 (1929), aff'd 282 U.S. 187, 51 S.Ct. \r\n  94, 75 L.Ed.2d. 287 (1930) (citation omitted and italics added by Daniel \r\n  court). Cf. State v. Beach Co., 271 S.C. 425, 248 S.E.2d 115 \r\n  (1978) (while Attorney General has broad statutory authority, and arguably common \r\n  law authority, to institute actions involving welfare of State, that authority \r\n  is not unlimited).\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General has a dual role. He is an attorney \r\n  for the Governor and he is an attorney for vindicating wrongs against the collective \r\n  citizens of the State. See Porcher v. Cappelmann, 187 S.C. 491, \r\n  198 S.E. 8 (1938) (Attorney General represents sovereign power and general public). \r\n  Allowing the Attorney General to bring an action against the Governor when there \r\n  is the possibility the Governor is acting illegally is consistent with the duties \r\n  of this dual role. Further, because the office of attorney general exists to \r\n  properly ensure the administration of the laws of this State, the Attorney General \r\n  is merely ensuring that Proviso 72.109 is being administered the way in which \r\n  the General Assembly intended. See Langford v. McLeod, 269 S.C. 466, \r\n  238 S.E.2d 161 (1977) (office of attorney general exists to properly ensure \r\n  administration of laws of this State).\r\n\r\nThe above precepts lead to the conclusion that the Attorney General can and should bring an action against the Governor if\r\nthere is the possibility the Governor is acting improperly. (6)\r\n\r\nWe note that, previously, the Attorney General has sued \r\n  the Governor in the Governor's capacity as Chairman of the State Budget and \r\n  Control Board. See State ex rel. McLeod v. Riley, 276 S.C. 323, \r\n  278 S.E.2d 612 (1981), overruled on other grounds by WDW Properties \r\n  v. City of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 535 S.E.2d 631 (2000) (action to determine \r\n  constitutionality of certain bond authorizations); State ex rel. McLeod v. \r\n  Edwards, 269 S.C. 75, 236 S.E.2d 406 (1977) (action attacking constitutionality \r\n  of legislation which created State Budget and Control Board). See also \r\n  State ex rel. McLeod v. Martin, 274 S.C. 106, 262 S.E.2d 404 (1980) (action \r\n  brought by Attorney General and Governor challenging legislation creating Court \r\n  of Appeals). However, the Attorney General's authority to sue the Governor was \r\n  not raised and remains a novel issue in this State. Subsequently, in State \r\n  ex rel McLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 295 S.E.2d 633 (1982), the Court \r\n  noted that the Attorney General's right to bring the action involved in Martin \r\n  and Edwards was not directly attacked. The McInnis court stated, however, \r\n  that\r\n\r\n\r\n[t]he Attorney General, by bringing this action in the name of the State, speaks for all of its citizens and may, on their\r\nbehalf, bring to the Court's attention for adjudication charges that there is an infringement in the separation-of-powers\r\narea. (7)\r\n\r\n\r\n      From this language and the fact there is no statutory or constitutional prohibition against the Attorney General suing the\r\nGovernor, we find the Attorney General has the authority to sue the Governor when he is bringing the action in the name of\r\nthe State for the purpose of asserting that a separation of powers violation has occurred.  Moreover, as stated previously, the\r\nAttorney General can bring an action against the Governor when it is necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the State,\r\nthe preservation of order, and the protection of public rights.\r\n\r\nDefendants query whether the Attorney General's action of bringing suit against the Governor violates the Rules of\r\nProfessional Responsibility.  Defendants state the Attorney General and the Governor have an attorney-client relationship,\r\nand that the Attorney General has violated Rule 1.7(a) of Rule 407 of the Rules of Professional Responsibility, which states\r\n\"[a] lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, unless: . .\r\n. (2) Each client consents after consultation.\"\r\n\r\nDefendants contend if the Governor had requested the Attorney General represent him in this matter, the Attorney General\r\nwould be required to do so.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-50.  In that event, the Attorney General would be on both sides of\r\nthe action which Defendants assert is impermissible.  Defendants also assert that because the Attorney General is currently\r\nrepresenting the Governor in other legal matters, the Attorney General cannot ethically bring the instant action against the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nWe have previously found that an analogous situation did \r\n  not create a conflict of interest. Cf. Langford v. McLeod, supra \r\n  (original proceeding brought for declaratory judgment as to status, responsibility, \r\n  and duty of Attorney General in representing municipal employees in civil actions; \r\n  Court held Attorney General may represent public officials in civil suits as \r\n  well as criminal ones without being subject to imposition of conflicting or \r\n  unethical duties); State ex rel. McLeod v. Snipes, 266 S.C. 415, 223 \r\n  S.E.2d 853 (1976) (Attorney General sought declaratory judgment that statute \r\n  requiring him to represent officers of State in criminal proceedings was in \r\n  conflict with constitutional provision designating Attorney General as chief \r\n  prosecutor of State; Court held no conflict of interest arose from two duties \r\n  of Attorney General as he could appoint members of his staff or solicitors or \r\n  assistant solicitors to participate in prosecution and defense).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Attorney General, as noted above, has a dual role of serving the sovereign of the State and the general\r\npublic.  Thus, the Attorney General is not violating the ethical rule against conflicts of interest by bringing an action against\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nWhile the Attorney General is required by the Constitution to \"assist and represent\" the Governor, the Attorney General\r\nalso has other duties given to him by the General Assembly, and elaborated on by the Court, which indicate the Attorney\r\nGeneral can bring an action against the Governor. (8)\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the Attorney General is not prohibited from bringing an action against the Governor.\r\n\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nAt issue is whether the combined actions of members of the executive branch violated the separation of powers doctrine by\r\nhaving funds that the General Assembly had specifically appropriated to the schools returned to the General Fund. (9)\r\n\r\nInitially, we note because Proviso 72.109 was not vetoed \r\n  by the Governor, the proviso became law. See S.C. Const. Art. IV, Â§ \r\n  21 (if Governor shall not approve any one or more of items or sections contained \r\n  in appropriation bill, but shall approve of residue thereof, residue shall become \r\n  law in like manner as if Governor had signed it). While the Governor indicated \r\n  in his veto message he was not vetoing Proviso 72.109 because the schools had \r\n  agreed to return the appropriated amounts to the general fund, the veto message \r\n  does not have the effect of law. Drummond v. Beasley, 331 S.C. 559, 503 \r\n  S.E.2d 455 (1998) (governor's veto message does not have force of law because \r\n  it is not a legislative act or an Executive Order).\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 8, provides:  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the government of this State, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the government shall be forever separate\r\nand distinct from each other, and no person or persons exercising the functions of one of said departments shall assume or\r\ndischarge the duties of any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated by the Court in State ex rel. McLeod v. McInnis:\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the prime reasons for separation of powers is the desirability of spreading out the authority for the operation of the\r\ngovernment.  It prevents the concentration of power in the hands of too few, and provides a system of checks and balances. \r\nThe legislative department makes the laws; the executive department carries the laws into effect; and the judicial\r\ndepartment interprets and declares the laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1982).\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly, as part of its law-making responsibilities, has\r\n\r\n\r\nthe duty and authority to appropriate money as necessary for the operation of the agencies of government and has the right\r\nto specify the conditions under which the appropriated monies shall be spent.  This the Assembly traditionally does by way\r\nof the annual State Appropriations Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 313-314, 295 S.E.2d at 637. See also \r\n  Gilstrap v. South Carolina Budget and Control Bd., 310 S.C. 210, 423 \r\n  S.E.2d 101 (1992) (appropriation of public funds is a legislative function); \r\n  Clarke v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., 177 S.C. 427, 181 S.E. 481 \r\n  (1935) (General Assembly has full authority to make such appropriations as it \r\n  deems wise in absence of any specific constitutional prohibition against such \r\n  appropriation).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the General Assembly properly appropriated money from the Barnwell Fund to the colleges and universities\r\nthrough Proviso 72.109.  The question is whether the concerted efforts of members of the executive branch encroached\r\nupon this power by having appropriated funds transferred from the schools to the General Fund.  We conclude the General\r\nAssembly's power has been encroached upon.\r\n\r\nOne of the Governor's duties, as chairman of the State Budget and Control Board, is to submit a recommended state budget\r\nto the General Assembly.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-11-10 (Supp. 2001) (Governor is chairman of State Budget and Control\r\nBoard); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-11-15 (Supp. 2001) (functions of State Budget and Control Board in preparation and\r\nsubmission to General Assembly of recommended state budget are devolved upon Governor).\r\n\r\nThe Governor has the ability, after the General Assembly has passed an appropriation act, of vetoing items or sections\r\ncontained within the act.  S.C. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 21.  If he vetoes any items or sections, the General Assembly, within each\r\nhouse, has the ability to override the Governor's vetoes by having the requisite number of votes to do so.  Id.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no provision in the South Carolina Code or Constitution which provides that the members of the\r\nexecutive branch have the ability to transfer funds from those to whom the General Assembly has appropriated money.  In\r\nfact, there is clear legislative intent that the ability to transfer appropriated money will lie only with the General Assembly. \r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-9-10 (1986) (\"It shall be unlawful for any moneys to be expended for any purpose or activity\r\nexcept that for which it is specifically appropriated, and no transfer from one appropriation account to another shall be\r\nmade unless such transfer be provided for in the annual appropriation act.\") (emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-9-20(A) (Supp. 2001) (\"It is unlawful for an officer, clerk, or other person charged with disbursements of state funds\r\nappropriated by the General Assembly to exceed the amounts and purposes stated in the appropriations, or to change or\r\nshift appropriations from one item to another.  Transfers may be authorized by the General Assembly in the annual\r\nappropriation act for the State.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the General Assembly cannot delegate this legislative \r\n  power even if it so desired. See Gilstrap v. South Carolina Budget \r\n  and Control Bd., supra (General Assembly may not delegate its power \r\n  to make laws); State ex rel McLeod v. McInnis, supra (General \r\n  Assembly's attempt to delegate to Joint Appropriations Review Committee power \r\n  to control expenditure of state and federal funds was found to violate separation \r\n  of powers because committee was permitted to control expenditures by administration \r\n  rather than by legislation); Bauer v. South Carolina State Housing Auth., \r\n  271 S.C. 219, 246 S.E.2d 869 (1978) (non-delegation doctrine is based on the \r\n  constitutional requirement that branches of government be forever separate and \r\n  distinct from each other).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the authority to transfer appropriated money lies with the General Assembly and not the executive branch. (10)  \r\n\r\nBecause Proviso 72.109 was not vetoed, the Governor and other members of the executive branch were required to\r\nfaithfully execute that proviso.  S.C. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 14 (Governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed). \r\nInstead, the proviso was undermined by the combined actions of certain members of the executive branch by transferring\r\nfunds that had been appropriated to the schools to the General Fund.\r\n\r\nWe emphasize that the Governor's simple request to the schools that they return the appropriated funds does not in and of\r\nitself violate the separation of powers doctrine.  However, given the concerted effort of the Governor, the Comptroller\r\nGeneral, and the State Treasurer to transfer the appropriated funds to the General Fund, we find the actions of the executive\r\nbranch have resulted in a separation of powers violation. (11)\r\n\r\nISSUE III\r\n\r\nAt issue is whether the Governor has a responsibility either to sign into law a balanced budget passed by the General\r\nAssembly or exercise his veto authority in a manner that maintains a balanced budget.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. Art. X, Â§ 7(a), provides:  \"The General Assembly shall provide by law for a budget process to insure that\r\nannual expenditures of state government may not exceed annual state revenue.\"  Therefore, the General Assembly is\r\nconstitutionally required to ensure that the budget process results in a balanced budget.  However, there is no provision in\r\nthe South Carolina Code or Constitution which states the Governor is required to return a balanced budget to the General\r\nAssembly.  There is also no requirement that the Governor exercise his veto power in a manner that will ensure a balanced\r\nbudget.  See, e.g., S.C. Const. Art. III, Â§ 36; S.C. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 21; S.C. Const. Art. X, Â§ 7.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the Governor is not required to return a balanced budget to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe conclude the Attorney General is not prohibited by the South Carolina Constitution or Code from bringing a legal\r\naction against the Governor.  Further, we find that the executive branch's actions have resulted in a separation of powers\r\nviolation.  Finally, we find the Governor is not required by the South Carolina Code or Constitution to return a balanced\r\nbudget to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur.  BURNETT, J., concurring in a separate opinion.  PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: (Concurring) I concur with the conclusions reached by the majority opinion.  I write separately\r\nbecause the majority bases the separation of powers violation on the \"concerted efforts\" of members of the executive\r\nbranch.  It is not disputed the events culminating in this constitutional violation were precipitated by a \"request\" from the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution Article I, Â§ 8, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the government of this State, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the government shall be forever separate\r\nand distinct from each other, and no person or persons exercising the functions of one of said departments shall assume or\r\ndischarge the duties of any other. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe separation of powers mandate is followed by the delineation of powers, authority and functions of each branch of\r\ngovernment.  Article III, Â§ 1 provides the legislative power of this State shall be vested in ... the \"General Assembly of the\r\nState of South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority explains the General Assembly has \"the duty \r\n  and authority to appropriate money as necessary for the operation of the agencies \r\n  of government and has the right to specify the conditions under which the appropriated \r\n  monies shall be spent. This the Assembly traditionally does by way of the annual \r\n  State Appropriations Bill.\" State ex rel. McLeod v. McInnis, \r\n  278 S.C. 312, 313-14, 295 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1982). \r\n\r\nUpon passage of an appropriations bill, the authority of the Governor extends to approving or vetoing items or sections of\r\nthe bill.  S.C. Const. art. IV, Â§ 21. The majority acknowledges South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 11-9-10 (1986) prohibits the\r\nexpenditure of any monies for any purpose other than that for which the monies were appropriated and \"no transfer from\r\none appropriation account to another shall be made unless such transfer be provided for in the annual appropriation act.\" \r\nNo authority to transfer the colleges and universities' funds was authorized in the 2001-2002 Appropriation Act.\r\n\r\nThrough Article IV, Â§ 1, the \"supreme executive authority\" \r\n  of South Carolina is vested in the \"Chief Magistrate,\" the \"Governor of the \r\n  State of South Carolina.\" A \"simple request\" from \"the supreme executive authority\" \r\n  of South Carolina issued to an agency with the purpose of effecting changes \r\n  in the appropriations act violates Article I, Â§ 8. The \"request\" of the Governor \r\n  is inconsistent with the \"right and duty of the legislature to determine the \r\n  appropriations of agencies and the programs undertaken.\" State ex rel. \r\n  McLeod v. McInnis, supra 278 S.C. at 314, 295 S.E.2d at 637.\r\n\r\nThe majority's conclusion of a separation of powers violation appears to rest on the \"concerted efforts\" of members of the\r\nexecutive branch.  Although this conclusion is correct, in my view, it is not merely the \"concerted effort\" of members of the\r\nexecutive branch which effects the violation of Article I, Â§ 8, but it is the act of any member of the executive branch which\r\neffects an infringement of the legislative authority and duty to appropriate money.  Id.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I agree with the majority that the transfer of funds from the colleges and universities to the state\r\ntreasurer contravened the budget process.  I also agree that the governor is not required to exercise his veto power to\r\neffectuate a balanced budget.  I write separately because I would pursue a different path in arriving at this result.\r\n\r\nI have grave reservations regarding the majority's decision \r\n  which allows the attorney general to sue the governor, especially where the \r\n  issue is whether one branch of government has encroached on the powers of another \r\n  branch. The attorney general is the governor's legal representative, and the \r\n  office of attorney general is part of the executive branch of government. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-1-110 (Supp. 2001) (office of attorney general is part of \r\n  the executive department).\r\n\r\nHere, the governor maintains that he has faithfully executed (12) the laws of the state.  I do not believe the framers of our\r\nstate constitution intended to make the attorney general the arbiter of whether his client, the governor, is or is not faithfully\r\nexecuting the law.\r\n\r\nThis case presents a separation of powers question and should be viewed only in that context.  The branch of government\r\naggrieved by the transfer of funds, the General Assembly, is a party to this suit, and is ably represented by its own counsel. \r\nIn my opinion the Court need not address whether the attorney general may, consonant with the state constitution, ever\r\nbring suit against the governor.  No one disputes that the General Assembly has the authority to maintain this action.  The\r\nGeneral Assembly is properly before this Court, and raises the same issues as the attorney general.  I would not decide the\r\nconstitutional issue of the attorney general's authority to initiate an action against the governor because that decision is not\r\nnecessary to the determination of this dispute. (13)\r\n\r\nAs to the governor's personal involvement in the transfers, \r\n  the undisputed facts establish that the governor merely requested the colleges \r\n  and universities return certain funds to the general fund. The schools complied \r\n  with the request. The governor neither transferred funds, nor ordered any entity \r\n  to transfer funds. Cf. Drummond v. Beasley, 331 S.C. 559, 503 \r\n  S.E.2d 455 (1998) (governor's veto message does not have force of law). In my \r\n  opinion the governor, like the attorney general, should be dismissed from this \r\n  action. \r\n1. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 13-7-10 (11), which is part of the Atomic Energy and Radiation Control Act, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Extended care maintenance fund\" means the \"escrow fund for perpetual care\" that is used for custodial, surveillance, and\r\nmaintenance costs during the period of institutional control and any post-closure observation period specified by the\r\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control, and for activities associated with the closure of the site . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n(Supp. 2001).\r\n2. The legality of the Governor's vetoes is not being challenged.\r\n3. The Governor did not request any transfer of money in the case where funds had been specifically designated by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to be spent for a certain purpose by a college or university.\r\n4. Due to the Governor's veto message, the net result in educational and general operating funding to higher education is\r\nthat, rather than the schools facing a $38.6 million reduction in operating funds, the schools would share in about a $1.9\r\nmillion overall increase in operating funds over the previous year's funding level.  Also, as a result of the Governor's\r\nactions, all higher education operating funds would be in recurring dollars.\r\n5. Defendants argue the Attorney General's action of suing the Governor is invalid because the Governor made a written\r\nrequest that the Attorney General dismiss the suit.  However, the Governor never requested that the Attorney General\r\nrepresent him in this matter; therefore, the Attorney General has not violated section 1-7-50.\r\n6. We agree with the conclusion stated in the concurring opinion that the framers of our state constitution did not intend to\r\nmake the Attorney General the \"arbiter\" of whether the Governor is faithfully executing the laws.  The Attorney General\r\ncannot be the arbiter because that is, in fact, the duty of this Court.  However, contrary to the belief stated in the concurring\r\nopinion, we conclude the Attorney General can and should bring to our attention alleged violations of the separation of\r\npowers doctrine.\r\n7. In McInnis, the Attorney General \r\n  brought an action against the Joint Appropriation Review Committee, claiming \r\n  the statute providing for the creation of that committee was unconstitutional \r\n  because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. \r\n8. See, e.g., Com. \r\n  ex rel. Cowan v. Wilkinson, 828 S.W.2d 610 (Ken. 1992) (Attorney General \r\n  brought action seeking to enjoin governor from being sworn in and acting as \r\n  member of state university board of trustees pursuant to executive order by \r\n  which Governor appointed himself to that position; court held Attorney General's \r\n  motion did not meet requirements of extraordinary remedy for injunctive relief.); \r\n  In re Com. ex rel.

Caperton, 446 \r\n  S.E.2d 921 (W.Va. 1994) (Attorney General brought declaratory judgment action \r\n  against Governor seeking determination of his rights and responsibilities under \r\n  statute requiring him to approve state contracts and ruling as to constitutionality \r\n  and validity of computer contracts which were basis for computer education program; \r\n  held Attorney General could not bring declaratory judgment action in official \r\n  capacity because he was not a \"person\" for purpose of maintaining declaratory \r\n  judgment action).\r\n\r\nWhile none of the above cases raised the issue of whether an Attorney General has the power to bring an action against the\r\nGovernor, we cite them for the proposition that the Attorney General has not been prohibited from bringing an action\r\nagainst the Governor in those jurisdictions.\r\n9. Defendants argue a justiciable controversy is not presented because the schools \"voluntarily remitted funds and the\r\nDefendant Treasurer and Comptroller General did nothing but place those funds, as requested in writing by the [schools],\r\ninto the general fund where they cannot be spent and are under the control of the General Assembly.\"  This issue involves a\r\nreal and not a hypothetical question.  The funds were requested to be returned to the General Fund and they were so\r\nreturned.  The question whether that action was valid remains a viable one.\r\n10. See also Rios v. Symington, \r\n  833 P.2d 20 (Ariz. 1992) (governor, in veto message to legislature, instructed \r\n  various state agencies to revert specified sums of money to general fund for \r\n  purpose of bringing total budget into balance; court held governor had exceeded \r\n  his power); Colorado General Assembly v. Lamm, 700 P.2d 508 (Colo. 1985) \r\n  (executive branch's action of transferring appropriated funds from particular \r\n  executive departments to others impermissibly infringed upon General Assembly's \r\n  plenary power of appropriation; also noting challenged transfers dramatically \r\n  altered objectives which General Assembly had determined were to be achieved \r\n  through use of state funds); County of Cook v. Ogilvie, 280 N.E.2d 224 \r\n  (Ill. 1972) (statute providing that State Department of Public Aid, with consent \r\n  of governor, may reapportion amounts appropriated under Public Aid Code among \r\n  several subdivisions of public aid as need arises was an unconstitutional delegation \r\n  of legislative power to executive branch). \r\n11. The State further argues the Governor has violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-9-10 (1986), which provides that \"no transfer\r\nfrom one appropriation account to another shall be made unless such transfer be provided for in the annual appropriation\r\nact.\"  Defendants argue section 11-9-10 was not violated because the returned funds were not placed in an appropriation\r\naccount but, rather, were placed in a revenue account.  Regardless of this fact, the statute has been violated.  \r\n\r\nFrom a reading of section 11-9-10 and from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-9-20(a), which provides that it is unlawful for one\r\n\"charged with disbursements of state funds appropriated by the General Assembly . . . to change or shift appropriations\r\nfrom one item to another,\" and which provides that \"[t]ransfers may be authorized by the General Assembly in annual\r\nappropriation act . . .,\" there is clear legislative intent to ensure that appropriated funds are not expended for any other\r\npurpose other than for which the funds were appropriated.\r\n12. The state constitution provides that \"[t]he Governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. . . .\"  S.C. Const.\r\nart. IV, Â§ 15. \r\n13. See State v.

Parham, Jr., of Irmo, for defendant Dr.\r\nCharles Eskridge. \r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  Respondent Susan Jinks brought this wrongful death and survival action on behalf of her husband, Carl H. Jinks (Jinks and his wife are\r\nreferred to collectively as \"Jinks\"), who died while incarcerated at Appellant Richland County's (County's) Detention Center.  The jury returned an $80,000\r\nverdict in Jinks' favor for wrongful death.  County appeals.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 1994, Jinks was arrested for failure to pay child support, booked, and confined at County's Detention Center.  He died at the Detention Center four\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Jinks brought an action in the United States District Court against \r\n  County, its detention center director, and the detention center physician alleging \r\n  the defendants violated 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 (1994). In addition, the complaint \r\n  alleged supplemental state claims of outrage and negligence under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Tort Claims Act). See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 \r\n  to -200 (Supp. 2001). The district court granted the defendants' motions for \r\n  summary judgment on the Section 1983 claim, (1) \r\n  issued an order declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state \r\n  claims, and dismissed the state claims without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1367(C)(3) (1993). \r\n\r\nOn December 18, 1997, sixteen days after the federal judge issued his order dismissing the state claims, Jinks filed the present wrongful death and survival action\r\nalleging various negligent acts by County and its detention center physician.  County answered, claiming immunity from suit under the Tort Claims Act, violation\r\nof the statute of limitations, collateral estoppel, and other defenses.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Does 28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1367(d) violate the Tenth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCounty contends Jinks failed to bring this state court action within the two \r\n  year statute of limitations provided by the Tort Claims Act and, therefore, \r\n  the claim is barred. See Â§ 15-78-100(a). (2) \r\n  Jinks maintains the statute of limitations was tolled pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1367(d) (hereafter referred to as \"Â§ 1367(d)\") while the original lawsuit \r\n  was pending in federal court. In response, County asserts in enacting Â§ 1367(d), \r\n  Congress exceeded its Article III and Necessary and Proper Clause \r\n  (3) powers, thereby violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States \r\n  Constitution. Specifically, County claims Â§ 1367(d) infringes on South Carolina's \r\n  sovereign immunity by extending the length of time in which a person may sue \r\n  a political subdivision of the State on grounds of negligence. We agree with \r\n  County. \r\n\r\nIn relevant part, 28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1367 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) . . . in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are\r\nso related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States\r\nConstitution. . . .\r\n\r\n(c) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if - \r\n\r\n      . . . \r\n\r\n    (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, . . . \r\n\r\n(d) The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a) . . . shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is\r\ndismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\r\n\r\n. . . .  \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1367 was adopted as part of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990. \r\n  Pub.L. 101-650, 104 Stat. 5089 (1990). \"The statute . . . gives federal courts \r\n  supplemental jurisdiction to the limits the case-and-controversy clause of Article \r\n  III of the [United States] Constitution permits.\" Charles A. Wright, Arthur \r\n  R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, 13  Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 3523.1 at 143 \r\n  (2d ed. Supp. 2001). (4)\r\n\r\nThe Tenth Amendment provides \"the powers not delegated to the United States \r\n  by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the \r\n  States respectively or to the people.\" U.S. Const. amend X. \"In a case like \r\n  these, involving the division of authority between federal and state governments, \r\n  the two inquiries are mirror images of each other. If a power is delegated to \r\n  Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation \r\n  of that power to the States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereignty \r\n  reserved by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a power the Constitution \r\n  has not conferred on Congress.\"  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156 \r\n  (1992). \r\n\r\n\r\n[W]e ask two questions to determine whether a statute violates [the Tenth Amendment].  First, whether the regulation it embodies is within Congress' power as\r\nbeing within those enumerated in the Constitution.  Second, whether, even if so, the means of regulation employed yet impermissibly infringe upon state\r\nsovereignty.  \r\n\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Johnson, 114 F.3d 476, 480 (4th Cir. 1997),\r\n referring \r\n  to  New York v. United States, supra. \r\n\r\nArticle III of the United States Constitution establishes the basis for the \r\n  judicial power of federal courts. By virtue of Article III and the Necessary \r\n  and Proper Clause, Congress has power to enact laws that govern the practice \r\n  and procedure in federal courts. Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460 (1965). \r\n\r\nThe Necessary and Proper Clause, referred to as the \"Sweeping Clause,\" provides that Congress is empowered \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and\r\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States.\"  U.S. Const.\r\nart. I, Â§ 8, cl. 18.  \"[T]he Sweeping Clause is not a self-contained grant of power.  It authorizes Congress only to pass laws that 'carry[] into Execution' powers the\r\nConstitution elsewhere vests in one or more institutions of the federal government.\"  Gary Lawson and Patricia B. Granger, The \"Proper\" Scope of Federal\r\nPower:  A Jurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L.J. 267, 274 (1993). \r\n\r\nWithin the Sweeping Clause, \"necessary\" does not mean absolutely required but \r\n  \"convenient, or useful, or essential to another.\"  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. \r\n  316, 413 (1819). In order for a law to be \"proper\" within the meaning of the \r\n  Clause, it must not violate the principles of state sovereignty.  Printz v. United\r\nStates, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).\r\n\r\n  County maintains Â§ 1367(d) is neither necessary nor proper.  First, County asserts since the tolling provision does not apply until after the federal action is\r\ndismissed, the statute is not \"necessary\" to federal practice and procedure.  Second, County argues Â§ 1367(d) is not \"proper\" because it interferes with a state's\r\nsovereignty by abrogating the statute of limitations.   More particularly, County claims Congress lacks the constitutional authority to extend the statute of\r\nlimitations governing actions in which the State has waived its sovereign immunity.\r\n\r\n  County correctly asserts Â§ 1367(d) regulates state court practice and procedure \r\n  as it tolls the statute of limitations for a state claim asserted in state court. \r\n  However, the tolling provision also affects federal practice as it allows litigants \r\n  to pursue actions in federal court without giving up access to state court in \r\n  the event the federal jurisdictional basis is determined not to exist. It governs \r\n  federal practice and procedure as it eliminates the need for federal judges \r\n  to retain supplemental claims which would be dismissed as stale if pursued in \r\n  state court. (5) Section 1367(d) is a useful \r\n  \"aid to the exercise of federal jurisdiction,\" and, therefore, is \"necessary\" \r\n  within the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause. Brief for Petitioner \r\n  at 27, Raygor v.  Regents of the Univ. of Minnesota, 2001 WL 913842 (Case No. \r\n  00-1514). \r\n\r\nWe conclude, however, that, as applied to the States and their political subdivisions in tort actions, passage of Â§ 1367(d) is not \"proper\" within the meaning of the\r\nNecessary and Proper Clause.  In these circumstances, the tolling provision interferes with the State's sovereign authority to establish the extent to which its\r\npolitical subdivisions are subject to suit.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he constitution of the United States, which recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the states, - independence in their legislative and\r\nindependence in their judicial departments.  Supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the states is in no case permissible except as to matters\r\nby the constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States.  Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority\r\nof the State and, to that extent, a denial of its independence.  \r\n\r\n\r\nErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78-79 (1938).\r\n\r\n  As a matter of sovereignty, the State has the authority to determine whether \r\n  it consents to suit within its own court system.  Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, \r\n  749 (1999) (\". . . the immunity of a sovereign in its own courts has always \r\n  been understood to be within the sole control of the sovereign itself.\");  Nevada \r\n  v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 414 (1979) (\"[t]he immunity of a truly independent sovereign \r\n  from suit in its own courts has been enjoyed as a matter of absolute right for \r\n  centuries. Only the sovereign's own consent could qualify the absolute character \r\n  of [its] immunity\" from suit). In addition, the State has the authority to determine \r\n  the conditions under which it consents to suit.  Alden v. Maine, supra \r\n  (suggesting state's waiver of immunity is limited to the parameters set forth \r\n  by the state statute);  Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858) (because waiver \r\n  of sovereign immunity is \"altogether voluntary,\" \"it follows that [the State] \r\n  may prescribe the terms and conditions on which [the State] consents to be sued, \r\n  and the manner in which the suit shall be conducted, and may withdraw its consent \r\n  whenever it may suppose that justice to the public requires.\"). Most recently, \r\n  the United States Supreme Court recognized that \"although we have not addressed \r\n  whether federal tolling of a state statute of limitations constitutes an abrogation \r\n  of state sovereign immunity with respect to claims against state defendants, \r\n  we can say that the notion at least raises serious constitutional doubt.\"  Raygor \r\n  v. Regents of Univ. of Minnesota, ___U.S. ___, ___, 122 S.Ct. 999,\r\n ___ ,  ___ \r\n  L.Ed.2d  ___ , ___(2002); see Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., \r\n  Inc., 337 U.S. 530, 533-34 (1949) (federal court \"cannot give [state claim] \r\n  longer life in the federal court than it would have had in the state court without \r\n  adding something to the cause of action.\"). \r\n\r\nUnder the doctrine of sovereign immunity, governmental entities in South Carolina \r\n  were protected from suits alleging tortious conduct by their employees until \r\n  1985.  Town of Duncan v. State Budget and Control Bd., 326 S.C. 6, 482 S.E.2d \r\n  768 (1997). In that year, the Court abolished the sovereign immunity of the \r\n  State and all local governmental subdivisions.  McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, \r\n  329 S.E.2d 741 (1985). In response, the General Assembly enacted the Tort Claims \r\n  Act, reinstating sovereign immunity for the State and its political subdivisions \r\n  with certain exceptions. Â§ 15-78-20. The Tort Claims Act provides a limited \r\n  waiver of governmental immunity and delineates the conditions upon which a claimant \r\n  may pursue actions against the State and its political subdivisions.  Moore v. \r\n  Florence School Dist. No. 1, 314 S.C. 335, 444 S.E.2d 498 (1994);  Bayle v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001); see \r\n  Â§ 15-78-40 (the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental \r\n  entities are \"liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent \r\n  as a private individual under like circumstances\" subject to certain limitations \r\n  and exemptions in the Tort Claims Act). One of the conditions is that an action \r\n  must be brought within two years of the date of loss. Â§ 15-78-100(a).\r\n\r\nSection 1367(d) potentially exposes political subdivisions to litigation and \r\n  liability after the limitations period established by the State has expired. \r\n  Accordingly, in tort actions against political subdivisions, Â§ 1367(d) extends \r\n  the waiver of the sovereign immunity of political subdivisions, thereby interfering \r\n  with the State's sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment and the Necessary \r\n  and Proper Clause. Lynn v. City of Jackson, 63 S.W.3d 332 (Tenn. 2001) (Â§ 1367(d) \r\n  cannot extend statute of limitations in governmental tort claim actions in which \r\n  State has consented to being sued without abrogating doctrine of sovereign immunity). \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a practical matter, we recognize our decision may affect a plaintiff's decision to pursue a tort action against a political subdivision in federal court.  We\r\nconclude, however, that a party's ability to choose its forum should not prevail over the State's sovereign authority to establish the terms under which its political\r\nsubdivisions may be sued.  Furthermore, our decision does not limit a plaintiff's ability to prosecute one action joining all federal and state law claims.  Should a\r\nplaintiff fear the federal court system will be unable to determine her claims within the statute of limitations, she may bring the action in state court.  \r\n\r\n  In summary, Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in enacting Â§ 1367(d) \r\n  to the extent it interferes with the States' sovereignty to establish the conditions \r\n  upon which tort actions may be maintained against political subdivisions. Consequently, \r\n  we conclude the tolling provision does not apply in these circumstances.  See\r\n \r\n  Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minnesota,  supra (Â§ 1367(d) does not apply to \r\n  dismissals of claims against nonconsenting States dismissed in federal court \r\n  on Eleventh Amendment grounds). Accordingly, Â§ 1367(d) did not toll Jinks' tort \r\n  action against County. Since her complaint was not filed within the two year \r\n  statute of limitations provided by the Tort Claims Act, her negligence claim \r\n  against County is barred as untimely. The trial judge erred in holding otherwise. \r\n  (6)  \r\n\r\nREVERSED. \r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Allen Bullard, Jr., and Assistant\r\nAttorney General Dave Spencer; all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this petition for a writ of certiorari to determine if the post-conviction relief\r\n(PCR) court erred by denying petitioner's PCR\r\napplication.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioner was convicted of second degree burglary. He was acquitted of grand \r\n  larceny and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. \r\n  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal by the Court of Appeals.\r\n \r\n  State v. Wertz, Op. No. 98-UP-099 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 19, 1998).\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, petitioner's PCR application was denied.  We granted in part and denied in part petitioner's pro se petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWas trial counsel ineffective for failing to request the jury's verdict be clarified with respect to the degree of the burglary conviction?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nPetitioner's charges arose out of the following facts. A building, housing \r\n  Carolina Comfort Heating and Air Conditioning, was broken into. The perpetrator \r\n  entered the building through the bathroom window and allegedly left through \r\n  a door. When the owner arrived, he found several items missing, including a \r\n  nine millimeter Beretta hand gun.\r\n\r\nDuring the jury charge, the trial court charged the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . this defendant is charged with burglary, second degree.  . . . a person is guilty of burglary in the second degree if a person enters a building without consent\r\nwith intent to commit a crime therein.  When in effect and entry [sic] while in the building or immediate flight therefrom be another participant in the crime [sic]\r\nis armed with a deadly weapon or explosive.  Burglary in the third degree is included in the lesser crime in burglary second degree.  . . . a person is guilty of\r\nburglary in the third degree if the person enters the building without consent with intent to commit a crime therein.  It matters not whether a crime was committed .\r\n. . for burglary. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court subsequently charged the jury regarding the forms of the verdict:\r\n\r\n\r\nCount One, burglary.  You could be guilty or not guilty, depending upon your view of the facts and circumstances, or it could be guilty of burglary in the third\r\ndegree or not guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verdict of the jury on Count One was guilty.  Trial counsel did not request that the jury be polled or that the verdict be clarified as to whether the verdict was\r\nguilty of second degree burglary or guilty of third degree burglary.  The trial court issued the maximum sentence for second degree burglary, which was fifteen\r\nyears imprisonment.\r\n\r\nPetitioner claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the verdict be clarified with respect to the degree of the burglary conviction.  Petitioner\r\nfurther asserts, because he was acquitted of the charge of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and because the trial court did not\r\ncharge the jury on the aggravating circumstance of burglary being committed in the nighttime, the jury apparently did not find an aggravating circumstance to\r\nsupport a second degree burglary verdict.\r\n\r\nPetitioner's trial counsel testified at the PCR hearing that his understanding of the verdict was that petitioner was found guilty of second degree burglary.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found counsel did not render ineffective assistance to petitioner.  The court read the verdict to be that petitioner was guilty of second degree\r\nburglary.\r\n\r\nFor petitioner to be granted PCR as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, \r\n  he must show both: (1) that his counsel failed to render reasonably effective \r\n  assistance under prevailing professional norms, and (2) that he was prejudiced \r\n  by his counsel's ineffective assistance.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. \r\n  668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984);  Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d 308 (2000).\r\n\r\nThe statute for second degree burglary, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B) (Supp. 2001), provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nA person is guilty of burglary in the second degree if the person enters a building without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, and either:\r\n\r\n(1) When, in effecting entry or while in the building or in immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n\r\n(a) Is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statute for third degree burglary, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-313 (A) (Supp. 2001), provides that, \"[a] person is guilty of burglary in the third degree if the person\r\nenters a building without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein.\"\r\n\r\nPetitioner asserts that the fact he was acquitted of the charge of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime showed the jury intended to find\r\nhim guilty of third degree burglary rather than second degree burglary.  However, this argument does not aid petitioner.\r\n\r\nIn  State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991), we abolished the \r\n  rule prohibiting inconsistent verdicts. In Alexander, the jury found Alexander \r\n  guilty of kidnapping and criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the third degree. \r\n  Alexander claimed that the fact he had been implicitly acquitted of first degree \r\n  CSC, which has as one definition of it a sexual battery accompanied by a kidnapping, \r\n  entitled him to a new trial because the jury had rendered an inconsistent verdict. \r\n  However, we rejected this claim. Petitioner's claim that the jury could not \r\n  have found him guilty of second degree burglary because the jury had found him \r\n  not guilty for the possession of a weapon charge is eviscerated by  State v.\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the question remains whether the jury's verdict was unclear as to the degree of burglary with which petitioner was convicted, and, if so, whether\r\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to have the verdict clarified at the time of trial.\r\n\r\n\"'A verdict should be certain and import a definite meaning free from ambiguity.'\"\r\n \r\n  Lorick &amp; Lowrance v. Julius H. Walker &amp; Co., 153 S.C. 309, 319, 150 \r\n  S.E. 789, 792 (1929) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nIf a party believes there is confusion in the wording of a jury's verdict, \r\n  that party should call it to the attention of the trial court at the time the \r\n  verdict is rendered so that any confusion in the verdict's language can be easily \r\n  cleared up.  Howard v. Kirton, 144 S.C. 89, 142 S.E. 39 (1928). It is \"the duty \r\n  of the trial judge to decide what the verdict meant, and, in reaching his conclusion \r\n  thereabout, it [is] his duty to take into consideration not only the language \r\n  of the verdict, but all the matters that occurred in the course of the trial.\" \r\n  Id. at 101, 142 S.E. at 43. See also   Durst v. Southern Ry.\r\nCo., 161 S.C. 498, 159 S.E. 844 (1931) (to determine what jury intended to find \r\n  construction of verdict can and should depend upon language used by jury and \r\n  other things occurring in trial). \r\n\r\n\r\nA verdict of a jury should be upheld when it is possible to do so, and carry \r\n  into effect what was clearly the intention of the jury. When a verdict is so \r\n  confused, however, that it is not absolutely clear what the jury intended to \r\n  do, the safest and best course for the court to pursue is to order a new trial. \r\n  Judges and parties should not be required to guess as to what verdict a jury \r\n  sought to render.\r\n\r\n\r\nLorick &amp; Lowrance, supra at 320, 150 S.E. at 793.\r\n\r\nIn  State v. Wilson, 162 S.C. 413, 437, 161 S.E. 104, 113 (1931) (quoting\r\n State \r\n  v. Smith, 18 S.C. 149 (1882)) (emphasis added by  Wilson court), the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\". . . a general verdict of guilty furnishes . . . no ground for a new trial, provided the jury have been explicitly instructed that the effect of a general verdict will be\r\nto find the party accused guilty of the highest offense charged in the indictment, and that they have the right to designate in their verdict which one of the\r\nparticular offenses charged they believed the accused to be guilty of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also   State v. Johnson, 186 S.C. 202, 195 S.E. 329 (1938) (same).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court's instructions to the jury on how the verdict should be rendered were unclear.  The trial court, as noted previously, instructed the\r\njury regarding the forms of the verdict:\r\n\r\n\r\nCount One, burglary.  You could be guilty or not guilty, depending upon your view of the facts and circumstances, or it could be guilty of burglary in the third\r\ndegree or not guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not explicitly instruct the jury to specify which degree \r\n  of burglary for which they were finding petitioner guilty. Further, the jury \r\n  was not charged that a general verdict had the effect of finding petitioner \r\n  guilty of the highest offense charged in the indictment. See State \r\n  v. Wilson, supra.\r\n\r\nGiven these unclear instructions and the general verdict rendered by the jury, \r\n  counsel was deficient for failing to have the verdict clarified as to which \r\n  degree of burglary the jury was finding petitioner guilty. See State \r\n  v. Wilson, supra. Counsel should have called the ambiguous verdict \r\n  to the trial court's attention at the time it was rendered, and, at that time, \r\n  the confusion could have been easily cleared up. See Howard v. Kirton, \r\n  supra.\r\n\r\nWe find there is a reasonable probability, but for counsel's error of not requesting \r\n  that the jury's verdict be clarified, the result of the trial would have been \r\n  different. See Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997) \r\n  (to show prejudice, applicant must show, but for counsel's errors, there is \r\n  reasonable probability result of trial would have been different). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the PCR court erred by not granting petitioner a new trial on \r\n  this ground. See Lorick &amp; Lowrance, supra (when verdict \r\n  is so confused, safest and best course for court is to order new trial).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe reverse the PCR court on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request the jury's verdict be clarified as to the degree of petitioner's\r\nburglary conviction.  Given our conclusion on this issue, we need not address petitioner's remaining issues.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. While there was the possibility the burglary occurred during the nighttime, the jury was not charged with regard to the element of nighttime.  Therefore, the only\r\naggravator charged which would elevate the crime to second degree burglary from third degree burglary was \"armed with a deadly weapon.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact a hand gun is stolen during a burglary makes the perpetrator \"armed\" \r\n  with a deadly weapon. See   State v. McCaskill, 321 S.C. 283, 468 S.E.2d \r\n  81 (Ct. App. 1996) (to be \"armed\" with a deadly weapon, a person or \"another \r\n  participant in the crime\" need only have physical control over a deadly weapon \r\n  \"in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in the immediate flight therefrom\" \r\n  such that the weapon is readily available for the person to use; it matters \r\n  not how person acquired deadly weapon or for what purpose person took possession \r\n  of deadly weapon).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25448","title":"In the Matter of Curlin","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25448","description":"Opinion disbarring Theron James Curlin.","date":"2002-04-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Theron James Curlin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25448\r\nSubmitted March 26, 2002 - Filed April 22, 2002\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Barbara M. Seymour, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n        Theron James Curlin, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\nRule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment. (1)  We accept the agreement and disbar\r\nrespondent.  The facts as admitted in the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Facts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained by client to represent him at a real estate loan closing.  At the time respondent prepared the mortgage and conducted the loan closing,\r\nrespondent was aware that the property was owned by client's sister, not client.  Respondent did not prepare a deed conveying title of the property to client, and\r\nclient's sister neither signed the mortgage nor attended the closing.\r\n\r\nWhen client failed to comply with the terms of the mortgage and the lender began foreclosure proceedings, it was discovered that client's sister was the record\r\nowner of the property.  After being contacted by the title insurance company, respondent drafted a quit-claim deed which purported to convey the property from\r\nclient's sister to client.  Respondent forged the signatures of client's sister, the witnesses, and the notary.  Respondent then recorded and filed the quit-claim deed. \r\nBased on respondent's representations that the deed was valid, the lender proceeded with foreclosure proceedings.  As a result of respondent's actions, the\r\nproperty was to be sold at public auction with the proceeds to be paid to the lender.  Respondent failed to respond to the complaint filed by client's sister with the\r\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nDuring a two or three year period, respondent routinely signed as witness and notarized legal documents outside the presence of the signatory.  At the time\r\nrespondent engaged in this conduct, he was aware that some of the documents were to be provided to lenders and filed with government agencies to be made part\r\nof the public record.\r\n\r\nIn another real estate matter, a client retained respondent to assist her in refinancing her home, including conducting the closing.  Respondent failed to discover or\r\ninform client about two South Carolina Department of Revenue liens, an Internal Revenue Service lien, and a judgment against the former owner of the house. \r\nThe encumbrance on the property exceeded $35,000.  When the liens were discovered, the client's new attorney contacted respondent, but respondent did not\r\nrespond and failed to assist the client in rectifying the matter.\r\n\r\nFor approximately three years, respondent engaged in a scheme to misappropriate funds from his firm's real estate trust account.  Respondent converted\r\napproximately $71,598 in law firm or client money to his own use.  In order to perpetuate and conceal his scheme, respondent engaged in the routine preparation\r\nof false and fraudulent documentation. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR: Rule 1.1 (failing to provide competent\r\nrepresentation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall consult with the client as to the means by which representation is to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (failing to act with\r\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter); Rule 1.15 (a\r\nlawyer shall hold property of clients that is in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property); Rule 3.3 (a\r\nlawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal or offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false); Rule 8.1 (failure to\r\nrespond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (committing a\r\ncriminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude);\r\nRule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is\r\nprejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\ndisrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.  Respondent shall not be entitled to seek reinstatement or readmission to the practice\r\nof law in this state until he has fully repaid any amounts due and owing his clients, as well as any other parties that may have lost money because of respondent's\r\nmisconduct, and until he has reimbursed the Lawyer's Fund for Client Protection for any and all amounts paid, including reasonable interest, in connection with\r\nthis matter.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of\r\nRule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

The facts as admitted \r\n  in the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Facts \r\n  \r\n\r\nRespondent represented a client in a real estate \r\n  transaction. Respondent accepted $699,210.59, which he was to hold in escrow \r\n  for the transaction. Instead, respondent deposited a majority of the funds into \r\n  a personal account and disbursed a portion of the funds to a third party.\r\nThereafter, respondent, on behalf of his client \r\n  and relative to the real estate transaction, presented Carolina First Bank with \r\n  a check for $679,888.49 drawn on an account he maintained with Regions Bank. \r\n  When Carolina First Bank attempted to negotiate the check, it was returned by \r\n  Regions Bank due to the fact that the funds in respondent's account were not \r\n  sufficient to cover the amount of the check.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents \r\n  to the imposition of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent.  \r\n  (1) \r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nI. Real Estate Matters\r\n\r\nA client retained respondent to handle a real estate \r\n  closing for a construction loan. At the closing, lender wired $33,573.81 to \r\n  respondent's real estate trust account to enable the client to pay off an existing \r\n  mortgage and to make a payment to the contractor. However, the checks issued \r\n  by respondent from his trust account were returned because of insufficient funds. \r\n  Respondent did not refund the retainer fee he received from the client, nor \r\n  did he account for how the funds wired to his trust account were used. \r\n\r\n The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) conducted \r\na full investigation and discovered that respondent's real estate trust account \r\nreflected a persistent pattern of negative balances. ODC further discovered that \r\nrespondent consistently disbursed funds deposited in his account for specific \r\nreal estate closings to make settlement payments for other unrelated closings \r\nin order to cover the shortage of funds in his trust account. \r\nIn another matter, a client signed a contract to \r\n  purchase a house and was informed by the mortgage company that it was using \r\n  respondent as the attorney to handle the closing. Respondent did not meet with \r\n  or discuss the matter with the client prior to the closing. At the closing, \r\n  respondent presented the client with a form stating that he represented all \r\n  parties and that he would withdraw if any conflict arose. However, as the closing \r\n  proceeded, the client raised many questions about the fees she was required \r\n  to pay and discovered that the loan origination fee on the settlement statement \r\n  was higher than what she and the mortgage company had discussed. When asked \r\n  about the fees, respondent could not provide an adequate explanation and asked \r\n  the mortgage company representative to explain the fee increase, giving the \r\n  client the impression that respondent was representing the mortgage company's \r\n  interest to her detriment. The client inquired about consulting another attorney; \r\n  however, respondent did not give her a reasonable opportunity to seek other \r\n  advice or offer to withdraw from representation of the parties. At the conclusion \r\n  of the closing, the client was not given copies of any of the documents she \r\n  had signed. Further, respondent failed to respond to the client's numerous requests \r\n  for information in the days following the closing.\r\n\r\nII. Post Conviction Relief Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent was appointed to represent a client \r\n  in post conviction relief (PCR) proceedings. Respondent failed to inform the \r\n  client of the status of the PCR or comply with the client's requests for information. \r\n  Respondent also failed to respond to a request for information from ODC and \r\n  knowingly made false statements of material fact to ODC. \r\n\r\nIII. Civil Dispute Matters\r\n\r\nRespondent agreed to represent a client in a dispute \r\n  and met with her three times to discuss the \r\n  dispute. However, respondent subsequently refused to respond to her requests \r\n  for information regarding her case. Respondent also failed to enter into a written \r\n  fee agreement with the client.\r\n\r\nIn another civil matter, a client hired respondent \r\n  to resolve a dispute with an automobile repair shop. The parties agreed to a \r\n  contingency fee; however, the agreement was not reduced to writing. Respondent \r\n  wrote a letter on behalf of the client to the repair shop, to which the shop \r\n  responded with a settlement offer. The client instructed respondent to make \r\n  a counteroffer. However, despite numerous requests for information, respondent \r\n  failed to communicate any further with the client and did not do any more work \r\n  on the case. Several months later, respondent sent the client a copy of the \r\n  file and stated that the client could bring an action against the shop himself \r\n  or hire another attorney to bring the suit.\r\n\r\nIV. Family Court Matters\r\n\r\nA client retained respondent to represent her in \r\n  a family court matter. Although respondent \r\n  stated that he was securing a court date for the case, the client discovered \r\n  that no work had been done when she retrieved her file following respondent's \r\n  interim suspension. Respondent also failed to account for or refund the retainer \r\n  fee paid by the client.\r\n\r\nIn another family court matter, a client retained \r\n  respondent to represent him in a child custody action and child support action. \r\n  After sending respondent the retainer fee, the client experienced difficulty \r\n  in contacting respondent. Respondent told the client that he had filed a petition \r\n  for a reduction in child support and had drafted the necessary papers for the \r\n  child custody action. However, the client was served with a summons and complaint \r\n  alleging that he was delinquent in his child support payments and ordering him \r\n  to appear in family court. The client, an Ohio resident, traveled to South Carolina \r\n  for the hearing but was unable to meet with respondent until two days after \r\n  his arrival. After the hearing, respondent again told the client that the papers \r\n  for the child custody action had been drafted and would be served on the client's \r\n  ex-wife within ten days. The client did not receive any papers or communication \r\n  from respondent until he contacted respondent's office and was told that respondent \r\n  had been suspended from the practice of law. Further, the client's file revealed \r\n  that respondent had not drafted a petition or complaint regarding the custody \r\n  issue.\r\n\r\nIn a third family court matter, a client retained \r\n  respondent to represent him; however, respondent failed to respond to requests \r\n  for information from the client and did not file any pleadings with the family \r\n  court. Respondent also failed to account for or refund the attorney fee paid \r\n  by the client.\r\n\r\nV. Criminal Matter\r\n\r\nA client retained respondent to represent him in \r\n  a criminal matter. Respondent collected several payments from the client but \r\n  did not provide any written receipts. Respondent failed to provide copies of \r\n  documents he prepared for the case, and did not respond to the client's requests \r\n  for information. Respondent also failed to account for or refund the retainer \r\n  fee paid by the client.\r\n\r\nVI. Bankruptcy Matters\r\n\r\nA client retained respondent to file a bankruptcy \r\n  petition. Respondent prepared the petition which was signed by respondent and \r\n  the client. The client believed that the petition would be filed immediately \r\n  thereafter. However, respondent failed to file the petition. The client sent \r\n  respondent additional information shortly after the petition was signed and \r\n  received a copy of a \"Motion to Amend Bankruptcy Petition.\" This reinforced \r\n  the client's belief that the petition had been filed. The client attempted unsuccessfully \r\n  to contact respondent regarding the court date and informed respondent that \r\n  the matter needed to be resolved so he could move out of state. \r\n\r\nSeveral months after the petition was signed and \r\n  after the client moved to Ohio, respondent filed the petition. The client drove \r\n  to South Carolina to attend the meeting of the creditors. However, respondent \r\n  failed to attend. Respondent told the client that he would refund part of his \r\n  legal fee, but never accounted for or made any refund of the fee.\r\n\r\nIn another matter in which a client retained respondent \r\n  to file a bankruptcy petition, the client understood that respondent would file \r\n  the petition upon receipt of an initial fee and that an additional fee would \r\n  be paid before the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings. Respondent failed \r\n  to obtain a written fee agreement and failed to communicate to the client that \r\n  he would take no action until the client paid him the additional fee. The client \r\n  attempted to discharge respondent and demanded a refund of his legal fee. However, \r\n  respondent never refunded the fee.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (failing \r\n  to provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (failing to abide \r\n  by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, and failing \r\n  to consult with the client as to the means by which they are pursued); Rule \r\n  1.3 (failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4 (failing to keep a client reasonably informed about the \r\n  status of a matter and promptly complying with reasonable requests for information); \r\n  Rule 1.5 (a lawyer's fees shall be reasonable); Rule 1.7 (a lawyer shall not \r\n  represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse \r\n  to another client); Rule 1.15 (failing to keep client funds in a separate account); \r\n  Rule 1.16 (failing to withdraw from representation when the representation will \r\n  result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law); Rule \r\n  3.2 (failing to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation); Rule 8.1 (failing \r\n  to respond to a lawful demand for information regarding a disciplinary matter); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging \r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (failing to respond \r\n  to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in \r\n  conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts \r\n  or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon \r\n  admission to practice law in this state). Finally, respondent violated Rule \r\n  417, SCACR (failing to maintain current financial records). \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state. Respondent is \r\n  prohibited from seeking reinstatement or readmission to the practice of law \r\n  until he has fully repaid all funds owed, including reasonable interest, to \r\n  clients or other parties who have been financially injured due to any misconduct \r\n  of the respondent, and reimbursed the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for \r\n  any and all amounts paid in connection with this matter. Further, respondent \r\n  warrants that he is, and will in the future, fully cooperate with all appropriate \r\n  authorities if a further audit of respondent's financial records is deemed necessary \r\n  and is conducted. Respondent also warrants that if any further shortages are \r\n  found to exist in any funds received in trust by respondent, he will make restitution \r\n  as stated in this opinion. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, \r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has \r\n  complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate \r\n  of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n1.

Richardson, Jr. and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n        M. Eugene Gibbs, of Silver Spring, Maryland, \r\n          Pro Se.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, a full panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (\"Commission\")\r\nrecommended M. Eugene Gibbs (\"Respondent\") be disbarred.  We agree and disbar Respondent.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nFormal charges were filed against Respondent four times between February 22, 1999, and February 6, 2001.  Three hearings were\r\nheld to address the various charges.  In response to the first three sets of formal charges, the sub-panel recommended indefinite\r\nsuspension.  However, after a hearing on the fourth set of charges, the sub-panel recommended disbarment and the full panel\r\nadopted that recommendation.  \r\n\r\nIn response to the disciplinary action pending against him, Respondent filed an Emergency Petition for Writ challenging the findings\r\nof the Commission below and requesting that this Court find him unable to defend himself in these proceedings, and take action to\r\nstop an alleged criminal conspiracy. \r\n\r\nFirst Formal Charges\r\n\r\nFormal charges were first brought against Respondent on February 22, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Patricia A. McDaniel Matter:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1997, Respondent requested a transcript from Patricia A. McDaniel, a circuit court reporter.  On December 5, 1997,\r\nMs. McDaniel forwarded the transcript to Respondent with a statement for her services in the amount of $482.45.  \r\n\r\nRespondent did not pay Ms. McDaniel despite several notices and phone calls from her.   After complaining to Court\r\nAdministration, her complaint was sent to the Commission.  On April 16, 1998, the Commission sent Respondent a letter requesting\r\na response to the complaint within fifteen days.  Respondent did not reply even after the Commission sent a second letter on May\r\n20, 1998, requesting a response and reminding Respondent that failure to respond could in and of itself constitute grounds for\r\ndiscipline.  \r\n\r\nOn July 7, 1998, Respondent sent a check for the full amount to the Commission, not to Ms. McDaniel, with a letter asking the\r\nCommission to pay her if it determined she deserved payment.  Notice of Full Investigation was sent to Respondent on July 24,\r\n1998. The Commission returned the check to Respondent in November 1998, stating that Respondent would have to decide whether\r\nMs. McDaniel's invoice should be paid and reminding Respondent he still had not properly responded to the Commission's inquiry. \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent did not respond and, on February 22, 1999, a Notice of Formal Charges was sent to Respondent.  Respondent's answer\r\nwas not received by the Commission until past the deadline on April 1, 1999.  In that answer, Respondent stated he believed his\r\ncontract with Ms. McDaniel was terminated when she did not deliver the transcript within thirty days.  He stated he would pay Ms.\r\nMcDaniel if the Commission determined the transcript had been delivered pursuant to the Rules of Court.  \r\n\r\nA hearing on this matter was conducted before the sub-panel of the Commission on December 23, 1999. (1)  Respondent did not\r\nappear at the hearing.  Based on the evidence before it, the sub-panel found Respondent committed attorney misconduct, violating\r\nRule 1.1 (competence) and 8.4 (misconduct) by ordering a transcript, receiving it, and failing to pay for it without just cause or\r\nexcuse. \r\n\r\nSecond Formal Charges\r\n\r\nBefore the conclusion of the Patricia McDaniel Matter, on July 6, 1999, notice of a second set of formal charges was sent to\r\nRespondent.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Mary McLeod Matter:\r\n\r\n\r\nThese charges arose out of Respondent's representation of Mary McLeod in what began as a routine eviction proceeding against her. \r\nMs. McLeod lived in a mobile home situated on land in Florence County owned by Sollie and Mary Floyd.  Ms. McLeod had a\r\nmonth to month lease with the Floyds requiring her to pay them $150.00 per month.  On May 5, 1997, Honda of South Carolina\r\nManufacturing, Inc. purchased the land, and on May 30, 1997, Honda served Ms. McLeod with notice to vacate within thirty days\r\nunder the terms of her lease.  They offered to pay the relocation cost of Ms. McLeod's mobile home and her first month's rent in the\r\nnew location, but Ms. McLeod did not vacate. \r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Solicitation of Legal Business  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission charged that Respondent improperly solicited legal business from Ms. McLeod by personally telephoning her, and\r\nrequesting to be her attorney in opposition to any effort to have her evicted.\r\n\r\n  (2) Improper Financial Assistance to Client\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission charged that Respondent paid, or caused a member of his staff to pay, rent payments directly to Ms. Floyd, and/or\r\nto others on her behalf. \r\n\r\n\r\n  (3) Frivolous Motion to Dismiss Eviction Action\r\n\r\n\r\nThe County brought an Application for Ejectment against Ms. McLeod.  In response, the Commission charged that Respondent filed\r\na frivolous Motion to Dismiss.  The Commission alleged that Respondent incorrectly claimed (1) that Ms. McLeod did not receive\r\nnotice of the termination of her lease and (2) that her lease could not be terminated absent a violation of the lease.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (4) Incompetent Representation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission charged that Respondent acted incompetently  numerous times during his representation.  First, the Commission\r\nclaimed he acted incompetently by filing a Notice of Appeal and Petition for Bond with the Court of Appeals when applications for\r\nBonds should be filed in the lower court.  Respondent's mistake resulted in failure to timely file for an Appeal Bond and prevented\r\nhis client's case from being successfully appealed.\r\n\r\nThe Commission further charged that Respondent acted incompetently by raising the applicability of certain state and federal\r\nstatutes for the first time in an Amended Motion for Stay and Bond with the circuit court.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (5) Frivolous Claims in State Suit\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent brought suit against Honda, the Town of Timmonsville, Mayor Peoples, and Florence County (by amendment).  The\r\nCommission charged Respondent's claim for punitive damages against the County for emotional distress was frivolous because the\r\nSouth Carolina Tort Claims Act does not permit claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress. \r\n\r\nEventually, Respondent moved for voluntary dismissal, asserting that the matter was being litigated in federal court.  Judge\r\nKittredge dismissed the suit with prejudice.  The Commission alleged Respondent acted incompetently by failing to notify Ms.\r\nMcLeod he was moving for voluntary dismissal and subsequently filing a frivolous Motion for Reconsideration, alleging that Judge\r\nKittredge had conspired with the defendants to deprive Ms. McLeod of her rights and claiming error in the eviction proceeding. \r\nJudge Kittredge denied the Motion, noting it (1) rambled and was difficult to follow, (2) claimed error in an entirely different action\r\nthan the one before him, and (3) was utterly frivolous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (6)  Frivolous Claims and Incompetence in Federal \r\n    Suit\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent filed a suit in federal court against Honda, Florence County, Mayor Peoples, the Floyds, the Department of Housing and\r\nUrban Development (\"HUD\"), and the Secretary of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.  The federal district court, Judge\r\nCurrie, dismissed the claims against HUD and the Chamber of Commerce with prejudice and entered summary judgment for the\r\nremaining defendants.  The Commission charged that Respondent acted incompetently because the suit was frivolous, and\r\nRespondent violated the local federal rules in his filings.  Further, the Commission alleged Respondent acted incompetently by\r\npursuing relief for his client under the Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Act (\"URA\") when it clearly did not apply\r\nto Ms. McLeod. (2) In addition, the Commission charged that Respondent's suit against Honda and many of the other defendants was\r\nbarred by the doctrine of res judicata as the issues had been litigated already in state court.  The Commission also charged that\r\nRespondent disclosed his client's mental health history in open court without her permission or knowledge.  Perhaps most\r\nsignificantly, the Commission charged that Respondent failed to advise his client to accept offers to move her mobile home free of\r\ncharge and to pay rent for her in a new location.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (7) Retainer Agreement\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission also found fault in Respondent's retainer agreement with Ms. McLeod because it did not identify the date the\r\ncause of action arose, whether Ms. McLeod would be responsible for costs, and whether Respondent's percentage fee would come\r\noff the top, or from the net of any recovery.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (8) Response to the Commission's Inquiry \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission sent copies of Ms. McLeod's complaints to Respondent on two occasions, each time requesting a response from\r\nRespondent within ten days.  Respondent did not reply to either letter.  On May 10, 1998, the Commission again requested a\r\nresponse, reminding Respondent that failure to respond could in and of itself constitute grounds for disciplinary action.  On May 28,\r\n1998, Respondent replied to the Disciplinary Counsel by stating that because the matter was in litigation, he had referred the\r\ncomplaint to the presiding judge.  Further, Respondent contended to the Commission that his client had not written the complaints.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, Respondent wrote U.S. Magistrate Judge Margaret Seymour, assigned to the case, stating that two complaints had\r\nbeen filed against him.  The Commission charged that Respondent misrepresented to Judge Seymour that his client had not written\r\nthe complaints and requested action beyond her jurisdiction by asking her to hold a hearing to rule on Ms. McLeod's allegations of\r\nmisconduct.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (9) False Statements Regarding Settlement Offers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission charged that Respondent told Ms. McLeod that he could negotiate a settlement with HUD for $45,000 when, in\r\nfact, no HUD attorney had told him any such offer would be forthcoming.  Respondent also stated Ms. McLeod had been offered\r\n$30,000 by another defendant ($20,000 to be paid to her and $10,000 for his fee).  The Commission charged no such offer was made\r\nalthough Respondent insists he did receive such an offer from HUD.  Also, during the course of his representation, Respondent\r\nwrote a demand letter to the S.C. Department of Commerce, requesting $25,000 to replace his client's mobile home and $10,000 to\r\nreplace items lost, damaged, or stolen when her home was forcibly removed from the land.  The Commission charged the demand\r\nwas improper because Ms. McLeod never gave Respondent any such accounting of lost or damaged items.  Therefore, the $10,000\r\ndemand had no basis in fact.\r\n\r\nSub-panel's Findings\r\n\r\nA hearing on the first and second formal charges \r\n  against Respondent was conducted by the sub-panel of the Commission on December \r\n  23, 1999. Respondent filed an answer, (3) but \r\n  was not present at the hearing. The sub-panel found Respondent \r\n  had committed attorney misconduct, in violation of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and Rule 7 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nEvidence considered at the hearing consisted of the testimony of Ms. McLeod and her boyfriend and all letters, motions, and other\r\ndocuments referred to in the Notice of Second Formal Charges.  Based on this evidence, the sub-panel found violations of numerous\r\nprovisions of Rule 407, particularly Rule 1.1 (competence), throughout Respondent's representation of Ms. McLeod. (4)  Generally,\r\nthe sub-panel found the Formal Charges against Respondent were supported by the evidence submitted.  The sub-panel noted, \"a\r\nseries of events, statements by Respondent, and exhibits submitted into evidence, raised serious concerns about his competence, his\r\nability to accurately grasp the issues, and his willingness to follow the rules of the court and the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe sub-panel found Respondent had violated Rule 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others) and Rule 8.4 (misconduct) on more\r\nthan one occasion:  (1) when he failed to disclose to his client the offers made to him on her behalf  and (2) when he demanded the\r\nDepartment of Commerce pay his client $35,000 ($25,000 for damage to her mobile home when moved and $10,000 for items lost\r\nin the move) without any factual basis for such a demand from his client.  Additionally, the sub-panel found Respondent had\r\nviolated the statutory provisions on barratry (5) and Rule 8.4 by soliciting Ms. McLeod's business over the telephone, as he had no\r\nprofessional relationship with her before he initiated contact by personal telephone call.\r\n\r\nThe sub-panel also found Respondent violated Rule 3.3 (false statement of fact made to a tribunal) in a letter to U.S. Magistrate\r\nJudge Seymour by describing Ms. McLeod's complaint letters as \"allegedly\" written by her.  Finally, the sub-panel found\r\nRespondent's retainer agreement with Ms. McLeod violated Rule 1.5 (fees).\r\n\r\n  From Rule 7 of Rule 413, Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, SCACR, the sub-panel found Respondent had violated \r\n  subsections (a)(1) (violating a rule of professional conduct), (a)(3) (knowingly \r\n  failing to respond to lawful demand from a disciplinary authority), and (a)(5) \r\n  (conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts \r\n  or legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to \r\n  practice). Based on this multitude of violations, the sub-panel recommended \r\n  indefinite suspension, but did not recommend that Respondent be responsible \r\n  for costs. After the filing of exceptions, the full panel adopted this recommendation \r\n  on February 21, 2000.\r\n\r\nThird Formal Charges\r\n\r\nThe third set of formal charges filed against Respondent stemmed from his representation of two clients: (1) Christopher\r\nHollowman (on various criminal charges) and (2) Sammy and Louise Abraham (in Mrs. Abraham's personal injury action).  Formal\r\nNotice of the charges was sent to Respondent on December 7, 1999, but Respondent never picked up the complaint and did not file\r\nan answer.  The Attorney General's Office filed an Affidavit of Default on January 27, 2000.  Pursuant to Rule 24 of Rule 413,\r\nSCACR, the charges were deemed admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Christopher Hollowman Matter:\r\n\r\n  (1) Incompetence\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Hollowman's mother hired Respondent to represent her son on several criminal charges related to an armed robbery. \r\nShe paid Respondent $100 towards a $1200 fee quoted by Respondent.  She never paid the balance of the fee.  On September 28,\r\n1995, Mr. Hollowman was found guilty of the charges and sentenced.  Instead of filing an appeal, Respondent filed a Motion for a\r\nNew Trial on October 5, 1995.  More than a year later, in December 1996, Respondent wrote Mr. Hollowman that he had filed a\r\nMotion for New Trial which the court was still considering.  Although Respondent failed to move to be relieved as counsel for Mr.\r\nHollowman, Respondent filed a document with the Clerk of Court for Florence County placing the Solicitor on notice that he should\r\nnot be notified if any of his clients were called to court.  Respondent stated he would not notify the client because his doctor would\r\nnot allow him to practice in General Sessions court.  \r\n\r\nIn April of 1997, Mr. Hollowman requested that a new attorney be appointed to represent him.  The Supreme Court responded by\r\nletter that Respondent was still counsel of record and a new attorney could not be appointed unless counsel of record was relieved. \r\nBy the end of the Commission's investigation, Respondent had yet to file a motion to be relieved as counsel or to file an appeal on\r\nbehalf of Mr. Hollowman.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (2) Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Charges\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Attorney General's Affidavit of Default, Notice of Formal Charges in this matter was sent to Respondent by\r\ncertified mail.  Respondent never picked up the charges from the post office and never replied to the Commission regarding this set\r\nof charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sammy and Louise Abraham Matter:\r\n\r\n   (1) Failure to Communicate\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abrahams filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that Respondent had failed to communicate with them regarding Mr.\r\nAbraham's loss of consortium claim.  Respondent settled Mrs. Abraham's personal injury claim and distributed the proceeds to her,\r\nbut never acted on Mr. Abraham's loss of consortium claim the Abrahams claimed they had hired him to pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (2) Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Charges\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was first notified of Louise Abraham's complaint on April 29, 1999.  Respondent initially replied, but ignored a\r\nsubpoena issued for Mrs. Abraham's file.  Respondent also failed to reply to the Notice of Full Investigation, despite its warning that\r\nfailure to respond could constitute independent grounds for disciplinary action.  Respondent did send the Commission notice of his\r\nnew address in Maryland during the course of the investigation, and all correspondence was sent to the address given.  According to\r\nthe Attorney General's Affidavit of Default, Notice of Formal Charges in this matter was sent to Respondent by certified mail. \r\nRespondent never picked up the charges from the post office and never replied to the Commission regarding this set of charges.\r\n\r\nSub-panel's Findings\r\n\r\nA hearing on the third formal charges was conducted before a sub-panel of the Commission on March 10, 2000.  Respondent was\r\npresent at the hearing although he never submitted an answer.  At the hearing, Respondent claimed an inability to defend himself for\r\nmental health reasons.  After the Commission denied Respondent's claim of inability to defend in other proceedings, (6) the sub-panel\r\nissued a report on April 25, 2000.  The sub-panel found him to be in default, but allowed Respondent to present evidence in\r\nmitigation.  Evidence presented to the sub-panel included Christopher Hollowman and the Abrahams' testimony and exhibits.\r\n\r\nAs to the Christopher Hollowman matter, the sub-panel \r\n  deemed the charges admitted and found Respondent to be in violation of various \r\n  sections of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407 and Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR. From Rule 413, SCACR, the sub-panel found Respondent violated Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (violating a rule of professional conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (refusal to respond \r\n  to an inquiry of a disciplinary authority), Rule 7(a)(5) (conduct demonstrating \r\n  unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath taken upon \r\n  admission to practice in this State).\r\n\r\nFrom Rule 407, SCACR, the sub-panel found Respondent violated Rule 1.2 (scope of representation) because he did not discuss the\r\nMotion for a New Trial sufficiently with his client; Rule 1.3 (diligence) because he failed to pursue his client's Motion for a New\r\nTrial; Rule 1.6 (terminating representation) because he did not take steps necessary to protect his client's interests prior to\r\nwithdrawing from the case by pursuing the Motion for a New Trial or by filing an appeal; and Rule 3.2 (expediting litigation)\r\nbecause he failed to take reasonable efforts to expedite his client's Motion for a New Trial.  \r\n\r\nAs to the Abraham matter, the sub-panel found Respondent \r\n  did not violate any of the Rules of Professional Conduct in the course \r\n  of his representation of the Abrahams, but did violate the rules by failing \r\n  to respond or cooperate with the investigation. Specifically, the sub-panel \r\n  concluded Respondent violated the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, Rules 7(a)(1) and 7(a)(3) for failing to respond to a lawful \r\n  demand by a disciplinary authority. The sub-panel recommended Respondent receive \r\n  indefinite suspension, to run concurrently with the sanction of indefinite suspension \r\n  already recommended. \r\n\r\nFourth Formal Charges\r\n\r\nThe fourth set of formal charges against Respondent stemmed from allegations that Respondent was practicing law after this Court\r\nissued an order transferring Respondent to incapacity inactive status.  During the disciplinary hearing on the third formal charges,\r\nRespondent maintained he was unable to defend himself due to mental incapacity.  On April 26, 2000, upon notification from Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel, this Court ordered Respondent be transferred to incapacity inactive status.  This Court appointed Steve\r\nWukela, Jr., Esquire to assume responsibility for Respondent's files.  This Court then remanded the matter to the Commission for a\r\ndetermination of the validity of Respondent's claim of inability to defend. \r\n\r\nIn response, a hearing panel of the Commission ordered initiation of Rule 28(b) proceedings, and appointed W. Haigh Porter as\r\nAttorney and Guardian ad Litem for Respondent.  The Commission ordered Dr. Geoffrey R. McKee to examine Respondent and to\r\nreport to the Commission regarding Respondent's mental status.  Despite numerous attempts by Mr. Porter to contact Respondent\r\nand to notify him of his scheduled examination with Dr. McKee and Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, Respondent never replied and did\r\nnot attend the scheduled examination.  Without any evidence of Respondent's mental condition, the Commission denied\r\nRespondent's claim of inability to defend and resumed the disciplinary proceedings against him.  On April 26, 2001, this Court\r\nordered Respondent to remain on incapacity inactive status until the completion of his disciplinary proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe fourth formal charges against Respondent were filed on February 6, 2001.  Respondent failed to respond to these formal charges\r\nas required.  Therefore, under Rule 24 of Rule 413, SCACR, the charges were deemed admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  Unauthorized Practice  \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent is licensed to practice law only by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.  As discussed, Respondent was transferred to\r\nincapacity inactive status by order of this Court on April 26, 2000.  An attorney in inactive status may not practice law.  Despite this,\r\nRespondent continued to practice law.\r\n\r\nBetween May 3, 2000 and August 10, 2000, Respondent sent at least six letters on law firm letterhead to the Clerk of Court for the\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The letters forwarded various motions, requests, and attorney affidavits,\r\nsigned by Respondent relating to litigation pending before that court. (7)  Beginning on June 9, 2000, Respondent's letters to the\r\nSecond Circuit were sent on Hardnett &amp; Associates (8) stationery.  \r\n\r\nAfter he was transferred to incapacity inactive status, Respondent continued to maintain a website (www.whjstolenart.com) bearing\r\nhis Silver Spring, Maryland and Florence, South Carolina addresses.  The website displayed the letterhead of Respondent's former\r\nlaw firm \"Gibbs &amp; Scott,\" and incorrectly identified Clifford Scott, Esquire as being associated with Respondent although their\r\nassociation ended two years before Respondent was placed on incapacity inactive status. (9)  The website chronicled the litigation in\r\nJohnson v. Smithsonian, et. al, characterizing the activities of the Smithsonian as fraud, and claiming the defendants were trying to\r\nforce Plaintiffs to abandon the case by driving them into bankruptcy.  To fund the litigation, Respondent solicited funds off the\r\nwebsite through the sale of a William H. Johnson video for $30.00 and a set of documents for $25.00.  The Commission charged\r\nsuch activity constituted the offense of barratry.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (2) False, Misleading, And/Or Outrageous Statements \r\n    in the Course of Litigation\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent made numerous false and/or misleading statements and  a multitude of outrageous allegations in motions, letters, and\r\naffidavits he submitted to the Second Circuit during the Johnson litigation.  Respondent made false statements of fact, including his\r\nclaim that opposing counsel, Peter Stern, offered him $30,000 and information which could \"sink\" the other defendant, the\r\nSmithsonian, in exchange for release of Stern's client.  Mr. Stern flatly denies ever making any offer to Respondent and claims to\r\nhave no such damaging information about the Smithsonian.  Respondent also claimed, in a Motion for Injunction filed in the Second\r\nCircuit, that Mr. James G. Bogle, Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General for South Carolina, had  offered to drop all disciplinary\r\ncharges against him in return for ten days of suspension.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Respondent accused United States District  Judge Constance Baker Motley of being involved in a criminal conspiracy\r\nwith opposing counsel, accused one of the defendants of murder on more than one occasion, and claimed that the disciplinary action\r\nbeing taken against him in this State was all part of the criminal conspiracy to conceal the theft of the Johnson artwork by the\r\ndefendants.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (3) Incompetent Representation\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent acted incompetently by filing suit in federal district court in an attempt to set aside a decision of the New York Supreme\r\nCourt.  The only appropriate course of action would have been to file an appeal in the New York appellate court as the federal\r\ndistrict court has no jurisdiction to review a decision by a state trial court.  Respondent never initiated any such appeal.  After the\r\nfederal district court dismissed the suit, Respondent acted incompetently by continuing to file frivolous motions, unsupported by the\r\nrecord or the facts, that resulted in undue burden, delay, and harassment of the defendants.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (4) Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Charges\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent received and accepted the Notice of Full Investigation in this matter by certified mail on April 5, 2000.  Respondent\r\nfailed to respond  to the Notice as required.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (5)  Improper Trust Account Activity  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Respondent was placed on incapacity inactive status, Mr. Wukela, appointed to protect his clients' interests, discovered\r\nongoing activity in an open trust account held by Respondent at BB&amp;T.  After this Court's order freezing all trust accounts,\r\nRespondent wrote three checks, totaling $2,947.50, to Barbara Gibbs and a fourth check to a mastercard account for over $900.00. \r\nTwo of the checks to Barbara Gibbs had the notation \"for Abraham Hearing\" and the third had the notation \"for MD-Jurisdiction.\" \r\nThe check to mastercard contained no reference to any client file.  Respondent did not reply to the Attorney General's request for\r\nmore information regarding the checks.\r\n\r\nSub-panel's Findings\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 2001, a third hearing was conducted \r\n  by a sub-panel of the Commission to address the fourth set of formal charges \r\n  against Respondent. Respondent failed to answer the charges and was not present \r\n  at the hearing. The sub-panel found Respondent to be in default and, under Rule \r\n  24, the allegations were deemed to be admitted. Based on the facts alleged and \r\n  deemed admitted, the sub-panel found Respondent violated Rules 7(a)(1), (3), \r\n  (5), and (6) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR. The sub-panel also found he violated Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.2 (scope \r\n  of representation), 3.1 (meritorious claims and contentions), 3.3 (candor toward \r\n  tribunal), 3.4 (fairness to opposing party and counsel), 4.1 (truthfulness in \r\n  statements to others), 5.5 (unauthorized practice of law), 8.1(b) (failing to \r\n  respond to lawful demand from disciplinary authority), and 8.4(a), (c), (d), \r\n  and (e) (misconduct) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR.\r\n\r\nThe sub-panel noted much of Respondent's conduct in this case, specifically the frivolous litigation and abuse of process, mirrored\r\nthe conduct for which Respondent had already, very recently been recommended for sanction.  The sub-panel went on to find\r\nRespondent guilty of the unauthorized practice of law, citing his  continued representation of Johnson and appearances in court after\r\nhe was placed on incapacity inactive status.  The sub-panel also found Respondent guilty of improper trust account activity, of\r\nfailing to cooperate with the attorney appointed to protect his clients interests, and of failing to respond to disciplinary charges.\r\n\r\nBased on these findings, the sub-panel recommended Respondent be disbarred.  The full panel adopted that recommendation in\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\n\r\nEmergency Petition for \r\n  Writ \r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2001, Respondent filed a document \r\n  with this Court entitled \"Emergency Petition for Writ.\" In this document, Respondent \r\n  takes exception with the panel's findings, arguing under his own version of \r\n  the facts and ignoring that many of the allegations against him were deemed \r\n  admitted because of his failure to respond. Although it is entitled \"Emergency \r\n  Petition for Writ,\" it appears to be no more than an exception to the panel's \r\n  findings, as defined in Rule 27(a) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR. Rule 27 provides: \"[w]ithin 30 days of the service of the hearing \r\n  panel report, disciplinary counsel and/or respondent may serve and file a brief \r\n  setting forth and arguing any exceptions taken to the findings, conclusions, \r\n  or recommendations made by the hearing panel.\" Respondent requests that this \r\n  Court find him incompetent, and goes on to argue both the merits of the charges \r\n  against him and the merits of the Johnson litigation, apparently in \r\n  hopes that this Court will intervene to stop what he deems to be a \"criminal \r\n  conspiracy.\" Additionally, Respondent requests that this Court intervene in \r\n  a declaratory action for a fee that Respondent claims the Bryan, Bahnmuller, \r\n  Goldman, &amp; McElveen law firm owes him. \r\n\r\nWe address his requests in reverse order. First, \r\n  we decline to address the litigation between Respondent and the Bryan, Bahnmuller, \r\n  Goldman, &amp; McElveen law firm as the matter is properly pending before the \r\n  circuit court. Similarly, we decline to act on Respondent's allegations of criminal \r\n  conspiracy involving the Johnson litigation, as we have no jurisdiction \r\n  to interfere with a matter pending in federal court. Second, we believe Respondent's \r\n  \"Petition\" is subject to the procedural rules for filing exceptions provided \r\n  in Rule 27, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  Under Rule 27, Respondent did not file his exceptions within the 30 days allotted. \r\n  The full panel's report was certified to the Supreme Court on October 12, 2001, \r\n  and Respondent's exceptions were not filed until more than two months later. \r\n  Therefore, we decline to consider Respondent's exceptions to the Commission's \r\n  findings below. \r\n\r\nFinally, we find Respondent's claim that this Court \r\n  declare him incompetent for purposes of these proceedings comes too late. When \r\n  he claimed he was unable to defend himself at the disciplinary hearing on the \r\n  third formal charges in March 2000, the Commission properly initiated proceedings \r\n  to determine capacity under Rule 28 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Action, Rule 413, SCACR. Haigh Porter, Esquire was appointed as attorney \r\n  and guardian ad Litem for Respondent and a psychiatric evaluation for \r\n  Respondent was scheduled with Dr. McKee and Dr. Schwartz-Watts. Respondent failed \r\n  to attend the evaluation or to communicate with the attorney appointed to represent \r\n  him. This Court immediately placed Respondent on incapacity inactive status \r\n  pursuant to Rule 28(d) and did not reinstate him despite the Commission's finding \r\n  that Respondent was capable of assisting in his defense. Under Rule 28(d)(1), \r\n  such a finding by the Commission is interlocutory and may not be appealed before \r\n  entry of a final order in the proceeding. \r\n\r\n  In support of his contention that he is unable to assist in his own defense, Respondent has submitted a report from the Department\r\nof Labor stating he is not capable of practicing law.  This report does not address, however, whether Respondent is incapable of\r\nunderstanding the charges against him and thus is unable to assist in his own defense.  Based on the Commission's Rule 28 finding\r\nbelow, and on Respondent's appearance before this Court, we find Respondent is able to assist in his own defense.  Respondent\r\ngave an articulate presentation of his point of view when he appeared before this Court, illustrating a detailed knowledge of the facts\r\nand memory of the events at issue.   Respondent stated he has not sought medical treatment since the death of his former psychiatrist\r\nin 1999, and he failed to attend the psychiatric evaluation scheduled by the Commission pursuant to Rule 28.  We affirm the\r\nCommission's finding that Respondent is able to assist in his defense in this attorney disciplinary matter.\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nThis Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by a panel's recommendation.  In re Larkin,\r\n336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).  The authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is given rests\r\nentirely with this Court.  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).  The sanction of disbarment has been imposed by this\r\nCourt in similar cases involving multiple acts of misconduct.  See, e.g., In re Morris, 343 S.C. 651, 541 S.E.2d 844 (accepting\r\nAgreement for Discipline by Consent to disbar for failure for failing to act with reasonable competence or diligence in\r\nrepresentation of clients, failure to keep clients informed, failure to safeguard property of clients, and allowing non-lawyer assistant\r\nto engage in unauthorized practice of law (among other violations)); In re Huskey, 342 S.C. 409, 537 S.E.2d 276 (2000) (disbarring\r\nattorney for failure to act with diligence and promptness in representing clients, failure to keep clients informed, failure to maintain\r\nclients' funds separate from his own, and failure to promptly deliver funds); In re Godbold, 336 S.C. 568, 521 S.E.2d 160 (1999)\r\n(disbarring attorney for failing to remit settlement funds to clients, failing to remit settlement funds to clients' medical providers,\r\nfailing to pay bills, and failing to file state and federal tax returns); In re Glee, 333 S.C. 9, 507 S.E.2d 326 (1998) (disbarring\r\nattorney for converting client funds for his own purposes, failing to provide competent representation, failing to comply with\r\ndemand for payment, and failing to act with reasonable diligence); Matter of Smith, 310 S.C. 449, 427 S.E.2d 634 (1992) (disbarring\r\nattorney for commingling client funds with personal and office funds, committing criminal acts reflecting adversely on his fitness as\r\na lawyer, failing to cooperate with the investigation, and engaging in unauthorized practice of law).\r\n\r\nThe gravity of Respondent's numerous incidences of misconduct, including his flagrant unauthorized practice of law, failure to\r\nprovide competent representation on so many occasions, repeated failure to respond to the disciplinary charges against him, failure\r\nto cooperate with the attorney appointed to protect his clients' interests, lack of candor to the tribunal and to his own clients, and\r\nimproper use of client trust account funds, more than justifies the full panel's recommendation for disbarment.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we adopt the full panel's recommendation for disbarment and deny Respondent's Emergency Petition for\r\nWrit.  Additionally, we affirm the Commission's denial of Respondent's claim of inability to defend.  DISBARRED.\r\n\r\ns/Jean H. Toal C.J.\r\n\r\ns/James E. Moore J.\r\n\r\ns/John H. Waller, Jr. J.\r\n\r\ns/E.C. Burnett, III J.\r\n\r\ns/Costa M. Pleicones J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The hearing on the Patricia McDaniel Matter was heard in conjunction with the hearing on the second set of formal charges\r\nagainst Respondent.  The sub-panel's ultimate recommendation for discipline (indefinite suspension) was based on these and the\r\nsecond set of formal charges discussed below.\r\n2. The URA was inapplicable to Ms. McLeod because she was not a displaced person under the statute, and Respondent failed to\r\nfirst exhaust administrative remedies with HUD as required under the URA.\r\n3. In response to the filing \r\n  of formal charges, Respondent sent a letter, after thirty days had expired, \r\n  to Ms. Hinson at the Commission in which he answered True, False, or N/A to \r\n  the charges against him without further explanation. The Attorney General's \r\n  office filed a Motion to Strike and requested Default Judgment be entered because \r\n  Respondent's responses did not conform to the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure applicable in lawyer discipline cases pursuant to Rule 9 of Rules \r\n  of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. Respondent opposed \r\n  the motion. The Commission ordered that Respondent make more definite replies \r\n  to those questions he answered \"N/A\" and that Respondent's False answers would \r\n  be interpreted as denied unless he clarified them further. Respondent did not \r\n  clarify any of his answers in response to the Commission's Order. \r\n4. Specifically, the sub-panel cited Respondent's failure to advise his client to accept offers for relocation and rent assistance as a\r\nbasis for finding violation of Rule 1.1.  In general, the sub-panel noted that the frivolous motions and the overall manner in which\r\nthe litigation was pursued by Respondent, viewed cumulatively, amounted to violations of Rule 1.1.\r\n5. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-10 (Supp. 2001).\r\n6. Respondent's claim and the proceedings initiated as a result are discussed in the next section.\r\n7. Respondent represented the heirs of the South Carolina artist, William H. Johnson, in James H. Johnson, Individually and as\r\nPersonal Representative of the Distributees of the Estate of William H. Johnson, Deceased v. The Smithsonian Institution and\r\nMichael Rosenfeld Gallery, Inc. to recover works of Johnson's art they claimed were stolen by the Smithsonian and the Michael\r\nRosenfeld Gallery in a criminal conspiracy.  Respondent was admitted pro hac vice in the United States District Court in New York,\r\nbut that court  revoked his pro hac vice status on May 18, 2000, after Respondent was placed on incapacity inactive status by this\r\nCourt.\r\n8. After being placed on incapacity inactive status, Respondent claimed to have associated himself with this Maryland law firm\r\nalthough he was not licensed to practice law in Maryland and never sought pro hac vice admission in Maryland.\r\n9. As of February 1, 2002, this website was in operation, displaying the same Gibbs &amp; Scott letterhead and referring to M. Eugene\r\nGibbs, Esquire  as the Johnson family attorney.

If the roads and other common elements transferred to the property owners association on March 20, 1998, were defective at the time of the transfer, what is the\r\nextent of Georgia-Pacific Corporation's or any of its subsidiary corporations' liability to the property owners association at this time?\r\n\r\n2. If the roads and other common elements transferred to the property owners association on March 20, 1998, were defective at the time of the transfer, what is the\r\nextent of Allan Feker doing business as U.S. Residential Golf Properties' and Dunes West Residential Golf Properties' liability to the property owners association\r\nat this time?\r\n\r\n3. During the period of time that the developer has control of the property owners association what is the developer's obligation to maintain the roads and other\r\ncommon areas of Dunes West?\r\n\r\n4. When control of the property owners association passes to the Dunes West property owners, what are Georgia-Pacific Corporation's or any of its subsidiary\r\ncorporations' obligations as to the condition of said roads and other common elements at the time of said transfer? \r\n\r\n5. When control of the property owners association passes to the Dunes West property owners, what are Allan Feker doing business as U.S. Residential Golf\r\nProperties' and Dunes West Residential Golf Properties' obligations as to the condition of said roads and other common elements at the time of said transfer?\r\n\r\nWe are confident that the answer we set forth to question 1 will provide the district court with sufficient guidance on the issues before that court and confine this\r\nopinion to an examination of that question.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWe summarize the district court's findings of fact as follows:  A subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation executed an agreement with Wild Dunes Associates\r\nfor the purpose of developing a planned unit development (\"PUD\") located in Charleston County.  Pursuant to the agreement, Georgia-Pacific Corporation\r\nconveyed 4,325 acres to the developers.  In 1991, the developers recorded the declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions for the development.  All new\r\nlots or tracts of land in the PUD were subject to the covenants.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, a second wholly-owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation purchased the interest of Wild Dunes Associates in the development venture. \r\nThe two Georgia-Pacific Corporation subsidiaries continued to develop the residential property.\r\n\r\nEagle Creek Construction Company (\"Eagle Creek\") constructed the roads and drainage systems in the early phases of the development.  Eagle Creek completed\r\nconstruction in 1991.  In 1993, the developers discovered defects in the roads constructed by Eagle Creek, and filed a lawsuit against Eagle Creek to recover the\r\ncosts to repair the roads.  While the lawsuit against Eagle Creek was pending, the developers hired engineers to design repair plans for the defective roads. \r\nBetween 1994 and 1996, the developers spent more than one million-one hundred thousand ($1,100,000) dollars repairing the roads.\r\n\r\nAfter settling its lawsuit against Eagle Creek, the developers learned that significant additional road and drainage repairs were needed within the development.\r\n\r\nOnly one week after discovering that the roads were in further need of repair, and prior to the completion of any further repairs, the developers entered into an\r\nAsset Purchase Agreement for the sale of all remaining undeveloped portions of the property to a buyer named Allan Feker (\"Feker\").\r\n\r\nPrior to consummating the sale of the undeveloped portions of the PUD to Feker, the developers executed a deed conveying the roads and other common areas\r\nwithin the development to the Dunes West Property Owners Association (\"POA\"). (1)  Pursuant to the recorded covenants, the POA was responsible for\r\nmaintaining all common areas within the PUD. \r\n\r\nFeker assigned his rights under the Asset Purchase Agreement to his corporation, Dunes West Residential Golf Properties, Inc., (\"DWRGP\").  DWRGP took title\r\nto the undeveloped property and became the new developer of the PUD.  DWRGP has continued to develop Dunes West and sell lots and tracts of land.\r\n\r\nIn litigation before the district court, the Concerned Dunes West Residents are proceeding in a derivative capacity on behalf of the POA and seeking to recover the\r\ncost to repair the roads and other common areas from Georgia-Pacific Corporation as the previous developer, and Allan Feker doing business as U. S. Residential\r\nGolf Properties as successor developer.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the roads and other common elements transferred to the POA on March 20, 1998, were defective at the time of the transfer, what is the extent of Georgia-Pacific\r\nCorporation's or any of its subsidiary corporations' liability to the POA at this time?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn Goddard v. Fairways Dev. Gen. Partn., \r\n  310 S.C. 408, 426 S.E.2d 828 (Ct. App. 1993), the Court of Appeals held that \r\n  the developer of a planned unit development (\"PUD\") owes a fiduciary duty to \r\n  the property owners association and its members, much like that owed by promoters \r\n  of a corporation to investors. As such, the developer has a responsibility to \r\n  insure that the common areas are in good repair at the time they are conveyed \r\n  to the property owners association or to provide the association with funds \r\n  sufficient to effectuate any needed repairs to those areas. Id. at 414, 426 \r\n  S.E.2d at 832.\r\n\r\nThe facts of Goddard are similar to those \r\n  in the instant dispute. In Goddard, Fairways Development General Partnership \r\n  began developing a PUD, with plans to build approximately 90 units. The PUD \r\n  was governed by recorded covenants and restrictions. The covenants called for \r\n  the formation of the Fairway Villas Homeowners Association, with mandatory membership \r\n  for all unit owners. The homeowners association owned the common areas within \r\n  the development, and was responsible for maintaining these areas. Funding for \r\n  the homeowners association was accomplished through assessments against each \r\n  unit. The homeowners association was organized to grant the developer control \r\n  over the association until nearly all the lots within the PUD had been developed \r\n  and sold. Further, the developer had the unilateral ability to determine assessments \r\n  against individual owners while the developer was not required to pay assessments.\r\n\r\nAfter selling five residential units, the developer transferred ownership of the common areas to the homeowners association.  Practically, the five property owners\r\nwere burdened with maintaining all common areas.  After it became apparent that the assessments generated by these five property owners were insufficient to\r\nmaintain the common areas, the individual property owners brought suit against the developer and the homeowners association seeking relief on a number of\r\ngrounds.  The homeowners argued, inter alia, that the developer had a responsibility to insure that the common areas were in good repair at the time they were\r\nconveyed to the homeowners association and that the association had sufficient funds to maintain the common areas.  The Court of Appeals stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the case of Duncan v. Brookview House, \r\n    Inc., 262 S.C. 449, 205 S.E.2d 707 (1974), our Supreme Court held that \r\n    the promoters of a corporation are fiduciaries to each other and to the corporation \r\n    they are creating. Id. at 456, 205 S.E.2d at 710. Here, we think there is \r\n    a corollary between the promoters of a corporation and the developers of a \r\n    PUD. Both are entrusted by interested investors to bring about a viable organization \r\n    to serve a specific function. Both should be expected to use good judgment \r\n    and act in utmost good faith to complete the formation of their organizations.\r\n\r\nWhile the evidence shows the Developer provided some maintenance of the common areas at its own expense until it belatedly organized the Association, there is\r\nevidence that the common areas were substandard at the time the Developer turned them over to the Association.  There is also some evidence the Developer\r\nseized the opportunity in 1987 to \"unload\" the common areas on the Association without a plan to establish a reserve or a plan to fund the Association until such\r\ntime as assessments were adequate to cover maintenance expenses.  It seems unfair to the villa owners for the Developer to burden them with substandard or\r\ndeteriorated common areas that required an immediate expenditure of funds to bring them up to standard without a plan or a reserve fund to cover the\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoddard, at 414-16, 426 S.E.2d at 832-33 \r\n  (internal citations omitted). (2)  \r\n\r\nThe district court in this case was aware of Goddard, \r\n  but expressed doubt as to whether Goddard accurately reflected the law \r\n  of this state. We hold today that it does: The developer of a PUD owes a duty \r\n  to the POA to turn over common areas that are not substandard and that are in \r\n  good repair. Failure to do so subjects the developer to liability for bringing \r\n  the common areas up to standard. (3)\r\n\r\nThe appellate courts of Illinois have reached a \r\n  similar conclusion when addressing condominium developers' obligations to property \r\n  owners associations taxed with maintaining common areas. For example, in Maercker \r\n  Point Villas Condo. Assoc. v. Szymski, 655 N.E.2d 1192 (Ill. App. 1995), \r\n  the court held that a condominium developer stood in a fiduciary relationship \r\n  to the owners association. As a fiduciary, the developer \"had the duty not to \r\n  hinder 'the ability of the corporation [i.e., the owners association] to continue \r\n  the business for which it was developed.'\" Id. at 1194. The court found that \r\n  by leaving the association underfunded at the time the developer relinquished \r\n  control of the association's board of directors, the developer violated his \r\n  fiduciary duty. See also  Board of Managers of Weathersfield Condo. \r\n  Assoc. v. Schaumburg Ltd. Part., 717 N.E.2d 429 (Ill. App. 1999) (developer \r\n  of condominium had fiduciary duty to adequately fund owners association for \r\n  maintenance/repair of common areas). (4)\r\n\r\nWhile Maercker addressed condominium developers' \r\n  duties to condominium owners associations, the Illinois Court of Appeals, relying \r\n  on Maercker, found that a fiduciary duty to adequately fund reserves \r\n  likewise runs from the developer of a townhome project to the townhome owners \r\n  association. Seven Bridges Court Assoc. v. Seven Bridges Development, Inc., \r\n  714 N.E.2d 601 (Ill. App. 1999). However, the public policy of Illinois does \r\n  not preclude the developer from contractually limiting its fiduciary duty to \r\n  adequately fund the association with a reserve account by including unambiguous \r\n  language to that effect in the declaration of covenants and restrictions. Id. \r\n  at 606.\r\n\r\nOther courts have recognized a POA's right to maintain \r\n  a cause of action against the developer for defects in the construction of common \r\n  areas. See e.g., Strathmore Gate-East at Lake St. George Homeowners' \r\n  Assoc., Inc. v. Levitt Homes, Inc., 537 So.2d 657 (Fla. Dist. App. 1989) \r\n  (homeowners association, as owner of common areas taxed with the burden of maintaining \r\n  the common areas, could maintain a cause of action against developer for defects \r\n  in the construction of the common areas).\r\n\r\nIn Orange Grove Terrace Owners Assoc. v. Bryant \r\n  Properties, Inc., 222 Cal. Rptr. 523 (Cal. App. 1986), the issue before \r\n  the court was \"whether a homeowners association has a cause of action for damages \r\n  to the common areas of a condominium project caused by negligent acts or omissions \r\n  of the developer occurring prior to formal organization of the association.\" \r\n  Id. at 524. Finding for the plaintiff/homeowners association, the court \r\n  observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [t]he record shows that the defendants' work was substantially accomplished prior to formal organization of the homeowners' association provided for in the\r\ncovenants, conditions and restrictions . . . and, therefore, before the Association assumed its management duties with respect to the common areas.  The timing of\r\nthe Association's organization was a matter wholly within the control of the defendants, who could readily foresee that the Association, which was obligated by\r\nthe covenants and conditions promulgated by defendants to maintain and repair the common areas, and to assess the condominium owners sums sufficient for that\r\npurpose, would be damaged by an injury to the common areas caused by the defendants' negligence in undertaking repairs in the course of the condominium\r\nconversion.  A developer may not make decisions for the Association that benefit its own interest at the expense of the association and its members.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 526 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nWhile the cases cited above have employed different \r\n  means, (5) they accomplish the same end: That \r\n  is, developers are held responsible for the condition of the common areas at \r\n  the time these areas are deeded to the POA. If these areas are not in good repair \r\n  at the time of conveyance, the developer is liable for the costs of repairs. \r\n  Goddard is consistent with this result.\r\n\r\nUnder the facts certified to this Court, Goddard \r\n  required the developer to ensure that the roads and other common areas were \r\n  in good repair at the time ownership of the common areas was transferred to \r\n  the POA, or, in the alternative, to provide the POA with sufficient funds to \r\n  bring these common areas up to standard as of the date of transfer. That is \r\n  to say, the developer has a fiduciary duty to the POA to transfer common areas \r\n  that are in good repair; if the developer transfers substandard common areas, \r\n  the developer must, at the time of transfer, provide the POA with the funds \r\n  necessary to bring the common areas up to a standard of reasonably good repair. \r\n  The developer who breaches this duty, by transferring common areas that are \r\n  not in reasonably good repair and without the funds necessary to bring the common \r\n  areas up to standard, is liable to the POA for all damages proximately flowing \r\n  from the breach, including damages for the continued deterioration of these \r\n  areas.\r\n\r\nREMAINING QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nQuestion 3 asks:\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period of time that the developer has control of the property owners association what is the developer's obligation to maintain the roads and other\r\ncommon areas of Dunes West?\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Dunes West, recorded on September 18, 1989, maintenance of the roads and common\r\nareas within Dunes West is the sole responsibility of the POA.   Funding for such maintenance is accomplished through annual and special assessments, in an\r\namount determined by the POA, levied against property owners.  Lots owned by the developer are exempt from paying assessments.  However, during the period\r\nof time the developer exerts de facto control over the POA, the developer is responsible for making up all shortfalls in the POA's operating budget up to an\r\namount equal to the assessments which would have been generated by the property owned by the developer were this property subject to assessments.\r\n\r\nThus, question 3 is answered by reference to the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Dunes West.  Assuming the district court questions the\r\nvalidity and enforceability of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Dunes West against the POA or individual property owners, we\r\ndecline to express an opinion on that issue because it does not involve a novel question of state law.\r\n\r\nAs to question 2, any liability of Allan Feker, U. S. Residential Golf Properties, or DWRGP arising from the condition of the common areas on the date the\r\ncommon areas were transferred to the POA arises by operation of contracts between the original developers and Allan Feker, or U. S. Residential Golf Properties,\r\nor DWRGP.  The issue involves no novel question of law, and we therefore decline to answer question 2.\r\n\r\nQuestions 4 and 5 assume a dispute which may never \r\n  arise. We decline to answer those questions. See Sangamo Weston, Inc. \r\n  v. National Sur. Corp., 307 S.C. 143, 414 S.E.2d 127 (1992) (even when answering \r\n  questions on certification, this Court will not issue advisory opinions nor \r\n  alter precedent based on questions presented in the abstract). \r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. The POA consists of all property owners within the PUD.  The owners are charged an annual assessment to be used to maintain the common areas.  The\r\nrecorded covenants grant the developers de facto control over the POA, and provide that any property owned by the developers is exempt from assessments. \r\nHowever, if assessments against property owners are insufficient to maintain the roads and other common areas, the covenants require the developers to make up\r\nany shortfall.  The developers' liability is limited to the assessments generated by property owned by the developers were this property subject to assessments. \r\n2. Neither party in Goddard \r\n  petitioned this Court for writ of certiorari. \r\n3. At least one court has agreed \r\n  with this premise and cited Goddard approvingly. See Chesus \r\n  v. Watts, 967 S.W.2d 97 (Mo. App. 1998). \r\n4. Illinois law provides by \r\n  statute that a condominium developer must \"pay a proportionate share of the \r\n  common expenses for each unit which has not been sold by such developer. The \r\n  proportionate share shall be in the same ratio as the percentage of ownership \r\n  in the common elements set forth in the Declaration.\" 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Â§ \r\n  605/9(a) (1992). The court in Maercker, supra, indicated this section did not \r\n  create new legal obligations, but merely codified or clarified preexisting law. \r\n  See Maercker, 655 N.E. 2d at 1194; see also Board of Managers of Weathersfield \r\n  Condo. Assoc., supra, 717 N.E.2d at 434. \r\n5. For example, Goddard \r\n  and two of the Illinois cases hold that the developer is a fiduciary to the \r\n  property owners association, and as such must establish adequate reserves to \r\n  perform its obligations under the covenants. Courts in Florida and California \r\n  permitted property owners associations to maintain causes of action against \r\n  developers for the developers' negligence in constructing or repairing the common \r\n  areas; the California court allowed the association to pursue damages arising \r\n  before the association's formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25454","title":"Faulkenberry v.

(Railroad) operates its railroad.  The circuit court ruled the property in question is owned by Respondent, J.\r\nLarry Faulkenberry.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no dispute as to the underlying facts in this matter.  Railroad's track bisects Faulkenberry's 200 acre piece of property, leaving approximately 97 acres on\r\nthe western side of the tracks, which abut the Broad River.  Railroad seeks to prevent Faulkenberry from using a crossing over the tracks. \r\n\r\nRailroad claims title to the property pursuant to an 1845 Act which created its predecessor in interest, the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company.\r\nFaulkenberry claims title under the last known recorded instrument of record in the chain of title for the property on both sides of the tracks.  Title records prior to\r\n1865 do not exist as they were burned by General Sherman in 1865 during the Civil War.  Railroad does not dispute that Faulkenberry owns the property to the\r\neast and west of the railroad tracks in fee simple.  The only issue is what right or title each party has to the strip of land encompassed by the railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, was formed pursuant to 1845 Act No. 2953 (Act). (1)  Sections 9-12 of the 1845 Act set forth Railroad's powers\r\nwith respect to acquisition of property upon which to operate.  Those sections provide, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n9.  That [Railroad] shall have power and capacity to purchase, take and hold in fee simple or for years, to them and their successors, any lands, tenements or\r\nhereditaments, . . . and in like manner to purchase all private rights of way or water courses that may lie on or across the route through which the said Railroad\r\nmay pass. . . \r\n\r\n10.  That in any case where lands or private rights of way may be required . . . and the same cannot be purchased from the owner . . . for want of agreement as to\r\nprice or from any other cause, the same may be taken by the Company at a valuation to be made by the Commissioners. . . appointed by the Court of Common\r\nPleas. . . . and the lands and right of way so valued by the Commissioners. . . shall vest in the said Company in fee simple, so soon as the valuation thereof may\r\nbe paid, or tendered and refused. . . . \r\n\r\n11.  That in the absence of any written contract between the said Company and the owner . . . of land, through which the said Railroad may be constructed . . . it\r\nshall be presumed that the land upon which the said Railroad may be constructed, together with one hundred feet on each side of the center of said road, has\r\nbeen granted to the said Company by the owner. . . and the said Company shall have good right and title to the same, (and shall have, hold and enjoy the\r\nsame) unto them and their successors, so long as the same may be used only for the purposes of the said road and no longer, unless the person or persons to\r\nwhom any right or title to such lands, tenements or hereditaments descend or come, shall prosecute the same within two years next after the construction of such\r\npart or portion of the said road as may be constructed upon the land of the said person or persons so having or acquiring such right to the title as aforesaid, and if\r\nany person or persons to whom any right or title to such lands. . . belong. . . do not prosecute the same within two years next after the construction of the\r\npart of the said road upon the lands of the person or persons so having or acquiring such right or title as aforesaid, then he or they, and all claiming under him or\r\nthem shall be forever barred to recover the same. . .\r\n\r\n12.  That all lands not heretofore granted to any person nor appropriated by law to the use of the State, within one mile from the centre from the main track of the\r\nsaid road that may be constructed, be, and they are hereby vested in the said Company and their successors, so long as the same may be used for the purposes of\r\nthe said road and no longer.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Railroad acquired the land used for its tracks  pursuant to Section 11, above.  The circuit court, pursuant to numerous cases of this Court,\r\nheld Railroad acquired only an easement to use the tracks, rather than a fee simple determinable, and that, in any event, Faulkenberry was entitled to an easement\r\nby necessity. (2)    \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid Railroad acquire a fee simple determinable in the land occupied by the tracks by virtue of section 11 of 1845 Act No. 2593?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted above, Railroad acquired its interest in the land at issue under section 11 of the 1845 Charter, which granted to it and its successors \"good right and title .\r\n. . so long as the same may be used only for the purposes of the said road and no longer.\"  The Act required the person having title to prosecute for compensation \r\nwithin two years or be forever barred to recover the same.  At issue is whether this language granted a fee simple determinable estate in the property, or whether it\r\nmerely created an easement.  \r\n\r\nRailroad correctly points out that \"so long as\" \r\n  language in a deed is generally held to create a \"fee simple determinable\" estate. \r\n  See Purvis v. McElveen, 234 S.C. 94, 98-99, 106 S.E.2d 913, 915 \r\n  (1959) (fee simple determinable is an estate in fee with a qualification annexed \r\n  to it). See&nbsp;also 28 Am. Jur.2d Estates Â§ 28 (1966)(an \r\n  estate in fee simple is created by any limitation which 1) creates an estate \r\n  in fee simple and 2) provides the estate shall automatically expire upon the \r\n  occurrence of the stated event). \r\n\r\nAlthough use of a qualification ( \"so long as,\" \"until,\" or \"during\") is generally used to indicate a determinable estate, it does not necessarily indicate a grant is in\r\nfee. (3)  Notably, in 1868, the General Assembly enacted 1868 Act No. 43, Â§ 7, providing that, upon payment of compensation, \"the right of way over said lands. . .\r\nshall vest in [Railroad]. . . so long as the same shall be used for such highway, and no longer; but the fee in such lands . . . shall remain in the owner thereof. . .\" \r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Clearly, under 1868 Act No. 43, Â§ 7, the interest created is an easement, rather than a fee simple determinable, notwithstanding use of the\r\nphrase \"so long as.\" (4)  Accordingly, we find use of the phrase \"so long as\" does not necessitate a finding of a fee simple determinable\r\nestate. \r\n\r\nBoth this Court and the Court of Appeals have held \r\n  the language of section 11 granted only an easement to Railroad. Waring v. \r\n  Cheraw and Darlington Ry., 16 S.C. 416 (1882); Ragsdale v. Southern Ry. \r\n  Co., 60 S.C. 381, 38 S.E. 609 (1901); Southern Ry. v. Beaudrot, 63 \r\n  S.C. 266, 41 S.E. 299 (1902); Hill v. Southern Ry., 67 S.C. 548, 46 S.E. \r\n  486 (1903)(recognizing Railroad acquired only a right of way under 1837 charter); \r\n   Harman v. Southern Ry., 72 S.C. 228, 51 S.E. 689(1905); Southern \r\n  Ry. v. Gossett, 79 S.C. 372, 60 S.E. 956 (1908); Boney v. Cornwell, \r\n  117 S.C. 426, 109 S.E. 271 (1921); Eldridge v. Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\nRailroad asserts all of these cases were wrongly \r\n  decided based upon an erroneous reading of Justice Wardlaw's dissent in the \r\n  \"seminal\" case of Lewis v. Wilmington and Manchester R.R. Co., 45 S.C.L. \r\n  (11 Rich.) 91 (1857), and upon an erroneous retroactive application of the 1868 \r\n  Constitution and/or 1868 Act No. 43, Â§ 7. (5) \r\n  We disagree. \r\n\r\nLewis construed an 1846 Charter containing \r\n  provisions virtually identical to those in the 1845 Charter in question. There, \r\n  the plaintiff had purchased a tract of land from the prior owner after the railroad \r\n  had already been constructed. The Court construed a portion of the Charter which \r\n  barred recovery \"unless the person . . . owning the said land at the time that \r\n  the part of the said road which may be on the said land was finished, or those \r\n  claiming under him . . . shall apply for an assessment of the value . . . within \r\n  ten years .\" A majority of the Court held Lewis could claim no right to an assessment, \r\n  as that right was provided for \"him who is the owner at the time the road is \r\n  finished. It is not the land but the right to compensation that is involved \r\n  in this controversy.\" The Lewis majority went on to state, however, that \r\n  \"[t]he land or right of way is vested in the company in fee simple as \r\n  soon as the valuation is paid . . . and if application for an assessment \r\n  is not made within ten years after the completion of the road, the owner \r\n  is forever barred from recovering the land or having an assessment, which manifests \r\n  the intention of the Legislature to divest the owner's title.\" 11 Rich \r\n  at 94. (Emphasis mine). Justice Wardlaw dissented. Under his construction of \r\n  the applicable sections of the 1846 charter, if the vendee (Lewis) permitted \r\n  the railroad to utilize the land for ten years without complaint, then the land \r\n  \"would become subject to the Company's right to enjoy the slip occupied by them, \r\n  so long as they continued to use it for their road, and no longer; - but if \r\n  compensation should be claimed and paid, the fee simple absolute would thereby \r\n  be vested in the company.\" Id. at 95. \r\n\r\nRailroad contends the opinions of this Court and \r\n  the Court of Appeals, subsequent to Lewis, have misconstrued Justice \r\n  Wardlaw's dissent as indicating that only an easement was created, when in fact, \r\n  Justice Wardlaw's dissent actually reflects a fee simple determinable. We disagree. \r\n  Initially, we find Justice Wardlaw's dissent could be read as finding either \r\n  an easement or a fee simple determinable. Moreover, we do not read subsequent \r\n  case law as relying solely upon Justice Wardlaw's dissent. \r\n\r\nIn Ragsdale v. Southern Ry. Co., 60 S.C. \r\n  381, 38 S.E. 609 (1901), the Court construed a Charter to the Spartanburg and \r\n  Union Railroad which had provisions identical to those of sections 9, 10 and \r\n  11 above. The Court noted that, under sections 9 and 10, the Legislature had \r\n  specifically provided that land taken by and paid for by the railroad would \r\n  vest in fee simple. However, the Court noted that no such words were used in \r\n  section 11, which provided only that the company shall have \"good right and \r\n  title. . . so long as the same may be used only for the purpose of said road.\" \r\n  The Ragsdale Court, after citing Justice Wardlaw's dissent in Lewis, \r\n  concluded \"[t]he legislature wisely made a distinction in the tenure by which \r\n  the railroad company held the land when it was under one or the other of said \r\n  sections. Having reached the conclusion that the rights of the parties are different \r\n  under the foregoing sections, . . . [o]ur interpretation of the foregoing sections \r\n  is that the railroad company acquired only a right of way over the land described \r\n  in the complaint.\" 60 S.C. at ___,38 S.E. at 612. Although Ragsdale \r\n  cited Justice Wardlaw's dissent in Lewis, it is patent that the primary \r\n  rationale for the holding in Ragsdale is the discrepancy between the legislature's \r\n  specific grant of a fee simple in sections 9 and 10 of the 1845 Charter, and \r\n  the lack of such a specific grant in section 11. Moreover, several subsequent \r\n  cases relied upon Ragsdale to find an easement. See Southern \r\n  Ry. v. Beaudrot, 63 S.C. 266, 41 S.E. 299 (1902)(citing Ragsdale, \r\n  court concluded it may be conceded railroad obtained only a right of way); Southern \r\n  Ry. v. Gossett, 79 S.C. 372, 60 S.E. 956 (1908)(citing Beaudrot for \r\n  proposition that railroad only obtained easement under 1845 charter); Boney \r\n  v. Cornwell, 117 S.C. 426, 109 S.E. 271 (1921)(under 1848 charter, railroad \r\n  acquired only an easement, and not a fee simple defeasible title; court cited \r\n  Ragsdale for proposition that easement right of way rather than fee was \r\n  created). See&nbsp;also Hill v. Southern Ry., 67 S.C. 548, \r\n  46 S.E. 486 (1903)(recognizing railroad acquired only a right of way under 1837 \r\n  charter);  Harman v. Southern Ry., 72 S.C. 228, 51 S.E. 689(1905)(court \r\n  construed deed from grantor as granting an easement, noting the right of way \r\n  obtained was same as that it would have acquired had it been obtained pursuant \r\n  to the statutory grant under section 11 of the 1845 charter).\r\n\r\nMost recently, in Eldridge v. Greenwood, \r\n  331 S.C. 398, 503 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 1998), the Court of Appeals addressed \r\n  the interest acquired by railroad where it obtained property in three different \r\n  manners: 1) by statutory grant under section 11 of its 1845 Charter, 2) through \r\n  condemnation, and 3) by deed. As to the statutory grant under section 11, the \r\n  Court of Appeals cited the prior authority of Ragsdale, Beaudrot, \r\n  and Boney for the proposition that railroad's interest was an easement \r\n  only.\r\n\r\nWe adhere to the wealth of authority in this state \r\n  and hold the 1845 Charter created only an easement in Railroad, such that Faulkenberry \r\n  is entitled to use the disputed crossing. We note, however, that although Faulkenberry \r\n  may cross the railroad tracks, he may not do anything which would unreasonably \r\n  interfere with Railroad's use of its easement. Marion County Lumber Co. v. \r\n  Tilghman Lumber Co., 75 S.C. 220, 55 S.E. 337 (1906) (owner of the dominant \r\n  estate cannot materially interfere with use and enjoyment of servient estate's \r\n  easement; owners must be held during continuance of easement to have abandoned \r\n  every use of the land except such as might be made consistent with the reasonable \r\n  enjoyment of the easement). See&nbsp;also Brown v. Gaskins, \r\n  284 S.C. 30, 33, 324 S.E.2d 639, 640 (Ct.App.1984). (6) \r\n   \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.     It is undisputed that construction of Railroad was completed by 1852.\r\n2.   The circuit court ruled that, in any event, Faulkenberry was entitled to an easement by necessity to cross the railroad tracks.  In light of our holding, we need\r\nnot address this alternate ruling.\r\n3.  Other courts have recognized \r\n  the existence of a determinable easement, or an easement subject to a condition \r\n  subsequent. See Howell v. Clyde, 493 S.E.2d 323 (N.C. App. 1997); \r\n  Higdon v. Davis, 337 S.E.2d 543 (N.C. 1985); Weir v. Consolidated \r\n  Rail Corp., 465 N.E.2d 1341 (OH 1983); Gerhard v. Stevens, 442 P.2d \r\n  692 (CA 1968); Eggleston v. Fox, 232 A.2d 670 (N.J. 1967). Although this \r\n  Court has never recognized a defeasible easement, we have held an easement no \r\n  longer used for its stated purposes has been abandoned and therefore extinguished. \r\n  See&nbsp;Immanuel Baptist Church v. Barnes, 274 S.C. 125, 264 \r\n  S.E.2d 142 (1980) (owner of easement may relinquish that easement by express \r\n  or implied abandonment). See&nbsp;also Saluda Motor Lines v. \r\n  Crouch, 300 S.C. 43, 386 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 1989)(where railroad ceased \r\n  to use its right-of-way for railroad purposes, it abandons right-of-way). \r\n4.   The General Assembly simultaneously enacted the Constitution of 1868 providing that \"[p]rivate property shall not be taken or applied for public use, or for\r\nthe use of corporations. . . without the consent of the owner or a just compensation being made therefor. . . . [L]aws may be made securing . . . the right of way\r\nover the lands of either persons or corporations . . . but a just compensation shall. . . be first made.\"  1868 CONST., Art. 1 Â§ 23, Art. 12 Â§ 3. \r\n5.  Railroad correctly points \r\n  out that if the 1845 Charter operated to grant it a fee simple \r\n  determinable estate in the property under the tracks, then the Legislature could \r\n  not retroactively divest it of vested property rights. See Robinson \r\n  v. Askew, 129 S.C. 188, 123 S.E. 822 (1924)(constitutional provision may \r\n  be given retroactive effect so long as it does not divest vested rights); Muldrow \r\n  v. Caldwell, 173 S.C. 243, 175 S.E. 501 (1934) (same with respect to statutory \r\n  provisions). \r\n6.  We note that Faulkenberry \r\n  is also prohibited from utilizing Railroad's easement in any manner inconsistent \r\n  with the right of utilities, telephone and telegraph companies, etc. to construct, \r\n  maintain, and operate lines upon the rights of way of railroad companies. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.

Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: Todd William Wright was convicted of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) and sentenced to 10 years\r\nimprisonment, suspended upon service of 8 years, and 5 years probation.  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWright, 6' tall and weighing 216 lbs., beat and kicked his wife Wendy on the evening of February 16, 1999.  Her injuries were so severe that two of her ribs were\r\nfractured and her spleen had to be removed.  Wright was indicted for criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature. (1)  The aggravating factors\r\nalleged in the indictment were \"a difference in the sexes of the victim and the defendant\" and/or that \"the defendant did inflict serious bodily harm upon the victim\r\nby kicking her in the mid-section requiring her to seek medical attention.\"\r\n\r\nWright objected to the judge's charge on the aggravating circumstance of \"a difference of the sexes,\" contending it violated equal protection. (2)  The objection was\r\noverruled; Wright was found guilty as charged.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the aggravating circumstance of a \"difference in the sexes\" violate equal protection? \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWright contends the judge's charge on the aggravating circumstance of a \"difference in the sexes\" violated his right to equal protection.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe equal protection clause prevents only irrational \r\n  and unjustified classifications, not all classifications. South Carolina \r\n  Public Svc. Authority v. C&amp;S Nat'l Bank, 300 S.C. 142, 386 S.E.2d 775 \r\n  (1989). For a gender-based classification to pass constitutional muster, it \r\n  must serve an important governmental objective and be substantially related \r\n  to the achievement of that objective. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \r\n  (1976); Griffin v. Warden, CCI, 277 S.C. 288, 286 S.E.2d 145, cert. \r\n  denied, 459 U.S. 942, 103 S.Ct. 255, 74 L.Ed.2d 199 (1982). A law will be \r\n  upheld where the gender classification realistically reflects the fact that \r\n  the sexes are not similarly situated in certain circumstances. In the Interest \r\n  of Joseph T, 312 S.C. 15, 430 S.E.2d 523 (1993). See&nbsp;also&nbsp;Michael \r\n  M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (holding \r\n  that as long as the rule of nature that the sexes are not similarly situated \r\n  in certain circumstances is realistically reflected in a gender classification, \r\n  the statute will be upheld as constitutional). \"The relevant inquiry ... is \r\n  not whether the statute is drawn as precisely as it might have been, but whether \r\n  the line chosen by the [legislature] is within constitutional limitations.\" \r\n  Id. at 473. \r\n\r\n\r\n  In Michael M., supra, Justice Stewart \r\n    wrote:\r\n\r\n[In] [certain narrow] circumstances, a gender classification based on clear differences between the sexes in [sic] not invidious, and a legislative classification\r\nrealistically based upon those differences is not unconstitutional. . . . When men and women are not in fact similarly situated in the area covered by the legislation\r\nin question, the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded. While those differences\r\nmust never be permitted to become a pretext for invidious discrimination, no such discrimination is presented by this case. The Constitution surely does not\r\nrequire a State to pretend that demonstrable differences between men and women do not really exist. \r\n\r\n\r\n450 U.S. at 478 and 481 (Justice Stewart concurring).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Gurganus, 250 S.E.2d 668, 672-673 \r\n  (1979), the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld a statute enhancing the punishment \r\n  for males convicted of assault on a female, stating, \r\n\r\n\r\n  We base our decision instead upon the demonstrable \r\n    and observable fact that the average adult male is taller, heavier and possesses \r\n    greater body strength than the average female. See Dothard v. Rawlinson, \r\n    433 U.S. 321, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977). We take judicial notice \r\n    of these physiological facts, and think that the General Assembly was also \r\n    entitled to take note of the differing physical sizes and strengths of the \r\n    sexes. Having noted such facts, the General Assembly could reasonably conclude \r\n    that assaults and batteries without deadly weapons by physically larger and \r\n    stronger males are likely to cause greater physical injury and risk of death \r\n    than similar assaults by females. Having so concluded, the General Assembly \r\n    could choose to provide greater punishment for these offenses, which it found \r\n    created greater danger to life and limb, without violating the Fourteenth \r\n    Amendment. We recognize that classifications based upon average physical differences \r\n    between the sexes could be invalid in certain situations involving equal employment \r\n    opportunity, participation in sports and other areas. . . . We believe that \r\n    an analytical approach taking into account such average differences is an \r\n    entirely valid approach, however, when distinguishing classes of direct physical \r\n    violence. This is particularly true where, as here, the acts of violence classified \r\n    are all criminal when engaged in by any person whatsoever and have no arguably \r\n    productive end. See Hall v. McKenzie, 537 F.2d 1232 (4th Cir. \r\n    1976). Certainly some individual females are larger, stronger and more violent \r\n    than many males. The General Assembly is not, however, required by the Fourteenth \r\n    Amendment to modify criminal statutes which have met the test of time in order \r\n    to make specific provisions for any such individuals. The Constitution of \r\n    the United States has not altered certain virtually immutable facts of nature, \r\n    and the General Assembly of North Carolina is not required to undertake to \r\n    alter those facts. [The North Carolina statute] establishes classifications \r\n    by gender which serve important governmental objectives and are substantially \r\n    related to achievement of those objectives. Therefore, we hold that the statute \r\n    does not deny males equal protection of law in violation of the Fourteenth \r\n    Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee&nbsp;also Buchanon v. State, \r\n  480 S.W.2d 207, 209 (Tex. 1972) (statute making assault or battery committed \r\n  by adult male on an adult female an aggravated assault did not deny equal protection \r\n  since \"[i]t is a matter of common knowledge, and a proper subject for judicial \r\n  notice, that women, as a general rule, are of smaller physical stature and strength \r\n  than are men\"). Accord Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412, 28 S.Ct. \r\n  324, 52 L.Ed. 551 (1908) (recognizing differences in body structure and physical \r\n  strength of sexes); People v. Silva, 33 Cal. Rptr.2d 181 (Cal. 1994) \r\n  (upholding against equal protection challenge criminal domestic abuse statute \r\n  criminalizing willful injury upon person of opposite sex with whom assailant \r\n  cohabits; noting obvious distinction that women are physically less able to \r\n  defend themselves against their husbands than vice-versa). \r\n\r\nWe find that the \"difference in gender\" aggravator \r\n  is legitimately based upon realistic physiological size and strength differences \r\n  of men and women such that it does not violate equal protection. Accord \r\n  Gurganus, supra. Cf&nbsp;Schlesinger v. Ballard, \r\n  419 U.S. 498, 508 (1975) (different treatment of men and women reflects, not \r\n  archaic and overbroad generalizations, but, instead, the demonstrable fact that \r\n  male and female line officers in the Navy are not similarly situated); Rostker \r\n  v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 72- 83 (1981) (holding that draft registration \r\n  applicable only to men was justified because women are excluded from combat). \r\n  We therefore affirm Wright's convictions. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nMOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal, concurring in result only.\r\n\r\nWhile I concur with the majority's decision to affirm Wright's CDVHAN conviction, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the \"difference in the sexes\"\r\naggravating circumstance does not violate equal protection.  I believe the \"difference in the sexes\" aggravating circumstance, as a gender-based classification,\r\nviolates equal protection.  However, the violation is harmless in this instance because the jury found another aggravating circumstance, infliction of serious bodily\r\ninjury, which does not violate equal protection.\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority that the \"difference in the sexes\" aggravator is inherently gender-based, but would find that it does not satisfy the second prong of the\r\nanalysis employed by the majority.  As explained by the majority, to pass constitutional muster, a gender-based classification must (1) serve an important\r\ngovernmental objective and (2) be substantially related to the achievement of that objective.  Craig v. Boren; Griffin v. Warden.  The burden rests on the state to\r\nmake this showing.  Although the \"difference in the sexes\" classification is presumably intended to serve the governmental objective of preventing domestic\r\nviolence, I would find it is not substantially related to achieving this objective.\r\n\r\nThe CDVHAN statute was designed to address violence in the home; it applies when any person harms any member of their household. (3)  The statute then is\r\ndesigned to prevent domestic violence against men, women, and children by perpetrators of both sexes.  Having an aggravating circumstance based solely on\r\ngender does not substantially further this objective or the narrower objective of protecting women from domestic abuse.  In my opinion, this gender-based\r\nclassification is no different than the classification discussed by the majority and struck down by this Court in In the Interest of Joseph T.  In that case, this Court\r\nheld a statute  criminalizing communication of indecent messages to females violated Equal Protection.  Id.  Although the Court recognized that some gender-based classifications which realistically reflect that men and women are not similarly situated can withstand equal protection scrutiny on occasion, it clarified that\r\ndistinctions in the law which were based on \"old notions\" that women should be afforded \"special protection\" could no longer withstand equal protection scrutiny. \r\nId.  \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this \"difference in gender\" aggravating circumstance is a distinction that perpetuates these \"old notions.\"  There is no logical purpose for it except\r\nto protect physically inferior women from stronger men; a purpose based on out-dated generalizations of the sexes no longer favored in legal analysis.  See United\r\nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1996) (reiterating that gender classifications cannot be used as they once were to create or\r\nperpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women and cautioning reviewing courts to take a hard look at generalizations or tendencies of the sexes). \r\nSimilarly, the cases relied upon by the majority are based on out-dated generalizations of the sexes no longer favored.\r\nThe equal protection analysis set forth by\r\nthe majority relies almost entirely on the 1979  North Carolina Supreme Court opinion State v. Gurganus, 250 S.E.2d 668 (1979).  No court, federal or state, has\r\never relied on the analysis the majority cites from Gurganaus.  In fact, Gurganus has been cited only once by any court, and then only for a rule of statutory\r\ninterpretation in a case that did not involve equal protection issues.  Guilford County Bd. of Educ. v. Guilford County Bd. of Elections, 430 S.E.2d 681 (N.C. Ct.\r\nApp. 1993).\r\n\r\nDeterring domestic violence is more efficiently and appropriately accomplished through other aggravators, such as the \"great disparity in ages or physical\r\nconditions of the parties\" and \"infliction of serious bodily injury\" aggravators.  In many cases, there may be a great disparity in strength between a male and a\r\nfemale, but if there is not, there is no reason why a difference in gender should serve as an aggravating circumstance to \"protect\" women to the detriment of men. \r\nTherefore, I would find that the \"difference in the sexes\" aggravating circumstance violates equal protection because it fails to substantially relate to the\r\ngovernment objective of preventing domestic violence.  However, I would affirm Wright's conviction because the jury also found a permissible, gender-neutral\r\naggravating circumstance:  infliction of serious bodily injury.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I respectfully concur in result only.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The offense of CDVHAN incorporates \r\n  the elements of ABHAN. S.C. Code Â§ 16-25-65 (Supp. 2000). The elements of ABHAN \r\n  are 1) the unlawful act of violent injury to another, accompanied by circumstances \r\n  of aggravation. Circumstances of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, \r\n  the intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity \r\n  in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the \r\n  purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities \r\n  with a female, and resistance to lawful authority. State v. Fennell, \r\n  340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000). Subsection C of section 16-25-65 specifically \r\n  states that it does not codify the common law offense of ABHAN but, rather, \r\n  creates a statutory offense of CDVHAN. \r\n2.

At trial, a jury convicted \r\n  petitioners of second degree burglary and grand larceny. The Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed. See State v. Mizzell, 341 S.C. 529, 535 S.E.2d 134 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000). We granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 1996, Howard Woods' (\"Woods\") home was burglarized.  Woods stated he left his home in the afternoon,\r\nreturning later to find the front door kicked in and numerous guns missing.  Woods testified knowing petitioners from a hunting\r\nclub. \r\n\r\nInvestigator Fowler (\"Fowler\"), the lead investigator, testified that upon reaching Woods' home, he found the door opened.  He\r\ndiscovered no fingerprints or any other physical evidence to further the investigation.  After receiving a tip, Fowler went to the home\r\nof Thomas Harley (\"Harley\") and recovered nine of Woods' rifles.  Harley admitted buying rifles from petitioners.  Harley testified\r\na man and woman were in the truck with petitioners when he bought the rifles. \r\n\r\nThe State's key witness, Donald Steele (\"Steele\"), testified he and his wife accompanied petitioners to Woods' home.  Steele drove\r\na small pick-up truck to the home.  After arriving, Steele claimed petitioners kicked in the door and entered.  Steele testified\r\npetitioners exited the home carrying guns.  Steele further testified to witnessing petitioners sell several of the guns to a man,\r\npresumably referring to Harley.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Steele admitted the State charged him with the same crimes as petitioners.  The trial court excluded evidence\r\nof the possible sentence Steele faced but permitted petitioners to examine Steele about the sentence in general terms.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS/DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nPetitioners argue the trial court erred in violating their rights under the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause (1) by limiting the\r\ncross-examination of Steele.  Specifically, petitioners assert the trial court should have permitted defense counsel to elicit from\r\nSteele the possible punishment he could receive if he were convicted of the charged crimes.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The Sixth Amendment rights to notice, confrontation, \r\n  and compulsory process guarantee that a criminal charge may be answered through \r\n  the calling and interrogation of favorable witnesses, the cross-examination \r\n  of adverse witnesses, and the orderly introduction of evidence.\" State v. \r\n  Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994) (quoting State \r\n  v. Schmidt, 228 S.C. 301, 303, 342 S.E.2d 401, 402 (1986)). The Sixth Amendment \r\n  is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. \r\n  (2) See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, \r\n  13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). \r\n\r\nA defendant has the right to cross-examine a witness \r\n  concerning bias under the Confrontation Clause. Davis v. Alaska, 415 \r\n  U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); State v. Brown, 303 S.C. \r\n  169, 399 S.E.2d 593 (1991). \"'On cross-examination, any fact may be elicited \r\n  which tends to show interest, bias, or partiality' of the witness.\" State \r\n  v. Brewington, 267 S.C. 97, 101, 226 S.E.2d 249, 250 (1976) (quoting 98 \r\n  C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 560a (1957)); see Rule 608(c), SCRE (\"Bias, \r\n  prejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness \r\n  either by examination of the witness or by evidence otherwise adduced.\").\r\n\r\nA criminal defendant may show a violation of the \r\n  Confrontation Clause \"by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise \r\n  appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on \r\n  the part of the witness, and thereby 'to expose to the jury the facts from which \r\n  jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability \r\n  of the witness.'\" Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680, 106 S.Ct. \r\n  1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 684 (1986). The trial judge retains discretion to \r\n  impose reasonable limits on the scope of cross-examination. State v. Sherard, \r\n  303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); accord Delaware v. Van Arsdall, \r\n  supra. Before a trial judge may limit a criminal defendant's right to \r\n  engage in cross-examination to show bias on the part of the witness, the record \r\n  must clearly show the cross-examination is inappropriate. State v. Graham, \r\n  supra. If the defendant establishes he was unfairly prejudiced by the \r\n  limitation, it is reversible error. State v. Brown, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge prohibited questioning Steele about \r\n  a specific possible sentence because the charges against Steele and petitioners \r\n  were the same. \"The purpose of preventing disclosure of the potential sentence \r\n  facing the defendant is that such evidence is irrelevant to the jury and could \r\n  possibly prejudice the State's right to a fair trial.\" Illinois v. Brewer, \r\n  615 N.E.2d 787, 790 (Ill. App. Ct. 1993). We implicitly recognized this interest \r\n  in State v. Brown, supra. \r\n\r\nThe jury is, generally, not entitled to learn the possible sentence of a defendant because the sentence is irrelevant to finding guilt or\r\ninnocence.   However, other constitutional concerns, such as the Confrontation Clause, limit the applicability of this rule in\r\ncircumstances where the defendant's right to effectively cross-examine a co-conspirator witness of possible bias outweighs the need\r\nto exclude the evidence.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Brown, supra, we held \r\n  the trial court erred in excluding evidence of a witness' possible punishment \r\n  because it would allow the jury to learn of Brown's own potential sentence, \r\n  if convicted. \r\n\r\nThe witness admitted, on direct examination, she testified in exchange for being charged with only one count of conspiracy for\r\nwhich she could face a maximum sentence of seven and one-half years.  On cross-examination, the trial judge precluded the defense\r\nfrom asking the witness the maximum punishment she faced if found guilty of trafficking in cocaine, the crime initially charged\r\nagainst her.  \r\n\r\nWe found Brown was unfairly prejudiced because \r\n  the witness \"was permitted to avoid a mandatory prison term of more than three \r\n  times the duration she would face on her plea to conspiracy [was] critical evidence \r\n  of potential bias that appellant should have been permitted to present to the \r\n  jury.\" Id., 303 S.C. at 171, 399 S.E.2d at 594. Moreover, the witness provided \r\n  the only evidence to link Brown to the cocaine trafficking. Id., 303 S.C. at \r\n  171-72, 399 S.E.2d at 594. \r\n\r\nBecause of the error of law and the unfair prejudice \r\n  to Brown, we held the denial of meaningful cross-examination outweighed the \r\n  State's interest in excluding the evidence. Id., 303 S.C. at 172, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  at 594.\r\n\r\nThe case sub judice is distinctive because \r\n  the co-conspirator witness was charged with the same crimes as petitioners but \r\n  had neither agreed to a plea bargain nor pled guilty. Petitioners assert the \r\n  State should not be allowed to rely on this distinction to exclude this testimony \r\n  because the absence of the agreement, if anything, suggests the witness will \r\n  testify more favorably to the State's position. Petitioners argue Steele would \r\n  reasonably have felt the quality of his cooperation would determine the degree \r\n  of benefit he would later receive. See Boone v. Paderick, 541 \r\n  F.2d 447, 451 (4th Cir. 1976) (\"[A] promise to recommend leniency (without assurance \r\n  of it) may be interpreted by the promisee as contingent upon the quality of \r\n  the evidence produced; the more uncertain the agreement, the greater the incentive \r\n  to make the testimony pleasing to the promisor.\"). We agree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a judge may prevent the introduction \r\n  of evidence which informs the jury of the possible sentence defendants may receive \r\n  if convicted because it is either irrelevant or substantially prejudicial. See \r\n  Illinois v.  Brewer, supra; State v. Alexander, \r\n  303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991) (construing Rule 403, SCRE, to allow a judge \r\n  to exclude relevant evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially \r\n  outweighs its probative value); Rule 402, SCRE (\"Evidence which is not relevant \r\n  is not admissible.\").\r\n\r\nThe fact the witness has yet to reach a plea bargain or been found guilty should not prevent the admission of such evidence.  The\r\nlack of a negotiated plea, if anything, creates a situation where the witness is more likely to engage in biased testimony in order to\r\nobtain a future recommendation for leniency.  Accordingly, we conclude the Court of Appeals erred in holding the trial judge\r\nproperly excluded testimony concerning Steele's potential sentence if convicted of the same crimes as petitioners.\r\n\r\nOur inquiry does not end upon finding the trial \r\n  court committed an error in limiting the cross-examination of Steele. \"A violation \r\n  of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness is not per \r\n  se reversible error\" if the \"error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \r\n  Graham, 314 S.C. at 385, 444 S.E.2d at 527. Whether an error is harmless \r\n  depends on the particular facts of each case and upon a host of factors including:\r\n\r\n\r\nthe importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence\r\nof evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise\r\npermitted, and of course the overall strength of the prosecution's case.\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. \r\n  at 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d at 686; see State v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, \r\n  445 S.E.2d 633 (1994) (applying Van Arsdall factors); see also \r\n  State v. Graham, supra, (the Van Arsdall factors are not \r\n  exhaustive).\r\n\r\n\"Harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" means the \r\n  reviewing court can conclude the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt. Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992). \r\n  In determining whether an error is harmless, \"the reviewing court must review \r\n  the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the verdict.\" Clark, \r\n  315 S.C. 478, 484, 445 S.E.2d 633, 636 (Toal, J. dissenting); see, e.g., \r\n  Arnold v. State, supra. \r\n\r\nConsidering the Van Arsdale factors, we \r\n  note much of Steele's testimony was either cumulative or corroborated by other \r\n  witnesses. Both Woods and Fowler testified the front door to the home had been \r\n  kicked in or tampered with to gain entry. Harley testified he bought rifles \r\n  from petitioners and observed a male and female (presumably Steele and his wife) \r\n  in the truck. \r\n\r\nCritically, however, Steele was the only witness \r\n  to testify as an eyewitness to petitioners' burglary of the home. The lack of \r\n  physical evidence placing petitioners at the scene enhanced the importance of \r\n  Steele's testimony. As in Brown, the co-conspirator witness is the only \r\n  link placing petitioners at the scene of the crime. \r\n\r\nThe State contends any error is harmless because the trial judge permitted petitioners to cross-examine Steele about any plea\r\nagreement and to question the veracity of his testimony.  Additionally, the State asserts the trial court's error did not prejudice the\r\noutcome of the trial because Steele was allowed to testify, if convicted, he could go to jail for a \"long time.\"\r\n\r\nSteele's general admission he \"could get a long sentence for these crimes,\" denies petitioners' Confrontation Clause rights under the\r\nSixth Amendment.  A \"long sentence\" may have different meanings to different jurors.\r\n\r\nWe believe the defendant's Sixth Amendment right \r\n  to effective cross-examination in this case outweighs the right of the State \r\n  to shield the jury from knowledge of the possible sentence for a defendant who \r\n  faces the same charges as a witness against him. A witness admitting he is subject \r\n  to a \"long sentence\" is quite different from a witness admitting he could be \r\n  sentenced to a maximum of life in prison, the sentence faced by Steele if convicted \r\n  of first degree burglary. (3) See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(B) (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Sherard, supra, two juvenile \r\n  co-conspirators implicated Sherard in a robbery-murder scheme. In exchange for \r\n  their testimony, the two were allowed to plead guilty as accessories in family \r\n  court. Sherard was waived up to general sessions court on charges of murder \r\n  and attempted armed robbery.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination one of the co-conspirators admitted his charges of murder and attempted armed robbery were reduced in\r\nexchange for his testimony.  He further testified that if he were found guilty of murder in general sessions court, he would face a\r\nmandatory life sentence.  However, the trial judge prevented Sherard from asking the second co-conspirator witness the penalty he\r\ncould have suffered if convicted of the original charges. The trial judge did allow the witness to testify he knew the reduced charges\r\nwould result in much less severe penalties.  \r\n\r\nWe found Sherard suffered no prejudice from the \r\n  trial court's decision. Critically, we distinguished our decision from Brown \r\n  where \"no evidence was presented to the jury regarding the sentence the witness \r\n  avoided in pleading guilty and testifying for the State.\" Id., 303 S.C. at 175, \r\n  399 S.E.2d at 596. While we found the trial court afforded the defense ample \r\n  opportunity to demonstrate the bias of the witnesses, we found it critical that \r\n  \"during cross-examination of [the first co-conspirator witness], the jury was \r\n  made fully aware that a charge of murder carries a mandatory life sentence.\" \r\n  Id. In the present case, the jury only knew Steele was subject to the \r\n  vagaries of a \"long\" prison term, whatever that may mean.\r\n\r\nBecause Steele was the only witness to directly \r\n  link petitioners to the burglary, we cannot say the trial court's error was \r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Arnold v. State. Accordingly, \r\n  we find the trial court committed prejudicial error in limiting petitioners \r\n  cross-examination into Steele's possible sentence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons we REVERSE the court below.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.

Barnett, of Barnett &amp; Wright, P.A., \r\n          of Myrtle Beach, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  This \r\n  is a church dispute. We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of \r\n  Appeals's decision (1) affirming the master's \r\n  finding that the dismissal of the preacher by church trustees was a nullity \r\n  and the congregation's election of new trustees was valid. We affirm in part \r\n  and reverse in part. \r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioners (Trustees), who are the founders of \r\n  The Christian Church of North Myrtle Beach (NMB Church), voted to dismiss the \r\n  church's preacher, respondent Darrell Hall. In response, the congregation voted \r\n  to oust Trustees, elected replacement trustees, and overrode the dismissal of \r\n  Preacher Hall. Trustees retaliated by freezing the church's assets and locking \r\n  its doors. \r\n\r\nRespondents, who are church members, then commenced \r\n  this declaratory judgment action to determine Preacher Hall's employment status \r\n  and the legitimacy of the newly elected trustees, and for injunctive relief. \r\n  After issuing a temporary injunction, the circuit court referred the case to \r\n  the master-in-equity. The master found NMB Church was a congregational church \r\n  and, as such, the congregation held the ultimate authority over all church matters. \r\n  Accordingly, he ruled the ouster of Trustees was legitimate and Preacher Hall's \r\n  dismissal was a nullity. Further, he enjoined Trustees from interfering with \r\n  the congregation's access to church assets. On appeal, the Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUES  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Did the Court of Appeals properly affirm the \r\n    master's finding that NMB Church is a congregational church?\r\n\r\n  2. Did the Court of Appeals's analysis infringe \r\n    the right to freedom of religion?\r\n\r\n  3. Was the special congregational meeting at which \r\n    the new trustees were elected a legal meeting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Standard of review \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe begin by noting our agreement with the Court \r\n  of Appeals's finding that this is an action in equity and therefore the applicable \r\n  standard of review is our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. See \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 \r\n  (1976). Whether an action for declaratory relief is legal or equitable in nature \r\n  depends on the plaintiff's main purpose in bringing the action. Doe v. South \r\n  Carolina Medical Malpractice Liability Joint Underwriting Assoc., 347 S.C. \r\n  642, 557 S.E.2d 670 (2001). Respondents' main purpose in bringing this action \r\n  was to enjoin Trustees' present and future interference in church matters. Accordingly, \r\n  this is an equitable action and we may take our own view of the evidence.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is important to note our limited jurisdiction \r\n  over church matters. Church disputes may be resolved by the courts only if resolution \r\n  can be made without extensive inquiry into religious law. It is not the function \r\n  of the courts to dictate procedures for a church to follow. Pearson v. Church \r\n  of God, 325 S.C. 45, 478 S.E.2d 849 (1996); Knotts v. Williams, 319 \r\n  S.C. 473, 462 S.E.2d 288 (1995). To preserve \"complete religious liberty, untrammeled \r\n  by state authority,\" we limit our inquiry into church affairs and respect the \r\n  boundaries of church self-governance. Pearson, 325 S.C. at 52, 478 S.E.2d \r\n  at 852-53.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Form of church governance \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe NMB Church was founded by Trustees as a Christian \r\n  Church, which is also referred to as the Church of Christ, in 1994. Trustees \r\n  were members of another Christian Church, the Grand Strand Christian Church, \r\n  and all but two of them remained members of that church even after founding \r\n  the NMB Church. (2) Trustees acquired the church \r\n  property in June 1994 and constructed the church building on it. The church \r\n  was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in March 1995. Trustees hired Preacher \r\n  Hall at the end of May 1996 and he began his tenure at NMB Church on June 18, \r\n  1996. \r\n\r\nOn June 30, Trustees approved a \"Constitution and \r\n  By-Laws\" (hereinafter \"the bylaws\") that became effective July 1, 1996. The \r\n  bylaws provide regarding trustees as follows:\r\n\r\nARTICLE I, SECTION III\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The church is set up as a \"Trust\" under the \r\n    direction of the Trustees named herein.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV, SECTION 11\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. TRUSTEES: The Church formed under the direction \r\n    of a Board of Trustees, named here as they may add to or change:\r\n\r\n  [naming Trustees]\r\n\r\n  A. DUTIES OF TRUSTEES: Trustees shall act as legal \r\n    agents of the Church in all business matters. Hold legal title to all church \r\n    property and handle all business transactions related thereto; have supervision \r\n    over all endowment and trust funds; and discharge such duties as the law of \r\n    South Carolina enjoins upon them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A1) As an advisory board to the church leaders \r\n      of [NMB Church]\r\n\r\n    A2) Duties as given in the Article of Organization \r\n       (3)\r\n\r\n  \r\n  B. MINIMUM NUMBER OF TRUSTEES (6)\r\n\r\n  C. QUALIFICATIONS: Must be active member of the \r\n    Christian Church\r\n\r\n  D. ELIGIBILITY: Shall be based upon the decision \r\n    of other trustees.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the subject of a preacher, the bylaws provide:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE VII, SECTION 1\r\n\r\n  1. The Minister shall be elected for an indefinite \r\n    term, and a contract agreeable to the Board of Elders and Deacons and Minister \r\n    shall be entered into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    . . .  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. The Elders shall appoint the Pulpit Committee. \r\n    . . . When a vacancy occurs in the pulpit, it shall be their duty to carry \r\n    on proper correspondence with candidates for the pulpit. The recommended candidate's \r\n    qualifications shall be submitted to the Church Board \r\n    (4) for their approval. If approved, the recommended candidate shall \r\n    be invited to meet with the Elders and Deacons prior to conducting a Worship \r\n    Service. . . . Then following the service a congregational vote shall be cast \r\n    to determine whether the candidate shall be elected to fill the pulpit. . \r\n    . .\r\n\r\n  4. The congregation reserves the right to dismiss \r\n    any Minister at any time. . . . The dismissal of a Minister of this congregation \r\n    shall be by the recommendation of majority of all Elders and Deacons and a \r\n    majority vote of the eligible members present at a congregational meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contested action regarding the preacher and \r\n  new trustees took place at a special congregational meeting held on June 14, \r\n  1998, after the approval of these bylaws.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is uncontested that Christian Churches \r\n  are independent congregational churches governed by their own congregations. \r\n  The congregation selects the church's trustees and the trustees are always members \r\n  of that church. In a congregational church, the congregation is the highest \r\n  authority. Knotts v. Williams, supra.\r\n\r\nIn a church dispute, the party asserting a deviation \r\n  from governance conforming to the affiliated church convention must demonstrate \r\n  by a preponderance of the evidence that the church adopted an alternative government. \r\n  Bowen v. Green, 275 S.C. 431, 272 S.E.2d 433 (1980). Here, the burden \r\n  is on Trustees to show the NMB Church was established as other than a congregational \r\n  church since they are asserting that they, and not the congregation, are the \r\n  highest authority.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Trustees at the hearing before \r\n  the master is conflicting on their intent as the founders of NMB Church. Trustee \r\n  Spruill testified the Board of Trustees was intended to act as an advisory committee \r\n  that \"would derive its authority from the principal that was recognized or represented. \r\n  That being the church.\" He stated that although the church had not ordained \r\n  any elders, which is \"a spiritually guided process,\" the church was now able \r\n  to handle its own affairs. His understanding was \"the trustees serve a legal \r\n  capacity at the pleasure of the elders and in turn the elders are elected by \r\n  the congregation members. Therefore the ultimate authority flows to the members.\" \r\n  Trustees Powell and Wilson, on the other hand, felt they had the authority to \r\n  control the church property and dismiss the preacher because the church was \r\n  set up as a \"trust.\" \r\n\r\nWhatever the original intent of the Trustees in \r\n  1994 when the church was founded, they memorialized its form of government by \r\n  approving the church bylaws in 1996. The church bylaws clearly reserve to the \r\n  congregation the right to dismiss the preacher which is consistent with the \r\n  convention of Christian Churches as congregational. Accordingly, Trustees had \r\n  no authority to dismiss Preacher Hall and the master properly ruled the dismissal \r\n  was a nullity.\r\n\r\nThe bylaws, however, do not clearly follow the \r\n  Christian Church convention of congregational authority in regard to the election \r\n  of trustees. There is no express provision regarding the election of trustees. \r\n  Article IV, section II(3)(A), provides: \"The Church [is] formed under the direction \r\n  of a Board of Trustees, named here as they may add to or change.\" This language \r\n  may be construed as creating a self-perpetuating Board, which would remove from \r\n  the congregation the right to elect new trustees. \r\n\r\nWe find this language is not sufficient, however, \r\n  to carry Trustees' burden of proving an alternative church government vesting \r\n  them with the highest authority. The same provision of the bylaws also specifies \r\n  that the Board of Trustees is \"an advisory board to the church leaders,\" language \r\n  which supports the conclusion a congregational form of government was intended. \r\n  The ambiguity of the bylaws and the conflicting testimony regarding the intent \r\n  of the founders is insufficient to prove the adoption of an alternative to the \r\n  conventional Christian Church governance by congregation.\r\n\r\nFurther, although the bylaws provide that the Board \r\n  of Trustees will \"hold legal title to all church property and handle all business \r\n  transactions related thereto [and] have supervisions (sic) over all \r\n  endowment and trust funds,\" this provision does not clearly give Trustees the \r\n  ultimate authority over church matters but merely indicates the Trustees' function \r\n  as business managers who will answer to the congregation. Accordingly, the bylaws \r\n  do not overcome the presumption that the church is ultimately governed by the \r\n  congregation according to the Christian Church convention.\r\n\r\nWe find Trustees have failed to carry their burden \r\n  of proving an alternative form of church governance and conclude the master \r\n  properly found the NMB Church is a congregational church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Freedom of religion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn affirming the master, the Court of Appeals noted \r\n  that \"South Carolina recognizes at least two forms of governance for churches: \r\n  (1) hierarchical; and (2) congregational.\" It found Trustees had failed to show \r\n  all the legally required elements of a trust and therefore the NMB Church was \r\n  not a trust but congregational. Trustees contend this analysis limits the church's \r\n  ability to choose its own form of government and infringes its right to the \r\n  free exercise of religion.  \r\n  (5)\r\n\r\nWe agree the Court of Appeals's abbreviated analysis \r\n  in determining the church's form of government appears to limit the form of \r\n  church government to those recognized forms. As discussed above, however, the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence, including the intent of the founders and the \r\n  church bylaws, supports the ruling that the NMB Church is in fact a congregational \r\n  church. Our analysis does not infringe on the church's ability to chose any \r\n  alternative form of government. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Election of new trustees \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Trustees contend the meeting at which \r\n  the congregation voted to reinstate Preacher Hall and to elect the new trustees \r\n  was illegal because notice was not given to Trustees. This issue affects only \r\n  the validity of the election of new trustees since the dismissal of Preacher \r\n  Hall by Trustees was a nullity and his reinstatement by the congregation was \r\n  not required.\r\n\r\nThe bylaws provide that notice of a special congregational \r\n  meeting must be given for the two preceding Sundays and written notice sent \r\n  five days before the meeting to all members of the church. \r\n  (6) Only two Trustees were members of the NMB Church, Trustee Powell \r\n  and Trustee Williamson. (7) Under the bylaws, \r\n  they were entitled to notice and it is undisputed they did not receive it. \r\n  (8) These two Trustees were not aware of the meeting until the day \r\n  it occurred. Both did attend and neither objected at the meeting that they were \r\n  not given notice.\r\n\r\nIn response to Trustees' claim the meeting was \r\n  held illegally, respondents contend Trustees have failed to show prejudice from \r\n  the lack of notice. Rather than inquiring into prejudice, in light of our restraint \r\n  in dealing with church disputes, we resolve this issue by simply requiring compliance \r\n  with the church's own bylaws rather than determining whether a deviation was \r\n  harmless. See Hatcher v. South Carolina Dist. Council of Assemblies \r\n  of God, Inc., 267 S.C. 107, 226 S.E.2d 253 (1976) (civil courts will accept \r\n  as conclusive the decision of a legally constituted ecclesiastical tribunal \r\n  having jurisdiction of the matter absent fraud, collusion, or arbitrariness).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, since the congregational meeting \r\n  was not properly noticed to all members as required, we reverse the Court of \r\n  Appeals's decision on this issue. Although the congregation has authority to \r\n  elect its trustees under the congregational form of church governance as discussed \r\n  above, this authority was not properly exercised according to the church bylaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the holding that Preacher Hall's dismissal \r\n  by Trustees was a nullity but reverse the holding that the new trustees were \r\n  properly elected.  (9)\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Williams v. Wilson, \r\n  341 S.C. 136, 533 S.E.2d 592 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n2. Under Christian Church doctrine, \r\n  a person can be a member of only one church at a time. \r\n3. There is no \"Article of Organization\" \r\n  included in the bylaws. \r\n4. The term \"Church Board\" is \r\n  not defined in this document but appears in context to refer to the Board of \r\n  Trustees. \r\n5. See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ \r\n  2. \r\n6. This provision regarding \r\n  a \"special congregational meeting\" (Article VI, section I, Â¶3), rather than \r\n  the provision governing a \"special business meeting\" of Trustees (Â¶ 2), applies \r\n  in light of our conclusion that the election of trustees is accomplished by \r\n  the congregation and not the trustees. \r\n7. As noted above, the other \r\n  Trustees remained members of the Grand Strand Christian Church and under church \r\n  doctrine a person can be a member of only one church at a time. \r\n8. Preacher Hall admitted he \r\n  intentionally omitted giving Powell and Williamson notice of the meeting. \r\n9. Although Trustees will retain \r\n  their positions until further action by the congregation, the injunction forbidding \r\n  them from interfering with the congregation's access to church assets accords \r\n  with congregational control and remains valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
