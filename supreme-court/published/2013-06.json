Father argues\r\nhe cannot be found liable under the family purpose doctrine; Son's actions were not\r\n\na proximate cause of Gause's injuries; he should be granted a new trial due to\r\nprejudicial statements and a defective verdict form; and the punitive damages\r\naward should be overturned as impermissible under the family purpose doctrine.\r\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Gause, a police officer for the City of Conway, was on duty when he\r\nresponded to a call from a highway patrolman who had pulled over a Firebird\r\ndriven by Son on suspicion of drunk driving. Instead of pulling off the highway\r\ninto the emergency lane, Son stopped in the left lane of traffic on the four lane\r\nhighway, and the patrolman stopped behind him with his lights flashing. When\r\nGause arrived, he parked behind the patrolman, who subsequently left the scene,\r\nand also activated his blue lights. A second policeman also responded and\r\neventually took Son into custody, leaving only Gause and the abandoned vehicle.\r\nGause was filling out paperwork in his car and waiting for the tow truck to move\r\nthe Firebird when a pickup truck driven by Nathan Smithers rear-ended him,\r\npropelling his cruiser into the Firebird.\r\n\r\n       Gause sued Smithers and Father—assuming he was the driver of the Firebird\r\nbecause it was registered in his name—for his injuries. Father moved to dismiss\r\non the basis that Son, and not he, had been driving the Firebird that night.\r\nRealizing the mistake, Gause filed an amended complaint substituting Son as the\r\ndefendant for the negligence claim and changing the claims against Father to\r\nnegligent entrustment and liability under the family purpose doctrine. Son moved\r\nto be dismissed as a party because the amendment occurred after the statute of\r\nlimitations had run, and the circuit court granted the motion, holding the amended\r\ncomplaint did not relate back under Rule 15(c), SCRCP. Gause appealed the grant\r\nof Son's motion to be dismissed, and the court of appeals affirmed in Gause v.\r\nSmithers, 384 S.C. 130, 681 S.E.2d 607 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\n       Father then moved for summary judgment on the grounds the case could not\r\nproceed under the theory of the family purpose doctrine because Son had been\r\ndismissed and additionally, Son did not proximately cause Gause's injuries. The\r\ncircuit court denied the motion and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of\r\nFather's liability under the family purpose doctrine.1\r\n\r\n1 Gause apparently abandoned the issue of negligent entrustment at summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\n       At trial, Father acknowledged he owned the Firebird at the time of the\r\naccident, but testified he had transferred title to Son shortly before trial. He noted\r\nthat prior to the accident he had performed some maintenance on the car, but stated\r\nthat Son took over most of the maintenance after Father decided to sell it to him.\r\nAccording to Father, Son made a payment of $200 prior to the accident, but Father\r\nused that money to bail Son out of jail after the wreck. He testified Son lived with\r\nhim, although he clarified that Son actually resided in a \"broken-down motor\r\nhome\" next to his house, with electricity provided by an extension cord running\r\nfrom Father's house.\r\n\r\n       Son testified that at the time of the accident he was twenty-five and lived\r\nwith his parents. He could not remember whether he was employed then. He\r\nstated on the night of the accident he patronized a strip club in Myrtle Beach for\r\nfour hours and then slept in his car for about an hour before attempting to drive\r\nhome. He testified he was pulled over because the patrolman observed him\r\nweaving between the lanes, and he was taken to the detention center after he was\r\nstopped. Son further acknowledged he should have pulled off the road and was not\r\nsure why he stopped his car in a lane of travel.\r\n\r\n       Over Father's objections, the court submitted the issue of Father's liability\r\nunder the family purpose doctrine to the jury. During deliberations, the jury asked\r\nthe circuit court to clarify the identity of the defendants in the case, and the court\r\nbrought the jury back in and stated that the father was the defendant, not the son.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Gause, awarding actual damages of $155,432.64\r\nand punitive damages of $60,000 against Smithers and $40,000 against Father.\r\nHowever, when the verdict was read, the parties realized that Son had been listed\r\nas a defendant in the caption. The court then sought to have the jurors consider a\r\ncorrected verdict form, but the bailiff had already dismissed them and the court\r\nwas unable to call them all back. The court, however, refused to grant a new trial,\r\nreasoning that the jury had not been confused and that any prior confusion was\r\nclarified by its previous instructions. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Did the circuit court err in failing to dismiss the case against Father when\r\n          Son was no longer a party to the action?\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Did the circuit court err in failing to direct a verdict in favor of Father?\r\n\n   III.\t   Did the circuit court err in denying Father's motions for a new trial based\r\n           on the defective verdict form and prejudicial statements made by Gause\r\n           and his attorney in regards to Son's intoxication at the time of the\r\n           incident?\r\n\r\n   IV.\t    Did the circuit court err in allowing punitive damages to be assessed\r\n           against Father when his liability was predicated on the family purpose\r\n           doctrine?             LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t     FAILURE TO DISMISS\r\n\r\n      Father argues the circuit court erred in refusing to dismiss the case against\r\nhim after Son was dismissed from the lawsuit because under the family purpose\r\ndoctrine, Father's liability was indivisible from Son's. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The family purpose doctrine, which arises from the law of agency, is derived\r\nfrom the notion that one “who has made it his business to furnish a car for the use\r\nof his family is liable as principal or master when such business is being carried\r\nout by a family member using the vehicle for its intended purpose, the family\r\nmember thereby filling the role of agent or servant.\" Campbell v. Paschal, 290\r\nS.C. 1, 8, 347 S.E.2d 892, 897 (Ct. App. 1986) (internal citation omitted). To\r\nimpose liability under the family purpose doctrine the plaintiff must prove the\r\ndefendant is the head of the family and owns, maintains, or furnishes the\r\nautomobile. Reid v. Swindler, 249 S.C. 483, 496, 154 S.E.2d 910, 916 (1967).\r\nWhether the family purpose doctrine applies is ordinarily a question of fact for the\r\njury, but where no factual issue is created, the question becomes one of law,\r\nproperly decided by the circuit court. Evans v. Stewart, 370 S.C. 522, 527, 636\r\nS.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n      Father relies on Jordan v. Payton, 305 S.C. 537, 409 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App.\r\n1991), for the proposition that his liability is indivisible from Son's liability In\r\nJordan, the plaintiff was injured when a minor lost control of his vehicle and\r\nstruck her house, and she sued the minor and his legal guardian based on the\r\nfamily purpose doctrine. Id. at 538, 409 S.E.2d at 793. Neither party filed an\r\nanswer, and the plaintiff was granted a default judgment against both the minor\r\nand the guardian. Id. The court of appeals reversed the judgment against the\r\n\nminor pursuant to Rule 55, SCRCP, because a guardian ad litem had not been\r\nappointed for him. Id. The court also reversed the judgment against the legal\r\nguardian, noting that \"the liability of [the guardian] depends upon the liability of\r\nthe child. Therefore, the judgment must be valid against both or it is valid against\r\nneither.\" Id. at 539, 409 S.E.2d at 794.\r\n\r\n        We find this case distinguishable. Although we agree the liability of Father\r\nhinges on the liability of Son, here, there has been no previous determination as to\r\nSon's liability. In Jordan, the court of appeals noted, \"Under the express language\r\nof [Rule 55, SCRCP], the default judgment entered against the child is void for all\r\npurposes, liability as well as damages.\" Id. (emphasis added). Thus, by voiding\r\nthe judgment, there was no longer a judgment that the minor was liable. Because\r\nthe liability of the guardian rested on the negligence of the minor, there could be\r\nno judgment against the guardian if the minor had not been found negligent. Here,\r\nhowever, Son's dismissal from the action was not grounded on a finding of no\r\nliability. Son was offered as a witness at trial and the jury was instructed that it\r\nhad to consider both his personal liability as well as whether Father should be\r\nfound liable under the family purpose doctrine. Son did not need to be a party to\r\nthe action to allow the jury to make these determinations. We therefore find Father\r\ncan be held liable even though Son was dismissed from the action.2\r\n\r\n      Moreover, allowing the case to proceed against Father alone is consistent\r\nwith the theories of agency from which the family purpose doctrine developed.\r\nUnder the doctrine of respondeat superior, an injured party can elect to sue both the\r\nprincipal and the agent, but is not required to sue the agent to recover from the\r\nprincipal. Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 319, 594 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n2 This holding is further supported by case law from other jurisdictions that have\r\nconsidered this issue. Jordan cites to Medlin v. Church, 278 S.E.2d 747 (Ga. Ct.\r\nApp. 1981), which reversed a verdict against a father under the family purpose\r\ndoctrine because the verdict against his son was void for improper service.\r\nHowever, Medlin specifically noted that \"Under Georgia law where the head of the\r\nfamily is sought to be held liable for some wrong committed by a member of his\r\nfamily within the scope of the family purpose doctrine, that member of the family\r\nneed not necessarily be joined as a party defendant.\" Id. at 748 n.1. Additionally,\r\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has noted that under\r\nKentucky' application of the family purpose doctrine, the primary tortfeasor\r\ndoctrine is not an essential party to a lawsuit. Ray v. Porter, 464 F.2d 452, 455\r\n(6th Cir. 1972).\r\n\n867, 878 (Ct. App. 2004). Furthermore, \"[t]he rationale of the family purpose\r\ndoctrine is that it serves to place financial responsibility upon the head of the\r\nfamily who is more likely to respond in damages when the family vehicle is used\r\nnegligently by a person without sufficient assets of his own.\" Lollar v. Dewitt, 255\r\nS.C. 452, 456, 179 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971). Thus, the reason for proceeding under\r\nthe family purpose doctrine is to allow recovery from the more solvent parent, and\r\nrequiring that the child be sued as well is unnecessary to accomplish that end.\r\n\r\n   II.\t         DIRECTED VERDICT AND JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING\r\n                THE VERDICT\r\n\r\n   Father argues the circuit court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in his favor\r\nbecause the facts did not support application of the family purpose doctrine and\r\nSon's actions did not proximately cause Gause's injuries. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"A motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable jury could have\r\nreached the challenged verdict.\" Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d\r\n408, 419 (Ct. App. 2000). On appeal from a circuit court's denial of a motion for a\r\ndirected verdict or a JNOV, we apply the same standard as the circuit court by\r\nviewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\r\nthe nonmoving party. RFT Mgmt. Co., L.L.C. v. Tinsley & Adams L.L.P., 399 S.C.\r\n322, 331–32, 732 S.E.2d 166, 171 (2012). We will not reverse the circuit court's\r\nruling on a JNOV motion unless there is no evidence to support the ruling or where\r\nthe ruling is controlled by an error of law. Law v. S.C. Dept. of Corr., 368 S.C.\r\n424, 434–35, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).\r\n\r\n          A.\t    Applicability of the Family Purpose Doctrine\r\n\r\n        Father argues the circuit court erred in allowing the jury to consider his\r\nliability under the family purpose doctrine because Gause presented no evidence to\r\nestablish liability under that theory. Examining the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Gause, we find the court properly submitted the issue to the jury.\r\n\r\n       Gause presented evidence that Father was the head of the household and\r\nowned, maintained, or provided the Firebird for Son's use. At trial, both Father\r\nand Son admitted that Son was living with his parents at the time of the accident.\r\nAlthough Son lived in a broken-down motor home adjacent to Father's home, it\r\nwas on the same property and Son received electricity from Father's home. Father\r\nalso stated the Firebird was titled in his name, he paid the property taxes on it, he\r\n\nhad a set of keys, and he could have taken the car away from Son if he wanted.\r\nAdditionally, he acknowledged the Firebird was used by Son for his convenience\r\nand general use because he and his wife were tired of having to drive Son around.\r\nAccordingly, we find sufficient evidence existed to submit this issue to the jury.\r\n\r\n      B.     Proximate Cause\r\n\r\n       Father additionally alleges the circuit court erred in submitting the issue of\r\nhis liability to the jury because Son's actions did not proximately cause Gause's\r\ninjury.\"Proximate cause is normally a question of fact for determination by the\r\njury, and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\" Player v.\r\nThompson, 259 S.C. 600, 606, 193 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1972). The touchstone of\r\nproximate cause is foreseeability which is determined by looking to the natural and\r\nprobable consequences of the defendant's conduct. J.T. Baggerly v. CSX Transp.,\r\nInc., 370 S.C. 362, 369, 635 S.E.2d 97, 101 (2006). Plaintiff need not prove the\r\ndefendant's negligence was the sole proximate cause of the injury. Id. \"To\r\nexculpate a negligent defendant, the intervening cause must be one which breaks\r\nthe sequence or causal connection between the defendant's negligence and the\r\ninjury alleged.\" Matthews v. Porter, 239 S.C. 620, 628, 124 S.E.2d 321, 325\r\n(1962). \"Only in rare or exceptional cases may the issue of proximate cause be\r\ndecided as a matter of law.\" Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 367, 550 S.E.2d 910,\r\n914 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n      Son negligently stopped his vehicle in the left lane of traffic instead of\r\npulling off the road into the emergency lane. \"The danger of leaving a vehicle\r\nstanding on the traveled portion of a highway is well known.\" Jeffers v.\r\nHardeman, 231 S.C. 578, 583, 99 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1957). It was reasonably\r\nforeseeable that by remaining in a lane of traffic, another car could crash into the\r\nback of the police cruiser that pulled him over. We therefore disagree with Son\r\nthat Smithers' actions broke the chain of causation and find sufficient evidence was\r\npresented for a jury to conclude Son's negligence was a proximate cause of Gause's\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\n   III. MOTIONS FOR A NEW TRIAL\r\n\r\n      Father contends the circuit court erred in refusing to grant his motions for a\r\nnew trial based on the defective verdict form and on prejudicial statements made in\r\nregards to Son's intoxication at the time of the incident.\r\n\n      A.     Verdict Form\r\n\r\n       Father argues the circuit court erred in not granting a new trial because the\r\nverdict form was unclear as to who was the actual defendant in the case. We find\r\nthis issue is not preserved. Father contends the verdict form was ambiguous\r\nbecause it allowed the jury to find \"against Defendant Hunt,\" but erroneously\r\nincluded Son's name as well as Father within the caption. However, Father did not\r\nobject to the caption form until after the verdict had been read. See Johnson, 317\r\nS.C. at 421, 453 S.E.2d at 912 (holding that by failing to object to a verdict form\r\nuntil after the verdict had been reached, a party failed to preserve any issue relating\r\nto the verdict form).\r\n\r\n      B.     Admission of Improper Testimony\r\n\r\n       Father additionally argues the circuit court erred in failing to grant a new\r\ntrial based on references to Son's drinking after the circuit court had ruled that\r\nevidence of Son's intoxication was inadmissible. However, Father did not move\r\nfor a mistrial, nor did he object to the curative instructions given to the jury after\r\nhis objections, and he is therefore precluded from making those arguments before\r\nthis Court. Accordingly, this issue also is not preserved. See Elam v. S.C. Dept. of\r\nTransp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue\r\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\n    IV.    PUNITIVE DAMAGES\r\n\r\n      Father finally argues the circuit court erred in allowing punitive damages to\r\nbe assessed against him under the family purpose doctrine. We agree.\r\n\r\n       This is a question of first impression in this State. Only a limited number of\r\njurisdictions have adopted the family purpose doctrine.3 See Jacobson v. Superior\r\n\r\n3 Although the family purpose remains viable in this State and its validity has not\r\nbeen challenged here, we recognize it has been widely criticized as an outmoded\r\njudicial construct. See F.P. Hubbard & R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of\r\nTorts 747 (4th ed. 2011) (\"Most jurisdictions have rejected the family purpose\r\ndoctrine largely on the grounds that it is a fiction developed to address motor\r\nvehicle accidents and that it is not necessary with insurance generally available\r\n\nCourt, 743 P.2d 410, 414 n.1 (Az. Ct. App. 1987) (noting that only Arizona,\r\nColorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Mexico, North\r\nCarolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and\r\nWest Virginia have adopted the family purpose doctrine). Of those states, only\r\ntwo have addressed whether punitive damages should be allowed and both have\r\nanswered that question in the negative.\r\n\r\n       In Byrne v. Bordeaux, 354 S.E.2d 277 (N.C. Ct. App. 1987), the North\r\nCarolina Court of Appeals concluded without much discussion that punitive\r\ndamages should not be allowed in this context by noting simply that although the\r\nfamily purpose doctrine may be well established within that state, it is not without\r\nits limits. Id. at 279. In acknowledging the boundaries of the doctrine, it cited to\r\nGrindstaff v. Watts, 119 S.E.2d 784 (N.C. 1961), where the court had previously\r\ndiscussed the doctrine's tenuous validity by stating, \"The doctrine undoubtedly\r\ninvolves a novel application of the rule of respondeat superior and may, perhaps,\r\nbe regarded as straining that rule unduly. It is a deviation from the ordinary\r\nprinciples of respondeat superior and has been severely criticized in some\r\nquarters.\" Id. at 787 (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals of Arizona offered a more detailed analysis regarding\r\nits rejection of punitive damages under the doctrine in Jacobsen. It noted that\r\nalthough the family purpose doctrine \"reli[ed] on agency principles for its\r\ncredibility, its social usefulness is its primary justification.\" Jacobsen, 743 P.2d at\r\n411. Additionally, it acknowledged that in Arizona the concept of punitive\r\ndamages was based on a finding that the wrongful acts were \"guided by evil\r\nmotives\" and was designed to punish the wrongdoer as well as deter him and\r\nothers from similar conduct. Id. at 411–12. Although Arizona allows punitive\r\ndamages against a principal for the torts of an agent, the court reasoned the factual\r\ndistinctions between agency and the family purpose doctrine militated against\r\nallowing punitive damages in cases based on the family purpose doctrine. Id. at\r\n412. A principal derives economic benefits from the acts of the agent and has\r\n\r\nunder today's owner consent statutes.\"); R. E. Barber, Comment note, Modern\r\nStatus of Family Purpose Doctrine with Respect to Motor Vehicles, 8 A.L.R.3d\r\n1191 (1966) (noting that courts rejecting the theory have both attacked its\r\ntheoretical basis in the law of agency and considered that any policy justifications\r\nfor it could be better satisfied in some other manner, such as legislation); see also 6\r\nBlashfield Automobile Law & Practice § 257 (4th ed. 2011) (\"At best, the family\r\npurpose doctrine is an anomaly in the law.\").\r\n\nmore leeway in defining the bounds of employment than a head of household may\r\nhave when merely providing a vehicle for the convenience of the family. Id.\r\nBecause punitive damages are designed to punish the actual tortfeasor, any\r\nimputation to another party should be limited. Id. Thus, the court concluded that\r\nallowing punitive damages under the family purpose doctrine did not serve the\r\nobjective of punishing the wrongdoer and it found no reason to make an exception\r\nsimply because the doctrine is nominally based on agency. Id. at 413.\r\n\r\n       We agree with these courts' reasoning that the family purpose doctrine's\r\nreliance on agency principles is somewhat of a legal fiction which cannot logically\r\nbe extended to allow recovery of punitive damages. The parallel between a\r\nparental relationship and an employment relationship can only be stretched so far.\r\nA principal can dictate the parameters of the use of a vehicle more narrowly than a\r\nparent who merely allows his child to use a car for the convenience of the family.\r\nMoreover, because a principal stands to gain financially from the actions of an\r\nagent, it makes more sense to allow additional monetary damages in the form of\r\npunitive damages against a principal.\r\n\r\n        Gause also argues that punitive damages should be allowed because they\r\nserve to vindicate the private rights of the injured party and are not solely for\r\npunishment of the tortfeasor, citing to our recent decision in O'Neill v. Smith, 388\r\nS.C. 246, 695 S.E.2d 531 (2010). We agree that punitive damages serve multiple\r\npurposes; however, we find O'Neill distinguishable. In that case, we answered a\r\nspecific certified question regarding whether plaintiffs could pursue punitive\r\ndamages against their own underinsured motorist insurance company where they\r\nhad signed a covenant not to execute after settling with defendant's liability\r\ncompany. Id. at 248, 695 S.E.2d at 532. There, the insurance company was\r\nattempting to escape liability and avoid vindicating the rights of its own insured.\r\nWe view that situation as being decidedly different than a parent providing a\r\nvehicle to a grown but dependent child to drive. The family purpose doctrine\r\nitself is a mechanism to allow the vindication of the rights of an injured party by\r\nimputing liability onto the likely more solvent parents. However, we decline to be\r\nthe first state to expand that doctrine to encompass an award of punitive damages\r\nagainst the parent.\r\n\n                             CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we reverse the award of punitive damages and\r\naffirm the circuit court on the remaining issues.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J.,\r\ndissenting in separate opinions.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent. I would find that the facts of\r\nthe instant case do not support application of the family purpose doctrine, and\r\nwould reverse.

The Family Purpose Doctrine\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, a brief review of this Court's family purpose doctrine\r\njurisprudence demonstrates the doctrine's inapplicability to this case.\r\n\r\n        The introduction of the motor vehicle, and inevitable accidents that\r\nfollowed, required the creation of new principles of law. See William W. Wilkins,\r\nJr., The Family Purpose Doctrine, 18 S.C.L. Rev. 638, 638 (1966). One such\r\ncreation, the family purpose doctrine, involved the stretching of agency principles\r\nto fix liability against the purchaser and title holder of a vehicle obtained for the\r\nuse and pleasure of his family for negligent acts committed by members of the\r\nfamily while using the vehicle for general family purposes. Id. at 639.\r\n\r\n       In Davis v. Littlefield, 97 S.C. 171, 81 S.E. 487 (1914), this Court adopted\r\nthe family purpose doctrine. That case provides a clear illustration of the doctrine's\r\napplication. In that case, the defendant, A.S. Littlefield (A.S.), rented a house in\r\nAiken and established his family home there. Id. at 171, 81 S.E. at 487. However,\r\nA.S. spent most of his time in Chicago, while his wife and son, Randolph\r\nLittlefield (Randolph), resided in Aiken. Id. at 171–72, 81 S.E. at 487. A.S.\r\nprovided a vehicle, \"for the health and pleasure,\" of his family. Id. at 172, 81 S.E.\r\nat 487.On February 13, 1912, while A.S. was in Chicago, Randolph took the\r\nvehicle to visit friends at an Aiken hotel. Id. His mother did not accompany him.\r\nDuring the trip, Randolph encountered Alonzo Davis who was driving a pair of\r\nmules. Id. It is unclear what happened when Randolph and Davis came upon each\r\nother, but as a result, Davis's mules ran away. Id. Davis was thrown from his\r\nmules and alleged injury. Id. Davis brought suit against A.S. and Randolph,\r\nclaiming that Randolph occupied the position of servant to his father in operating\r\nthe vehicle, and that both men should be held responsible. Id.\r\n\r\n      This Court viewed the underlying \"purpose\" for owning the car as essential:\r\n\r\n      The sole purpose of having the car was for the pleasure of the family.\r\n      The family, for whose use the car was sent, consisted of Mrs.\r\n\n      Littlefield and three sons, two of whom were college students and\r\n      only in Aiken for a short time. The principal use, therefore, was for\r\n      the wife and this son Randolph, who drove the car on the day of the\r\n      accident. The wife was not in good health and used the car but little,\r\n      and then Randolph drove. The family use, therefore, consisted mainly\r\n      in Randolph's use.\r\n\r\nId. at 176, 81 S.E. at 488. The Court held that Randolph operated the vehicle in\r\nfurtherance of his father's sole purpose in providing the vehicle, and therefore, A.S.\r\ncould be held responsible for the acts of his \"servant:\"\r\n\r\n      The general proposition that a servant, in the transaction of his\r\n      master's business, shall have no purpose of his own is nowhere\r\n      maintained. When a master sends his servant to town on the master's\r\n      business, we know of no court that has held that, if the servant is\r\n      induced to go mainly because he wants to make purchases for himself,\r\n      the private purpose of the servant will relieve the master from liability\r\n      for the negligence of his servant in the conduct of the master's\r\n      business. The parent is not liable for the negligence of the child by\r\n      reason of the relation of parent and child, yet if the child is the agent\r\n      of the father, then the existence of the relation of parent and child does\r\n      not destroy the liability of the principal for the acts of the agent.\r\n\r\nId. at 177, 81 S.E. at 488; see also Mooney v. Gilreath, 124 S.C. 1, 7, 117 S.E. 186,\r\n188 (1923) (\"But, whether the defendant was sole or part owner of the car, we\r\nthink the evidence was reasonably susceptible of the inference that it had been\r\nacquired and was kept and used by the defendant for a purpose that he had as much\r\nright to make his business as he had to run a jitney line—the convenience and\r\npleasure of his family, of which his minor son . . . was a member.\").\r\n\r\n      In Porter v. Hardee, 241 S.C. 474, 129 S.E.2d 131 (1963), the defendant,\r\nLeon Hardee, Sr. (Leon Sr.), appealed from a judgment finding him liable for\r\npersonal injuries sustained by the plaintiff when her vehicle collided with an\r\nautomobile registered to Hardee, but driven by his minor son, Leon Hardee Jr.\r\n(Leon Jr.).\r\n\r\n       Leon Jr. testified at trial that he lived with his father and that Leon Jr.\r\npurchased the automobile two weeks prior to the accident. Id. at 476, 129 S.E.2d\r\nat 131–32. According to Leon Jr., he placed title in his father's name because of\r\nhis status as a minor. Id. at 476, 129 S.E.2d at 132. Leon Jr. testified that his\r\n\nfather maintained an automobile used by the family, but that Leon Jr. had exclusive\r\nuse of the vehicle involved in the accident. Id. at 476–77, 129 S.E.2d at 132 (\"The\r\ntestimony for the plaintiff, which was corroborated by that of the defendant,\r\ntherefore, shows that . . . the automobile in question was not provided, maintained,\r\nor used by the defendant for general family purposes.\"). This Court held that\r\nliability could not be imposed upon Leon Sr. in the absence of evidence that he\r\nmaintained or furnished the vehicle for his family's use:\r\n\r\n      A necessary requisite to the imposition of liability under the family\r\n      purpose doctrine, therefore, is that the head of the family own,\r\n      maintain, or furnish the automobile and, where the head of the family\r\n      does not own, maintain, or furnish the automobile for general family\r\n      use, he is not liable.\r\n\r\nId. at 477, 129 S.E.2d at 132 (citing 60 C.J.S. Motor Vehicles § 433). This Court\r\nrejected the plaintiff's argument that because the car was registered in Leon Sr.'s\r\nname, and that his son resided in the home, a presumption arose that the son was\r\nLeon Sr.'s agent at the time of the collision, relying in part on Mooney v. Gilreath,\r\nsupra:The facts of the foregoing cases clearly distinguish them from the\r\n      present case . . . . [A]ny presumption that may have arisen from the\r\n      proof of the foregoing facts was clearly rebutted by the uncontradicted\r\n      testimony of the witness for the plaintiff, by which she was bound,\r\n      that the car was in fact owned by son and was not maintained or\r\n      furnished by the defendant for general family use.\r\n\r\nId. at 477–78, 129 S.E.2d at 132 (remanding for entry of judgment in favor of the\r\ndefendant); see also Lollar v. Dewitt, 255 S.C. 452, 456, 179 S.E.2d 607, 608\r\n(1971) (\"The family purpose doctrine has been adopted in this state. Basically,\r\nunder this doctrine, where the head of the family owns, furnishes and maintains a\r\nvehicle for the general use, pleasure and convenience of the family, he is liable for\r\nthe negligence of a member of the family having general authority to drive it while\r\nthe vehicle is being so used.\" (emphasis added) (citations omitted)); but see Lucht\r\nv. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127,133, 221 S.E.2d 854, 857 (1976) (affirming the trial\r\ncourt's application of the family purpose doctrine, and stating, \"Further, the\r\ntestimony is uncontradicted that the boy was seventeen years old and a student\r\nliving at home with his parents. The father agreed he bought the car for the use of\r\nhis son, and that it was used practically exclusively by the son except on occasions\r\nwhen the father drove the car.\")).\r\n\n       This Court's decisions analyzing the family purpose doctrine provide three\r\ngeneral requirements for its application: (1) the automobile must have been\r\nmaintained by the owner for the pleasure and use of her family at the time of the\r\naccident; (2) the vehicle in question must have been used by a member of the\r\nowner's family at the time of the accident; and (3) the vehicle must have been used\r\nwith the permission, either express or implied, of the owner, at the time of the\r\naccident. See Wilkins, 18 S.C.L. Rev. at 641. (\"When these three requirements\r\nhave been met, the doctrine can be imposed. Liability is founded on the use of the\r\nvehicle for the purpose for which it was provided and not the existence of the\r\nfamily relationship.\").\r\n\r\n       In my view, an important, and pertinent, aspect of the doctrine is its\r\nindivisibility. Basically, general agency principles allow a plaintiff to pursue\r\nrecovery against the principal or agent, and under the family purpose doctrine, the\r\nprincipal's liability is directly premised on the agent's liability.\r\n\r\n      In Player v. Thompson, 259 S.C. 600, 193 S.E.2d 531 (1972), minor Diane\r\nPlayer was injured in a one-car automobile collision with a mailbox and fence\r\nwhile a guest passenger in an automobile driven by Nancy Carder, a minor, and\r\nowned by Bobby and Geraldine Thompson (collectively, the Thompsons). The\r\nguardian ad litem (GAL), on Player's behalf, sued Carder for damages, alleging\r\nCarder operated the vehicle recklessly. Id. at 604, 193 S.E.2d at 533. Player also\r\nsought to hold the Thompsons liable under the family purpose doctrine. Id. at\r\n604–05, 193 S.E.2d at 533.\r\n\r\n        At the conclusion of Player's case, the trial court held that Carder did not\r\noperate the vehicle recklessly or heedlessly, and that her conduct was not the\r\nproximate cause of the injuries sustained. Id. at 605, 193 S.E.2d at 533. The trial\r\ncourt granted Carder and the Thompsons' motions for nonsuit, holding that the\r\nThompsons \"could not be held liable unless the driver Carder could be held liable.\"\r\nId. at 610, 193 S.E.2d at 536. This Court reversed the trial court's decision\r\nregarding Carder's recklessness, but agreed that the Thompsons' liability was\r\npremised on Carder's liability:\r\n\r\n      The trial judge granted the motion for a nonsuit as to [the Thompsons]\r\n      because they could not be held liable unless the driver Carder could be\r\n      held liable. He did not grant the motion on the ground that the family\r\n      purpose doctrine was not applicable . . . . Inasmuch as the motion\r\n      should not have been granted as to Carder, the motion should not have\r\n      been granted as to [the Thompsons]. We do not mean to intimate that\r\n\n      the motion for a nonsuit as to [the Thompsons] should not have been\r\n      granted on the theory of the family purpose doctrine . . . . On a new\r\n      trial, after the plaintiff's testimony has been submitted, [the\r\n      Thompsons] may renew their motion, inasmuch as the same was not\r\n      ruled upon in the first trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 610–11, 193 S.E.2d at 536 (alterations added).\r\n\r\n       In Jordan v. Payton, 305 S.C. 537, 409 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App. 1991), the\r\nrespondent sued the appellant, a minor child, alleging that the child lost control of\r\nhis vehicle and struck respondent's house. The respondent joined the appellant's\r\nlegal guardian as a defendant, alleging that the guardian provided the appellant\r\nwith the vehicle \"for family purposes.\" Id. at 538, 409 S.E.2d at 793. Neither the\r\nappellant nor the guardian answered. Id. The circuit court found them in default\r\nand referred the case to a master-in-equity for a damages hearing. Id. The Master\r\ngranted the respondent a default judgment which the respondent and the guardian\r\nmoved to set aside. Id. The Master denied their motion, and they appealed. Id.\r\n\r\n        The court of appeals reversed on two grounds. First, the minor was not\r\nrepresented by a GAL in the action. Id. Rule 55 of the South Carolina Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure provides that \"[N]o judgment by default shall be entered against a\r\nminor . . . unless represented in the action by a [GAL] who has appeared therein.\"\r\nId. at 538, 409 S.E.2d at 793–94 (citing Rule 55, SCRCP). Therefore, the court of\r\nappeals voided the default judgment. Id. at 538–39, 409 S.E.2d 794. Second, the\r\ncourt held if the child could not be held liable, neither could the guardian, and\r\nprovided a perceptive summary of the law on this point:\r\n\r\n      The judgment must also be set aside as to [the guardian]. Her alleged\r\n      liability is based on the family purpose doctrine. As we have said, no\r\n      independent basis for her liability is alleged. \"The doctrine is based\r\n      on the theory that one 'who has made it his business to furnish a car\r\n      for the use of his family is liable as principal or master when such\r\n      business is being carried out by a family member using the vehicle for\r\n      its intended purpose.'\" Quite obviously, the liability of [the guardian]\r\n      depends upon the liability of the child. Therefore, the judgment must\r\n      be valid against both or it is valid against neither.\r\n\r\nId. at 539, 409 S.E.2d at 794 (citation omitted); see also Unisun Ins. v. Hawkins,\r\n342 S.C. 537, 543–44, 537 S.E.2d 559, 562–63 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. dismissed,\r\n350 S.C. 6, 564 S.E.2d 676 (2002) (\"The court . . . held that even had Unisun\r\n\nproperly pled a cause of action under [the family purpose doctrine] Unisun's\r\nrecovery was barred because the Hawkinses' liability was derivative of Bruce's.\r\nThus, the trial court reasoned, if the statute of limitations ran against Bruce, it\r\nnecessarily ran against the Hawkinses'. Unisun, however, failed to appeal the\r\nunderlying ruling . . . . Hence, it is the law of the case.\" (alterations added)).\r\n\r\n       In my view, the foregoing cases, when taken together, stand for the\r\nproposition that liability under the family purpose doctrine is indivisible. This\r\ndoes not mean that a plaintiff must pursue a claim against both the principal and\r\nthe agent. However, in my opinion, this does mean that a plaintiff may not pursue\r\na claim against the principal when an action for liability against the servant cannot\r\nbe maintained either due to substance or procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                II.   Failure to dismiss\r\n\r\n       From my perspective, the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the action as a\r\nresult of Son's removal as a defendant.\r\n\r\n       On November 2, 2006, Gause sued Smithers, the driver of the vehicle that\r\nrear-ended him, and Father. Gause alleged that Father acted negligently on the\r\nnight of the accident, and that Father's actions were the proximate cause of Gause's\r\ninjuries. On December 4, 2006, Father submitted an Answer denying Gause's\r\nallegations, and moved for a dismissal. Father admitted that he owned the vehicle,\r\nbut asserted that Son drove the vehicle on the night in question. Gause amended\r\nhis complaint to include Son. Father and Son moved to dismiss based on Gause's\r\nfailure to commence the action against them within the applicable statute of\r\nlimitations. The court granted the motion as to Son only, and denied Gause's\r\nmotion for reconsideration. The trial proceeded against Father, and at the close of\r\nall evidence, Father's counsel moved for nonsuit:\r\n\r\n      Your Honor, we would also move that your Honor dismiss the case as\r\n      an involuntary nonsuit issue based on the fact that the parent child\r\n      family purpose doctrine is an indivisible situation. You can't have\r\n      family purpose liability without the child involved who was alleged to\r\n      be the wrongdoer and we, we rely on the case of Payton v. Jordan.\r\n\r\n      Gause's counsel responded,\r\n\n      Also subsequent to that [a] case came out in South Carolina . . . that\r\n      says when you have vicarious liability you don't have to sue the agent.\r\n      You can sue the principal for the acts of the agent and so we believe\r\n      that law is controlling.\r\n\r\n        The trial court denied the motion. In my opinion, this was error. Gause's\r\ncounsel is correct that under the theory of vicarious liability a plaintiff may sue\r\neither the principal or the agent. However, an important nuance to this standard is\r\nthat the principal cannot be held liable for acts committed by the agent if the agent\r\nis not himself liable for those acts. See Johnson v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 142\r\nS.C. 125, 133, 140 S.E. 443, 445 (1927) (\"When the master and the servant are\r\nsued together for the same act of negligence or willful tort, and the master's\r\nliability rests solely upon the servant's conduct, a verdict against the master alone\r\nis illogical and cannot stand.\"). This notion is particularly valid under our family\r\npurpose doctrine jurisprudence described supra. See Player, 251 S.C. at 610–11,\r\n193 S.E.2d at 536; Unisun, 342 S.C. at 543–44, 537 S.E.2d at 562–63.\r\n\r\n        The majority distinguishes the instant case from Jordan v. Payton, supra,\r\nbecause, \"Son's dismissal from the action was not grounded on a finding of no\r\nliability.\" Respectfully, in my opinion, this is no distinction at all. In Jordan, the\r\ncourt did not base the dismissal of the default judgment against the child on a\r\nfinding of \"no liability,\" but instead of the procedural commands of Rule 55,\r\nSCRCP. This is analogous to a dismissal pursuant to an applicable statute of\r\nlimitations, as in the instant case, or failure to perfect service of process. See\r\nMedlin v. Church, 278 S.E.2d 747, 750 (Ga. 1981) (\"Since service was not\r\nperfected upon appellant's son according to statute, the judgment entered jointly\r\nagainst both appellant and his son must be reversed as to the son. Being indivisible\r\nunder these circumstances, the judgment must also be reversed as to appellant.\").\r\n\r\n        In my opinion, Son's inclusion as a witness compounds the error in this case,\r\nand sets a dangerous precedent for future bootstrapping by plaintiffs. Simply put,\r\nif a plaintiff is foreclosed from establishing liability against the agent, she may\r\nsimply sue the principal and call the agent as a witness. This testimony alone,\r\nthough not serving as the basis for the jury's verdict, may then be used to place\r\nliability on the principal. To the extent the family purpose doctrine is an extension\r\nof traditional agency principles, the facts of the instant case, and the majority's\r\nresulting formulation, represent a bridge too far.\r\n\n       In my view, this trial should not have proceeded following Son's removal\r\nfrom the action, and the trial court's attempt to engineer a bypass around this fact\r\ndoes not cure the error. I would hold that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss\r\nthe action against Father.      III.   Directed Verdict\r\n        The majority concludes that Gause presented sufficient evidence of Father's\r\nliability under the family purpose doctrine. I disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n   A. Applicability of Family Purpose Doctrine\r\n\r\n       According to the majority, Father admitted Son lived in a motor home\r\nadjacent to Father's home at the time of the accident, and received electricity for\r\nthat motor home from Father's home. Additionally, Father admitted he held title to\r\nthe Firebird, that he could have taken the car away from Son if he wanted, and that\r\nSon used the Firebird because Father and Father's wife were tired of having to\r\ndrive Son around. In my opinion, this is a rather broad summary of Father's\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n        My review of the Record shows that Father also testified at trial that he\r\npurchased the Firebird in 1992, and that originally Father and his wife used the\r\nvehicle. In 2003, Father allowed Son to use the car to drive to work, and as\r\nplaintiff's counsel pointed out, Father permitted Son to use the car \"for that\r\npurpose, because . . . [Father] and his wife had been taking care of that purpose\r\nuntil that time.\" Father originally intended to maintain the car in good condition so\r\nthat it could eventually be classified as an antique. However, Father agreed to sell\r\nthe Firebird to his son, although he retained title in his name and a set of keys.\r\nPrior to the accident, Son paid $200 towards the purchase. Father testified that Son\r\ncompleted all maintenance on the Firebird, and that the Firebird was not for the\r\ngeneral use of the family, but instead was for Son's exclusive use.\r\n\r\n       Son testified that on the night of the accident he visited an adult\r\nentertainment establishment and departed the establishment sometime between\r\napproximately 3:00 and 5:00 a.m. Son slept in his car and then began the drive\r\nhome. He was later stopped by police.\r\n\n       In my opinion, these facts do not place this case within the ambit of the\r\nfamily purpose doctrine. Father did not maintain or provide the Firebird for the\r\nuse of the family, but agreed to sell the vehicle to Son for his exclusive use. Father\r\nthen agreed to sell the vehicle to Son prior to the accident. Our precedent has\r\nrestricted application of the family purpose doctrine to those circumstances where\r\nthe vehicle is generally for a family's common use. See Davis, 97 S.C. at 176, 81\r\nS.E. at 487 (noting that the father provided the vehicle for the \"health and\r\npleasure,\" of his family); Porter v. Hardee, 241 S.C. at 477, 129 S.E.2d at 132\r\n(denying liability under the family purpose doctrine where the plaintiff could not\r\nestablish that defendant provided the vehicle for \"general family purposes\");\r\nLollar, 255 S.C. at 456, 179 S.E.2d at 608 (\"Basically, under this doctrine, where\r\nthe head of the family, owns, furnishes, and maintains a vehicle for the general\r\nuse, pleasure, and convenience of the family, he is liable for the negligence of a\r\nmember of the family having general authority to drive it.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, the Son's stated purpose at the time of his arrest was to return\r\nhome from visiting an adult entertainment establishment. There is no evidence in\r\nthe Record that the Father authorized this type of trip as part of any general family\r\npurpose. To the contrary, the only explicit family purpose identified at trial was\r\nfor Son's travel to and from his place of employment. See, e.g., Player, 259 S.C. at\r\n605, 193 S.E.2d at 533 (\"Defendant . . . furnished an automobile for family\r\npurposes to his then-estranged wife, Geraldine Thompson. At the time of the\r\ncollision, Nancy Carder was staying at the home of Geraldine Thompson. Mrs.\r\nThompson requested that Nancy Carder go to the store for her and entrusted her\r\nwith the automobile.\")\r\n\r\n       The family purpose doctrine's rationale demands restrictive application. The\r\nintent of the doctrine is to fix liability on the owner of a vehicle provided for\r\nfamily use when a member of the family operates the vehicle in a negligent manner\r\nand injures a third party. The doctrine is not intended to facilitate judicial intrusion\r\ninto familial affairs and the personal decisions families make regarding vehicle\r\nownership and other business matters. The majority's analysis allows liability in a\r\nmore expansive range of circumstances than originally supported by the doctrine,\r\nor established in this Court's precedent.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, from my perspective, the family purpose doctrine is inapplicable\r\nto the instant case, and the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in Father's\r\nfavor.\r\n\n   B. Proximate Cause\r\n\r\n       In the majority's view, Son's actions were the proximate cause of Gause's\r\ninjury. According to the majority, \"it is reasonably foreseeable that by remaining\r\nin a lane of traffic, another car could crash into the back of the police cruiser that\r\nhad pulled him over.\" However, this addresses only part of the proximate cause\r\nanalysis. In my opinion, Smithers's negligent actions were not reasonably\r\nforeseeable given the circumstances. However, even if those actions were\r\nreasonably foreseeable, the facts of this case do not support a finding that Son's\r\nactions were the cause-in-fact of Gause's injuries.\r\n\r\n       Proximate cause requires proof of: (1) causation-in-fact and (2) legal cause.\r\nBramlette v. Charter–Med.–Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 72, 393 S.E.2d 914, 916\r\n(1990). Causation-in-fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have\r\noccurred \"but for\" the defendant's negligence, and legal cause is proved by\r\nestablishing foreseeability. Id. \"A prior and remote cause cannot be made the\r\nbasis of an action if such remote cause did nothing more than furnish the condition\r\nor give rise to the occasion by which the injury was made possible, if there\r\nintervened between such prior or remote cause and the injury a distinct, successive,\r\nunrelated and efficient cause of the injury, even though such injury would not have\r\nhappened but for such condition or occasion.\" Driggers v. City of Florence, 190\r\nS.C. 309, 313, 2 S.E.2d 790, 791 (1939) (emphasis added). Evidence of an\r\nindependent negligent act of a third party is directed to the question of proximate\r\ncause. Matthews v. Porter, 239 S.C. 620, 628, 124 S.E.2d 321, 325 (1962). To\r\nexculpate a negligent defendant, the intervening cause must be one which breaks\r\nthe sequence or causal connection between the defendant's negligence and the\r\ninjury alleged. Id. The superseding act must so intervene as to exclude the\r\nnegligence of the defendant as one of the proximate causes of the injury. Id.\r\n\r\n       In Matthews, the respondent, Jacqueline Matthews, brought an action for\r\ndamages caused by the alleged negligence and willfulness of Grover Porter. Id. at\r\n622–23, 124 S.E.2d at 322. On December 25, 1957, at approximately 10:30 p.m.,\r\nPorter's vehicle collided with a vehicle driven by Issac Singletary. Id. at 623, 124\r\nS.E.2d at 322. The vehicles came to rest on the highway, and Porter's vehicle\r\nblocked the eastbound lane of traffic. Id. Matthews was riding in a vehicle\r\ntraveling in a westerly direction and arrived at the scene of the collision soon after\r\nit occurred. Id. Matthews's vehicle stopped on the eastern side of the collision\r\nscene and Matthews got out of the car to offer her assistance to a physician who\r\nhad arrived on the scene. Id. Matthews was standing beside Porter's vehicle when\r\nanother vehicle, driven by Lewis McKnight, skidded sideways down the highway,\r\n\nand pinned Matthews between McKnight's vehicle and Porter's vehicle. Id.\r\nMcKnight would later testify at trial that the night was \"dark, foggy, and a\r\ndrizzling rain was falling.\" Id. at 629, 124 S.E.2d at 325.\r\n\r\n       Matthews alleged that Porter acted negligently in permitting his vehicle to\r\nblock the highway so that others could not safely pass, and in failing to warn\r\napproaching vehicles of the blocked highway. Id. at 623, 124 S.E.2d at 322–23.\r\nPorter alleged that Singletary solely and proximately caused the accident between\r\ntheir two vehicles, and that McKnight solely and proximately caused the second\r\ncollision between Porter and McKnight's vehicles. Id. at 624, 124 S.E.2d 323.\r\nPorter also claimed that police controlled the scene and all traffic thereabout at the\r\ntime of Matthews's injury, and that his injuries rendered him incapable of removing\r\nhis automobile from the scene. Id.\r\n\r\n       At trial, a highway patrolman testified that he found debris from the collision\r\nin the lane of travel Singletary occupied. Id. at 625, 124 S.E.2d at 323–24. This\r\nCourt relied on this fact, coupled with Singletary's testimony regarding Porter's\r\nnegligence, in holding that sufficient evidence supported the trial court's finding\r\nthat Porter caused the initial accident. Id. at 625–26, 124 S.E.2d at 324. However,\r\nPorter argued that even if he caused the accident with Singletary, McKnight's\r\nintervening negligence insulated his own negligent actions. Id. at 626, 124 S.E.2d\r\nat 324. This Court disagreed, relying primarily on Porter's duty to warn, the\r\nweather conditions at the time of the accident, and Porter's discredited testimony\r\nthat his injuries from the accident rendered him unable to provide the necessary\r\nwarning to oncoming motorists:\r\n\r\n      In an action for injury alleged to be due to the neglect of a duty on the\r\n      part of the defendant, it is no defense that a similar duty rested upon\r\n      another person. One upon whom the law devolves a duty cannot shift\r\n      it to another, so as to exonerate himself from the consequence of its\r\n      nonperformance. Since [Porter's] negligence had caused the highway\r\n      at the scene of the collision to be blocked, it was his duty to warn\r\n      others using the highway of the dangerous condition he had created.\r\n      He could not delegate this duty to another, even though he was a law\r\n      enforcement officer, and escape the consequences for its\r\n      nonperformance by such officer. [Porter] asserts also that he was so\r\n      disabled in the first collision that he was unable to give a warning that\r\n      the road was obstructed. The respondent testified that [Porter] was\r\n      outside of his car and walking around and that, \"I asked Mr. Porter if\r\n      he wanted to sit down, and he said: 'No, I will stand here. I am all\r\n\n      right.'\" This witness further testified that [Porter] wasn't being held up\r\n      and that he was standing beside his car. This testimony raised a\r\n      question of fact as to whether [Porter] was so disabled that he could\r\n      not give warning of the dangerous condition that had been created by\r\n      his negligence.\r\n\r\nId. at 631, 124 S.E.2d at 327.\r\n\r\n       The Matthews case is a prime illustration of the requisite prongs of the\r\nproximate cause inquiry. Porter caused an accident through negligent operation of\r\nhis automobile, and then neglected his duty to warn others of the chaotic scene\r\ncreated by his actions. It is reasonably foreseeable that injuries may occur from a\r\nvehicle left idle on a highway in adverse weather conditions. Furthermore,\r\nMatthews's injuries involved a collision between McKnight's vehicle and Porter's\r\nvehicle. Thus, \"but for\" Porter's failure to move his vehicle, when he undoubtedly\r\ncould have, Matthews would not have been harmed.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, I find the court of appeals' decision in Gibson v. Gross, 280\r\nS.C. 194, 311 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 1984), persuasive.\r\n\r\n       In that case, the respondent, Gross, struck a telephone pole with his car, and\r\nsubsequently collided with a car driven by Newland. Id. at 195, 311 S.E.2d at 737.\r\nAnother driver at the scene, Bennett, alleged that Gross's vehicle struck his vehicle,\r\nas well, and an argument ensued. Id. Gibson, the appellant, noticed the altercation\r\nand stopped his vehicle to intervene. Id. After halting the argument, Gibson was\r\nstruck by a vehicle driven by Edwards. Id. at 195, 311 S.E.2d at 737–38. Gibson\r\nalleged that Gross was negligent in failing to move his automobile off the highway,\r\nand warn others that his car blocked the roadway. Id. at 196, 311 S.E.2d at 738.\r\nThe court of appeals disagreed, finding that Gross could not have foreseen that his\r\nconduct would cause injury to a person in Gibson's circumstances. The court\r\nmeasured Gibson's claim against the standard articulated in Stone v. Bethea, 251\r\nS.C. 157, 161–62, 161 S.E.2d 171, 173 (1968), and reasoned:\r\n\r\n      The test, therefore, by which the negligent conduct of the original\r\n      wrongdoer is to be insulated as a matter of law by the independent\r\n      negligent act of another, is whether the intervening act and the injury\r\n      resulting therefrom are of such character that the author of the primary\r\n      negligence should have reasonably foreseen and anticipated them in\r\n      light of attendant circumstances. The law requires only reasonable\r\n      foresight, and when the injury complained of is not reasonably\r\n\n      foreseeable, in the exercise of due care there is no liability. One is not\r\n      charged with foreseeing that which is unpredictable or that which\r\n      could not be expected to happen. When the negligence appears\r\n      merely to have brought about a condition of affairs, or a situation in\r\n      which another and entirely independent and efficient agency\r\n      intervenes to cause the injury, the latter is to be deemed the direct or\r\n      proximate cause, and the former only the indirect or remote cause.\r\n\r\nGibson, 280 S.C. at 197, 311 S.E.2d at 738–39.\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, Gause, and one other police officer, responded to a\r\ndispatch call requesting assistance for a highway patrolman who stopped Son on\r\nsuspicion of drunk driving. According to Gause's trial testimony, the highway\r\npatrolman's vehicle and Son's vehicle both occupied the left lane of traffic on the\r\nfour lane highway. The highway patrolman informed the police officers that \"there\r\nwere issues,\" with Son's ability to drive the Firebird, and requested their assistance\r\nin \"taking [Son] off the road for the evening.\" The police officers placed Son\r\nunder arrest, and Gause remained at the scene while his fellow police officer\r\ntransported Son to a detention center. Gause then pulled his vehicle directly\r\nbehind Son's abandoned vehicle, remaining in the left lane of traffic, and waited for\r\na tow truck to arrive. Gause testified that his only attempt to secure the scene and\r\nwarn oncoming motorists was to turn on his hazard lights and keep his \"blue lights\r\nrunning,\" because at his location he \"lit up the road.\" Five to ten minutes later,\r\nSmithers's vehicle collided with Gause's vehicle, and pushed Gause's vehicle into\r\nSon's Firebird. Smithers was intoxicated and did not reduce his speed prior to the\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\n       Son's negligent conduct may have created the conditions for Gause's injury,\r\nbut is not the proximate cause of those injuries. It is not reasonably foreseeable\r\nthat following Son's initial stop, the police would leave Son's vehicle sitting in the\r\nlane of traffic, and then proceed to place a police vehicle behind the car without\r\nany other warning to oncoming motorists. Although Gause testified that police\r\npolicy directed officers to refrain from driving an arrestee's vehicle, this says\r\nnothing of his actions related to his own vehicle immediately after Son's arrest. In\r\nmy view, actions by law enforcement and Smithers served as intervening acts\r\nsimilar to that in Gibson, but dissimilar from the scenario in Matthews. The\r\nmajority's formulation ignores these intervening acts which I believe transformed\r\nSon's acts from a possible \"but for\" cause, to an indirect cause. Unlike the factual\r\nscenario in Matthews, Son did not neglect his duty to warn others, and was\r\nremoved from the scene prior to several intervening acts occurring after his arrest.\r\n\n       I agree with the majority's opinion regarding the danger of leaving a vehicle\r\nstanding in the traveled portion of a highway. However, this danger does not\r\npermit ignoring a critical component of our proximate cause standard. Thus, in my\r\nview, although there may be evidence of Son's negligence, the evidence in this case\r\nwas insufficient to raise a jury question as to whether his negligence caused\r\nGause's injuries. Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 388, 529 S.E.2d 528, 538 (2000)\r\n(citing Horton v. Greyhound, 241 S.C. 430, 441, 128 S.E.2d 776, 782 (1962)); see\r\nalso Odom v. Steigerwald, 260 S.C. 422, 427–28, 196 S.E.2d 635, 638 (1973)\r\n(\"Even if it was determined that the plaintiff was negligent, there was still one\r\nadditional question to be answered before the plaintiff would be barred of\r\nrecovery, and that question was: Did plaintiff's negligence contribute as a\r\nproximate cause?\").4              CONCLUSION\r\n       For the foregoing reasons I would reverse the trial court as to the preceding\r\nissues and dismiss Gause's claim with prejudice.\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, the family purpose doctrine has overstayed its welcome. The\r\ndoctrine's underpinnings are rooted in obsolete perceptions of gender, societal, and\r\nfamily dynamics. Additionally, the negligent entrustment cause of action, and\r\nintroduction of insurance coverage for resident relatives and permissive drivers has\r\nalleviated, to the extent that the family purpose doctrine ever did, the danger that\r\ninjured parties will be unable to recover financially from individuals negligently\r\noperating a family vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 I agree with the majority's analysis regarding the verdict form, inadmissible\r\ntestimony, and punitive damages claims in this case.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I dissent and join Sections I and II of Chief Justice\r\nToal's dissent.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27262","title":"In the Matter of Christopher John Van Son","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27262.pdf","description":"The Court imposed discipline on a California attorney who violated solicitation rules in South Carolina.","date":"2013-06-05","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n             In the Matter of Christopher John Van Son, Respondent.\r\n\r\n             Appellate Case No. 2013-000064\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Opinion No. 27262 \n\r\n                   Submitted May 15, 2013 – Filed June 5, 2013 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DISCIPLINE IMPOSED\r\n\r\n\r\n             Lesley M.

These letters\r\nviolated a number of provisions of Rule 7, Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC),\r\nRule 407, SCACR. Respondent subsequently failed to cooperate with the Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel's (ODC) investigation. Respondent did not answer ODC's\r\nformal charges, was found to be in default, and is therefore deemed to have\r\nadmitted the factual allegations made in those charges. Rule 24(a), Rules for\r\nLawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR. Following an\r\nevidentiary hearing at which respondent did not appear, the hearing Panel\r\nrecommended that respondent be barred for five years from seeking admission of\r\nany kind in South Carolina, from advertising or soliciting clients in South Carolina\r\n\r\n1 Respondent's California license is currently suspended for conduct similar to that\r\ninvolved in this matter.\r\n\nfor five years, and that he be required to pay the costs of the proceedings.2 Further,\r\nthe Panel recommended respondent be required to complete the Legal Ethics and\r\nPractice Program, Ethics School, and Advertising School before being eligible for\r\nadmission. Neither party sought review of the order, and the matter is now\r\nsubmitted for the Court's consideration. We impose the sanctions recommended\r\nby the Panel but modify the starting date of the five-year period.\r\n\r\n                                         FACTS\r\n\r\nRespondent sent letters to South Carolina residents notifying them they were\r\npotential plaintiffs in a \"national lawsuit\" that respondent's office had recently\r\nfiled, and urging them to contact that office to avoid being \"excluded as a\r\nplaintiff.\" Respondent's conduct in sending the letters violated the following\r\nsections of Rule 7, RPC, Rule 407:\r\n\r\n               (1) 7.1(a) in that the letters contained material\r\n                           \t\r\n                  misrepresentations of fact or law and omitted facts necessary\r\n                  to make the statements considered as a whole not materially\r\n                  misleading;\r\n\r\n               (2) Rule 7.3(c) in that he failed to file a copy of the letter and a\r\n                  list of persons to whom it was sent, and failed to pay the fee\r\n                  as required by the version of this rule in effect at the time;\r\n\r\n               (3) Rule 7.3(d)(1) in that the letters did not include in capital\r\n                  letters and prominent type \"ADVERTISING MATERIAL\"\r\n                  on the front of the envelope and on each page of the\r\n                  enclosed material;\r\n\r\n               (4) Rule 7.3(d)(2) and (3) in that the letters did not include\r\n                  required disclaimers; and\r\n\r\n               (5) Rule 7.3(g) in\t that respondent did not disclose how he\r\n                  obtained the information prompting the communication.\r\n\r\nFurther, respondent failed to cooperate with ODC in that he:\r\n\r\n\r\n2   The costs total $513.29.\r\n\n            (1) Did not respond in writing to a notice of investigation sent\r\n               August 30, 2011;\r\n\r\n            (2) Did not claim a certified letter sent September 26, 2011,\r\n               reminding him of his obligation to respond despite being left\r\n               two notices by the Post Office;\r\n\r\n            (3) Did not claim another reminder letter and notice sent by\r\n               certified mail in January 2012, despite being left two notices\r\n               by the Post Office;\r\n\r\n            (4) Did not respond to the notice and reminder letter sent by\r\n               regular mail in January 2012, which was not returned to\r\n               ODC;\r\n\r\n            (5) After learning in March 2012 that the California State Bar\r\n               had closed respondent's practice because of a mortgage\r\n               modification scam related to the South Carolina solicitation\r\n               letters, ODC sent its notice to the lawyer representing\r\n               respondent in the California disciplinary proceedings. This\r\n               lawyer forwarded ODC's correspondence to respondent, who\r\n               then wrote ODC telling it that because the California State\r\n               Bar had taken over his law practice and seized his files, its\r\n               inquiry should be directed to the State Bar. State Bar\r\n               Counsel confirmed to ODC that the State Bar is neither\r\n               representing respondent nor accepting service on his behalf;\r\n               and\r\n\r\n            (6) ODC wrote respondent in April 2012 informing him that he\r\n               was required to respond and that the California State Bar\r\n               would not be responding on his behalf. As of December\r\n               2012, respondent has not responded to ODC.\r\n\r\n                                   ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nRespondent is in default, and thus all factual allegations against him are deemed\r\nadmitted. Rule 24, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Further, although not licensed in\r\nSouth Carolina, respondent is subject to discipline here. First, Rule 2(q), RLDE,\r\nRule 413, SCACR, defines \"lawyer\" to include \"a lawyer not admitted in this\r\n\njurisdiction if the lawyer . . . offers to provide any legal services in this jurisdiction\r\n[and] anyone whose advertisements or solicitations are subject to Rule 418,\r\nSCACR.\" Further, Rule 418, titled \"ADVERTISING AND SOLICITATION BY\r\nUNLICENSED LAWYERS\" defines \"unlicensed lawyer\" as an individual\r\n\"admitted to practice law in another jurisdiction but . . . not . . . in South Carolina.\"\r\nRule 418(a). The rule also provides for jurisdiction over allegations of misconduct\r\nby foreign lawyers and procedures for determining misconduct charges, Rule\r\n418(c), and for sanctions. Rule 418(d).\r\n\r\nThe Panel found that respondent's conduct violated Rules 7.1, 7.3, and 8.1(b),\r\nRPC, Rule 407, SCACR, and recommended the Court sanction respondent. It\r\nfound his failure to appear at the hearing or respond to the final charges were\r\naggravating factors, citing In re Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268\r\n(1998) (internal citation omitted). Recognizing that disbarment was not available\r\nhere, the Panel recommended the Court prohibit respondent from admission or\r\nappearance of any kind in South Carolina, including in ADR proceedings or pro\r\nhac vice, and prohibit him from advertising or soliciting business in South\r\nCarolina. The Panel recommended the sanctions run for five years, and that prior\r\nto the lifting of any of the sanction, respondent be required to complete the Legal\r\nEthics and Practice Program, Ethics School, and Advertising School.\r\n\r\n                                     DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is\r\nimposed is a matter within the Court's discretion. E.g., In re Yarborough, 337 S.C.\r\n245, 524 S.E.2d 100 (1999). When the respondent is in default the Court need\r\nonly determine the appropriate sanction. E.g., In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551\r\nS.E.2d 586 (2001). We adopt the sanctions recommended by the Panel, effective\r\nupon the filing of this opinion. However, the five-year period during which\r\nrespondent may not be admitted in this state nor advertise or solicit clients shall\r\nbegin to run when respondent regains his status as a member in good standing of\r\nthe California State Bar.           CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nRespondent is barred from admission before the courts of this state and from\r\nadvertising or soliciting clients in South Carolina until five years after he has\r\nbecome a member in good standing of the California State Bar. Before seeking\r\nadmission here, or advertising or soliciting within the state, respondent shall\r\n\ncomplete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program, Ethics School, and Advertising\r\nSchool. Further, he shall, within thirty days of the filing of this opinion, pay the\r\ncosts assessed by the Panel.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE IMPOSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27263","title":"Health Promotion Specialists v.

This Court\r\ncertified this appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nWe affirm as we find the Board proved as a matter of law that it is entitled to\r\nimmunity from suit.       I. Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n       In 1988, the General Assembly amended the Dental Practice Act (DPA)4 to\r\nauthorize, subject to certain restrictions, dental hygienists to provide various oral\r\nhealth services in public settings, including schools. Act No. 439, 1988 S.C. Acts\r\n2921. Section 40-15-80 of this legislation authorized dental hygienists to apply\r\ntopical fluoride and perform oral screenings in a school setting \"without the\r\npresence of a dentist on the premises.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-80(B) (2001). The\r\n1988 law permitted dental hygienists to apply sealants and oral prophylaxis in a\r\nschool setting, but only if the following conditions were met: (1) the student had\r\nwritten permission from a parent or guardian; (2) a licensed dentist authorized the\r\ntreatments; (3) the student was not an active patient of another dentist; and (4) the\r\nauthorizing dentist had examined the student's teeth and given written\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Board is South Carolina's regulatory authority for dentists and dental\r\nhygienists and is composed of seven dentists, one dental hygienist, and one lay\r\nmember. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-20 (2011). An amendment, with an effective\r\ndate of June 7, 2012, revised the composition of the Board and the procedures for\r\nappointment of its members. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-20 (Supp. 2012).\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-78-10 to -220 (2005 & Supp. 2012).\r\n3   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 39-5-10 to -560 (1985 & Supp. 2012).\r\n4   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 40-15-10 to -380 (2011 & Supp. 2012).\r\n\nauthorization within 45 days before application of the sealant or oral prophylaxis.\r\nId. § 40-15-80(C).\r\n\r\n       In 2000, the General Assembly amended the DPA to impose fewer\r\nrestrictions on dental hygienists to perform preventive dental services in schools.\r\nAct No. 298, 2000 S.C. Acts 2088. As amended, the DPA authorized dental\r\nhygienists to perform oral prophylaxis and to apply sealants and topical fluoride in\r\nschools under a dentist's \"general supervision,\" which was defined to mean that a\r\nlicensed dentist or a state public health dentist \"authorized the procedures to be\r\nperformed but does not require that a dentist be present when the procedures are\r\nperformed.\" S.C. Code Ann. §§ 40-15-80(B), -85(B) (2001 & Supp. 2002).5 Thus,\r\nother than the parental-consent requirement, the 2000 amendments did not preserve\r\nthe requirements set forth in the prior version of section 40-15-80(C)(3),\r\nspecifically the 45-day dentist pre-examination requirement.\r\n\r\n       In signing the 2000 amendments, Governor Jim Hodges issued a statement\r\nthat the \"new law removes a regulation that hindered access to dental care\" and\r\nnoted that it would \"allow[ ] dental hygienists to offer preventative dental care in\r\nplaces such as schools . . . [where] [d]entists rarely practice full-time.\"\r\n\r\n       In January 2001, Health Promotion began providing cleanings, sealants,\r\ntopical fluoride treatments, and other preventive dental hygiene services onsite to\r\nchildren in South Carolina schools. As a result, Health Promotion established\r\nworking relationships with twenty-one school districts in South Carolina.\r\nAccording to its records, Health Promotion had screened over 19,000 children and\r\nhad provided services to over 4,000, of whom almost 3,000 were Medicaid-\r\neligible.\r\n\r\n       On July 13, 2001, the Board promulgated Emergency Regulation 39-18, to\r\n\"clarify\" the authorization required for dental hygienists to administer care in\r\nschool settings. The Emergency Regulation stated in relevant part:\r\n\r\n5   Based on the 2000 amendments, section 40-15-80 provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n       (B) In school settings, licensed dental hygienists may apply topical\r\n       fluoride and may perform the application of sealants and oral\r\n       prophylaxis under general supervision, with written permission of the\r\n       student's parent or guardian.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-80(B) (Supp. 2002).\r\n\n      (A) A clinical examination must be conducted by the supervising\r\n      dentist for each patient not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the\r\n      date the dental hygienist is to perform the procedure for the patient.\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulation 39-18, State Register, Vol. 25, Issue No. 7 (July 27, 2001).\r\nUpon approval of the Board, the Emergency Regulation was put into effect and\r\nwas to expire in January 2002, 180 days after it was promulgated.6\r\n\r\n       Immediately thereafter, Health Promotion sought a temporary restraining\r\norder to prohibit the Board from enforcing the Emergency Regulation.7\r\nAdditionally, Health Promotion sought damages as it contended the enactment of\r\nthe Emergency Regulation would effectively force it out of business.\r\n\r\n       By order dated August 21, 2001, Special Circuit Court Judge Joseph M.\r\nStrickland denied the motion on the grounds that: (1) Health Promotion failed to\r\nexhaust its administrative remedies; and (2) the Board acted within \"its power and\r\nauthority as conferred by statute\" to promulgate the Emergency Regulation, which\r\nreasonably clarified the term \"general supervision\" in the 2000 amendment to\r\ninclude a pre-examination by a licensed dentist. Judge Strickland further\r\ndetermined that Health Promotion failed to establish any irreparable harm for\r\nwhich there was not an adequate remedy at law as it had alleged \"lost business\r\nfrom eleven school districts that would have resulted in revenue of five million\r\n($5,000,000.00) dollars.\" On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision\r\nsolely on the ground that Health Promotion failed to exhaust its administrative\r\nremedies. Health Promotion Specialists, L.L.C. v. S.C. Bd. of Dentistry, Op. No.\r\n2003-UP-232 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 26, 2003).\r\n\r\n6 Because the General Assembly was out of session when the regulation was filed\r\nand when the normal 90-day period expired, the regulation was extended for an\r\nadditional 90 days. See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-130(C) (2005) (\"If emergency\r\nregulations are either filed or expire while the General Assembly is in session, the\r\nemergency regulations remain in effect for ninety days only and may not be\r\nrefiled; but if emergency regulations are both filed and expire during a time when\r\nthe General Assembly is not in session they may be refiled for an additional ninety\r\ndays.\").\r\n7  In its Complaint, Health Promotion named the following as defendants: the\r\nBoard, the South Carolina Dental Association, Dr. Charles Maxwell, Dr. Charles\r\nE. Millwood, and James H. Zorn, Jr.\r\n\n       On August 24, 2001, the Board published a proposed permanent regulation\r\nthat was essentially identical to the Emergency Regulation. As required by\r\nstatute,8 an Administrative Law Judge held a public hearing to determine the \"need\r\nand reasonableness\" of the proposed regulation.\r\n\r\n       On February 11, 2002, Administrative Law Judge Marvin Kittrell issued a\r\nreport wherein he concluded that \"the proposed regulation, as written, is\r\nunreasonable to the extent that it reinstates a requirement the legislature purposely\r\neliminated when enacting 2000 S.C. Acts 298.\" In so ruling, Judge Kittrell\r\neffectively found the proposed regulation contravened the legislature's intent, in\r\namending section 40-15-80 in 2000, \"to provide for quicker and more accessible\r\ndental care to be given to these low-income children and adults.\" Ultimately, the\r\nBoard elected not to submit the proposed permanent regulation to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n      In June 2003, the General Assembly again amended the DPA to clarify the\r\npermissibility of certain acts by dental hygienists in public health school settings.\r\nAct No. 45, 2003 S.C. Acts 210-15. As amended, dental hygienists were\r\nauthorized to provide preventive dental care in certain public health settings\r\nwithout a requirement for pre-examination by a dentist. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-\r\n102(D), -110(A)(10) (2011).\r\n\r\n       On September 12, 2003, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) instituted an\r\nadministrative complaint against the Board alleging the Board violated Section 5 of\r\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act by \"restrain[ing] competition in the provision\r\nof preventive dental care services by unreasonably restricting the delivery of dental\r\ncleanings, sealants, and topical fluoride treatments in school settings by licensed\r\ndental hygienists.\"\r\n\r\n      After protracted adjudicative and appellate proceedings, the FTC issued a\r\nConsent Agreement on September 6, 2007. The Consent Agreement mandated that\r\nthe Board submit written notice to the FTC thirty days prior to any action of the\r\nBoard \"relating to the provision by dental hygienists of preventive dental services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 S.C. Code Ann. §§ 1-23-110, -111 (2005 & Supp. 2012) (outlining\r\nadministrative procedures for publication of proposed promulgations).\r\n\nin a public setting.\" The Consent Agreement was for \"settlement purposes only\"\r\nand did not constitute an admission by the Board as to the law or facts alleged in\r\nthe FTC Complaint.\r\n\r\n       During the pendency of the adjudication of the FTC complaint, Health\r\nPromotion filed a case in federal court essentially based on the same facts as the\r\nstate court action.9 By agreement of the parties, the state court action was stayed\r\npending the outcome of the federal court case. Ultimately, the Board was\r\ndismissed from the federal case and the remaining parties reached a settlement.\r\nOn November 1, 2007, the state court case was restored to the Richland County\r\ncircuit court docket with Health Promotion and the Board as the remaining parties.\r\n\r\n      Subsequently, Health Promotion moved to amend its Complaint to include a\r\nclaim alleging the Board conspired to violate the SCUTPA. The Board renewed its\r\npreviously filed motion to dismiss and filed a motion for summary judgment. In its\r\nmotion, the Board maintained it was entitled to summary judgment primarily based\r\non the following grounds: (1) it was immune from suit pursuant to the TCA as\r\nwell as common law legislative and quasi-legislative immunity; (2) Health\r\nPromotion could not maintain a cause of action under the SCUTPA; and (3) Health\r\nPromotion's claim for injunctive relief was moot.\r\n\r\n       After a hearing, Circuit Court Judge William P. Keesley issued an order\r\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the Board. In so ruling, Judge Keesley\r\nfound: (1) Health Promotion could not maintain a cause of action for violation of\r\nthe SCUTPA because the Board is not a \"person\" and did not engage \"in the\r\nconduct of any trade or commerce\" for the purposes of the SCUTPA; (2) the Board\r\nwas immune from suit under the TCA and common law legislative immunity; (3)\r\nthe claim for injunctive relief was moot; and (4) Health Promotion was not entitled\r\nto amend its Complaint. Additionally, Judge Keesley found it unnecessary to\r\naddress the Board's remaining defenses, which included other claims of statutory\r\nand common law immunity.\r\n\r\n      Following the denial of its motion for reconsideration, Health Promotion\r\nappealed to the Court of Appeals. This Court certified this appeal from the Court\r\nof Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 Health Promotion Specialists, Inc., a S.C. Corporation v. S.C. Dental\r\nAssociation, et al., Civil Action No. 3:03-3230-24 (D.S.C. 2003).\r\n\nII. Discussion\r\n\r\n\r\nA.    Procedural Issues\r\n\r\n      1. Amendment of the Complaint\r\n\r\n       With limited discussion, Health Promotion contends the circuit court judge\r\nerred in denying its motion to amend the Complaint. In support of this contention,\r\nHealth Promotion maintains \"it could establish facts that would prove the Board\r\ncould be a co-conspirator in a conspiracy to violate the SCUTPA and that the\r\nBoard may also be found to have aided and abetted others in violations of\r\nSCUTPA.\" Because the parties have yet to engage in discovery, Health Promotion\r\nasserts the amendment was permissible under Rule 15 of South Carolina Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure.\r\n\r\n       Rule 15, SCRCP, provides that: \"A party may amend his pleading once as a\r\nmatter of course at any time before or within 30 days after a responsive pleading is\r\nserved or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is required and\r\nthe action has not been placed upon the trial roster, he may so amend it at any time\r\nwithin 30 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only\r\nby leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be\r\nfreely given when justice so requires and does not prejudice any other party.\" Rule\r\n15(a), SCRCP. A motion to amend is within the sound discretion of the trial judge\r\nand the opposing party has the burden of establishing prejudice. Foggie v. CSX\r\nTransp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 431 S.E.2d 587 (1993).\r\n\r\n       In denying the motion, Judge Keesley noted the case was filed in 2001 and\r\nthat the Complaint was initially amended in 2004. Recognizing that extensive\r\ndiscovery had been conducted in the federal case involving the same parties, Judge\r\nKeesley deemed the motion untimely and declined to permit Health Promotion to\r\nsupplement its case with additional theories. Additionally, he found the\r\namendment would unduly prejudice the Board as it would be forced to defend\r\nagainst \"arguably new theories of the case when so much time ha[d] elapsed.\"\r\nEven if the motion had been timely, Judge Keesley found the amendments\r\ninvolving civil conspiracy would be \"futile\" as the Board would be immune from\r\nsuit for claims involving the commission of intentional torts under the TCA.\r\n\r\n       We find Judge Keesley did not abuse his discretion as Health Promotion's\r\ndelay in moving to amend the Complaint was inexplicable given the seven-year\r\n\nlapse between the filing of the initial complaint and the oral motion. Moreover,\r\ndespite the extensive federal court proceedings, there were no significant factual\r\ndevelopments that warranted the untimely amendment. Furthermore, even if the\r\namendment had been permitted, it would not have affected the grant of summary\r\njudgment to the Board. As will be discussed, we find the Board was immune from\r\nany tort claim asserted by Health Promotion.10\r\n\r\n      2. Summary Judgment Posture\r\n\r\n      Although not designated as a separate issue, Health Promotion appears to\r\nchallenge Judge Keesley's ruling as an improper dismissal pursuant to Rule\r\n12(b)(6).11 Alternatively, Health Promotion generally claims summary judgment\r\nwas improperly granted as there are questions of material fact that should have\r\nbeen decided by a jury.\r\n\r\n      We find this challenge to be without merit as the Board designated its\r\nmotion as one for summary judgment, Health Promotion responded in full to the\r\nmotion, and Judge Keesley's decision was based on and encompassed more than\r\nthe parties' pleadings. See Rule 12(b), SCRCP (\"If, on a motion asserting the\r\ndefense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state facts sufficient\r\nto constitute a cause of action, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not\r\n\r\n10  We also note that in order for Health Promotion to maintain a cause of action\r\nfor conspiracy it would have needed to include the defendants named in the\r\noriginal lawsuit or establish that members of the Board acted with \"actual malice.\"\r\nSee Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 567-68, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006) (\"The\r\ngravamen of the tort of civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the plaintiff\r\nfrom an overt act done pursuant to the combination, not the agreement or\r\ncombination per se.\"); LaMotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 69,\r\n370 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1988) (\"A civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more\r\npersons joining for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and causing special damage\r\nto the plaintiff.\"); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-60 (2011) (\"No member of the\r\nboard, or its director, its committees, special examiners, agents, and employees\r\nshall be held liable for acts performed in the course of official duties except where\r\nactual malice is shown.\"). The Board, however, is now the sole defendant.\r\n11  See Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995)\r\n(recognizing that in deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\r\nSCRCP, the trial judge should consider only the allegations set forth on the face of\r\nthe plaintiff's complaint).\r\n\nexcluded by the Court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment\r\nand disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable\r\nopportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\");\r\nCharleston County Sch. Dist. v. Harrell, 393 S.C. 552, 559 n.4, 713 S.E.2d 604,\r\n608 n.4 (2011) (recognizing that a motion to dismiss may be converted into a\r\nmotion for summary judgment when the court considers matters outside of the\r\npleadings). Furthermore, other than characterizing Judge Keesley's ruling as\r\npremature, we discern no objection by Health Promotion regarding the posture of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n       Thus, we have analyzed this case utilizing our summary judgment standard\r\nof review. As will be discussed, we find Judge Keesley correctly granted summary\r\njudgment because the facts are undisputed and the Board established its entitlement\r\nto immunity as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n        Because this case was presented to the circuit court in the posture of a\r\nmotion for summary judgment, it is governed by Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina\r\nRules of Civil Procedure. This rule provides a motion for summary judgment shall\r\nbe granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\r\njudgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. \"When reviewing the grant of\r\nsummary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the\r\ntrial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493,\r\n567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).\r\n\r\nB.    Substantive Issues\r\n\r\n      1. Immunity from Suit\r\n\r\n        Health Promotion asserts the circuit court judge erred in finding as a matter\r\nof law that the Board's actions are \"protected by the shields of legislative and\r\ncommon law immunities.\" Because immunity under the TCA is an affirmative\r\ndefense, Health Promotion contends the Board failed to prove as a matter of law\r\nthat it was entitled to this immunity. Specifically, Health Promotion asserts the\r\nBoard did not prove it was entitled to discretionary immunity as there is no\r\nevidence that it \"weighed competing considerations and then made a conscious\r\nchoice to act.\"\r\n\n       Health Promotion's reliance on an alleged failure to prove entitlement to\r\ndiscretionary immunity is misplaced. Rather, at issue is the propriety of the\r\nBoard's legislative action. As will be discussed, we find that subsections (1), (2)\r\nand (4) of section 15-78-60 grant a per se immunity to legislative actions. Thus,\r\nthere is an irrefutable presumption of the exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\n      The TCA \"is the exclusive civil remedy available for any tort committed by\r\na government entity, its employees, or its agents except as provided in § 15-78-\r\n70(b).\" Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 302, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998); see S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-200 (2005) (\"Notwithstanding any\r\nprovision of law, this chapter, the 'South Carolina Tort Claims Act', is the\r\nexclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a\r\ngovernmental entity while acting within the scope of the employee's official\r\nduty.\").\r\n\r\n       The TCA provides that \"[t]he State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a\r\ngovernmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same\r\nextent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations\r\nupon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages contained\r\nherein.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-40 (2005). \"Governmental entity\" is defined by\r\nthe TCA as \"the State and its political subdivisions.\" Id. § 15-78-30(d).\r\n\r\n       \"The Tort Claims Act expressly preserves all existing common law\r\nimmunities.\" O'Laughlin v. Windham, 330 S.C. 379, 383, 498 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998) (quoting section 15-78-20(b), which provides: \"The General Assembly\r\nadditionally intends to provide for liability on the part of the State, its political\r\nsubdivisions, and employees, while acting within the scope of official duty, only to\r\nthe extent provided herein. All other immunities applicable to a governmental\r\nentity, its employees, and agents are expressly preserved.\").\r\n\r\n       \"The burden of establishing a limitation upon liability or an exception to the\r\nwaiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act is upon the governmental entity\r\nasserting it as an affirmative defense.\" Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing &\r\nRegulation, 336 S.C. 373, 393, 520 S.E.2d 142, 152 (1999). \"Provisions\r\nestablishing limitations upon and exemptions from liability of a governmental\r\nentity must be liberally construed in favor of limiting liability.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       We conclude the Board constitutes a governmental entity that may invoke\r\nthe protections of the TCA. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered the\r\nfollowing factors: \"whether the entity functions statewide, whether the entity\r\n\nperforms the work of the state, whether the entity was created by the legislature,\r\nand whether the entity is subject to local control.\" 81A C.J.S. States § 552 (Supp.\r\n2013) (footnote omitted). Additionally, we have examined \"the character of the\r\npower delegated to the entity, and the nature of the function performed by the\r\nentity.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      Significantly, the Board was created by the General Assembly as the\r\nstatewide regulatory authority for dentists and dental hygienists. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n40-15-10 (2011); see id. § 40-1-20(3) (defining \"Board\" to mean \"the group of\r\nindividuals charged by law with the responsibility of licensing or otherwise\r\nregulating an occupation or profession within the State\"). Several members of the\r\nBoard are appointed by the Governor and its funds are controlled by the State\r\nTreasurer. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-15-20 (providing for Governor's appointment of\r\nBoard members); id. § 40-15-50 (\"All fees received by the board become the\r\nproperty of the state general fund and must be deposited to the account of the State\r\nTreasurer. The expenditures of the board must be from state appropriations. All\r\nfines must be deposited into a special account to be held by the State Treasurer for\r\nthe purpose of the payment of administrative costs upon the approval of the Budget\r\nand Control Board.\").\r\n\r\n       Notably, the individual members of the Board are entitled to immunity for\r\nactions performed in the course of their official duties. See S.C. Code Ann. § 40-\r\n15-60 (2011) (\"No member of the board, or its director, its committees, special\r\nexaminers, agents, and employees shall be held liable for acts performed in the\r\ncourse of official duties except where actual malice is shown.\"). Thus, by creating\r\nthis governmental entity, the General Assembly intended for the Board as a whole\r\nto come within the purview of the TCA. Accordingly, as a governmental entity,\r\nthe Board is entitled to assert the affirmative defense of immunity under the\r\nprovisions of the TCA.\r\n\r\n       Having found the Board qualifies for the protections of the TCA, the\r\nquestion becomes whether the Board satisfied its burden of establishing a\r\nlimitation on liability or an exception to the waiver of immunity. We conclude the\r\nBoard established as a matter of law that it was entitled to immunity for any tort\r\nclaims arising out of the promulgation of the Emergency Regulation.\r\n\r\n        Judge Keesley properly found the Board's promulgation of the Emergency\r\nRegulation constituted a legislative or quasi-legislative act that was protected from\r\nliability under the following provisions of the TCA, which provide that the\r\ngovernmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n\n      (1) legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction;\r\n\r\n      (2) administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi-\r\n      judicial nature;\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      (4) adoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure to\r\n      adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not\r\n      limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule,\r\n      regulation, or written policies.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60(1), (2), (4) (2005).\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, the Board's entitlement to immunity is supported by common\r\nlaw that interprets and applies principles of legislative immunity, a doctrine that\r\nhas not been supplanted by the TCA. See Richardson v. McGill, 273 S.C. 142,\r\n146, 255 S.E.2d 341, 343 (1979) (\"A sound public policy has long recognized an\r\nabsolute immunity of members of legislative bodies for acts in the performance of\r\ntheir duties.\"); see also Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d 496 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2001) (discussing principles of legislative immunity as established by the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court in Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367 (1951)).\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold the Board was immune from the tort claims\r\nasserted by Health Promotion. Although this decision is dispositive, we briefly\r\naddress Health Promotion's remaining issues regarding its claim under the\r\nSCUTPA.\r\n\r\n      2. SCUTPA Claim\r\n\r\n      Health Promotion argues the circuit court judge erred in finding that Health\r\nPromotion could not sustain a cause of action for violation of the SCUTPA as the\r\nBoard is not a \"person\" and its actions were not within \"trade or commerce\" for the\r\npurposes of the SCUTPA.\r\n\r\n      The SCUTPA provides that \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or\r\ndeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby\r\ndeclared unlawful.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-20(a) (1985) (emphasis added).\r\n\nAlthough the SCUTPA provides for enforcement by the Attorney General,12 it also\r\nprovides for an action by a private party \"who suffers any ascertainable loss of\r\nmoney or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by\r\nanother person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful\r\nby § 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity,\r\nto recover actual damages.\" Id. § 39-5-140(a) (emphasis added); F. Patrick\r\nHubbard & Robert L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 415-16 (4th ed.\r\n2011) (discussing provisions of the SCUTPA and quoting section 39-5-140 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code).\r\n\r\n       \"To recover in an action under the UTPA, the plaintiff must show: (1) the\r\ndefendant engaged in an unfair or deceptive act in the conduct of trade or\r\ncommerce; (2) the unfair or deceptive act affected [the] public interest; and (3) the\r\nplaintiff suffered monetary or property loss as a result of the defendant's unfair or\r\ndeceptive act(s).\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 23, 640 S.E.2d 486, 498 (Ct. App.\r\n2006). \"An act is 'unfair' when it is offensive to public policy or when it is\r\nimmoral, unethical, or oppressive.\" Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 12, 522 S.E.2d\r\n137, 143 (1999). \"An act is 'deceptive' when it has a tendency to deceive.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Even assuming arguendo that the Board constitutes a \"person\" susceptible to\r\nsuit under the SCUPTA, we find Health Promotion's claim fails as the Board's\r\naction of promulgating the Emergency Regulation cannot satisfy the requirement\r\nthat the alleged unfair act occurred \"in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\r\n\r\n       As defined by the SCUTPA, \"trade or commerce\" includes \"the advertising,\r\noffering for sale, sale or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or\r\nintangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity or thing of\r\nvalue wherever situate, and shall include any trade or commerce directly or\r\nindirectly affecting the people of this State.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-10(b) (1985).\r\nBy these plain terms, it is clear the General Assembly intended for the SCUTPA to\r\napply to business or consumer transactions.\r\n\r\n      Furthermore, by its very definition, \"trade or commerce\" involves \"[e]very\r\nbusiness occupation carried on for subsistence or profit and involving the elements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12 S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-50 to -130 (1985) (authorizing and identifying specific\r\npowers of the Attorney General in carrying out the duties prescribed in the\r\nSCUTPA).\r\n\nof bargain and sale, barter, exchange, or traffic.\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed.\r\n2009); see Bretton v. State Lottery Comm'n, 673 N.E.2d 76, 78-79 (Mass App. Ct.\r\n1996) (recognizing that \"the proscription in § 2 of 'unfair or deceptive acts or\r\npractices in the conduct of any trade or commerce' must be read to apply to those\r\nacts or practices which are perpetrated in a business context\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, the Board's sole action was the promulgation of a\r\nregulation. We find this act, which is alleged to have been unfair, does not fall\r\nwithin the definition of \"trade or commerce\" as it did not involve advertisement,\r\nsale, or distribution of services or property within a business context.13\r\n\r\n                                  III. Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we find Judge Keesley properly denied Health\r\nPromotion's motion to amend its Complaint. Furthermore, we conclude that he\r\ncorrectly granted summary judgment in favor of the Board as the facts of this case\r\nare undisputed and the Board established its entitlement to immunity as a matter of\r\nlaw. Specifically, the Board's action in promulgating the Emergency Regulation\r\nwas exempt under the provisions of the TCA involving legislative or quasi-\r\nlegislative decisions. Alternatively, even if the Board was not immune, Health\r\nPromotion could not sustain a cause of action for a violation of the SCUTPA as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13 Although the SCUTPA has been interpreted to include claims regarding\r\nprofessional services, these cases are inapplicable as the instant appeal involves a\r\nregulation of professional services and not the \"sale\" of those services. See Taylor\r\nv. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 217, 479 S.E.2d 35, 44 (1996) (citing the statutory\r\ndefinitions of section 39-5-10(b) and holding \"[t]he provision of any service\r\nconstitutes commerce within the meaning of the UTPA\"; the Court observed that\r\n\"[t]he statute does not exclude professional services from its definition\").\r\nFurthermore, although not dispositive, the Board's actions arguably fell within the\r\nregulatory exemption of the SCUTPA, which provides that the SCUTPA does not\r\napply to \"[a]ctions or transactions permitted under laws administered by any\r\nregulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of this State or the\r\nUnited States or actions or transactions permitted by any other South Carolina\r\nState law.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-40(a) (1985).\r\n\nBoard's promulgation of the Emergency Regulation was not an action \"in the\r\nconduct of any trade or commerce.\" Accordingly, we affirm the order of the\r\ncircuit court.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

She brought this suit against respondent, the insurer, after it\r\ndenied her benefits under an exclusion for injury resulting from the insured's being\r\n\"under the influence of any narcotic.\" It is undisputed that petitioner's decedent\r\n\nwas under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of his accidental death.\r\nThe circuit court granted petitioner summary judgment holding that\r\nmethamphetamine is not a narcotic. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the\r\nplain and ordinary meaning of narcotic in an insurance policy to a layperson is\r\nunderstood to include methamphetamine \"based on its widespread illegal use.\"\r\nHutchinson v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 393 S.C. 19, 709 S.E.2d 130 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\nWe granted petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari and now reverse.\r\n\r\n                                     FACTS\r\n\r\nDecedent was a long-distance truck driver who died at the scene of a one-truck\r\naccident in Illinois. The death certificate gives the immediate cause of death as\r\n\"blunt chest trauma\" with \"motor vehicle crash\" as the underlying cause. It also\r\nlists \"methamphetamine use\" as an \"other significant condition[s] contributing to\r\ndeath but not resulting in the underlying cause given.\" The Illinois autopsy lab\r\nreport is negative for narcotics but positive for both amphetamine and\r\nmethamphetamine.\r\n\r\nRespondent denied petitioner benefits under exclusion (h) of the decedent's policy.\r\nExclusion (h) provides:\r\n\r\n            A Benefit will not be payable under this Certificate if your\r\n            Accidental Death results directly or indirectly from:\r\n\r\n            ...\r\n\r\n            (h) injury as a result of the insured being under the influence of\r\n            any narcotic unless administered on the advice of a physician\r\n            and taken in the dosage prescribed\r\n\r\n            ....\r\n\r\nThis exclusion is derived from S.C. Code Ann. § 38-71-370(9) (2002), which\r\npermits an exclusion \"for any loss resulting from the insured being drunk or under\r\nthe influence of any narcotic unless taken on the advice of a physician.\" A similar\r\nprovision has been a part of our statutory law since the adoption of the Insurance\r\nCode in 1947. See 1947 Act No. 232, § 5 VIII p. 429, permitting an insurer to\r\nexclude coverage \"for death, injury incurred or disease contracted while the\r\ninsured is intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics unless administered on\r\n\nthe advice of a physician.\" Over time the narcotics clause has been slightly altered,\r\nwhile the broad intoxication clause has been narrowed to a \"drunk\" standard.1\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding as a matter of law that\r\nmethamphetamine is commonly understood to be a narcotic based upon its\r\n\"widespread illegal use.\" We agree. The Court of Appeals read the exclusion to\r\ndeny coverage for any injury resulting from unlawful use of popular intoxicating\r\nsubstances. In our opinion, this reading rewrites rather than interprets the\r\ninsurance policy's exclusionary clause.\r\n\r\nWords in insurance contracts are to be given their \"plain, ordinary and popular\r\nmeaning.\" Whitlock v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 399 S.C. 610, 732 S.E.2d 626\r\n(2012) (internal citations omitted). Whether language is ambiguous is a question\r\nof law for the Court, and any ambiguous terms are to be construed liberally in\r\nfavor of the insured. Id. Further, exclusionary terms in a policy are narrowly\r\nconstrued to the benefit of the insured. McPherson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 310\r\nS.C. 316, 426 S.E.2d 770 (1993).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals appears to have read the term \"narcotic\" in exclusion (h) to\r\nmean any drug widely known to be used illegally. In our view, the use of the term\r\n\"narcotic\" in the exclusion rather than \"unlawful drug\" or \"unlawful use of drug\"\r\ncreates, at minimum, an ambiguity as 'narcotic' is a defined type of controlled\r\nsubstance rather than a generic term for illegally used substances. If there is any\r\nambiguity, McPherson, supra, it must be construed in favor of the petitioner.\r\nWhitlock, supra.\r\n\r\nOn certiorari, respondent relies, as did the Court of Appeals, on Doe v. Gen. Am.\r\nLife Ins. Co., 815 F. Supp. 1281 (E.D. Mo. 1993). In Doe, the question was\r\nwhether cocaine was within an insurance exclusion that excluded treatment for\r\nconditions \"arising out of the use of : a) narcotics; b) hallucinogens; c) barbiturates;\r\nd) marijuana; e) amphetamines; or other similar drugs or substances.\" The Doe\r\ncourt held the drug exclusion clause was ambiguous, and that \"the Missouri rule of\r\nconstruction that requires ambiguities to be construed in favor of the insured\r\n\r\n While the parties argued to the Court of Appeals that exclusion (h) should be\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\ninterpreted using rules of statutory construction, the court did not reach that issue\r\nnor do we. We simply note that it is doubtful that in 1947 'narcotic' was\r\nunderstood to embrace methamphetamine, just as today it is defined as a controlled\r\nsubstance but not a narcotic. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-110 (2002).\r\n\ncannot be used in interpreting the terms of the instant health plan.\" Doe at 1285.\r\nAlthough the court resolved the ambiguity by concluding cocaine was commonly\r\nunderstood to be a narcotic, we do not find Doe aids respondent. First, our state\r\nrules of insurance policy construction favoring the insured do apply. Second, the\r\nexclusionary language in Doe was much broader than exclusion (h), and the Doe\r\ncourt could easily have found cocaine to be within the exclusion's catchall phrase\r\n\"or similar drugs or substances.\" Finally, at least in South Carolina, cocaine is\r\nunambiguously defined as a narcotic. § 44-53-110. The other cases relied upon by\r\nthe Court of Appeals are all criminal decisions, and appear to involve loose\r\nlanguage in an opinion2 or sloppy drafting in search warrants,3 or to be relying\r\nupon testimony about drug use in a Hell's Angels clubhouse4 or reciting the\r\nopinion of an expert witness.5 Whatever the individual merits of these criminal\r\ndecisions, none were subject to the rules of construction applicable to this\r\ninsurance policy exclusion.      CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's order because, applying\r\nour rules of insurance policy construction, methamphetamine is not a narcotic\r\nwithin the meaning of Exclusion (h).\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  United States v.

Braithwaite, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This Court granted the petition of Dana Allison Medlock\r\n(Petitioner) in its Original Jurisdiction to determine whether a non-attorney who\r\nfiles a claim and petition for allowance of a claim in probate court on behalf of a\r\nbusiness entity is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. We dispense with\r\nfurther briefing and hold that a non-attorney may present claims against an estate\r\nand petition for allowance of claims in the probate court on behalf of a business\r\nentity without engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\nPetitioner is the personal representative of the Medlock Estate. On August 9,\r\n2012, Respondent filed and served a Statement of Creditor's Claim (the claim)\r\nagainst the Medlock Estate in probate court. Albert J. Sullivan signed the claim as\r\nRespondent's \"Director of Collections.\" The claim did not indicate Sullivan was an\r\nattorney or that Respondent was represented by an attorney.\r\n\r\nPetitioner filed and served a disallowance of the claim. Respondent then petitioned\r\nfor allowance of the claim. Sullivan signed the petition for allowance of the claim,\r\nwhich was captioned, \"Albert J. Sullivan, Petitioner v. [Petitioner].\" The petition\r\nfurther indicated that Edward Burr was Respondent's attorney. Burr is not licensed\r\nto practice law in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on Respondent's petition for allowance of the claim, Petitioner\r\nargued Sullivan could not appear on Respondent's behalf because he was not a\r\nlicensed attorney. The probate judge continued the hearing without ruling on\r\nwhether Sullivan could properly appear.\r\n\r\nPetitioner then filed a petition for original jurisdiction with this Court, requesting\r\nthe Court declare Sullivan engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by filing the\r\nclaim and subsequently petitioning for allowance of the claim without the\r\nassistance of an attorney licensed in South Carolina. On January 25, 2013, this\r\nCourt granted the petition and referred the case to the Honorable James O. Spence\r\nas special referee to make findings of fact and recommendations to this Court.\r\nJudge Spence has since provided the Court with a stipulation of facts from the\r\nparties and notice that Respondent permanently withdrew its claim against the\r\nMedlock Estate on April 1, 2013.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina limits the practice of law to licensed attorneys. Brown v. Coe, 365\r\nS.C. 137, 139, 616 S.E.2d 705, 706 (2005). The generally understood definition of\r\nthe practice of law embraces the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident\r\nto actions and special proceedings, and the management of such actions and\r\nproceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts. Id. at 139, 616 S.E.2d at\r\n706–07. However, this Court has consistently refrained from adopting a definition\r\nof \"the practice of law.\" Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 312, 585 S.E.2d 773, 776\r\n(2002). It is the character of the services rendered, and not the denomination of the\r\ntribunal where the services are rendered, that determines whether such services\r\nconstitute the practice of law. State ex rel. Daniel v. Wells, 191 S.C. 468, 477, 5\r\nS.E.2d 181, 185 (1939). A business entity may be represented by a non-attorney in\r\ncivil magistrate court proceedings, but it must be represented by an attorney in the\r\ncircuit and appellate courts. Rule 21, SCMCR; Renaissance Enters., Inc. v.\r\nSummit Teleservices., Inc., 334 S.C. 649, 651–53, 515 S.E.2d 257, 258–59 (1999);\r\n\nIn re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules proposed by the S.C. Bar, 309 S.C. 304,\r\n305–06, 422 S.E.2d 123, 124 (1992).\r\n\r\nWe have encouraged any interested individual to bring a declaratory judgment\r\naction in this Court's original jurisdiction to determine the validity of any\r\nquestionable conduct. See In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. at\r\n307, 422 S.E.2d at 125. Pursuant to that invitation, we now hold a non-attorney\r\nmay represent a business entity in the probate court to make an estate claim and\r\nsubsequently petition for allowance of the claim without engaging in the\r\nunauthorized practice of law. To file a claim in the probate court, a claimant must\r\nmerely deliver to the personal representative and the probate court a written\r\nstatement of the claim indicating its basis, the claimant's name and address, the\r\namount claimed, and the date upon which the claim is due. S.C. Code Ann. § 62-\r\n3-804(1) (2009). Similarly, a petition for allowance of a claim in the probate court\r\nmerely requires a creditor to complete a one-page standard form, located on the\r\nSouth Carolina Judicial Department website, requesting the probate court allow the\r\nclaim and attesting that such claim is valid, timely presented, and has not been\r\npaid. None of these activities require the professional judgment of an attorney or\r\nentail specialized legal knowledge and ability.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold a non-attorney may present claims against an estate and\r\npetition for allowance of claims in the probate court on behalf of a business entity\r\nwithout engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27266","title":"SC Public Interest Foundation v.

We find both challenges fail and\r\nthat section 11-43-140 is constitutional.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n        The Bank, a corporate and political instrumentality established by legislative\r\nenactment, is responsible for selecting and assisting \"in financing major qualified\r\nprojects by providing loans and other financial assistance to government units and\r\nprivate entities for constructing and improving highway and transportation\r\nfacilities.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 11-43-120 (2011). In doing so, the Bank may,\r\namong other things, \"make loans to qualified borrowers to finance the eligible\r\ncosts of qualified projects and to acquire, hold, and sell loan obligations at prices\r\nand in a manner as the [B]oard determines advisable\" and \"borrow money through\r\nthe issuance of bonds and other forms of indebtedness as provided in this chapter.\"\r\nId. § 11-43-150(5) & (14) (2011). Since 1998, the Bank has expended nearly three\r\nbillion dollars for major transportation projects.\r\n\r\n      Section 11-43-140 establishes the composition of the Board as follows:\r\n\r\n      [T]he Chairman of the Department of Transportation                        \n\r\n      Commission, ex officio; one director appointed by the                    \n\r\n      Governor who shall serve as chairman; one director appointed         \n\r\n      by the Governor; one director appointed by the Speaker of the        \n\r\n      House of Representatives; one member of the House of                     \n\r\n\r\n1 The South Carolina Public Interest Foundation is a not-for-profit corporation\r\n\"dedicated to the public interest, including the upholding and proper application of\r\nthe South Carolina Constitution.\"\r\n\n          Representatives appointed by the Speaker, ex officio; one\r\n          director appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate;\r\n          and one member of the Senate appointed by the President Pro\r\n          Tempore of the Senate, ex officio.\r\n\r\n       Since the Bank's creation, no more than two legislators have served as\r\ndirectors at any one time. The legislators currently serving on the Board are the\r\nHonorable Hugh K. Leatherman, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and\r\nthe Honorable Harry B. \"Chip\" Limehouse, Vice-Chairman of the House Ways and\r\nMeans Committee. We granted Sloan's petition to bring a declaratory judgment\r\naction in our original jurisdiction challenging the constitutionality of section 11-\r\n43-140.                          ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n   I.        Does Sloan have standing to bring this action?\r\n\r\n   II.       Does section 11-43-140 violate the South Carolina Constitution’s dual\r\n             office holding prohibitions in Article III, Section 24; Article VI, Section\r\n             3; and Article XVII, Section 1A by allowing legislators to serve as\r\n             directors on the Board?\r\n\r\n   III.      Does section 11-43-140 violate the South Carolina Constitution's\r\n             separation of powers provisions in Article I, Section 8 by allowing\r\n             legislators to serve as directors on the Board?\r\n\r\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n      \"This Court has a limited scope of review in cases involving a constitutional\r\nchallenge to a statute because all statutes are presumed constitutional and, if\r\npossible, will be construed to render them valid.\" State v. Neuman, 384 S.C. 395,\r\n402, 683 S.E.2d 268, 271 (2009). \"A statute will not be declared unconstitutional\r\nunless its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no doubt that it violates some\r\nprovision of the constitution.\" Segars-Andrews v. Judicial Merit Selection\r\nComm'n, 387 S.C. 109, 118, 691 S.E.2d 453, 458 (2010). A \"legislative act will\r\nnot be declared unconstitutional unless its repugnance to the constitution is clear\r\nand beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id.\r\n\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.    STANDING\r\n       As a threshold matter, Respondents argue Sloan does not have standing to\r\nassert his claims because he does not allege a particularized injury and has not\r\nshown that this matter falls within the public importance exception. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      A party seeking to establish standing bears the burden of proving it. See Sea\r\nPines Ass'n for Prot. of Wildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Dep’t of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594,\r\n601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001). As a general rule, a private individual may not\r\nuse the judicial process to scrutinize the validity of a legislative act without\r\nshowing that the act in question caused or threatens to cause a direct injury to the\r\nindividual. Sloan v. Dep’t of Transp., 379 S.C. 160, 169, 666 S.E.2d 236, 241\r\n(2008). However, the rule of standing is not inflexible and standing may be\r\nconferred where the issue is one of public importance. Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C.\r\n430, 436, 608 S.E.2d 579, 583 (2005). The public importance exception grants\r\nstanding to a party who has not suffered a particularized injury where the issue\r\ninvolved is of such public importance that its resolution is required for future\r\nguidance. ATC S., Inc. v. Charleston Cnty., 380 S.C. 191, 198, 669 S.E.2d 337,\r\n341 (2008). \"It is this concept of 'future guidance' that gives meaning to an issue\r\nwhich transcends a purely private matter and rises to the level of public\r\nimportance.\" Id. at 199, 669 S.E.2d at 341.\r\n\r\n       Sloan has not asserted he has suffered a particularized harm or injury as a\r\nresult of section 11-43-140, but we find this case fits within the public importance\r\nexception. While we are mindful that we must be cautious with this exception, lest\r\nit swallow the rule, this is the precise instance where the public importance\r\nexception should apply. Sloan presents a colorable claim that the Board is\r\nunconstitutionally comprised, casting a cloud of illegitimacy which could\r\nmarginalize the important decisions of the Board. We find resolution of this\r\nquestion is certainly of importance and concern to the public and therefore hold\r\nSloan has standing to bring this challenge.\r\n\r\n   II.   DUAL OFFICE HOLDING\r\n\r\n      Sloan first argues that section 11-43-140 violates the constitution because\r\nconcurrent service on the Board and in the General Assembly constitutes dual\r\n\noffice holding.2 Because we believe the ex officio exception to dual office holding\r\napplies, we disagree.\r\n\r\n       The South Carolina Constitution prohibits members of the General\r\nAssembly from holding another office during their service in the legislature, both\r\nexpressly and by virtue of the repeated general prohibitions against dual office\r\nholding. See S.C. Const. art. III, §24 (\"No person is eligible to a seat in the\r\nGeneral Assembly while he holds any office or position of profit or trust under this\r\nState . . . .\"); S.C. Const. art. VI, § 3 (\"No person may hold two offices of honor or\r\nprofit at the same time.\"); S.C. Const. art. XVII, § 1A (\"No person may hold two\r\noffices of honor or profit at the same time . . . .\"). This Court, however, has\r\nrecognized an \"ex officio\" or \"incidental duties\" exception where \"there is a\r\nconstitutional nexus in terms of power and responsibilities between the first office\r\nand the 'ex officio' office.\" Segars-Andrews, 387 S.C. at 126, 691 S.E.2d at 462.\r\nEx officio is defined as \"[b]y virtue or because of an office; by virtue of the\r\nauthority implied by office.\" Black's Law Dictionary 267 (3d pocket ed. 2006).\r\n\r\n       Sloan argues that the ex officio exception is inapplicable here because\r\nservice on the Board does not relate to the duties of a legislator. In support of his\r\nposition, Sloan relies heavily on Ashmore v. Greater Greenville Sewer District,\r\n211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88 (1947), in which we considered a constitutional\r\nchallenge to the statute creating a board of trustees for an auditorium in Greenville.\r\nId. at 85, 44 S.E.2d at 91. There, we found a statutory requirement that the senator\r\nand representative from Greenville County serve as members on the board of\r\ntrustees ran afoul of the dual office holding provisions of the constitution. Id. at\r\n90, 44 S.E.2d at 94. However, we clarified that our ruling was not applicable to\r\n\"those officers upon whom other duties relating to their respective offices are\r\nplaced by law\" and would \"not affect the state of the law with respect to ex officio\r\nofficeholding.\" Id. at 92, 44 S.E.2d at 95.\r\n\r\n       More recently, in Segars-Andrews, we elucidated the framework for\r\ndetermining whether a second office is being held ex officio. There, we\r\nconsidered, inter alia, a dual office holding challenge against legislators serving as\r\nmembers of the Judicial Merit Selection Commission (JMSC). 387 S.C. at 123–\r\n28, 691 S.E.2d at 461–64. The JMSC possesses the power, both statutorily and\r\nconstitutionally, to evaluate the qualifications and fitness of all judicial candidates\r\n\r\n\r\n2None of the Respondents challenges the assertion that membership on the Board\r\nqualifies as serving in an office for the purposes of the constitutional analysis.\r\n\nfor election or re-election. Id. at 114, 691 S.E.2d at 456. A candidate must first be\r\nfound qualified by the JMSC to be considered by the legislature. Id. After the\r\nJMSC determined Judge Segars-Andrews was not qualified for re-election, she\r\nbrought multiple constitutional challenges against the JMSC. Id. at 116, 691\r\nS.E.2d at 457. In addressing the dual office holding allegation, we found that\r\nalthough a position on the JMSC qualified as a constitutional office, the ex officio\r\nexception applied because service on the JMSC by the legislators was \"properly\r\ncharacterized as incidental to their legislative duties.\" Id. at 125, 691 S.E.2d at\r\n462. We further concluded there must be a \"constitutional nexus in terms of power\r\nand responsibilities\" between the two offices. Id. at 126, 691 S.E.2d at 462.\r\nMoreover, we distinguished the case from Ashmore by noting that when members\r\nof the General Assembly also serve on the JMSC, \"such service is reasonably\r\nincidental to the full and effective exercise of their legislative powers.\" Id. at 127,\r\n691 S.E.2d at 463. We held that because the constitution specifically charged the\r\nGeneral Assembly with the task of electing members of the judiciary, legislative\r\nmembers of the JMSC exercised the powers and responsibilities which they were\r\nalready constitutionally granted. Id. at 125–26, 691 S.E.2d at 462.\r\n\r\n       Here, we likewise find the necessary constitutional nexus between service on\r\nthe Board and service in the legislature. The Bank's purpose \"is to select and assist\r\nin financing major qualified projects by providing loans and other financial\r\nassistance to government units and private entities for constructing and improving\r\nhighway and transportation facilities necessary for public purposes including\r\neconomic development.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 11-43-120(C) (2011). To this end, the\r\nBoard has the power to \"borrow money through issuance of bonds and other forms\r\nof indebtedness.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 11-43-150(14) (2011). Similarly, the\r\nconstitution vests the General Assembly with the power to set the terms and\r\nconditions of general obligation debt of the State. S.C. Const. art. X, § 13(6).\r\nBecause it is within the province of the legislature to incur debt on behalf of the\r\nState, we find a sufficient constitutional nexus between the powers and\r\nresponsibilities of the directors on the Board and members of the General\r\nAssembly.3 Moreover, this case is also distinguishable from Ashmore because like\r\n\r\n3 We realize the Board may not be performing purely legislative acts, but the\r\ndiscussion of whether members of the General Assembly can serve on a Board\r\nwhich performs some executive functions relates to the separation of powers\r\nchallenge, which is discussed infra, Part III. Whether the ex officio exception\r\napplies merely requires an inquiry into whether there is a constitutional nexus\r\nbetween the powers and responsibilities of the two offices.\r\n\nservice on the JMSC in Segars-Andrews, service by legislators on the Board is\r\n\"reasonably incidental to the full and effective exercise of their legislative powers.\"\r\nSegars-Andrews, 387 at 127, 691 S.E.2d at 463.\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, we hold the ex officio exception applies and the statute does\r\nnot violate the provisions barring dual office holding.\r\n\r\n   III.   SEPARATION OF POWERS\r\n\r\n       Sloan also argues that section 11-43-140 violates the constitutional\r\nprovisions regarding separation of powers because service on the Board by\r\nlegislators results in members of the legislative branch performing executive\r\nfunctions. Because we believe the overlap of the two branches falls within\r\nconstitutional bounds, we disagree.\r\n\r\n       The preservation of a separation of powers has been a basic tenet of\r\ndemocratic societies at least since Baron de Montesquieu warned that \"[t]here\r\nwould be an end of everything, were the same man or the same body, whether of\r\nthe nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws,\r\nthat of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.\"\r\nSee Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws 152 (Thomas Nugent trans. 1949).\r\nConsistent with this notion, the South Carolina Constitution requires the branches\r\nof government be \"forever separate and distinct from each other, and no person or\r\npersons exercising the functions of one of said departments shall assume or\r\ndischarge the duties of any other.\" S.C. Const. art. I, § 8. \"One of the prime\r\nreasons for separation of powers is the desirability of spreading out the authority\r\nfor the operation of the government.\" State ex rel. McLeod v. Yonce, 274 S.C. 81,\r\n84, 261 S.E.2d 303, 304 (1979). \"The legislative department makes the laws[,] the\r\nexecutive department carries the laws into effect, and the judicial department\r\ninterprets and declares the laws.\" Id. at 84, 261 S.E.2d at 305. This delineation of\r\npowers amongst the branches \"prevents the concentration of power in the hands of\r\ntoo few, and provides a system of checks and balances.\" State ex rel. McLeod v.\r\nMcInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1982).\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, “[s]eparation of powers does not require that the branches of\r\ngovernment be hermetically sealed.” 16A Am. Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 244.\r\nAccordingly, allowing some degree of overlap between the branches has been a\r\nfeature of our government since the founding of the Republic. Our founding\r\n\nfathers embraced the celebrated writings of Montesquieu, yet concluded that a\r\ncertain amount of encroachment was permissible, even under his ideology:\r\n\r\n      [I]t may clearly be inferred that, in saying \"There can be no liberty\r\n      where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same\r\n      person, or body of magistrates,\" or, \"if the power of judging be not\r\n      separated from the legislative and executive powers,\" [Montesquieu]\r\n      did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency\r\n      in, or no control over, the acts of each other. His meaning, as his own\r\n      words import, and still more conclusively as illustrated by the\r\n      example in his eye, can amount to no more than this, that where the\r\n      whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which\r\n      possess the whole power of another department, the fundamental\r\n      principles of a free constitution are subverted.\r\n\r\nThe Federalist No. 47, at 250–51 (James Madison) (The Gideon ed., 2001). Thus,\r\nwe have acknowledged that \"there is tolerated in complex areas of government of\r\nnecessity from time to time some overlap of authority and some encroachment to a\r\nlimited degree.\" McInnis, 278 S.C. at 313, 295 S.E.2d at 636 (citing State ex rel.\r\nMcLeod v. Edwards, 269 S.C. 75, 83, 236 S.E.2d 406, 409 (1977)).\r\n\r\n       In South Carolina, this allowance of overlap between the branches is\r\nsomewhat singular in the extensive involvement of the legislature in the powers of\r\nthe executive and judiciary. Historically, this State has been considered a\r\n\"legislative state\" with a practice of \"[j]oining legislators with executive branch\r\ndecision makers\" for a \"commission approach to government.\" Cole Blease\r\nGraham, Jr., The South Carolina Constitution: A Reference Guide 46 (2007).\r\n\r\n       The path leading to this collaborative governance where the General\r\nAssembly wields extensive power is discussed at length by Professor Underwood\r\nin his excellent treatise on our State constitution. While recognizing that no one\r\nforce can be identified as being responsible for \"South Carolina's unique form of\r\ngovernment in which the legislative takes a permanent position among the three\r\ntheoretically equal branches of government,\" Underwood does discuss several\r\ncausative factors. James L. Underwood, The Constitution of South Carolina,\r\nVolume I: The Relationship of the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches 13\r\n(1986).\r\n\n      Among the historical forces that created the impetus for the\r\n      acquisition of such powers by the colonial Commons House were\r\n      abuses by the royal executive that created an inbred suspicion of\r\n      concentrated executive power in the South Carolina political\r\n      leadership. In the view of Commons these royal executive excesses\r\n      threatened the economy of the province, frustrated their own\r\n      ambitions by reserving choice judicial and other positions for British\r\n      placemen and threatened the prerogatives of Commons to judge the\r\n      proper composition of its own membership. The climate favorable to\r\n      the legislative style of government was enhanced by a small,\r\n      homogeneous elite who found it convenient to rule as a group through\r\n      the legislature as a form of committee of peers. Admiration and\r\n      emulation of the constitutional precedents of British government with\r\n      its example of growing parliamentary power proved to be a seductive\r\n      model for the South Carolinians, many of whom were lawyers trained\r\n      at English Inns of Court.\r\n\r\nId. at 21–22. Although our system has retrenched somewhat from the colonial\r\nlevels of legislative control,4 the influence of the legislature in the activities of the\r\nother branches remains firmly girded in the operation of our government.\r\n\r\n       Consequently, our rich and unique constitutional history has resulted in a\r\nsystem of government which does not lend itself to a neat, compartmentalized, or\r\n\"cookie-cutter\" approach. Rather, to counteract the destructive forces which can\r\nemanate from strictly defined and jealously guarded power bastions, certain\r\n\"power fusion devices\" have developed to enable the branches to work together in\r\na cooperative fashion. Id. at 3. A prime example of one of these collaborative\r\ndevices is the State Budget and Control Board. See Edwards, 279 S.C. at 83, 236\r\nS.E.2d at 409.\r\n\r\n      With this historical framework in mind, we now turn to Sloan's claim that\r\nSection 11-43-140 violates the constitutional separation of powers provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Professor Underwood offers several \"countervailing forces\" which have worked\r\nover time to moderate the vast power of the General Assembly including the\r\ntradition of judicial review and the strengthening of the office of the Governor. Id.\r\nat 27–85.\r\n\n       In answering this question, our prior decision in Tall Tower, Inc. v. South\r\nCarolina Procurement Review Panel, 294 S.C. 225, 363 S.E.2d 683 (1988), is\r\nparticularly instructive. There, we identified two major criteria to determine\r\nwhether a \"creature of legislative enactment\" which draws membership from\r\ndifferent branches of government, like the Board, is constitutional under a\r\nseparation of powers challenge: \"(1) the legislators should be a numerical minority,\r\nand (2) the body should represent a cooperative effort to make available to the\r\nexecutive department the special knowledge and expertise of designated legislators\r\nin matters related to their function as legislators.\" Id. at 230, 363 S.E.2d at 685–86\r\n\r\n       In arguing that the Board does not have a legislative minority, Sloan first\r\nreasons that although only two members of the legislature currently sit on the\r\nBoard, there is a possibility that as many as four legislators could sit on the seven-\r\nmember Board, which would constitute a majority. Initially, we note that since its\r\ninception, the Board has never had more than two legislators serve as directors at\r\none time. Additionally, Sloan's contention rests on an illogical reading of the\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\n      The Board is appointed as follows:\r\n\r\n      [T]he Chairman of the Department of Transportation Commission, ex\r\n      officio; one director appointed by the Governor who shall serve as\r\n      chairman; one director appointed by the Governor; one director\r\n      appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; one\r\n      member of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker, ex\r\n      officio; one director appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the\r\n      Senate; and one member of the Senate appointed by the President Pro\r\n      Tempore of the Senate, ex officio.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 11-43-140 (emphasis added). The statute expressly provides that\r\nthe Speaker and President Pro Tempore may appoint a member of the House and\r\nSenate, respectively, to serve ex officio, but the other two appointments are neither\r\nspecifically delineated as members nor constrained to be held ex officio. While it\r\nis true there is no express prohibition against the other appointees being members,\r\nthe same is true for any of the positions except for the Chairman of the Department\r\nof Transportation Commission. For example, it could be alleged just as easily that\r\nthe Governor could choose to appoint a director who was also a legislator. Were\r\nwe to hold that the absence of language specifically restricting the number of\r\nlegislators who can serve on such a board rendered the statute constitutionally\r\n\ndefective, we would upend countless boards across the State. Furthermore, the fact\r\nthat neither leaders of the General Assembly nor the Governor have appointed\r\nlegislators to these other positions demonstrates that the statute is capable of\r\nconstitutional application.\r\n\r\n       Sloan further argues that even if only two of the directors are members of\r\nthe legislature, the fact that the Speaker and President Pro Tempore appoint a\r\nmajority of the directors constitutes de facto control. He relies mainly on language\r\nfrom Tall Tower which, in approving the constitutionality of a statute, noted that in\r\nthe nine-member panel in question, the maximum number of legislators possible\r\nwas four so \"[t]he five executive appointees will always constitute a majority.\"\r\nTall Tower, 294 S.C. at 230, 363 S.E.2d at 686. Sloan therefore reasons that the\r\nimportant distinction in that case was that the executive appointees were in the\r\nmajority, not that the legislators were in the minority. Thus, in this case, because\r\nthe Board does not have a majority of executive appointees, it fails the test used in\r\nTall Tower. However, this conclusion ignores the actual language of the Tall\r\nTower test which specifically required that \"legislators should be a numerical\r\nminority.\" Id. at 230, 363 S.E.2d at 685 (emphasis added). Here, as discussed\r\nabove, the statute allows for two directors to be simultaneously members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which leaves them in the minority. Therefore, we do not agree\r\nthat because the President Pro Tempore and the Speaker can appoint two other\r\ndirectors, the legislature necessarily dominates the board.5\r\n\r\n       The second prong of Tall Tower requires that \"the body should represent a\r\ncooperative effort to make available to the executive department the special\r\nknowledge and expertise of designated legislators in matters related to their\r\nfunction as legislators.\" Id. at 230, 363 S.E.2d at 685–86. Sloan argues the statute\r\nfails this element because it does not expressly state that the legislator appointees\r\n\r\n5 We therefore also disagree with Justice Pleicones's conclusion that Tall Tower\r\nrequires us to hold that the Board violates the separation of powers. As discussed\r\npreviously, the statute indicates that only two legislators can be appointed to the\r\nBoard in an ex officio capacity. This is consistent with the language and the test of\r\nTall Tower. The executive appointees, of whom there are three, will always be in a\r\nmajority over the two legislators. While Justice Pleicones asserts it \"defies logic\"\r\nto hold that power of appointment is not tantamount to control, we cannot agree\r\nthat because the legislature has selected a person for a position, that individual has\r\nbeen stripped of his independence. Indeed, to do so would undermine the integrity\r\nof many boards and institutions in this State, including the judiciary.\r\n\nmust have the requisite special knowledge and expertise to increase cooperation\r\nbetween the executive and the legislative branches. However, this contention\r\nimposes an unnecessary requirement upon legislative enactments and ignores our\r\ndeference to the legislature in these appointments. Tellingly, Tall Tower did not\r\nexpressly mandate inclusion of language about the legislator's special knowledge\r\nand expertise. Instead, it noted that \"[the Court] necessarily give[s] great weight to\r\nlegislative discretion in the designation of which members of which committees\r\npossess the requisite 'special knowledge and expertise' to increase cooperation\r\nbetween the executive and legislative branches.\" Id. at 231–32, 363 S.E.2d at 686.\r\nWe believe the composition of the Board at issue here enables it to benefit from the\r\nlegislator members' wisdom without being dominated by them. Therefore, ever\r\nmindful of the presumption of constitutional validity, we conclude the Board's\r\ncomposition satisfies both prongs of Tall Tower and thus survives the separation of\r\npowers challenge.                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we find Sloan has standing to bring this challenge\r\nbut nevertheless find section 11-43-140 is constitutional under both a dual office\r\nholding and separation of powers challenge.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in result in a separate opinion. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a\r\nseparate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I have, in previous decisions, stated my\r\nopposition to the \"public importance\" exception to standing. In my view,\r\nstanding should not be conferred on a party who cannot allege a particular\r\nharm when another potential plaintiff has interests greater than the plaintiff's.\r\nSee Energy Research Foundation v. Waddell, 295 S.C. 100, 102, 367 S.E.2d\r\n419, 420 (1988); Sloan v. Department of Transportation, 379 S.C. 160, 175,\r\n666 S.E.2d 236, 244 (2008) (Pleicones, J., dissenting). I completely agree\r\nthat the constitutionality of the structure and composition of the board of the\r\nSouth Carolina Public Infrastructure Bank (the board) is of great public\r\nimportance. Nonetheless, I would conclude that, despite the manifest public\r\nimportance of the issues raised by Petitioner, the executive branch has a\r\ngreater interest than Petitioner in seeing that the General Assembly does not\r\nintrude on executive powers. Thus, I would hold that Petitioner lacks\r\nstanding to bring this challenge. I therefore concur in result.\r\nAlthough the analysis should end with the determination that Petitioner lacks\r\nstanding to bring this challenge, I address the merits because I disagree with\r\nthe majority's analysis.\r\nOn the question whether the composition of the board is unconstitutional, we\r\nmust initially determine whether the board is legislative or executive. In\r\nBramlette v. Stringer, the Court considered the constitutionality of an act,\r\nchallenged as a violation of the separation of powers, that authorized the\r\nGreenville County legislative delegation to determine the amount and method\r\nof selling bonds for highway construction and to select the particular roads to\r\nbe constructed and improved. 186 S.C. 134, 195 S.E. 257 (1938). These\r\nfunctions, the Court found, \"are fully discretionary acts, relating exclusively\r\nto the executive functions . . . .\" Id. at 149-50, 195 S.E. at 264. The board of\r\nthe Infrastructure Bank here is charged with the power to issue bonds and\r\nother debt, determine which projects to fund, and make loans. Thus, the\r\nboard and its functions are undoubtedly executive.\r\nThe Bramlette Court, having identified the functions at issue as executive,\r\nunanimously struck down the act, finding that the provisions permitting\r\nperformance of such acts by a legislative delegation \"are clear violations of\r\n[the separation of powers mandate], and are therefore null and void.\" 186\r\nS.C. at 149-50, 195 S.E. at 264. In the course of its decision, the Court\r\n\nexamined those cases in which some \"executive\" functions had been found\r\npermissible as incidental to the legislative function, but it did not discover a\r\nfluid boundary between the legislative and executive branches.6 Rather, it\r\nidentified as permissible to the legislative branch \"executive\" functions so\r\nunremarkable as hiring and firing its own accountants engaged in audits of\r\nexecutive bodies. Id. at 146-47, 195 S.E. at 262.\r\nThe General Assembly in subsequent years, having been denied the option of\r\ncreating executive boards composed exclusively of legislators, has created\r\nexecutive boards on which it has designated some, though not all, seats to\r\nlegislators or to legislative appointees. In Ashmore v. Greater Greenville\r\nSewer District, we rejected this overlap of government branches as well,\r\nstriking down as unconstitutional an executive board where two of its thirteen\r\nmembers were designated to be legislators. 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88\r\n(1947). The board's composition is unconstitutional under Ashmore.\r\nSubsequently, however, the Court reversed course and approved some limited\r\nseating of legislative members on executive bodies. In State ex rel. McLeod\r\nv. Edwards, the Court approved such minority membership, explaining that it\r\nwas intended to \"mak[e] available to the executive department the special\r\nknowledge and expertise\" of the legislative members. 269 S.C. 75, 83, 236\r\nS.E.2d 406, 409 (1977). While thus seeking to characterize the legislators'\r\nfunction on the board as incidental to the legislative function, the Edwards\r\nCourt also found it \"[i]mportant\" that \"the General Assembly ha[d] been\r\n\r\n\r\n6 The majority cites to secondary sources as authority for the proposition that South\r\nCarolina has traditionally used a commission approach to government rather than\r\nto this Court's precedents, the only real authorities on the interpretation of our\r\nconstitution's separation of powers mandate. As the discussion herein\r\ndemonstrates, in my view these authorities do not interpret that mandate as\r\npermissively as does the majority. Moreover, this Court's recent decision in State\r\nv. Langford, 400 S.C. 421, 735 S.E.2d 471 (2012), gave no weight to our state's\r\nlongstanding tradition of solicitor control of the docket. Notwithstanding that\r\nexecutive and judicial functions necessarily interact when court proceedings are\r\ninitiated in criminal prosecutions, the Court held that solicitor control of the docket\r\n\"is not a grey area where some encroachment can be tolerated, but rather a\r\ncomplete invasion into the court's domain.\" Id. at 435, 735 S.E.2d at 478.\r\n\ncareful to put the legislative members in a minority position on [the executive\r\nbody].\" Id. at 82-83, 236 S.E.2d at 408-09.\r\nIn my view, Edwards was wrongly decided because it departed from the\r\nCourt's prior adherence to the traditional doctrine of separation of powers\r\nrequiring clear boundaries between the two branches and disapproving any\r\nlegislative membership on executive boards. As the Ashmore Court\r\nimplicitly recognized, any legislative presence on an executive body\r\nconstitutes legislative exercise of executive powers, since even a single\r\nvoting member of an executive body may have opportunities to alter the\r\noutcome of a number of its decisions. If the true purpose of seating\r\nlegislators on such bodies were to make their special knowledge and\r\nexpertise available to the executive department, the power to vote would be\r\nunnecessary.\r\nNotwithstanding my disagreement with Edwards and its progeny, even under\r\nour current jurisprudence the composition of the board of the Infrastructure\r\nBank is impermissible. In Tall Tower, Inc. v. South Carolina Procurement\r\nReview Panel, while it again approved mixed membership on an executive\r\nbody, the Court articulated the test for a mixed-membership board. 294 S.C.\r\n225, 363 S.E.2d 683 (1987). The Court explained that legislative\r\nmembership on an executive body is permissible under two conditions: \"(1)\r\nthe legislators should be a numerical minority; and (2) the body should\r\nrepresent a cooperative effort to make available to the executive department\r\nthe special knowledge and expertise of designated legislators in matters\r\nrelated to their function as legislators.\" Id. at 230, 363 S.E.2d at 685-86. The\r\nTall Tower Court considered all possible compositions permitted by the\r\nstatute for the nine-member body: \"Two legislative positions are statutorily\r\nguaranteed, with a possibility of four legislators maximum. The five\r\nexecutive appointees will always constitute a majority.\" Id. at 230, 363\r\nS.E.2d at 686. Here, two legislative positions are statutorily guaranteed, with\r\na possibility of four legislators maximum, but only three seats are designated\r\nfor executive officers or appointees.\r\nThe majority explains that Tall Tower was concerned only with the number\r\nof seats guaranteed to legislators and not with the branch by which members\r\nare appointed. I disagree. As is clear from the foregoing quotation, the Tall\r\n\nTower Court assumed that the General Assembly might appoint legislators to\r\nall four seats for which it held appointment power and approved the\r\ncomposition only because a majority of executive appointees was guaranteed.\r\nIn contrast, the board of the Infrastructure Bank is guaranteed always to be\r\ndominated by legislative appointees. Moreover, as a practical matter, it\r\ndefies logic to assert that the board is not controlled by the legislative branch\r\nwhen that branch appoints the majority of its members, regardless whether\r\nthose members are themselves legislators.\r\nI also respectfully disagree with the suggestion that a constitutional nexus\r\nexists for the exercise by legislators of the board's function in article X,\r\nsection 13, of our constitution. See Segars-Andrews v. Judicial Merit\r\nSelection Commission, 387 S.C. 109, 126, 691 S.E.2d 453, 462 (2010)\r\n(approving legislative membership on Judicial Merit Selection Commission\r\nas incidental to the constitutionally mandated legislative function of electing\r\njudges). Article X, section 13, concerns the creation of state debt and seeks\r\nto protect taxpayers by limiting the amount of debt that may be incurred.\r\nRobinson v. White, 256 S.C. 410, 416, 182 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1971). In my\r\nview, nothing in the wording of this section suggests any constitutional nexus\r\nfor legislative appointees to participate in the issuance of bonds and\r\nindebtedness or select recipients or projects to be financed. The language\r\nused in Article X, section 13, in no way suggests deviation from ordinary\r\nconstitutional procedures designed to separate the legislative and executive\r\nfunctions. See S.C. Const. art. III, § 18 (bicameralism); art. IV, § 21\r\n(presentment). It speaks only in terms of the General Assembly enacting\r\nlegislation to authorize the incurring of debt.7 As the Bramlette Court\r\n\r\n\r\n7 See art. X, § 13(4) (\"In each act authorizing the incurring of general obligation\r\ndebt the General Assembly shall . . . .\"); (5) (\"If general obligation debt be\r\nauthorized by (a) two-thirds of the General Assembly; or (b) [referendum] . . .\r\nthere shall be no conditions or restrictions . . . except . . . those . . . imposed in the\r\nauthorization . . . .\"); (6) (\"on such terms and conditions as the General Assembly\r\nmay by law prescribe\"); (7) (\"under such terms and conditions as the General\r\nAssembly may prescribe by law\"); (8) (\"under terms and conditions which the\r\nGeneral Assembly may prescribe by law\"); (9) (\"The General Assembly may\r\nauthorize the State or any of its agencies, authorities or institutions to incur\r\n\nexplained, when the General Assembly sought to permit a delegation of its\r\nmembers to participate in the issuance of bonds,\r\n      It is conceded that the Legislature itself, in the act, could have\r\n      specified the amount, and method of selling bonds, and designated the\r\n      roads to be constructed and improved with the funds. It is well settled\r\n      that the Legislature may pass any act which is not prohibited by the\r\n      State or Federal Constitutions. But the act must be complete when it\r\n      comes from the hands of the Legislature; nothing can be added to, or\r\n      taken away from, the act [by members of the legislative branch] after\r\n      it leaves the lawmaking body. . . . Article 3 of the State Constitution\r\n      prescribes the procedure for enacting laws. Among other\r\n      requirements, the act must be passed during a session of the\r\n      Legislature, by a majority vote of both branches of that body, after\r\n      having been read three times, and approved by the Governor. All\r\n      such requirements are mandatory. So any action now on the part of\r\n      the Greenville County Legislative Delegation, pursuant to said act,\r\n      cannot amount to the enactment of legislation, and if said act was\r\n      incomplete when it came from the hands of the Legislature, it cannot\r\n      be finished by the Greenville County Legislative Delegation in the\r\n      manner provided for in said act.\r\n\r\n186 S.C. 134, 136-37, 195 S.E. 257, 258 (internal citations omitted).\r\nThus, I would hold that § 11-43-140 violates article I, section 8, of the South\r\nCarolina Constitution, and that it is unnecessary to reach the question\r\nwhether § 11-43-140 violates the dual office holding prohibition of our\r\nconstitution. Nevertheless, because Petitioner lacks standing to bring this\r\nchallenge, I concur in result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindebtedness . . . .\"; \"upon such terms and conditions as the General Assembly may\r\nprescribe by law\") (all emphases added).\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I join Justice Hearn's excellent and scholarly majority\r\nopinion. I write separately to set forth my understanding of the constitutional\r\nissues involved, as I, unlike Justice Pleicones, would recognize differences in the\r\nanalytical frameworks of the two constitutional challenges. In short, I would not\r\nconflate the dual-office and separation of powers challenges.\r\n\r\nConcerning the dual-office holding challenge, the South Carolina Constitution\r\ncontains several provisions prohibiting dual-office holding. See S.C. Const. art.\r\nIII, § 24 (\"No person is eligible to a seat in the General Assembly while he holds\r\nany office or position of profit or trust under this State . . . .\"); S.C. Const. art.\r\nXVII, § 1A (\"No person may hold two offices of honor or profit at the same time . .\r\n. .\"); S.C. Const. art. VI, § 3 (\"No person may hold two offices of honor or profit at\r\nthe same time.\"). Respondents concede, as they must, that service on the South\r\nCarolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank's (Bank) Board of Directors is an\r\noffice. The Bank's Board of Directors has extensive power to \"select and assist in\r\nfinancing major qualified projects by providing loans and other financial assistance\r\nto government units and private entities for constructing and improving highway\r\nand transportation facilities necessary for public purposes including economic\r\ndevelopment.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 11-43-120(C) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nI concur with the majority's recognition that the \"ex officio\" or \"incidental duties\"\r\nexception \"may be properly invoked only where there is a constitutional nexus in\r\nterms of power and responsibilities between the first office and the 'ex officio'\r\noffice.\" Segars-Andrews v. Judicial Merit Selection Comm'n, 387 S.C. 109, 126,\r\n691 S.E.2d 453, 462 (2010). I agree that article X, section 13 of our constitution\r\nprovides the necessary nexus between the General Assembly and membership on\r\nthe Bank's Board of Directors. It is this constitutional nexus between the\r\nlegislative office and service on the Bank's Board of Directors that, in my\r\njudgment, provides an objective framework and requires this Court to reject\r\nPetitioners' constitutional dual-office holding challenge.\r\n\r\nBecause the constitution is controlling, I would not adopt a framework that would\r\nhave the effect of upholding a legislative enactment that purports to shield a\r\nmember of the General Assembly from the dual-office holding prohibitions.\r\nSimilarly, I agree with the majority that a dual-office holding claim is not resolved\r\nby considerations of degrees of board or commission membership, such as\r\nminority representation. Rather, the issue posed is straightforward—it is either a\r\nconstitutionally prohibited dual office or it is not. That is precisely why we\r\nexplained in Segars-Andrews that \"because the Legislature is impressed by our\r\nconstitution with sole responsibility for the election and re-election of judges[,] . . .\r\n\nservice on the [Judicial Merit Selection Commission] by one who holds an office\r\nin the executive or judicial branch would violate the constitutional ban on dual-\r\noffice holding.\" 387 S.C. at 126, 691 S.E.2d at 462. It is the presence or absence\r\nof the constitutional nexus, and nothing more, that should answer the dual-office\r\nholding question.\r\n\r\nIn light of the South Carolina Constitution of 1895, I also join the majority in\r\nrejecting Petitioners' separation of powers claim. I commend Justice Hearn for her\r\nexcellent recitation of the importance of the separation of powers doctrine in our\r\ncountry's founding. This Court's jurisprudence often recognizes, in glowing terms,\r\nthe sanctity of the separation of powers doctrine in our democratic republic. See\r\nState ex rel. McLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1982)\r\n(observing that the separation of the branches of government \"prevents the\r\nconcentration of power in the hands of too few, and provides a system of checks\r\nand balances\"); State ex rel. McLeod v. Yonce, 274 S.C. 81, 84, 261 S.E.2d 303,\r\n305 (1979) (holding that under separation of powers the \"legislative department\r\nmakes the laws; the executive department carries the laws into effect, and the\r\njudicial department interprets and declares the laws\").\r\n\r\nYet, as the majority articulates, \"South Carolina . . . is somewhat singular in the\r\nextensive involvement of the legislature in the powers of the executive and\r\njudiciary.\" The majority further refers to South Carolina's \"collaborative\r\ngovernance where the General Assembly wields extensive power.\" The majority is\r\nentirely correct to acknowledge the legislative dominance that prevails under the\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution of 1895. While article I, section 8 of our constitution\r\ncontains the familiar separation of powers provision, the balance of the constitution\r\nis replete with provisions expressly granting broad powers to the legislative\r\nbranch. It is for this reason that I believe, under our unique constitutional\r\nstructure, a separation of powers challenge under article I, section 8 cannot be\r\nresolved by merely ascertaining whether the legislative branch is exercising an\r\nexecutive function. Here, the South Carolina Constitution expressly grants power\r\nto the legislature, such that legislative service on Bank's Board of Directors does\r\nnot offend separation of powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27267","title":"Ware v.

Ware (Husband) and Margaret P. Ware\r\n(Wife). The family court denied Husband's motion to vacate the orders in the\r\nSouth Carolina case, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Ware v. Ware, 390 S.C.\r\n493, 702 S.E.2d 390 (Ct. App. 2010). This Court has granted Husband's petition\r\nfor a writ of certiorari. Husband contends the Court of Appeals erred in upholding\r\n\nthe South Carolina orders, which declared the parties to be living separate and\r\napart and included a property division and an award of alimony and attorney's fees\r\nto Wife. Husband asserts full faith and credit should have been given to the\r\nAlabama decree, which granted the parties a divorce and set forth a different\r\nproperty division and contained no ruling on alimony. It is undisputed that\r\nHusband instituted his action first, but Wife has raised questions as to the Alabama\r\ncourt's jurisdiction over her and the marital property that she contends precludes\r\naffording full faith and credit to the Alabama order. Husband argues Wife has\r\nwaived any objection in this regard. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n                                    I. FACTS\r\n\r\n       The parties married in Berkeley County in September 1986. At the time of\r\nthe marriage, Husband was in the United States Navy, and he retired in May 1998.\r\nFollowing Husband's retirement, he was employed locally for two years, and then\r\nobtained a job as a federal civil servant with the United States Navy's Military\r\nSealift Command, which required him to be away for long periods. Wife worked\r\nat one time, but medical issues resulted in her being declared totally disabled.\r\nDuring their marriage, the parties resided in a marital home they purchased in\r\nBerkeley County. No children were born of the marriage.\r\n\r\n       On January 10, 2007, Husband filed a summons and complaint for divorce\r\nand a property division in the circuit court of Randolph County, Alabama.\r\nHusband alleged he was a resident of Alabama, Wife was a resident of South\r\nCarolina, and that they had separated on February 27, 2001 due to irreconcilable\r\ndifferences. In addition to a divorce, Husband sought an award of his retirement\r\nbenefits, his vehicle, and his clothing and personal belongings. Husband requested\r\nthat Wife be awarded her retirement and disability benefits, a vehicle, and the\r\nmarital home and its furnishings in South Carolina. Wife signed a certified mail\r\nreceipt on January 13, 2007 acknowledging service of the pleading.\r\n\r\n       About one month later, on February 16, 2007, Wife filed the instant action in\r\nSouth Carolina seeking, among other things, an equitable division of marital\r\nproperty, including Husband's retirement; alimony; and attorney's fees. Wife\r\nstated the parties had separated on or about February 27, 2001 when Husband\r\nabandoned the marital home, and averred that \"she is entitled to live separate and\r\napart from\" Husband. She did not request a divorce. Wife stated in her complaint\r\nthat she was a resident of Berkeley County, South Carolina, and Husband was a\r\nresident of Randolph County, Alabama, and that the family court had jurisdiction\r\nover the parties and the subject matter of the action.\r\n\n      After Wife's attempts to serve Husband at his last known address failed,\r\nWife was permitted to serve Husband with the South Carolina action by\r\npublication in Alabama. Husband did not answer Wife's pleading.\r\n\r\n       On February 20, 2007, some four days after Wife filed her complaint in\r\nSouth Carolina, an Alabama attorney filed a Limited Notice of Appearance on\r\nbehalf of Wife in Alabama. The same day, Wife's counsel also filed a motion to\r\ndismiss Husband's action. Wife argued, in relevant part, that the \"complaint does\r\nnot meet the requirements of Alabama Code Section 30-2-5.\"1 In addition, Wife\r\nasserted the Alabama court does not have personal jurisdiction over her and does\r\nnot have jurisdiction \"over the marital res at issue,\" as Wife is a resident of South\r\nCarolina with no contact with Alabama as evidenced in a supporting affidavit.\r\n\r\n       In the alternative, Wife asked that, if the court decided to proceed with the\r\ncase, that it rule that it has jurisdiction only to divorce the parties and not over any\r\nof the marital assets and liabilities, which are located in South Carolina or other\r\nstates, and Wife noted ancillary proceedings in such states were pending. Lastly,\r\nWife requested that she \"be awarded attorney's fees and costs for litigating this\r\njurisdictional issue.\"\r\n\r\n       After a hearing, the Alabama court denied Wife's motion to dismiss by order\r\ndated May 13, 2007. In its order, the Alabama court stated the hearing was held on\r\nWife's motion to dismiss \"for [Husband's] failure to plead and prove residence as\r\nrequired by Alabama statute.\" The court noted that Husband had testified at the\r\nhearing that he had been domiciled in Alabama since 2001; additionally, Husband\r\nhad filed amended pleadings denoting the same.2 The court stated while Husband\r\n\"spends most of his time at sea due to his profession, residency is based on more\r\nthan [where] he lays his head each night.\" On May 17, 2007 the court set the trial\r\ndate for August 23, 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See Ala. Code § 30-2-5 (2011) (\"When the defendant is a nonresident, the other\r\nparty to the marriage must have been a bona fide resident of this state for six\r\nmonths next before the filing of the complaint, which must be alleged in the\r\ncomplaint and proved.\"). Husband's complaint stated he separated from Wife in\r\n2001 and he was a resident of Alabama, but he did not specifically state he had\r\nbeen a resident of Alabama for six months prior to filing the complaint.\r\n2   The order does not indicate whether the amended pleading was served on Wife.\r\n\n       On or about June 1, 2007, Wife filed a \"Motion to Reconsider,\" pointing out\r\nthat, while the court found it had personal jurisdiction as to Husband, it had failed\r\nto address her argument that the Alabama court lacked personal jurisdiction over\r\nher and the parties' marital property based on her insufficient contacts with\r\nAlabama. The court issued no ruling at that time.\r\n\r\n      On June 18, 2007, Wife's Alabama attorney filed a motion to continue the\r\nAugust 23rd trial date previously set for the Alabama action citing, among other\r\nthings, the fact that Wife's motion for reconsideration was still pending. There is\r\nno indication in the record that a formal ruling was issued on this motion prior to\r\nthe August trial.\r\n\r\n      A final hearing was held on Wife's domestic action in South Carolina on\r\nJune 22, 2007. Wife was present with her attorney; however, Husband was absent\r\nand was not otherwise represented by counsel.\r\n\r\n       By order filed July 31, 2007, the South Carolina family court declared Wife\r\nshall be permitted to continue living separate and apart from Husband, it awarded\r\nWife alimony of $750 per month, it equitably distributed the marital assets,\r\nincluding Husband's military retirement, and it awarded Wife $2,867.91 in\r\nattorney's fees. The family court noted Wife had testified that she desired to\r\ncontinue her marriage in spite of Husband's desertion because she is afforded\r\nmilitary medical coverage, which supplements her Medicare. However, upon her\r\ndivorce, which Husband was pursing in Alabama, she will no longer have that\r\nmedical coverage.\r\n\r\n       As to the property, the family court awarded Wife the marital home in South\r\nCarolina, a 27% share of Husband's military retirement, and a Chrysler Jeep.\r\nHusband was awarded property located in Georgia after Wife relinquished all\r\ninterest therein, all of his Civil Service retirement, the balance of his military\r\nretirement that was not awarded to Wife, and three vehicles. He was ordered not to\r\nchange benefits documents or insurance policies that have named Wife as a\r\nbeneficiary.\r\n\r\n       The family court found it had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter\r\njurisdiction of this action except as to the disposition of the Georgia property, to\r\nwhich Wife had relinquished any interest. The family court stated it had been\r\nmade aware of ongoing litigation in Alabama by a letter from Husband's counsel\r\nnotifying the court of the Alabama action and seeking to have the South Carolina\r\naction dismissed. As to this request, the family court stated, \"The Alabama\r\n\nattorney, neither being a member of the South Carolina Bar or being authorized to\r\nproceed pro hac vice, was not authorized to practice law in this state and the Court\r\ntook no actions based on the Defendant's attorney's letter.\"\r\n\r\n       A hearing was held by the Alabama court as scheduled on August 23, 2007.\r\nBy that time, Wife's Alabama counsel had withdrawn from representation on the\r\nbasis Wife had retained her for the limited purpose of handling the motion to\r\ndismiss and had not contacted her thereafter to retain her for further\r\nrepresentation.3 The Alabama court filed a final judgment on September 5, 2007\r\ndeclaring the orders issued in South Carolina to be \"null and void and of no effect.\"\r\nThe court stated the South Carolina judge \"was sent notice of this Court's Order\r\nMay 13, 2007 [denying Wife's motion to dismiss], and yet refused to abstain from\r\nfurther proceedings and even refers to the notice in her Final Order . . . .\"\r\n\r\n       The court granted Husband a divorce and divided the marital estate,\r\nincluding real property located in South Carolina and personal property, along the\r\nlines requested by Husband in his complaint. Both Husband's complaint and the\r\ncourt's order are silent on the issue of alimony. The order did not address Wife's\r\nprevious motion for a continuance.\r\n\r\n       On October 12, 2007, Wife filed an \"Appeal/Amendment\" of the Alabama\r\ncourt's final order with the trial court. Wife stated she was \"not contesting the\r\ndivorce in any manner,\" but that she believed she had a right to appeal and/or\r\namend the final order because she is \"entitled to a fair share of the personal assets\r\nthat were acquired during [the] marriage and alimony.\" Wife requested the\r\nAlabama court to \"reconsider the decision based on the lack of jurisdiction and fair\r\nplay over the issue of alimony and the distribution of marital assets.\"\r\n\r\n        On January 17, 2008, the Alabama court summarily denied Wife's \"Motion\r\nto Reconsider.\" The order does not otherwise identify which of Wife's motions\r\nthat it was ruling on, or the date of the order it reviewed.4 The Alabama court\r\nstated it \"specifically finds that jurisdiction was proper here and that [Wife] was\r\nproperly served in this matter and failed to appear. Furthermore, the court notes\r\n\r\n3Wife's Alabama attorney filed a Motion to Withdraw on July 20, 2007, which\r\nwas granted by the Alabama court on July 26, 2007.\r\n4Husband characterizes the Alabama court's order as a ruling on Wife's June 2007\r\nmotion to reconsider following the denial of her motion to dismiss, not a ruling on\r\nWife's October 2007 motion to reconsider filed after the court's final order.\r\n\nthat this case was filed and [Wife was] served prior to [Wife's] commencement of\r\nthe divorce action in South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\n       On April 13, 2008, Husband filed a Rule 60(b), SCRCP motion with the\r\nfamily court in South Carolina seeking to vacate the family court's final order of\r\nJuly 31, 2007, as well as an August 28, 2007 Supplemental Qualified Domestic\r\nRelations Order (QDRO) and a January 10, 2008 Amended Supplemental QDRO\r\nregarding the equitable distribution of Husband's military retirement, and a\r\nFebruary 26, 2008 Order for Alimony Support Payments to be Made Through the\r\nCourt. The family court dismissed Husband's motion to vacate pursuant to Rule\r\n60(b)(3) and (5), and it denied the motion as to Rule 60(b)(4). The family court\r\nfound there was no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation, nor was there any\r\nevidence that a judgment had been satisfied, thus negating any relief under either\r\n(b)(3) or (5). The family court concluded Husband's Rule 60(b)(4) argument was\r\nwithout merit because, while it might have been shown that Husband's domicile\r\ngave Alabama jurisdiction over the marital res, or marital status, of the parties, it\r\nwas not shown that Alabama had in personam jurisdiction over Wife or in rem\r\njurisdiction over the marital assets to preclude South Carolina from proceeding\r\nwith its action. The family court found Husband had been properly served with the\r\nSouth Carolina action by publication and that he had sufficient contacts with South\r\nCarolina for the family court to acquire in personam jurisdiction over Husband.\r\n\r\n      Husband appealed the denial of his motion under Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP,\r\nand the Court of Appeals affirmed.5 Ware v. Ware, 390 S.C. 493, 702 S.E.2d 390\r\n(Ct. App. 2010).           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       The decision to deny or grant a motion made pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP\r\nis within the sound discretion of the trial judge. BB & T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548,\r\n633 S.E.2d 501 (2006). An abuse of discretion occurs when the order of the court\r\nis controlled by an error of law or where the order is based on factual findings that\r\nare without evidentiary support. Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d a 502-03. In appeals from\r\nthe family court, the appellate court has the authority to correct errors of law and\r\nfind facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\r\nAnthony H. v. Matthew G., 397 S.C. 447, 725 S.E.2d 132 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\r\n5   Husband is no longer pursuing relief under the other provisions of Rule 60.\r\n\n                               III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       Rule 60(b)(4) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides, \"On\r\nmotion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal\r\nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\" if \"the judgment is\r\nvoid[.]\" Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n       \"A void judgment is one that, from its inception, is a complete nullity and is\r\nwithout legal effect[.]\" Thomas & Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham & Co., 318 S.C.\r\n286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995). \"The definition of void under the rule only\r\nencompasses judgments from courts which failed to provide proper due process, or\r\njudgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or personal\r\njurisdiction.\" Universal Benefits, Inc. v.

App. 1996)); see also BB & T, 369 S.C. at 551,\r\n633 S.E.2d at 503 (\"A judgment is void if a court acts without personal\r\njurisdiction.\"). \"A judgment is not rendered void by irregularities which do not\r\ninvolve jurisdiction.\" Universal Benefits, Inc., 349 S.C. at 183, 561 S.E.2d at 661.\r\n\r\n       In this case, although Wife contends the Alabama property division should\r\nbe given no effect since the Alabama court had no personal jurisdiction over her,\r\nHusband argues the South Carolina orders regarding alimony, the property\r\ndivision, and attorney's fees, should have been vacated as void because Wife had\r\nthe opportunity to litigate the issue of personal jurisdiction in Alabama when she\r\nmade a limited appearance for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction, but she\r\nthereafter abandoned her argument by not completing the process for an appeal.\r\nThus, the Alabama court's ruling that it had personal jurisdiction, right or wrong, is\r\nres judicata and is entitled to full faith and credit in this state. Husband contends\r\nthe South Carolina courts may not go behind the ruling of the Alabama court and\r\nreexamine the issue of personal jurisdiction itself, as that would undermine the\r\nbasis for the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Consequently, Husband maintains the\r\nSouth Carolina orders should have been vacated since the Alabama court had\r\nalready assumed jurisdiction of this matter, and the family court and Court of\r\nAppeals erred to the extent they ruled to the contrary.\r\n\r\n       Under the United States Constitution, \"[f]ull Faith and credit shall be given\r\nin each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other\r\nstate.\" U.S. Const. art. 4, § 1. \"Full faith and credit 'generally requires every State\r\nto give to a judgment at least the res judicata effect which the judgment would be\r\naccorded in the State which rendered it.\" Hospitality Mgmt.

The validity of the Alabama order must be\r\nexamined under Alabama law, and its effect in other jurisdictions should be\r\nexamined in light of the principles governing the application of the Full Faith and\r\nCredit Clause.\r\n\r\n       As an initial matter, we find the Alabama court had the authority to issue a\r\ndecree of divorce based on Alabama law, and that the divorce is entitled to full\r\nfaith and credit in South Carolina. \"If one party is a resident of Alabama, then an\r\nAlabama court has jurisdiction over the marital res.\" Orban v.

App. 1993)). \"For purposes of subject-\r\nmatter jurisdiction in a divorce action, residency means domicile.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       For an Alabama trial court to have jurisdiction over a divorce, the\r\ncomplaining party must have been a resident of Alabama for six months before\r\nfiling a complaint seeking a divorce. See Chafin v. Chafin, 101 So. 3d 234 (Ala.\r\nCiv. App. 2012) (holding the trial court had jurisdiction to divorce the parties\r\nwhere the husband alleged that he had been a resident of Alabama for more than\r\nsix months when he filed his complaint for divorce and the wife did not challenge\r\nthe fact that husband was an Alabama resident); see also Ala. Code § 30-2-5\r\n(2011) (\"When the defendant is a nonresident, the other party to the marriage must\r\nhave been a bona fide resident of this state for six months next before the filing of\r\nthe complaint, which must be alleged in the complaint and proved.\").\r\n\r\n       In this case, Husband alleged that he separated from Wife in 2001 and that\r\nhe was a domiciliary of Alabama. The Alabama court noted Husband had testified\r\nthat he had been a resident of Alabama for more than six months prior to filing his\r\ncomplaint and the court found it had jurisdiction over Husband's complaint.\r\nMoreover, Wife has previously acknowledged that she is not challenging the\r\nAlabama court's grant of the divorce itself, as distinguished from the property\r\ndivision, so we find the divorce is entitled to full faith and credit. Cf. Chafin, 101\r\nSo. 3d at 236-37 (stating the complaining party must have been a resident of\r\nAlabama for six months before filing a complaint for divorce; the Alabama statutes\r\ndo not require that a court have in personam jurisdiction over both parties to grant\r\na divorce); Fuller v. Fuller, 51 So. 3d 1053 (Ala. Civ. App. 2010) (holding\r\nhusband's allegation that he had been a bona fide resident of Alabama for more\r\nthan six months before filing his complaint conferred jurisdiction over the divorce\r\nwith the Alabama court even though the wife was a resident of Mississippi).\r\n\n       The next consideration is whether the Alabama court had personal\r\njurisdiction over Wife to issue its ruling regarding the equitable division of the\r\nmarital property. The Alabama court ultimately concluded that it had personal\r\njurisdiction over Wife because she was properly served with process and she\r\ndefaulted by not filing a responsive pleading. Although the Alabama court did not\r\nspecifically use the phrase \"personal jurisdiction,\" it did say that \"jurisdiction\" was\r\nproper in response to Wife's specific challenge to the court's exercise of personal\r\njurisdiction over her. After reviewing the record, we believe the Alabama court\r\ndid not, in fact, have in personam jurisdiction over Wife under Alabama law.\r\nAlthough she was properly given service of process, it was not shown that Wife\r\nhad sufficient contacts with Alabama to warrant the exercise of in personam\r\njurisdiction over her, and both (1) proper service of process and (2) sufficient\r\ncontacts are required to obtain in personam jurisdiction. See, e.g., Coleman v.\r\nColeman, 864 So. 2d 371 (Ala. Civ. App. 2003) (finding wife's residence in\r\nAlabama was sufficient to allow Alabama court to have jurisdiction over the\r\nmarital res and the divorce, but the nonresident husband did not have the requisite\r\ncontacts with Alabama for the Alabama court to exercise in personam jurisdiction\r\nover him with respect to other issues raised in wife's divorce action; Alabama law,\r\nhowever, does not require a court to have in personam jurisdiction over both\r\nparties to grant a divorce).\r\n\r\n       In light of the foregoing, it appears the Alabama court did not have in\r\npersonam jurisdiction over Wife because, although she was properly served, there\r\nwas no evidence or finding that she had sufficient contacts with that state in order\r\nto effect a division of the marital property. However, a question arises as to\r\nwhether Wife, by her conduct, has waived any objection to the alleged lack of\r\njurisdiction. We are mindful of the restraint imposed by the Full Faith and Credit\r\nClause on our review of another state's determination regarding jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n       Husband argues that Wife, by agreeing to make a limited appearance to\r\nlitigate the issue of personal jurisdiction in the Alabama court, was thereafter\r\nbound by that court's ruling, right or wrong, and she should have appealed any\r\nerroneous ruling.6 Since Wife had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the\r\nissue, she was not denied due process and the Alabama court's ruling is given res\r\njudicata effect in that state. Thus, the Alabama order should be afforded full faith\r\nand credit. Husband contends Wife could not challenge personal jurisdiction in\r\n6 Husband acknowledges that Wife's entry of a limited appearance to contest\r\npersonal jurisdiction did not, in itself, confer personal jurisdiction on the Alabama\r\ncourt.\r\n\nAlabama, walk away after the trial court's ruling, and then, in effect, reassert the\r\nissue in the South Carolina court. Cf. 27C C.J.S. Divorce § 1220 (2005) (\"Where\r\nthe foreign court has once acquired jurisdiction over the parties, whether it retained\r\nthat jurisdiction is a question depending on the law of that state, which cannot be\r\nattacked collaterally.\").\r\n\r\n       We are constrained to agree with Husband. If Wife had made no appearance\r\nin Alabama, it is clear that court would have been without jurisdiction over any\r\nissue other than the parties' divorce. See 27C C.J.S. Divorce § 1221 (2005) (stating\r\nwhere a divorce is obtained by a spouse domiciled in the forum state without\r\nacquiring personal jurisdiction over a nonresident spouse, the courts of other states\r\nare required to give full faith and credit only insofar as it purports to operate on the\r\nparties' marital status, but they are not required to give it recognition for issues\r\nother than marital status).\r\n\r\n       Here, however, Wife did present the jurisdictional issue to the Alabama\r\ncourt by virtue of her special appearance and representation by counsel. However,\r\nWife failed to proceed on the merits. The Supreme Court of Alabama has\r\nspecifically held: \"It is clear under Alabama's Rules of Civil Procedure that when\r\na defendant challenges the court's personal jurisdiction and the trial court overrules\r\nthe challenge, the issue of personal jurisdiction is preserved for appeal. However,\r\nthe defendant must proceed with the case on the merits.\" Leventhal v. Harrelson,\r\n723 So. 2d 566, 570 (Ala. 1998).\r\n\r\n        In a case analogous to the current appeal, Hennessee v. State ex rel. State of\r\nTexas, 650 So. 2d 903 (Ala. Civ. App. 1994), an Alabama appellate court\r\nconsidered whether to give full faith and credit to another state's decision under\r\nsimilar circumstances. The Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama found a Texas\r\ncourt's judgment was entitled to full faith and credit where Hennessee attempted to\r\nobject to the jurisdiction of Texas by filing a motion to dismiss, but never followed\r\nup with a special appearance in Texas to argue his objection and did nothing to\r\npursue the issue of jurisdiction, although he had notice and an opportunity to do so.\r\nId. at 905-06. The Alabama court initially hearing Hennessee's motion to set aside\r\nthe Texas judgment denied the motion, stating:\r\n\r\n            Under the full faith and credit clause of the United States\r\n      Constitution, sister states generally give effect to foreign judgments.\r\n      However, Alabama courts may inquire into the jurisdiction of the\r\n      foreign court and determine whether the issue of jurisdiction was fully\r\n      and fairly litigated by the foreign court. The respondent/defendant\r\n\n      had [the] opportunity to present his evidence and his view of the law\r\n      in reference to the issue of jurisdiction in the Texas court but, for\r\n      whatever reason, chose not to do so. Consequently, the proceedings\r\n      in Texas ultimately concluded with default judgment being entered\r\n      against the respondent/defendant and said judgment must be given full\r\n      faith and credit.\r\n\r\nId. at 905. The Civil Court of Appeals of Alabama affirmed. Id. at 906.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court of the United States has observed that the requirement\r\nof personal jurisdiction is \"a legal right protecting the individual\" and that a\r\nplaintiff may demonstrate certain facts that make it clear to a court that there is\r\npersonal jurisdiction, or a defendant may take certain actions that amount to a legal\r\nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court, whether voluntary or not. Ins. Corp. of\r\nIreland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 704-05 (1982).\r\nThe Supreme Court stated the expression of legal rights is often subject to certain\r\nprocedural rules, and that \"[t]he failure to follow those rules may well result in the\r\ncurtailment of the rights.\" Id. at 705. \"A defendant is always free to ignore the\r\njudicial proceedings, risk a default judgment, and then challenge that judgment on\r\njurisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding.\" Id. at 706. However, \"[b]y\r\nsubmitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the limited purpose of challenging\r\njurisdiction, the defendant agrees to abide by that court's determination on the issue\r\nof jurisdiction: That decision will be res judicata on that issue in any further\r\nproceedings.\" Id.\r\n\r\n        It remains unclear why Wife did not challenge the Alabama court's ruling\r\nbeyond the trial court level. Since those findings are res judicata, the Alabama\r\ncourt's ruling is entitled to full faith and credit. Thus, the family court in South\r\nCarolina should have granted Husband's Rule 60(b) motion. As a result, the\r\nrulings on the property division, alimony, and attorney's fees award will be\r\nvacated, an unfortunate result in light of the Alabama court's apparently erroneous\r\nruling as to personal jurisdiction, but one that is mandated by the Full Faith and\r\nCredit Clause due to Wife's special appearance and subsequent failure to pursue\r\nher rights in this regard. Cf. Thoma v. Thoma, 934 P.2d 1066 (N.M. Ct. App.\r\n1996) (finding where a husband appeared specially in an Oklahoma divorce\r\nproceeding, he was bound by that court's determination that it had personal\r\njurisdiction over him based on the doctrine of issue preclusion; the court stated the\r\nFull Faith and Credit Clause required it to recognize the sister state's determination\r\nthat it had personal jurisdiction over the husband because, although he had asserted\r\nan objection on this basis, he took no appeal from an adverse ruling in this regard\r\n\nby the sister state); Mount Holly Sunoco v. Exec. Commercial Servs., Ltd., 396\r\nA.2d 1155, 1157 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1978) (\"A special appearance does not\r\ngive a defendant the right to litigate jurisdiction and ignore the outcome with\r\nimpunity. It merely protects against waiver of the jurisdictional defense which\r\nwould otherwise flow from a general appearance.\").\r\n\r\n      In Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Association, 283 U.S. 522, 525-26\r\n(1931), the Supreme Court explained the import of a special appearance:\r\n\r\n              The special appearance gives point to the fact that the\r\n      respondent entered the Missouri court for the very purpose of\r\n      litigating the question of jurisdiction over its person. It had the\r\n      election not to appear at all. If, in the absence of appearance, the\r\n      court had proceeded to judgment and the present suit had been\r\n      brought thereon, respondent could have raised and tried out the issue\r\n      in the present action, because it would never have had its day in court\r\n      with respect to jurisdiction. . . .\r\n\r\n             Public policy dictates that there be an end of litigation; that\r\n      those who have contested an issue shall be bound by the result of the\r\n      contest; and that matters once tried shall be considered forever settled\r\n      as between the parties. We see no reason why this doctrine should not\r\n      apply in every case where one voluntarily appears, presents his case\r\n      and is fully heard, and why he should not, in the absence of fraud, be\r\n      thereafter concluded by the judgment of the tribunal to which he has\r\n      submitted his cause.\r\n\r\n       In the current matter, Wife should have either made no appearance at all or,\r\nhaving chosen to make a special appearance, she should have retained her Alabama\r\ncounsel to pursue an appeal as to the issue of personal jurisdiction. By attempting,\r\nin essence, to raise the issue piecemeal in both the Alabama and South Carolina\r\ncourts, she has adversely impacted her rights. See Elkins v. West, 554 S.W.2d 821\r\n(Tex. Civ. App. 1977) (stating the full faith and credit inquiry is restricted to\r\nwhether the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of\r\njurisdiction; the court found the defendant could have appealed the default\r\njudgment or could have gone to trial on the merits and then appealed both the\r\nmerits and the jurisdictional question); see also United States ex rel.

Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 250 (9th Cir. 1992)\r\n(\"Even if a foreign court lacked jurisdiction to pronounce a judgment, a party will\r\nbe barred from collaterally attacking a judgment entered by that court if the party\r\n\nappeared there, contested jurisdiction, and lost.\"); id.

Duke, 375 U.S. 106, 11-12 (1963)).\r\n\r\n                                 IV. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       The Alabama court had jurisdiction to enter an order granting Husband a\r\ndivorce based on the provisions of Ala. Code § 30-2-5. The South Carolina orders\r\ndid not purport to establish a divorce, and Wife has previously acknowledged that\r\nshe is not contesting the Alabama court's entry of a divorce. Thus, the Alabama\r\ncourt's grant of a divorce should be afforded full faith and credit.\r\n\r\n        As to the issue of personal jurisdiction and its effect on the financial issues\r\nof equitable division and alimony, we believe the Alabama court was incorrect in\r\nits initial determination that in personam jurisdiction was established over Wife\r\nbased solely on completion of service of process. Under Alabama law, two\r\ncomponents are required: (1) the nonresident defendant must have had sufficient\r\nminimum contacts with the state to comport with notions of fairness and due\r\nprocess, and (2) effective service of process must have been established to confer\r\nin personam jurisdiction upon the Alabama court.\r\n\r\n        However, we reluctantly conclude Wife was not entitled to bring the South\r\nCarolina action for an equitable division, alimony, and attorney's fees. Wife\r\nentered a notice of limited appearance in Alabama through counsel solely to\r\nlitigate the issue of personal jurisdiction in Alabama and having done that, she is\r\nbound by the Alabama forum's decision in that regard and its determination is res\r\njudicata. Wife did not pursue her challenge to personal jurisdiction past the trial\r\ncourt level, but under Alabama law a nonresident may appeal the court's erroneous\r\nfinding of personal jurisdiction. Thus, she had the opportunity to contest personal\r\njurisdiction and abandoned that challenge in the Alabama courts. The inquiry in\r\nassessing whether an order is entitled to full faith and credit is whether the\r\ndefendant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of jurisdiction. By\r\nsubmitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the limited purpose of challenging\r\njurisdiction, a defendant agrees to abide by that court's determination on that issue\r\nand it will be given res judicata effect in further proceedings.\r\n\r\n        Since Alabama would have given its order res judicata effect, it was entitled\r\nto full faith and credit. Thus, we conclude Husband's Rule 60(b) motion to vacate\r\nthe South Carolina orders should have been granted, contrary to the determination\r\nof the family court and the Court of Appeals. Consequently, we reverse and\r\n\nremand this case to the family court for entry of an order in accordance with this\r\ndecision. Husband's request for attorney's fees may be considered at that time.\r\n\r\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

We disagree, and affirm.\r\n\r\n                                      FACTS\r\n\r\nAppellants Chappelear (Owners) hired defendant Premier Southern Homes LLC\r\n(Premier) to construct a model home. The contract price was $300,000 although\r\nan Owner testified that the value of the construction services was in the four\r\nhundreds, and that Premier had agreed to the lower price as it intended to showcase\r\nits work in Owners' residence. Premier contracted with Subcontractor to do certain\r\nwork on the property, including building a retaining wall and the home's\r\nfoundation and walls. Premier failed to pay Subcontractor's final bill of\r\n$66,862.63.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 2007, within 90 days of its last work on the home, Subcontractor\r\nfiled and served a notice of mechanics lien and statement of account on Owners.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-40 (2007). On September 27, 2007, Subcontractor\r\nrecorded its mechanics lien. See S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-20 (2007). Subcontractor\r\nfiled its lis pendens and its lien foreclosure complaint on December 27, 2007.\r\n\r\nAs of September 27, 2007, when Subcontractor's lien was recorded, Owners had\r\npaid Premier $135,740 on the $300,000 contract, leaving a balance of $164,260.\r\nWhile Owners made no payments to Premier after notice of Subcontractor's lien,\r\nOwners paid $118,931.83 directly to other subcontractors on Premier's behalf\r\nduring the period between receiving notice of the lien and their firing of Premier\r\non May 2, 2008. Up until that day, Premier remained as the general contractor\r\nsupervising the subcontractors and the project. One Owner testified that she told\r\nPremier she would pay the subcontractors directly while Premier caught up with\r\nthe money due Subcontractor.\r\n\r\nAs of May 2, 2008, Owners had paid $254,671.83 for a home that was\r\napproximately 68% complete. Owners subsequently bonded off Subcontractor's\r\nlien in August 2008 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-110 (2007). At some\r\npoint, Owners sold the unfinished house for an undisclosed amount.\r\n\nSubcontractor moved for summary judgment, and Owners interposed a payment\r\ndefense. Owners also contended they were entitled to set-off damages they\r\nincurred when Premier breached the contract by failing to pay Subcontractor\r\nagainst the moneys due Subcontractor on its lien. The trial judge found the\r\npayment defense was a question of law, interpreted four mechanic's lien statutes,1\r\nconcluded Owners owed Subcontractor the full amount of its lien along with\r\ninterest, costs, and attorneys fees, and referred the matter to the master to foreclose\r\nthe lien and determine the exact amounts due. Owners appealed.\r\n\r\n                                        ISSUE\r\n\r\n               Did the trial court err in granting Subcontractor summary\r\n               judgment?             ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAn owner has several defenses available to it when a subcontractor asserts a\r\nmechanic's lien. First, the lien may be invalid because the subcontractor did not\r\ncomply with the statutory requirements for perfecting the lien. There is no\r\nallegation here that Subcontractor did not properly perfect its lien. Second, the\r\nowner may assert he has paid the general contractor the full amount due under the\r\ncontract before receiving notice of the subcontractor's lien. E.g., A.V.A. Constr.\r\nCo. v. Palmetto Land Clearing, 308 S.C. 377, 418 S.E.2d 317 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nThis payment defense is predicated on the last sentence of the subcontractor's lien\r\nstatute, which provides that \"[I]n no event shall the aggregate amount of\r\n[subcontractor] liens set up hereby exceed the amount due by the owner on the\r\ncontract price of the improvement made.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-40 (2007).\r\n\r\nOwners contend there is an unresolved question of fact as to the value of the work\r\ndone by Premier as of September 27, 2007, when they received notice of\r\nSubcontractor's lien. While there may be such a question, under the facts of this\r\ncase, the relevant date for determining the value of the \"improvement made\" under\r\n§ 29-5-40 is May 2, 2008, Premier's last day on the job. Second, Owners contend\r\nthe trial court erred in failing to credit them for payments they made to Premier's\r\nother subcontractors between receiving notice of Subcontractor's lien and the firing\r\nof Premier on May 2, 2008. We find no error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    S.C. Code Ann. §§ 29-5-20, -40, -50, and -110.\r\n1\r\n\nWe first address Owners' contention that the relevant date for determining \"the\r\namount due by the owner on the contract price of the improvement made\" under §\r\n29-5-40 is the date they received notice of Subcontractor's lien. We agree that\r\nwhere, as here, the general contractor leaves before the job is finished, the amount\r\ndue under § 29-5-40 is determined by the percentage of the contracted-for work\r\ncompleted. E.g., Stoudenmire Heating & Air Conditioning Co. v. Craig Bldg.\r\nP'ship, 308 S.C. 298, 417 S.E.2d 634 (1992); Wood v. Hardy, 235 S.C. 131, 110\r\nS.E.2d 157 (1959). That percentage is determined as of the last day the general\r\ncontractor worked on the job. Id. Here, the last day of work was May 2, 2008.\r\nWhile ordinarily the notice of a subcontractor lien follows shortly after the general\r\ncontractor's abandonment or results in its firing, Premier was allowed to continue\r\nto act as the general contractor for 220 days after Subcontractor's lien was noticed.\r\nThere is no issue of fact that May 2, 2008, is the relevant date for purposes of § 29-\r\n5-40. Further, there is no issue that as of that date, the house was 68% complete,\r\nnor that the contract price was $300,000.2 Sixty-eight percent of $300,000 is\r\n$204,000.\r\n\r\nOwners next contend that the trial court erred when it gave them credit only for the\r\n$135,740 they paid to Premier before receiving notice of Subcontractor's lien.\r\nOwners contend they are entitled to offset that amount plus the $118,931.83\r\nOwners paid directly to Premier's other subcontractors between notice in\r\nSeptember 2007 and Premier's last day on the job. Under Owners' theory, since\r\nthey paid Premier and its subcontractors a total of $254,671.83, and since they\r\nwere only liable for $204,000 under § 29-5-40, Subcontractor cannot collect on its\r\nlien. The circuit court rejected this argument, citing S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-50.\r\nWe agree with the circuit court.\r\n\r\nSection 29-5-50 provides:\r\n\r\n             Any person claiming a lien under the provisions of this chapter\r\n             who shall have given the notice provided for herein shall be\r\n             entitled to be paid in preference to the contractor at whose\r\n             instance the labor was performed or material furnished and no\r\n             payment by the owner to the contractor thereafter shall operate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We need not decide in this case whether the fact that the builder had agreed to\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\naccept less than the value of his work affects the amount of money available for\r\nSubcontractor.\r\n\n             to lessen the amount recoverable by the person so giving the\r\n             notice.\r\n\r\nIn other words, \"payment by the owner to the general contractor after the owner\r\nhas received notice of the lien is made at the owner's peril, as it will not effect [sic]\r\nthe amount recoverable by the party with the mechanics' lien.\" Maddux Supply Co.\r\nv. Safhi, Inc., 316 S.C. 404, 412, 450 S.E.2d 101, 106 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\nOwners argue that the circuit court should not have found them \"in violation\" of §\r\n29-5-50 for paying Premier's other subcontractors directly between September\r\n2007, when they received notice of Subcontractor's lien, and May 2008, when\r\nOwners fired Premier. They contend that, by virtue of Subcontractor's lien, it was\r\nobvious that Premier was having financial difficulties. Thus, Owners contend that\r\nunder Stoudenmire, they were entitled to begin paying other subcontractors\r\ndirectly. We find nothing in Stoudenmire that supports Owners' argument.\r\n\r\nIn Stoudenmire the evidence showed that after the general contractor became\r\ninsolvent, \"[Owner] took over the construction job and simply hired [general\r\ncontractor's] employee's to complete the job.\" 308 S.C. at 301, 417 S.E.2d at 636-\r\n7. Here, however, Premier remained on the job, supervising the project and the\r\nsubcontractors who continued to work on the project. Owners did not \"take over\r\nthe job\" but instead continued to rely on Premier to act as the general contractor.\r\nThe circuit court correctly held that Owners cannot reduce the money available to\r\nSubcontractor on its lien by amounts they chose to pay for Premier while Premier\r\nremained the general contractor. A.V.A. Construction teaches that for purposes of\r\nthe mechanics lien statutes, owners can pay general contractors other than by\r\nconveying money directly to them. In A.V.A. Construction, the payment took the\r\nform of the owner's forgiveness of the general contractor's prior debts; here,\r\nOwners paid Premier's debts. Owners' payments to Premier's subcontractors after\r\nnotice of Subcontractor's lien were \"payment by the owner to the contractor\" under\r\n§ 29-5-50. The circuit court properly refused to allow Owners' post-lien direct\r\npayments to Premier's other subcontractors to reduce their obligation to\r\nSubcontractor because to do so would violate § 29-5-50 and the policies\r\nunderlying the entire mechanics lien procedure. 3\r\n\r\n Again, it is important to recall that Premier remained the general contractor until\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2008. As Subcontractor concedes, the result might well be different had\r\nOwners actually fired Premier around the time they learned of its failure to pay\r\nSubcontractor.\r\n\nFinally, Owners contend summary judgment was inappropriate because there\r\nremains a material issue of fact as to the moneys they paid to finish Premier's work\r\nor repair work done by Premier's subcontractors. They contend they would be\r\nentitled to offset funds expended as a result of Premier's abandonment of the job\r\nagainst their debt to Subcontractor. We find summary judgment appropriate here.\r\n\r\nWhere a general contractor abandons the job before work is complete and the\r\nlienholder does not give the owner notice until after that juncture, the owner is\r\nentitled to credit for damages, if any, incurred by the owner to finish the general\r\ncontractor's work. Stoudenmire, supra. Further, where the general contractor has\r\nabandoned the job before completion, the subcontractor gives notice after the\r\nproject is complete, and the original general contractor's work was shoddily\r\nperformed, the owner may be entitled to offset moneys spent to repair that work\r\nagainst the lienholder's recovery. Wood, supra. Assuming without deciding that\r\nthese principles apply where notice is given and the general contractor remains on\r\nthe job, summary judgment was appropriate because Owners failed to present any\r\nevidence that they incurred expenses to repair work performed while Premier was\r\nthe general contractor or to finish the house. Instead, the only evidence is that\r\nwhile they obtained an estimate for the cost of completion, they instead sold the\r\nunfinished house to third parties for an undisclosed sum. There is no evidence\r\nOwners incurred any \"abandonment\" damages.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOwners owed Premier $204,000. Owners, however, (over)paid Premier a total\r\n$254,671.83: $135,740 before Subcontractor's lien was perfected and $118,931.83\r\nafter. Pursuant to § 29-5-50, Owners are only entitled to credit the $135,740\r\nagainst the $204,000 due Premier. The total due to Premier ($204,000) less the\r\nOwners' proper payments ($135,740) leaves $68,260 available for liens.\r\nSubcontractor's lien is $66,862.16, less than the $68,260 available, and therefore\r\nSubcontractor is entitled to its entire lien.\r\n\r\nThe summary judgment order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.\r\nMoore, concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27269","title":"Rainey v.

Rainey brought this action in circuit\r\ncourt against the Honorable Nikki R. Haley, Governor of South Carolina, seeking\r\ndeclarations that Governor Haley, during her service as a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, committed violations of the State Ethics Act.1 The circuit court\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-13-100 to -1520 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\ndismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction, finding the House Ethics Committee\r\nhas exclusive jurisdiction to hear complaints of ethics violations against its own\r\nmembers. We agree and affirm.             I.\r\n\r\nAppellant filed a Complaint in circuit court seeking a declaration that Governor\r\nHaley violated the State Ethics Act while serving as a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.2 Specifically, the Complaint sought declarations that Governor\r\nHaley failed to disclose a reason for recusing herself from a vote, failed to abstain\r\nfrom a vote, solicited money from registered lobbyists for the benefit of her\r\nemployer, and concealed all of the aforementioned activity by making false and\r\nincomplete disclosures required by law.3\r\n\r\nGovernor Haley filed a motion to dismiss in the circuit court based on lack of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction and standing. After a hearing, the circuit court\r\ndismissed the action, finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the\r\nLegislature had granted exclusive authority to the House Ethics Committee to hear\r\nsuch matters. The court denied Appellant's Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to\r\nreconsider. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the dismissal of his circuit court action, Appellant filed a complaint\r\nasserting the identical charges against Governor Haley with the House Ethics\r\nCommittee. After a full merits hearing, the House Ethics Committee dismissed all\r\nof the claims, finding Governor Haley had not violated the law.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred in dismissing the Complaint. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Appellant contended the court had jurisdiction pursuant the Declaratory\r\nJudgments Act, S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-52-10 to -140 (Supp. 2012).\r\n3The Complaint also asserted Governor Haley's actions violated section 2-17-80\r\nof the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), dealing with prohibited acts of members\r\nof the legislature in connection with lobbyists, and section 16-9-10 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2012), which concerns perjury.\r\n\n                                          A. \n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the legislature. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).\r\n\"Where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and\r\ndefinite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court\r\nhas no right to impose another meaning.\" Id. (\"Under the plain meaning rule, it is\r\nnot the court's place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.\").\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina circuit courts are vested with original jurisdiction in civil and\r\ncriminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to\r\ninferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law. S.C.\r\nConst. art. V, § 11. \"In determining whether the Legislature has given another\r\nentity exclusive jurisdiction over a case, a court must look to the relevant statute.\"\r\nDema v. Tenet Physician Servs.-Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 115, 121, 678 S.E.2d\r\n430, 433 (2009).\r\n\r\nThe Legislature has established a comprehensive statutory scheme for regulating\r\nthe behavior of elected officials, public employees, lobbyists, and other individuals\r\nwho present for public service. See generally S.C. Code Ann. §§ 2-17-5 to -150\r\n(Supp. 2011); S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-13-100 to -1520. To enforce the State Ethics\r\nAct, the Legislature statutorily created the State Ethics Commission and the Senate\r\nand House Legislative Ethics Committees, respectively. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-\r\n13-310 and -510.\r\n\r\nAlthough the State Ethics Commission is generally responsible for the handling of\r\nethical violations by most public officials and employees, the House and Senate\r\nLegislative Ethics Committees are charged with the exclusive responsibility for the\r\nhandling of ethics complaints involving members of the General Assembly and\r\ntheir staff. See S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-530 (noting the Ethics Committees are\r\nauthorized to receive and hear complaints regarding ethical violations of members\r\nor staff of the appropriate house); S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-320(9) (noting the Ethics\r\nCommission is authorized to initiate or receive complaints and make investigations\r\nconcerning public officials or public employees, except those concerning members\r\nor staff of the General Assembly). The respective Committees are authorized to\r\nreceive, investigate, and hear all complaints alleging a violation of the State Ethics\r\n\nAct by its own members or staff. See S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-5404 (outlining the\r\nprocedures to be followed when a complaint is filed with the Legislative Ethics\r\nCommittee); see also S.C. House of Representatives Rule 4.16 (delineating\r\nprocedure for investigation and hearings).\r\n\r\nThe extensive and unambiguous statutory scheme contemplates the receipt,\r\nprocessing and resolution of ethics complaints against members of the General\r\nAssembly in the respective chambers of the Legislature. Therefore, it is clear the\r\nLegislature intended the respective Ethics Committees to have exclusive authority\r\nto hear alleged ethics violations of its own members and staff.\r\n\r\n                                       B.\r\nThe statutory scheme, however, does provide one limited situation where the\r\ncircuit court may receive and act on an ethics complaint, to the exclusion of the\r\nEthics Committees:\r\n\r\n      No complaint may be accepted by the ethics committee concerning a\r\n      member of or candidate for the appropriate house during the fifty-day\r\n      period before an election in which the member or candidate is a\r\n      candidate. During this fifty-day period, any person may petition the\r\n      court of common pleas alleging the violations complained of and\r\n\r\n4 Section 8-13-540 provides extensive procedures to the Legislative Ethics\r\nCommittees for receiving, investigating, sanctioning, and dispensing with a\r\ncomplaint. The Committee shall conduct a confidential, preliminary investigation.\r\nIf it finds that probable cause exists to support an alleged violation, the Committee\r\nshall render an advisory opinion. If the member fails to comply with the opinion,\r\nthe Committee shall convene a formal hearing. After the hearing, the Committee\r\ndetermines its findings of fact. If it finds, based on competent and substantial\r\nevidence, the member has committed a violation, the Committee shall administer a\r\npublic or private reprimand, determine that a technical violation has occurred,\r\nrecommend expulsion of the member, and / or refer the matter to the Attorney\r\nGeneral in the case of an alleged criminal violation. If the Committee finds the\r\nmember has not violated a code or statutory provision, it shall dismiss the charges.\r\n\r\nAt all times, the Committee must afford appropriate due process protections,\r\nincluding the right to counsel, the right to call and examine witnesses, the right to\r\ncross-examine, and the right to introduce exhibits. An appeal from the\r\nCommittee's action is to the full legislative body.\r\n\n      praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction, or\r\n      both. Within ten days, a rule to show cause hearing must be held, and\r\n      the court must either dismiss the petition or direct that a mandamus\r\n      order or an injunction, or both, be issued. A violation of this chapter\r\n      by a candidate during this fifty-day period must be considered to be an\r\n      irreparable injury for which no adequate remedy at law exists.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-530(4).\r\n\r\nAbsent this one narrow situation within the fifty-day period before an election, the\r\nLegislature has granted exclusive authority over ethical complaints to the\r\nappropriate Ethics Committee. \"The canon of construction 'expressio unius est\r\nexclusio alterius' or 'inclusio unius est exclusio alterius' holds that 'to express or\r\ninclude one thing implies the exclusion of another, or of the alternative.'\" Hodges,\r\n341 S.C. at 86, 533 S.E.2d at 582 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 602 (7th ed.\r\n1999)). Moreover, the necessity of the circuit court's fifty-day window is self-\r\nevident during the final days of an election, where time is of the essence and an\r\nimmediate remedy may be warranted.5 It is therefore clear the Legislature\r\nintended the respective Ethics Committee to otherwise have exclusive authority to\r\nhear alleged ethics violations of its own members and staff.\r\n\r\nAppellant asserts the case of Ford v. State Ethics Commission supports the circuit\r\ncourt's exercise of jurisdiction in this matter. 344 S.C. 642, 545 S.E.2d 821 (2001).\r\nAppellant's reliance on Ford is misplaced. Ford in no manner lends support to the\r\nargument that the circuit court has jurisdiction to hear this action. Ford, a state\r\nsenator, was the subject of a matter filed in the State Ethics Commission. Ford\r\nsought dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the State Ethics Commission\r\nlacked jurisdiction over a state senator's conduct, as jurisdiction rested exclusively\r\nwith the Senate Ethics Committee. Id. at 644, 545 S.E.2d at 822. The State Ethics\r\n5 Even in such an instance, the Legislature has limited the remedy that the circuit\r\ncourt can impose. See S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-530 (\"Within ten days, a rule to\r\nshow cause hearing must be held, and the court must either dismiss the petition or\r\ndirect that a mandamus order or an injunction, or both, be issued.\"). Thus, the\r\ncircuit court is not authorized to issue the enumerated sanctions the Committees\r\nare authorized to issue. Cf. id. § 8-13-540(3) (stating that if the Ethics Committee\r\nfinds a violation, it shall administer a public or private reprimand, determine that a\r\ntechnical violation has occurred, recommend expulsion of the member, or refer the\r\nmatter to the Attorney General for investigation in the case of an alleged criminal\r\nviolation).\r\n\nCommission complaint was dismissed and we affirmed. Ford is in accord with our\r\nconstruction of the State Ethics Act.     C.\r\nFinally, the South Carolina Constitution and this Court have expressly recognized\r\nand respected the Legislature's authority over the conduct of its own members.\r\nSee, e.g., Const. Art. 3, § 11 (stating each house has the authority to judge the\r\nelection returns and qualifications of its own members); Const. Art. 3, § 12\r\n(providing that each chamber shall determine its own rules of procedure, punish its\r\nmembers for disorderly behavior, and expel a member); see also Stone v.\r\nLeatherman, 343 S.C. 484, 541 S.E.2d 241 (2001) (finding court did not have\r\njurisdiction over election result in light of Article 3, § 11 of the Constitution that\r\nprovides the Senate has the authority to judge the election returns and\r\nqualifications of its own members); Scott v. Thorton, 234 S.C. 19, 106 S.E.2d 446\r\n(1959) (finding the court had no jurisdiction in light of the constitutional\r\nprovisions that require each house to judge the election returns and qualifications\r\nof its own members). Consequently, a court's exercise of jurisdiction over\r\nAppellant's ethical complaint against Governor Haley would not only contravene\r\nthe clear language of the State Ethics Act, it would also violate separation of\r\npowers.6 See S.C. Const. art. I, § 8 (\"In the government of this State, the\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial powers of the government shall be forever\r\nseparate and distinct from each other, and no person or persons exercising the\r\nfunctions of one of said departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any\r\nother.\").\r\n\r\nIn sum, ethics investigations concerning members and staff of the Legislature are\r\nintended to be solely within the Legislature's purview, to the exclusion of the\r\ncourts, except in the singular circumstance expressly provided for in section 8-13-\r\n530(4).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., and PLEICONES, J., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in result\r\nin a separate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n6In light of our conclusion, we need not reach the remaining issues on appeal. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\ndisposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nJUSTICE BEATTY: I concur in result. In my view, the circuit court correctly\r\ndismissed Appellant's declaratory judgment action. I disagree, however, with the\r\nmajority's reasoning as I believe the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction,\r\nbut the matter was not procedurally proper for its consideration. Because\r\nAppellant's primary purpose for filing the action was to seek a declaration that\r\nRespondent's conduct violated the criminal laws of this state, I would find\r\ndeclaratory judgment proceedings were inappropriate as it would deprive\r\nRespondent of her constitutional right to a jury trial. Furthermore, Appellant, as a\r\nprivate citizen, was precluded from seeking this relief. Finally, any determination\r\nas to whether Respondent's conduct violated provisions of the South Carolina\r\nEthics, Government Accountability, and Campaign Reform Act of 1991 (\"the\r\nEthics Act\")7 was not ripe for judicial review as Appellant failed to exhaust the\r\nAct's administrative remedies.8\r\n\r\n                       I.    Declaratory Judgment Actions\r\n       In analyzing this appeal, it is important to initially recognize that Appellant\r\nfiled his case pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Section 15-53-\r\n20 of the South Carolina Code identifies the purpose of the Uniform Declaratory\r\nJudgments Act (\"the Act\") and provides that courts \"shall have power to declare\r\nrights, status and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be\r\nclaimed.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-53-20 (2005); see Rule 57, SCRCP (\"The\r\nprocedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment pursuant to Code §§ 15-53-10\r\nthrough 15-53-140, shall be in accordance with these rules, and . . . [t]he existence\r\nof another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in\r\ncases where it is appropriate.\"). The Act is to be liberally construed and\r\nadministered to achieve its intended purpose \"to settle and to afford relief from\r\nuncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal relations.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-53-130 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-13-100 to -1520 (Supp. 2011).\r\n8  I base my conclusion on the statutory provisions in effect at the time Appellant\r\nfiled his declaratory judgment action on November 17, 2011. Notably, several\r\nbills have been introduced in the House and Senate that specifically confer\r\njurisdiction with the State Ethics Commission and amend the process and\r\nprocedures governing the disposition of ethics complaints. S.B. 133, S.B. 338,\r\nS.B. 347, H.B. 3407, H.B. 3945, 120th Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (S.C. 2013).\r\n\n       Despite this liberal construction, \"[d]eclaratory judgment statutes do not\r\ncreate jurisdiction, and the court must have the authority to grant the relief as well\r\nas jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties.\" 26 C.J.S. Declaratory\r\nJudgments § 123 (Supp. 2013). Stated another way, \"[t]he authority of a state's\r\ncourts to render declaratory judgments must operate within the limits of the\r\nconstitutional powers and duties of those courts.\" Id. Thus, \"[a] declaratory\r\njudgment action may be maintained only if the jurisdictional conditions that are\r\nrequired in ordinary actions are present.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Applying these principles to the instant case, it is necessary to determine:\r\n(1) whether the circuit court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action\r\nand, if so, (2) whether the action constituted a justiciable controversy appropriate\r\nfor judicial determination.\r\n\r\n                        II.    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\n       \"Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the\r\ngeneral class to which the proceedings in question belong.\" Skinner v.\r\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 93, 668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008) (citations\r\nomitted)). As provided in our state constitution, \"The Circuit Court shall be a\r\ngeneral trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, except\r\nthose cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and\r\nshall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.\" S.C. Const. art. V, § 11.\r\nThus, pursuant to this broad constitutional provision, a circuit court has subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction to hear any justiciable matter unless the General Assembly has\r\nconferred exclusive jurisdiction of the matter to an inferior court. Dema v. Tenet\r\nPhysician Servs.-Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 115, 120-21, 678 S.E.2d 430, 433\r\n(2009). In determining whether the General Assembly \"has given another entity\r\nexclusive jurisdiction over a case, a court must look to the relevant statute.\" Id. at\r\n121, 678 S.E.2d at 433.\r\n\r\n       In my view, a circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over violations of\r\nthe Ethics Act as I discern no statutory provision, and Respondent has not\r\nidentified one, which confers exclusive jurisdiction to the State Ethics Commission\r\nor the Legislative Ethics Committees.9 Although these legislative entities are\r\n\r\n9As a member of the House of Representatives at the time of the alleged\r\nmisconduct, Respondent would only have been subject to the jurisdiction of the\r\nHouse of Representatives Legislative Ethics Committee as members of the General\r\nAssembly are not subject to the jurisdiction of the State Ethics Commission. See\r\n\nstatutorily authorized to receive complaints, the fact that jurisdiction has been\r\nconferred does not operate to divest the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nSee Muldrow v. Jeffords, 144 S.C. 509, 520, 142 S.E. 602, 605 (1928)\r\n(\"[A]ccording to a well-established rule of law, those who undertake to deprive [a\r\ncourt] of jurisdiction in any given case and give it to [another] must be able to\r\npoint out some particular provision of the Constitution which either expressly or by\r\nnecessary implication gives jurisdiction of such case to the limited and inferior\r\ntribunal to the exclusion of the superior tribunal.\").\r\n\r\n       Instead, several provisions of the Ethics Act reveal the General Assembly\r\nhas implicitly conferred the circuit court with concurrent jurisdiction over matters\r\narising from the Ethics Act. For example, the circuit court is designated as the\r\nexclusive forum for resolving Ethics Act complaints involving a legislative\r\nmember or candidate during the fifty-day period before an election in which the\r\nmember or candidate is a candidate.10 Thus, by implication, the circuit court is an\r\navailable forum to resolve all Ethics Act violations and is the exclusive forum for\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-320(9) (Supp. 2011) (outlining duties and powers of the\r\nState Ethics Commission and noting that it may initiate or receive complaints and\r\nmake investigations involving a \"public official, public member, or public\r\nemployee except members or staff, including staff elected to serve as officers of or\r\ncandidates for the General Assembly unless otherwise provided for under House or\r\nSenate Rules\"); id. § 8-13-530 (identifying powers and duties of legislative ethics\r\ncommittees in receiving and investigating complaints as to a \"member or staff of\r\nthe appropriate house\"); see also Ford v. State Ethics Comm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 644,\r\n545 S.E.2d 821, 822 (2001) (holding that State Ethics Commission did not have\r\njurisdiction over state senator as it was vested in the Senate Ethics Committee).\r\n10  S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-320(9)(b)(1) (Supp. 2011) (\"No complaint may be\r\naccepted by the commission concerning a candidate for elective office during the\r\nfifty-day period before an election in which he is a candidate. During this fifty-day\r\nperiod, any person may petition the court of common pleas alleging the violations\r\ncomplained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or\r\ninjunction, or both.\"); id. § 8-13-530(4) (\"No complaint may be accepted by the\r\nethics committee concerning a member of or candidate for the appropriate house\r\nduring the fifty-day period before an election in which the member or candidate is\r\na candidate. During this fifty-day period, any person may petition the court of\r\ncommon pleas alleging the violations complained of and praying for appropriate\r\nrelief by way of mandamus or injunction, or both.\").\r\n\nallegations that arise fifty days before an election. Additionally, the State Ethics\r\nCommission is authorized to file in the court of common pleas a certified copy of\r\nan order or decision that results in a judgment that \"has the same effect as though it\r\nhad been rendered in a case duly heard and determined by the court.\" § 8-13-\r\n320(14).\r\n\r\n       Because there is no statutory or constitutional authority to support the circuit\r\ncourt's holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, I believe the court erred in\r\ndismissing Appellant's action on this ground.\r\n\r\n                           III.   Justiciable Controversy\r\n       Having found the circuit court was vested with the subject matter\r\njurisdiction, the question becomes whether Appellant demonstrated a justiciable\r\ncontroversy that was appropriate for the court's determination.\r\n\r\n        Although the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is to be broadly\r\nconstrued, it is not without limitation. Sunset Cay, L.L.C. v. City of Folly Beach,\r\n357 S.C. 414, 423, 593 S.E.2d 462, 466 (2004). \"An adjudication that would not\r\nsettle legal rights of the parties would only be advisory in nature and, therefore,\r\nwould be beyond the intended purpose and scope of the Uniform Declaratory\r\nJudgments Act.\" Id. \"To state a cause of action under the Declaratory Judgment\r\nAct, a party must demonstrate a justiciable controversy.\" Id. A justiciable\r\ncontroversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for\r\njudicial determination, as distinguished from a dispute or difference of a\r\ncontingent, hypothetical or abstract character. Power v. McNair, 255 S.C. 150,\r\n154, 177 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1970); Colleton County Taxpayers Ass'n v. Sch. Dist. of\r\nColleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 638 S.E.2d 685 (2006) (recognizing that an issue\r\nthat is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract is not ripe for judicial review).\r\n\r\n      In the instant case, Appellant did not demonstrate the requisite justiciable\r\ncontroversy to maintain a cause of action under the Uniform Declaratory\r\nJudgments Act as: (1) these proceedings were inappropriate to determine guilt or\r\ninnocence in a criminal matter; (2) he was not the proper party to pursue the\r\ncriminal allegations, and (3) he failed to exhaust the administrative remedies\r\nprovided for in the Ethics Act.\r\n\n                                          A.\r\n\r\n       As his Complaint states, Appellant sought a determination by the circuit\r\ncourt that Respondent's alleged ethical misconduct \"violate[d] the law(s) of South\r\nCarolina.\" This statement, in conjunction with counsel's arguments before this\r\nCourt, can only lead to the conclusion that Appellant sought to criminally\r\nprosecute Respondent.\r\n\r\n       Initially, I note that a declaratory judgment action is not the appropriate\r\nproceeding for determining guilt or innocence in criminal matters. See W.E.\r\nShipley, Annotation, Validity, Construction, and Application of Criminal Statutes\r\nor Ordinances as Proper Subject for Declaratory Judgment, 10 A.L.R.3d 727, § 2\r\n(1966 & Supp. 2013) (discussing state and federal cases that have considered the\r\navailability of declaratory judgment procedures to determine matters of criminal\r\nlaw and stating, \"This is not to say that a declaratory proceeding may be resorted to\r\nto try ordinary matters of guilt or innocence, or even whether particular\r\ncontemplated action will or will not amount to a violation of a criminal provision,\r\nunless there are presented peculiar circumstances making the resort to declaratory\r\nrelief particularly appropriate\"). If we were to permit this type of relief,\r\nRespondent would be denied her constitutional right to a jury trial. U.S. Const.\r\namend. VI; S.C. Const. art. I, § 14.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, Appellant, as a private citizen, lacked the authority to seek this\r\nrelief because \"[t]he South Carolina Constitution, South Carolina statutes and case\r\nlaw place the unfettered discretion to prosecute solely in the prosecutor's hands.\"\r\nIn re Richland County Magistrate's Court, 389 S.C. 408, 411, 699 S.E.2d 161, 163\r\n(2010) (emphasis added). By precluding a private citizen from prosecuting a\r\ncriminal action, the interests of the public are best served as the \"powers of the\r\nState are employed only for the interest of the community at large\" as opposed to\r\nthe potential self-interest of a private party. Id. at 412, 699 S.E.2d at 163.\r\n\r\n       Although Appellant was not the proper party to pursue the criminal action,\r\nhis concern for the public was not without recourse as the Attorney General's\r\noffice, either on its own initiative or via a referral from the House of\r\nRepresentatives Legislative Ethics Committee, could have sought a criminal\r\ndetermination of the alleged misconduct.\r\n\r\n      Our state constitution provides, \"[t]he Attorney General shall be the chief\r\nprosecuting officer of the State with authority to supervise the prosecution of all\r\ncriminal cases in courts of record.\" S.C. Const. art. V, § 24. Thus, \"the\r\n\nprosecution has wide latitude in selecting what cases to prosecute,\" which\r\nnecessarily would include violations of the Ethics Act. State v. Thrift, 312 S.C.\r\n282, 307, 440 S.E.2d 341, 355 (1994) (holding that prosecution under the Ethics\r\nAct does not require referral by the Ethics Commission as the Attorney General's\r\npower to prosecute \"arises from our State Constitution and cannot be impaired by\r\nlegislation\"); see Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 526 S.E.2d 222 (2000) (discussing\r\nprosecution of state trooper for using his official position for financial gain under\r\n1991 Ethics Act).11                       B.\r\n       Alternatively, to the extent Appellant's Complaint can be construed as purely\r\na civil action involving a violation of the Ethics Act,12 I would find it was not ripe\r\nfor judicial review as Appellant failed to exhaust the administrative remedies\r\nprovided for in the Ethics Act.\r\n\r\n       Initially, I note that Appellant's failure to exhaust the administrative\r\nremedies did not affect the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction. As this Court\r\nhas explained, \"[t]he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is generally\r\nconsidered a rule of policy, convenience and discretion, rather than one of law, and\r\nis not jurisdictional.\" Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 17 n.5, 538 S.E.2d 245, 246 n.5\r\n(2000) (citations omitted). \"Thus, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies\r\ngoes to the prematurity of a case, not subject matter jurisdiction.\" Id. \"The general\r\nrule is that administrative remedies must be exhausted absent circumstances\r\nsupporting an exception to application of the general rule.\" Hyde v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nMental Health, 314 S.C. 207, 208, 442 S.E.2d 582, 583 (1994).\r\n\r\n      Although the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action, the\r\nEthics Act provided administrative remedies specifically tailored to efficiently\r\nresolve Appellant's complaint against Respondent.\r\n\r\n11 Regardless of whether a matter goes to the State Ethics Commission or to the\r\nHouse/Senate Ethics Committee, under either statutory scheme the Commission or\r\nthe appropriate Ethics Committee can refer a matter to the Attorney General if\r\ncriminal conduct has been committed.\r\n12 See Thrift, 312 S.C. at 307, 440 S.E.2d at 355 (\"recognizing the civil nature of\r\nthe Ethics Act complaint\" and providing for criminal referral by the Ethics\r\nCommission to the Attorney General).\r\n\n       Pursuant to the Ethics Act, the State Ethics Commission is designated as the\r\nadministrative agency13 that is imbued with the power to initiate complaints,\r\nreceive complaints from individuals, and to investigate the complaints regarding \"a\r\npublic official, public member, or public employee except members or staff,\r\nincluding staff elected to serve as officers of or candidates for the General\r\nAssembly unless otherwise provided under House or Senate Rules.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 8-13-310 (Supp. 2011) (providing for State Ethics Commission and\r\ncomposition of its members); id. § 8-13-320 (outlining the duties and powers of the\r\nState Ethics Commission) (emphasis added)).14\r\n\r\n       Because Respondent was serving as a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives at the time of the alleged misconduct, any complaint against her\r\nwould have been filed with the House of Representatives Legislative Ethics\r\nCommittee as this committee and a Senate Legislative Ethics Committee have been\r\nestablished in addition to the State Ethics Commission. S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-\r\n510 (Supp. 2011). These legislative ethics committees were created to receive\r\n\r\n13  See Sanford v. South Carolina State Ethics Comm'n, 385 S.C. 483, 685 S.E.2d\r\n600 (2009) (deferring to State Ethics Commission, as an administrative agency, for\r\nmatters regarding investigation of ethics complaint against Governor), clarified by,\r\n386 S.C. 274, 688 S.E.2d 120 (2009).\r\n14 Any person charged with an ethical violation before the State Ethics\r\nCommission is entitled to the administrative process outlined in section 8-13-320\r\nand an administrative hearing conducted in accordance with the Administrative\r\nProcedures Act. Id. § 8-13-320(9), (10). If, upon investigation, the commission\r\nstaff determines there is probable cause to believe that a violation has been\r\ncommitted, a hearing may be held before a panel of three commissioners. Id. § 8-\r\n13-320(10)(i). Within sixty days after the conclusion of a hearing, the commission\r\npanel must issue a written decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\r\nId. § 8-13-320(10)(k). \"The commission panel, where appropriate, shall\r\nrecommend disciplinary or administrative action, or in the case of an alleged\r\ncriminal violation, refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action.\"\r\nId. \"Within ten days after service of an order, report, or recommendation, a\r\nrespondent may apply to the commission for a full commission review of the\r\ndecision made by the commission panel.\" Id. § 8-13-320(m). Although this\r\nreview is the final disposition of the complaint before the commission, a\r\nrespondent may appeal to the Court of Appeals, pursuant to section 1-23-380 and\r\nthe South Carolina Appellate Court Rules. Id.\r\n\ncomplaints filed by individuals and investigate possible ethical violations\r\ncommitted by a member or staff of the appropriate house. Id. § 8-13-530\r\n(outlining powers and duties of legislative ethics committees). Specifically, an\r\nethics committee is designated to \"administer or recommend sanctions appropriate\r\nto a particular member or staff of or candidate for the appropriate house pursuant\r\nto Section 8-13-540 or dismiss the charges.\" Id. § 8-13-530(6).\r\n\r\n       After a complaint is filed with the ethics committee, a copy must be\r\npromptly sent to the person alleged to have committed the violations. Id. § 8-13-\r\n540(1). \"If the ethics committee determines the complaint does not allege facts\r\nsufficient to constitute a violation, the complaint must be dismissed and the\r\ncomplainant and respondent notified.\" Id. However, if the ethics committee\r\ndetermines the complaint alleges facts sufficient to constitute a violation, it must\r\npromptly investigate the alleged violation. Id. If, after such preliminary\r\ninvestigation, the ethics committee finds that probable cause exists to support an\r\nalleged violation, it shall either: (a) render an advisory opinion to the respondent\r\nand require respondent's compliance within a reasonable time; or (b) convene a\r\nformal hearing on the matter within thirty days of respondent's failure to comply\r\nwith the advisory opinion. Id.\r\n\r\n       If a hearing is held, the ethics committee shall determine its findings of fact\r\nas to whether the respondent committed an ethical violation. Id. § 8-13-540(3). If\r\nthe committee finds a violation, it shall:\r\n      (a) administer a public or private reprimand;\r\n\r\n      (b) determine that a technical violation as provided for in Section 8-\r\n         13-1170 has occurred;\r\n\r\n\r\n      (c) recommend expulsion of the member; and/or,\r\n\r\n\r\n      (d) in the case of an alleged criminal violation, refer the matter to the\r\n         Attorney General for investigation. The ethics committee shall\r\n         report its findings in writing to the Speaker of the House or\r\n         President Pro Tempore of the Senate, as appropriate. The report\r\n         must be accompanied by an order of punishment and supported\r\n         and signed by a majority of the ethics committee members. If the\r\n\n         ethics committee finds the respondent has not violated a code or\r\n         statutory provision, it shall dismiss the charges.\r\n\r\nId. § 8-13-540 (3). The individual has ten days from the date of notification of the\r\nethics committee's action to appeal the action to the full legislative body. Id. § 8-\r\n13-540(4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Had Appellant pursued the above-outlined administrative remedies, he could\r\nhave received the relief he requested in his declaratory judgment action.\r\nSpecifically, he could have procured a determination as to whether Respondent's\r\nactions constituted an ethical violation. If a violation was found, the ethics\r\ncommittee may have issued a public reprimand, recommended expulsion, or\r\nreferred the matter to the Attorney General for a criminal investigation. Thus, as a\r\nmatter of policy and efficiency, it would have been procedurally more appropriate\r\nfor Appellant to file his Complaint with the House of Representatives Legislative\r\nEthics Committee rather than the circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Because Appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, I would\r\nfind the matter was premature and, thus, not proper for the circuit court's\r\nconsideration.                   IV.    Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, I would affirm as modified the circuit court's order\r\ndismissing Appellant's declaratory judgment action. Because the General\r\nAssembly has not conferred the State Ethics Commission or the Legislative Ethics\r\nCommittees with exclusive jurisdiction over ethics complaints, the circuit court\r\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over Appellant's action. Despite subject matter\r\njurisdiction being vested in the circuit court, Appellant failed to demonstrate a\r\njusticiable controversy to maintain a cause of action under the Uniform\r\nDeclaratory Judgments Act. Thus, the action was not proper for the circuit court's\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27270","title":"Narruhn v.

We affirm as\r\nmodified.\r\n\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n       Narruhn brought a lawsuit seeking damages against RKC Entertainment,\r\nL.L.C., d/b/a The Red Room (\"RKC\"), and Ardon Percevial Cato, II (\"Cato\") after\r\nshe was shot and injured by Cato while she was a customer at The Red Room, a\r\nnightclub in Myrtle Beach. Thereafter, by order of reference, a special referee was\r\ndirected to conduct supplemental proceedings to determine if there were any assets\r\navailable to satisfy the judgment. After a hearing, the special referee issued an\r\norder granting Narruhn an assignment of any and all rights, including any claims,\r\nthat RKC might have against Insurer, who had previously issued a liability\r\ninsurance policy to RKC for The Red Room.\r\n\r\n       Narruhn then brought the current lawsuit against Insurer and Anderson\r\nGeneral Insurance, the producing agency, seeking actual and punitive damages and\r\nalleging, inter alia, the failure to pay or defend a claim. Insurer filed a Rule 60(b)\r\nmotion to set aside the order of the special referee granting Narruhn an assignment\r\nof rights.1 The circuit court denied Insurer's Rule 60(b) motion after finding (1) the\r\nmotion was untimely and not properly before the circuit court because the motion\r\nwas not made within one year of the date of the order of reference; (2) it was\r\nwithout authority to rule on Insurer's Rule 60(b) motion because it should have\r\nbeen directed to the special referee, not the circuit court; and (3) Insurer had no\r\nstanding to challenge the special referee's order granting an assignment as it was\r\nnot a party to the challenged order from which it sought relief. Insurer appealed\r\nthe circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals, and the matter was certified for\r\nthis Court's review under Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                               II. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Timeliness\r\n\r\n       As to the issue of timeliness, we agree with Insurer that the circuit court\r\nerroneously considered the date of the order of reference in calculating the\r\ntimeliness of Insurer's Rule 60(b) motion, rather than the date of the challenged\r\norder, which is the special referee's order granting Narruhn an assignment of rights.\r\nThe special referee's order granting Narruhn an assignment of RKC's rights was\r\nfiled on March 8, 2010. Insurer's motion challenging that order was made pursuant\r\n\r\n1   Although Insurer's motion and the circuit court's order are captioned with\r\nNarruhn's current action number, both the contents of Insurer's motion and the\r\ncircuit court's order state the Rule 60(b) motion was directed to the special referee's\r\nruling.\r\n\nto the provisions of Rule 60(b)(1) (surprise), (b)(4) (void), and (b)(5) (inequitable)\r\non or about December 10, 2010.\r\n\r\n       Motions under Rule 60(b)(1), (2), or (3) must be made within a reasonable\r\ntime, but not later than one year of the order taken, and those under (4) and (5) are\r\nsubject only to the reasonable time limitation. Insurer's motion was clearly timely\r\nunder these parameters as it was made well within one year of the date of the\r\nspecial referee's order granting the assignment and within a reasonable time. See\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP (\"The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for\r\nreasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or\r\nproceeding was entered or taken.\"); BB & T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 633 S.E.2d\r\n501 (2006) (stating the decision to deny or grant a motion made pursuant to Rule\r\n60(b), SCRCP is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, which will not be\r\ndisturbed unless the order of the court is controlled by an error of law or is based\r\non factual findings that are without evidentiary support).\r\n\r\nB.    Authority\r\n\r\n       As to the issue of authority, we find the circuit court did have the authority\r\nto rule on Insurer's motion. Since the special referee had already entered a final\r\norder regarding the supplemental proceedings as directed under the order of\r\nreference, the special referee had no remaining duties to perform, and the matter\r\nwas properly before the circuit court. Because the Rule 60(b) motion presents a\r\nseparate matter, it does not run afoul of the general rule prohibiting one circuit\r\ncourt judge from overruling another. Cf. Wachovia Bank of S.C. v. Player, 341\r\nS.C. 424, 535 S.E.2d 128 (2000) (holding where a matter had been referred to the\r\nmaster with finality, but the master had not concluded all of his duties under the\r\norder of reference because he had directed a foreclosure yet still needed to conduct\r\nthe sale and dispose of the surplus fund, the master had the authority to decide a\r\nparty's Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP motion).\r\n\r\nC.    Standing\r\n       As to the issue of standing, the circuit court found the Rule 60(b) motion\r\nwas not properly before it and should, therefore, be denied because Insurer was not\r\na party to the order from which it sought relief. See Rule 60(b), SCRCP (\"On\r\nmotion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal\r\nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding . . . .\" (emphasis\r\nadded)).\r\n\n        As an initial matter, we question whether Insurer has preserved an objection\r\nto the circuit court's ruling on standing. Insurer did not specifically set forth any\r\nchallenge to this independent basis for the circuit court's denial of the Rule 60(b)\r\nmotion in its Statement of Issues on Appeal and, although it made an implied\r\nreference to standing in the conclusion of its brief, it cited none of the authorities\r\nthat it belatedly advanced during the oral argument of this matter. See Rule\r\n208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set\r\nforth in the statement of the issues on appeal.\"); id. Rule 208(b)(1)(D) (\"The brief\r\nshall be divided into as many parts as there are issues to be argued. At the head of\r\neach part, the particular issue to be addressed shall be set forth in distinctive type,\r\nfollowed by discussion and citations of authority.\").\r\n\r\n       In any event, we find the cases and argument advanced by Insurer do not\r\nsupport Insurer's position that the circuit court erred in finding it did not have\r\nstanding to make a Rule 60(b) motion because it was not a party to the challenged\r\njudgment. In McClurg v. Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 671 S.E.2d 87 (Ct. App. 2008),\r\naff'd 395 S.C. 85, 716 S.E.2d 887 (2011), the employer of a party filed a motion to\r\nintervene in the case, which was granted, so at the time the employer made a Rule\r\n60(b) motion, it was a party and, as a party, the employer could seek relief from the\r\njudgment. Insurer also cited Edwards v. Ferguson, 254 S.C. 278, 175 S.E.2d 224\r\n(1970), a case decided prior to the adoption of the SCRCP, for the proposition that\r\na nonparty insurer may petition for relief under Rule 60(b). In Edwards, the\r\ndefendant (Ferguson) and his insurance company moved to set aside a default\r\njudgment entered against Ferguson on the basis of mistake, inadvertence, surprise,\r\nor excusable neglect. Thus, there is no question that the motion was properly\r\nbefore the court as it was being advanced by a party to the judgment, Ferguson,\r\nand no issue was raised regarding the insurance company's status. Accordingly,\r\nthis case does not support Insurer's argument in this regard. Since Insurer has not\r\nestablished that it was a party or the legal representative of a party, it was not\r\nentitled to seek relief under the provisions of Rule 60(b). See Fairchild v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Transp., 398 S.C. 90, 107-08, 727 S.E.2d 407, 416 (2012) (stating in\r\ninterpreting the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court applies the\r\nsame rules of construction used to interpret statutes, and if a rule's language is\r\nplain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, interpretation is unnecessary\r\nand the court is obligated to follow and to enforce the stated meaning).\r\n\r\n      The concurring/dissenting opinion concludes Insurer did have standing to\r\nbring a challenge by means of a Rule 60(b) motion. The opinion contends the\r\nassignment was in error because notice and an opportunity to be heard must be\r\nafforded to Insurer before its rights may be affected, citing, inter alia, S.C. Code\r\n\nAnn. § 15-39-350 (2005) (governing the examination of debtors of a judgment\r\ndebtor) and Johnson v. Service Management, Inc., 319 S.C. 165, 168, 459 S.E.2d\r\n900, 902 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating where funds are held by a third party, \"the funds\r\non deposit could be reached only after the supplementary proceedings were held to\r\nexamine [the third party] with regard to the account\").2\r\n\r\n       While we agree in general with the law cited, we find these provisions are\r\nnot controlling here because they pertain to the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion,\r\nsuch as whether the assignment was valid in the face of an anti-assignment clause\r\nand other enumerated defenses (see Section D below), and they do not involve the\r\nthreshold issue before this Court, namely, the propriety of Insurer's challenge to the\r\nassignment by means of a Rule 60(b) motion. Because Insurer does not fall within\r\nthe plain terms of Rule 60(b), in that Insurer was not a party or the legal\r\nrepresentative of a party, Rule 60(b) is not the proper vehicle for any challenge in\r\nthis regard. That is not to say, however, that Insurer is without recourse. The\r\nreferee, in making the assignment, referred to it as a \"chose in action,\"3 and\r\nexpressly stated Narruhn assumed the rights that RKC might have against Insurer,\r\n\"if any.\" Moreover, Narruhn stipulated, as she must, at oral argument before this\r\nCourt that Insurer still retains all of its defenses and rights under the insurance\r\n\r\n2 Johnson involved an attempt to satisfy a judgment by obtaining funds held in a\r\njudgment debtor's bank account. 319 S.C. at 167, 459 S.E.2d at 902. The Court of\r\nAppeals explained that funds on deposit, unless put into a special account,\r\n\"becomes the property of the bank and goes into its general account.\" Id. at 167-\r\n68, 459 S.E.2d at 902. \"The funds on deposit thus are no longer the personal\r\nproperty of the depositor; instead, the depositor has a chose in action against the\r\nbank for recovery of the deposit.\" Id. at 168, 459 S.E.2d at 902. The court stated\r\nthe funds could not be reached through execution and levy, but only through\r\nsupplemental proceedings. Id.\r\n3 A \"chose in action\" has been variously defined as (1) \"A proprietary right in\r\npersonam, such as a debt owed by another person, a share in a joint-stock\r\ncompany, or a claim for damages in tort\"; (2) \"The right to bring an action to\r\nrecover a debt, money, or thing\"; and (3) \"Personal property that one person owns\r\nbut another person possesses, the owner being able to regain possession through a\r\nlawsuit.\" Black's Law Dictionary 275 (9th ed. 2009). \"South Carolina\r\njurisprudence has long recognized that a chose in action can be validly assigned in\r\neither law or equity.\" Moore v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 220, 644 S.E.2d 740, 745\r\n(Ct. App. 2007). \"In South Carolina a chose or thing in action is statutorily\r\nincluded in one's personal property and is assignable.\" Id. (citation omitted).\r\n\ncontract. See, e.g., Twelfth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Nat'l Safe Corp., 335 S.C. 635,\r\n639-40, 518 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating that an assignee generally\r\n\"stands in the shoes of its assignor\" and has the same rights as the assignor\r\n(citation omitted)); Chet Adams Co. v. James F. Pederson Co., 308 S.C. 410, 413,\r\n418 S.E.2d 337, 338 (Ct. App. 1992) (\"Generally, the assignee of a non-negotiable\r\nchose in action takes it subject to all equities and defenses which could have been\r\nset up against the assignor at the time of the assignment.\"); 29 Williston on\r\nContracts § 74:47 (4th ed. 2003) (\"[T]he assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in\r\naction . . . takes it subject to all defenses that the obligor may have had against the\r\nassignor . . . .\").\r\n\r\n        We note Johnson refers to the need for supplemental proceedings, which\r\nwere held in the current matter with all necessary parties present, and section 15-\r\n39-350 speaks in terms of the \"discretionary authority\" of the court to question a\r\nthird party when it deems it necessary, as indicated by the statute's use of \"may\"\r\nrather than \"shall.\"4 Although we need not reach the issue here, it appears the\r\nreferee did not believe Insurer's approval of the assignment of RKC's rights was\r\nrequired, and we note it is generally held that an assignment after a loss has\r\nalready occurred does not require an insurer's consent. See 3 Couch on Insurance\r\n3d § 35:8 (2011 Rev. Ed.) (\"[T]he great majority of courts adhere to the rule that\r\ngeneral stipulations in policies prohibiting assignments of the policy, except with\r\nthe consent of the insurer, apply only to assignments before loss, and do not\r\nprevent an assignment after loss, for the obvious reason that the clause by its own\r\nterms ordinarily prohibits merely the assignment of the policy, as distinguished\r\nfrom a claim arising under the policy, and the assignment before loss involves a\r\ntransfer of a contractual relationship while the assignment after loss is the transfer\r\nof a right to a money claim. The purpose of a no assignment clause is to protect\r\nthe insurer from increased liability, and after events giving rise to the insurer's\r\nliability have occurred, the insurer's risk cannot be increased by a change in the\r\ninsured's identity.\" (footnotes omitted)); 44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance § 786 (2003)\r\n(\"After a loss has been incurred, the claim to recover insurance proceeds may be\r\neffectively assigned by the insured.\"); 17 Williston on Contracts § 49:126 (4th ed.\r\n\r\n4 \"[U]pon an affidavit that any person or corporation has property of such\r\njudgment debtor or is indebted to him in any amount exceeding ten dollars, the\r\njudge may by an order require such person or corporation, or any officer or\r\nmember thereof, to appear at a specified time and place and answer concerning\r\nsuch property or indebtedness. The judge may also, in his discretion, require\r\nnotice of such proceeding to be given to any party to the action in such manner as\r\nmay seem to him proper.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-39-350 (2005) (emphasis added).\r\n\n2000) (\"As a general principle, a clause restricting assignment [in an insurance\r\npolicy] does not in any way limit the policyholder's power to make an assignment\r\nof the rights under the policy . . . after a loss has occurred. . . . It is now a vested\r\nclaim against the insurer and can be freely assigned or sold like any other chose in\r\naction or piece of property.\"); see also Young v. Chicago Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n,\r\n535 N.E.2d 977, 980-81 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989) (\"An insurance policy that is assigned\r\nafter a claim arises is an assignment of the policy proceeds; such a transaction\r\nresults in an assignment of a chose in action which does not require the insurer's\r\nconsent.\" (citing Couch on Insurance)); Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Commerce &\r\nIndus. Ins. Co., 962 N.E.2d 1042 (Ill. App. Ct. 2011) (same, citing Young, 535\r\nN.E.2d at 980-81); Kintzel v. Wheatland Mut. Ins. Ass'n, 203 N.W.2d 799, 804-05\r\n(Iowa 1973) (rejecting an insurer's contention that an insurance policy was not\r\nassignable without its consent, and stating, \"[a]fter the loss was incurred, the issue\r\nbecame not an assignment of the policy, but the assignment of a chose in\r\naction….\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nD.    Merits\r\n        Lastly, to the extent Insurer argues the merits of its Rule 60(b) motion in its\r\nbrief, i.e., that the special referee erred in granting an assignment of rights to\r\nNarruhn,5 we hold that argument is not properly before this Court since the circuit\r\ncourt denied the motion for reasons related to timeliness, authority, and standing,\r\nand we ultimately find no error in the circuit court's decision to deny the motion\r\nbased on standing. See Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289,\r\n292 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"Where a decision is based on alternative grounds, either of\r\nwhich independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision will not be\r\nreversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.\"). Moreover, the issue of\r\nstanding was not appealed.\r\n\r\n      As noted above, however, Insurer has retained all of its defenses and rights\r\nunder the insurance contract, and said defenses and rights will be considered in\r\nNarruhn's pending action against Insurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Insurer asserts it was not given notice of the supplemental proceedings, the\r\ncontract of insurance prohibits an assignment of rights without its consent, the\r\npolicy was not in effect at the time of the incident as the policy had already been\r\ncancelled for nonpayment of premiums, and the policy was void for RKC's\r\nviolation of the cooperation clause.\r\n\n                              III. CONCLUSION\r\n     Based on the foregoing, the circuit court's order denying Insurer's Rule 60(b)\r\nmotion to set aside the order of the special referee is affirmed as modified.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. ACTING CHIEF\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES, concurring in a separate opinion. KITTREDGE, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in the result here\r\nwhich allows appellant to assert all its rights, including any defenses, in\r\nrespondent's pending action against appellant. I write separately because\r\nwhile I agree with Justice Beatty that appellant lacked standing to bring this\r\nRule 60(b) motion, I also agree with Justice Kittredge that we should not\r\nreach the merits of appellant's anti-assignment argument both because\r\nwithout standing the merits are not before the Court, and because respondent\r\nhas stipulated that appellant retains all of its defenses and rights under the\r\ninsurance contract. I therefore concur in the decision to affirm the circuit\r\ncourt's denial of appellant's Rule 60(b) motion.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I concur in part and dissent in part. I respectfully\r\ndissent from this Court's advisory opinion concerning the efficacy of the anti-\r\nassignment provision in the insurance policy. I otherwise concur in result only\r\nbecause of the stipulation that Appellant Alea London Limited's rights remain fully\r\npreserved, notwithstanding the clearly erroneous order of the circuit court denying\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP, relief. As noted by the majority, \"Narruhn conceded at oral\r\nargument that [Appellant] Insurer has retained all of its defenses and rights under\r\nthe insurance contract.\"\r\n\r\nI write separately because I fundamentally disagree with the suggestion that\r\nAppellant lacked standing to challenge the order of the special referee assigning\r\nthe insured's rights under the policy. I find it breathtaking and a Due Process\r\nviolation for a court to unilaterally and without notice affect and potentially impair\r\na third party's contract rights and then deny that third party the ability and standing\r\nto challenge the court order.6\r\n\r\nThe facts are not in dispute. Elisa Narruhn was injured in a shooting at The Red\r\nRoom, a Myrtle Beach nightclub. The Red Room is owned by RKC\r\nEntertainment, LLC (RKC). Narruhn obtained a default judgment against RKC\r\nand sought to enforce the judgment through supplemental proceedings. The matter\r\nwas referred to a special referee who, at the request of Narruhn, referred to the\r\ninsurance policy as a \"chose in action.\" With the insurance policy characterized as\r\na chose in action, the special referee believed he had the authority to assign RKC's\r\ncontract rights under the insurance policy to Narruhn. As stated, this was\r\naccomplished without notice to Appellant. This was error.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to decide the correctness of the chose in action designation.\r\nEven assuming the insurance policy was properly characterized as a chose in\r\n\r\n\r\n6 I do not understand the majority's suggestion that the issue of Appellant's\r\nstanding is not preserved, and I do not agree with the majority's finding that \"the\r\nissue of standing was not appealed.\" The entire essence of its Rule 60(b), SCRCP,\r\nmotion was that the special referee's order affected its rights. As asserted in its\r\nsupporting memorandum, Appellant argued that \"Alea London, whose interests\r\nwere to be affected, should have been provided Notice of Hearing before the\r\nSpecial Referee.\" In Appellant's final brief to this Court, Appellant referenced the\r\ncircuit court's order \"that [Appellant] may not file a Rule 60 motion because it was\r\nnot a party[,]\" and stated that the \"Trial Court's Order errs in construing South\r\nCarolina law.\" A fair reading of this record reeks of Appellant's contention that it\r\nhas standing to pursue Rule 60(b) relief.\r\n\naction by the special referee, it was improper to effect an assignment of the\r\ninsurance policy without notice to Appellant. The law is clear—if an account or\r\nasset of a judgment debtor is held by a third party, that account or asset may be\r\nreached in supplemental proceedings only after notice and opportunity to be heard\r\nis given to the third party. See Johnson v. Serv. Mgmt., Inc., 319 S.C. 165, 167-69,\r\n459 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that where funds are held by a\r\nthird party that are allegedly owed a judgment debtor, \"the funds on deposit could\r\nbe reached only after supplementary proceedings were held to examine [the third\r\nparty] with regard to the account\").\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 15-39-350 provides:\r\n\r\n      After the issuing or return of an execution against property of the\r\n      judgment debtor or of any one of several debtors in the same\r\n      judgment and upon an affidavit that any person or corporation has\r\n      property of such judgment debtor or is indebted to him in any amount\r\n      exceeding ten dollars, the judge may by an order require such person\r\n      or corporation, or any officer or member thereof, to appear at a\r\n      specified time and place and answer concerning such property or\r\n      indebtedness. The judge may also, in his discretion, require notice of\r\n      such proceeding to be given to any party to the action in such manner\r\n      as may seem to him proper.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Here, no affidavit was presented to the special referee, and\r\nAppellant was given no notice and opportunity to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmed with the assignment, Narruhn filed the underlying action seeking actual and\r\npunitive damages for failure to pay or defend a claim. Appellant was served and\r\nthen learned, for the first time, of the special referee's assignment of RKC's rights\r\nunder the insurance policy to Narruhn. Appellant filed the Rule 60(b) motion\r\nunderstandably claiming \"surprise.\"7 I am confident the able circuit judge would\r\nhave rectified the error of the special referee had he not mistakenly believed that\r\nhis exercise of jurisdiction would run afoul of the rule prohibiting one circuit judge\r\nfrom overruling another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 As Appellant observed in its Rule 60(b) motion, \"[t]here was nothing regarding\r\nthe [special referee's order] which was not a surprise.\" (emphasis in original).\r\n\nThis case may well illustrate the reasons why section 15-39-350, as well as basic\r\nnotions of due process, require the providing of notice and opportunity to be heard\r\nto a third party before its rights may be affected. This is so because Appellant\r\nattempted to demonstrate in its Rule 60(b) motion to the circuit court the\r\nfollowing: (1) the policy excluded coverage for \"all causes of action arising out of\r\nan assault and/or battery\"; (2) RKC failed to comply with the policy by failing to,\r\namong other things, notify Appellant of the Complaint, damages hearing and order\r\nof reference to the special referee; and (3) the policy included an anti-assignment\r\nprovision, \"[RKC's] rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred\r\nwithout [Appellant's] written consent except in the cause of death of an individual\r\nNamed Insured.\"\r\n\r\nWith great respect for the majority, I believe it ventures inappropriately into the\r\nmerits of Appellant's anti-assignment challenge. We are to believe that Appellant,\r\nwhich the majority assumes has no standing because its rights were not affected by\r\nthe special referee's order, may assert all of its defenses in the underlying action.\r\nYet today, this Court sends an unmistakable message to the trial court that\r\nAppellant's reliance on the policy's anti-assignment provision is meritless. The\r\nCourt speculates that \"it appears the referee did not believe [Appellant's] approval\r\nof the assignment of RKC's rights was required.\" I speculate that the referee had\r\nno clue that the policy had an anti-assignment provision, for it would not have\r\nserved the mutual interests of Narruhn and RKC to inform the referee of the terms\r\nof the policy. After an extensive discussion indicating that an assignment after a\r\nloss has already occurred does not require an insurer's consent, the majority\r\ncorrectly observes that the issue \"is not properly before this Court.\" Does one\r\nreally expect the trial court to view this issue without regard to the Court's advisory\r\nview of the anti-assignment provision? We are doing the same thing the special\r\nreferee did—prematurely and adversely affecting Appellant's rights. I dissent from\r\nthe Court's advisory opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps in recognition of the erroneous rulings of the special referee and the circuit\r\ncourt, Narruhn made her concession at oral argument, acknowledging that\r\nAppellant retains all of its rights in the pending action. It is solely because of the\r\nstipulation fully preserving Appellant's rights that I otherwise concur in result.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27271","title":"State v.

Miller, 393 S.C. 59, 709\r\nS.E.2d 135 (Ct. App. 2011), in which it considered the novel question of whether a\r\ndefendant's probation for a criminal offense should be tolled during his civil\r\ncommitment pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) Act.1 The Court of\r\nAppeals affirmed a circuit court order tolling James C. Miller's probation while he\r\nis in the SVP program. We reverse.  I. FACTS\r\n        On September 6, 2001, Miller pled guilty to committing a lewd act on a\r\nchild under the age of sixteen and criminal domestic violence of a high and\r\naggravated nature (CDVHAN). For the lewd act conviction, Miller was sentenced\r\nto fifteen years in prison, suspended upon the service of ten years in prison and\r\nfive years of probation. The sentencing sheet on this charge indicates Miller was\r\nordered to undergo sex abuse counseling while in the South Carolina Department\r\nof Corrections, and that he was to have no contact with children while on\r\nprobation. Miller received a concurrent sentence of ten years in prison for the\r\nCDVHAN conviction.\r\n\r\n       Miller's probation began on or about December 1, 2005.2 However, Miller\r\nwas not released from custody because, prior to his release from prison, he was\r\nreferred for review as to whether he should be deemed an SVP and subjected to\r\ncivil commitment. Miller was ultimately found by a jury to be an SVP. He has\r\nbeen in commitment pursuant to the SVP program and housed at the Edisto Unit\r\nsince November 29, 2006.3 Miller's commitment was affirmed by the Court of\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. §§ 44-48-10 to -170 (Supp. 2012). Amendments to some of the\r\nprovisions in the SVP Act were passed by the General Assembly subsequent to the\r\ncurrent matter.\r\n2 According to a report of the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and\r\nPardon Services, Miller's probation began on December 1, 2005 and was scheduled\r\nto end on November 30, 2010.\r\n3 An SVP remains under the supervision of the South Carolina Department of\r\nMental Health and is housed in the Edisto Unit on the grounds of the South\r\nCarolina Department of Corrections. See S.C. Department of Mental Health\r\nwebpage, available at http://www.state.sc.us/dmh/dir_facilities.htm.\r\n\nAppeals and this Court. In re the Care and Treatment of Miller, 385 S.C. 539, 685\r\nS.E.2d 619 (Ct. App. 2009), aff'd, 393 S.C. 248, 713 S.E.2d 253 (2011).\r\n\r\n       On August 28, 2008, Miller's probation officer issued a probation citation\r\nand supporting affidavit. In the box on the citation form for specifying the alleged\r\nviolation, it is indicated: \"Citation issued to give court subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nover indictment number 2001-GS-32-2716.\" A hearing was held before the circuit\r\ncourt on December 19, 2008, at which the court initially expressed some\r\nreservation about tolling probation in a matter involving a civil commitment.\r\nHowever, the court thereafter issued an \"Order Tolling Probation\" on March 24,\r\n2009.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. State v. Miller, 393 S.C. 59, 709 S.E.2d 135\r\n(Ct. App. 2011). The Court of Appeals held the circuit court did not exceed its\r\ndiscretion in finding Miller was unable to comply with all of the conditions of his\r\nprobation while committed as an SVP and that he would benefit from supervision\r\nwhile in the community. Id. at 63, 709 S.E.2d at 137.\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals further stated this Court has recognized that the circuit\r\ncourt has the authority to toll probation in at least two instances: (1) partial\r\nrevocation and continuance, and (2) absconding from supervision. Id. The Court\r\nof Appeals stated, however, that it was \"mindful that in both these instances the\r\nprobationer has generally committed some affirmative act to violate the conditions\r\nof probation.\" Id. The court acknowledged \"Miller was civilly committed against\r\nhis will,\" but noted \"he admitted to committing a lewd act on a minor under the age\r\nof sixteen[,] which contributed to the basis for his civil commitment.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals rejected Miller's argument that tolling his probation in\r\nthese circumstances converts his civil commitment into a punitive commitment by\r\nextending the length of his criminal sentence. Id. at 64, 709 S.E.2d at 137-38.\r\nThis Court has granted Miller's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\n                       II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       The determination of probation matters lies within the sound discretion of\r\nthe trial court. See generally State v. Ellis, 397 S.C. 576, 726 S.E.2d 5 (2012);\r\nState v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 634 S.E.2d 653 (2006). An appellate court will reverse\r\nthe trial court's decision where there has been an abuse of discretion. Allen, 370\r\nS.C. at 94, 634 S.E.2d at 656.\r\n\n       \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based upon an\r\nerror of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based upon\r\nfactual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when the trial\r\ncourt is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised;\r\nor when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible decisions\r\napplicable in a particular case, such that it may be deemed arbitrary and\r\ncapricious.\" Id.              III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       Miller contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding the circuit court\r\nproperly tolled his probation during his civil commitment as an SVP. Miller\r\nasserts the applicable statutes do not specifically authorize such tolling, and he has\r\ncommitted no misconduct that would justify the imposition of equitable tolling\r\nbecause the probation citation was issued only to bring his probation status before\r\nthe circuit court.       Statutory Authority for Probation\r\n       \"In South Carolina, parole and probation are governed by statute.\" State v.\r\nCrouch, 355 S.C. 355, 360, 585 S.E.2d 288, 291 (2003). Statutory law authorizes\r\nthe circuit court to suspend the imposition or the execution of a criminal sentence\r\nand place the defendant on probation, except for crimes punishable by death or life\r\nimprisonment. S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-410 (2007).4 \"Probation is a form of\r\nclemency.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       \"The period of probation or suspension of sentence shall not exceed a period\r\nof five years and shall be determined by the judge of the court and may be\r\ncontinued or extended within the above limit.\" Id. § 24-21-440 (emphasis added).\r\nThus, while the court may extend the length of the probation originally given, the\r\ntotal period of probation may not exceed the statutory maximum of five years.\r\n\r\n       \"Probation, a suspension of the period of incarceration, is clearly part of a\r\ncriminal defendant's 'term of imprisonment[,'] as is actual incarceration, parole, and\r\nthe suspended portion of a sentence[.]\" Thompson v. S.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 335\r\n4 Section 24-21-410 was amended in 2010, but the amendment does not affect the\r\ncurrent appeal.\r\n\nS.C. 52, 55-56, 515 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1999). Therefore, whether a violation of\r\nprobationary terms has occurred and the consequences of any such violation are\r\nmatters for the courts. Duckson v. State, 355 S.C. 596, 598 n.2, 586 S.E.2d 576,\r\n578 n.2 (2003). If a defendant has violated the terms of his probation, the circuit\r\ncourt may revoke the defendant's probation or suspension of sentence, or, in its\r\ndiscretion, the court may require the defendant to serve all or a portion only of the\r\nsentence imposed. S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-460 (2007).\r\n\r\n                Tolling Recognized Under South Carolina Law\r\n\r\n      There is no explicit reference to tolling in the statutes governing probation.\r\nHowever, South Carolina's appellate courts have expressly recognized the general\r\nauthority of the circuit court to toll probation.\r\n\r\n       In State v.Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162, 573 S.E.2d 783 (2002), the circuit court\r\nruled the defendant's probationary term was tolled and therefore did not begin to\r\nrun until after he successfully completed his mandatory two-year term of service in\r\na community supervision program (CSP) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 21-24-560\r\n(Supp. 1998) for his no-parole offense.5 Id. at 164-65, 573 S.E.2d at 783-84.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, this Court noted this was a statutory construction case, and\r\ninterpreted South Carolina Code section 24-21-560(E), which \"provides, '[a]\r\nprisoner who successfully completes a [CSP] pursuant to this section has satisfied\r\nhis sentence and must be discharged from his sentence.'\" Id. at 165, 573 S.E.2d at\r\n                                                          \r\n784 (alterations in original). While observing that \"all parties agree the statutory\r\nscheme is convoluted,\" the Court held that a prisoner's successful completion of\r\nthe mandatory CSP for no-parole offenses completely discharges his sentence,\r\nincluding his five-year probationary period, as this result was mandated by the\r\nterms of the statute. Id. at 167, 573 S.E.2d at 785. Although this Court reversed\r\n\r\n5 A \"no parole offense\" is one in which a prisoner must serve at least 85% of the\r\nactual term of imprisonment imposed. See Dawkins, 352 S.C. at 164 n.1, 573\r\nS.E.2d at 784 n.1; see also S.C. Code Ann. § 24-13-100 (2007) (stating a \"no\r\nparole offense\" refers to \"a class A, B, or C felony or an offense exempt from\r\nclassification as enumerated in Section 16-1-10(d), which is punishable by a\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment for twenty years or more\"); id. § 24-13-150(A)\r\n(defendant must serve 85% of actual term of imprisonment imposed).\r\n\nthe circuit court's tolling of probation, it did so because the probation was\r\nsubsumed by the CSP, not because tolling is prohibited. The Court stated it\r\n\"believe[d] the legislature intended mandatory participation in the CSP to serve as\r\na more rigorous term of probation for those convicted of no-parole offenses, in lieu\r\nof normal probation.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, in State v. Crouch, this Court generally observed tolling could be\r\nappropriate in circumstances involving \"absconding or partial revocation and\r\ncontinuance.\" 355 S.C. at 359 n.2, 585 S.E.2d at 290 n.2. The Court found the\r\njudge erroneously revoked a sentence and tolled the running of probation when the\r\nappellant's probation had already ended. Id. at 359-60, 585 S.E.2d at 290-91.\r\nHowever, the Court concluded it need not address whether probationary sentences\r\ncould be tolled so as to turn concurrent sentences into consecutive ones. Id. at 361,\r\n585 S.E.2d at 291.\r\n\r\n       In State v. Hackett, 363 S.C. 177, 609 S.E.2d 553 (Ct. App. 2005), the Court\r\nof Appeals affirmed a circuit court's ruling that the defendant's probation could be\r\ntolled during the period the defendant had absconded from supervision. In doing\r\nso, the Court of Appeals reasoned there was no explicit prohibition in section 24-\r\n21-440 (providing probation may not exceed five years) on tolling probation. Id. at\r\n181, 609 S.E.2d at 555. In addition, in construing the legislative intent, the circuit\r\ncourt could not logically give Hackett credit against his five-year probationary\r\nperiod for the time he absconded, because to do so would be to allow Hackett to\r\nescape revocation of his probation and any further punishment, \"free and clear of\r\nall consequences, as long as he manages to elude apprehension for a set amount of\r\ntime,\" which \"would lead to an absurd result.\" Id. at 181-82, 609 S.E.2d at 555-56.\r\nThe Court of Appeals relied for support upon United States v. Green, in which the\r\nfederal district court stated, \"It would be unreasonable to conclude that a\r\nprobationer could violate conditions of probation and keep the clock running at the\r\nsame time, thereby annulling both the principle and purpose of probation.\" Id. at\r\n182-83, 609 S.E.2d at 556 (quoting United States v. Green, 429 F. Supp. 1036,\r\n1038 (W.D. Tex. 1977)).\r\n\r\n                     Application of Tolling in Current Matter\r\n\r\n       In the current appeal, the Court of Appeals stated it was mindful that in\r\ninstances where the Supreme Court of South Carolina had previously recognized\r\ntolling was appropriate, \"the probationer has generally committed some affirmative\r\n\nact to violate the conditions of probation.\" Miller, 393 S.C. at 63, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n137 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals appeared to find this\r\nstandard was met based on Miller's past misconduct: \"Miller was civilly\r\ncommitted against his will, [but] he admitted to committing a lewd act on a minor\r\nunder the age of sixteen[,] which contributed to the basis for his civil\r\ncommitment.\" Id. We find Miller's past misconduct is irrelevant in this particular\r\nanalysis, as it would not form the basis for finding a probation violation nor would\r\nit support tolling of probation because the conduct occurred before sentencing.\r\n\r\n       The general rule applied in most jurisdictions is that the tolling of probation\r\nis appropriate where the authorities could not supervise the defendant due to the\r\ndefendant's wrongful acts. It is based on the principle that a defendant should not\r\nbe allowed to profit from his own misconduct which prevents supervision by\r\nprobationary authorities. See generally 24 C.J.S. Criminal Law § 2153 (2006)\r\n(\"The period of probation is tolled while the probationer is a fugitive from justice\r\nor serving a sentence imposed by another court. The period during which the\r\nprobationer is imprisoned for violating his or her probation tolls the probationary\r\nterm for the duration of the imprisonment.\" (footnote omitted)). The references to\r\ntolling by our own appellate courts have also focused on fault-based grounds.\r\nThus, we conclude that the tolling of probation must be premised on a violation of\r\na condition of probation or a statutory directive.\r\n\r\n      The State does not allege that Miller has violated a condition of his\r\nprobation. Indeed, the State makes no allegation of fault by Miller. The State\r\nargues only that Miller's probationary period should be tolled because he is\r\nreceiving mental health treatment in the SVP program and is, therefore,\r\nunavailable for community supervision.\r\n\r\n       The SVP program in this state is administered under the supervision of the\r\nDepartment of Mental Health. See generally S.C. Code Ann. § 44-48-20 (Supp.\r\n2012) (providing the General Assembly has found that an involuntary, civil\r\ncommitment process is desirable for those found to be an SVP and observing that\r\n\"[t]he civil commitment of [SVPs] is not intended to stigmatize the mentally ill\r\ncommunity\"); id. § 44-48-30(1)(a)-(b) (defining an SVP as one who (1) \"has been\r\nconvicted of a sexually violent offense,\" and (2) \"suffers from a mental\r\nabnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts\r\nof sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care,\r\nand treatment\").\r\n\n        Notwithstanding its punitive attributes, this Court and many others, to\r\ninclude the United States Supreme Court, have concluded that an SVP program is a\r\ncivil, non-punitive treatment program. Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 267 (2001)\r\n(concluding confinement under Washington's SVP program was civil and not\r\nintended as punishment); Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 361-65 (1997)\r\n(holding a similar SVP program was civil and that involuntary commitment for a\r\nmental abnormality was not punitive); In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh,\r\n351 S.C. 122, 135, 568 S.E.2d 338, 344 (2002) (stating the SVP Act is a civil, non-\r\npunitive statutory scheme); In re Care and Treatment of Matthews, 345 S.C. 638,\r\n648, 550 S.E.2d 311, 316 (2001) (\"Our [SVP] Act specifies the purpose of the Act\r\nis civil commitment.\"). The SVP program is treated as a civil program for all other\r\npurposes, and we see no existing basis for treating this type of civil commitment\r\nfor persons with mental illness any differently than other forms of civil\r\ncommitment.\r\n\r\n       Traditionally, a civil commitment, whether in a drug treatment center,\r\nmental health clinic, or other facility, does not give rise to tolling, and it appears\r\ninconsistent to treat those under civil commitment in the SVP program any\r\ndifferently in the absence of some legislative directive to do so. As it stands now,\r\ncommitment to the SVP treatment program is indeterminate and could last a life\r\ntime. Although we certainly appreciate the policy considerations that weigh on\r\nboth sides in this matter, the decision to carve out a categorical exception for those\r\ncommitted in the SVP program, as opposed to other forms of civil commitment, is\r\na matter best left to the General Assembly, since probation exists solely by statute,\r\nand the General Assembly has not, to date, seen fit to make this exception.\r\n\r\n                                IV.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n                         FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n      On April 20, 2006, in Georgetown County, Petitioner pleaded guilty as\r\ncharged to the indicted offenses of one count of criminal sexual conduct with a\r\nminor in the second degree (CSC 2nd) and two counts of committing lewd act\r\nupon a minor (lewd act).1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Petitioner waived presentment to the grand jury on the CSC 2nd charge and\r\npleaded guilty as indicted to the two lewd act charges. Specifically, Petitioner\r\npleaded guilty to sexual encounters occurring in 1988, 1989, and 1999 and\r\ninvolving three separate male minors. At Petitioner's plea, the State averred that\r\nPetitioner engaged in the lewd acts in 1988 and 1989 with Victims 1 and 2, both\r\naged twelve at the time of the incidents, while Petitioner served as their youth\r\npastor. According the Indictment, Petitioner forced these Victims to engage in\r\ninappropriate touching as they were sleeping in the bed with Petitioner. The CSC\r\n2nd charge arose from an incident in 1999, in which Victim 3 alleged Petitioner\r\nsodomized him during a church-sanctioned trip to the beach during Petitioner's\r\ntenure as head pastor at Low County Baptist Church in Murrells Inlet, South\r\nCarolina. Although Petitioner admitted to the facts of these allegations during his\r\nplea, at sentencing, he presented the following mitigation: (1) Petitioner and his\r\nparents claimed Petitioner was a victim of generational sexual abuse, and as pastor\r\nat Low County Baptist, he often used the sexual abuse inflicted upon him as a child\r\nas a tool in his ministry; (2) many of the members of Petitioner's church were\r\npresent at the plea to support him; (3) since the incidents, Petitioner had married\r\nand fathered three children, two biological children and an adopted teen-aged son\r\nfrom Romania; and (4) the young children submitted letters on Petitioner's behalf,\r\nand the teen-aged son spoke on Petitioner's behalf in court, pleading for leniency\r\nfor Petitioner and claiming Petitioner had never sexually abused him.\r\n\n       During his guilty plea, Petitioner stated unequivocally that he committed the\r\nacts alleged by the State, and engaged in a detailed colloquy with the court\r\naffirming that he entered into the plea voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\r\nThe circuit court sentenced Petitioner to concurrent sentences of imprisonment for\r\na period of eight years, suspended upon the service of five years, plus three years'\r\nprobation, for each of the charges. No direct appeal was taken with respect to\r\nthese convictions or the sentences.\r\n\r\n       At the time of the Georgetown County plea, plea counsel also represented\r\nPetitioner on pending charges in Williamsburg County involving one of the\r\nGeorgetown County victims. Unbeknownst to Petitioner at the time of the\r\nGeorgetown plea, he became eligible to receive a sentence of life without the\r\npossibility of parole (LWOP), pursuant to section 17-25-45(A) of the South\r\nCarolina Code, or the \"two-strike\" law, upon a subsequent conviction of another\r\n\"most serious\" crime. See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-25-45(A) (2003).2\r\n\r\n       Petitioner proceeded to trial on the Williamsburg charges in July 2007, and a\r\njury found him guilty of CSC 2nd and kidnapping. The circuit court judge\r\nsentenced Petitioner to two consecutive LWOP sentences, pursuant to section 17-\r\n25-45 of the South Carolina Code, due to his prior conviction for CSC 2nd in\r\nGeorgetown County. Petitioner filed a direct appeal upon his conviction in the\r\nWilliamsburg County case, which was affirmed. See State v. Taylor, Op. No. 4920\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 21, 2011) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 46 at 107).\r\n\r\n      On April 3, 2007, Petitioner filed an application for PCR, and an evidentiary\r\nhearing was convened on November 20 and 21, 2008.\r\n\r\n       At the evidentiary hearing, plea counsel admitted he did not advise\r\nPetitioner that his plea to CSC 2nd in Georgetown County could be used as a\r\n\r\n\r\n2CSC 2nd is considered a \"most serious\" offense for purposes of sentencing\r\nenhancement under this section. See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-25-45(C)(1) (Supp.\r\n2011) (enumerating \"most serious\" offenses). At the time of Petitioner's plea, an\r\nLWOP sentence was mandatory under section 17-25-45(A). See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n17-25-45(G) (2003) (providing the provisions of section 17-25-45(A) are\r\nmandatory). Under its present iteration, section 17-25-45(G) provides that the\r\nSolicitor has discretion to seek sentencing enhancement under section 17-25-\r\n45(A). See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-25-45(G) (Supp. 2011) (\"The decision to invoke\r\nsentencing under this section is in the discretion of the solicitor.\").\r\n\npredicate offense that would expose him to an LWOP sentence on the\r\nWilliamsburg County charges,3 and that this was a grave mistake in his\r\nrepresentation.4\r\n\r\n      Petitioner testified that he was unaware of the potential for an LWOP\r\nsentence in the Williamsburg County case until after he pleaded guilty to the\r\nGeorgetown County charges.5 He testified further that he and plea counsel never\r\ndiscussed that pleading guilty in Georgetown would result in a \"strike,\" and that he\r\nwould not have chosen to plead guilty in Georgetown County had he known the\r\nplea could expose him to an LWOP sentence on the Williamsburg County\r\ncharges.6\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Plea counsel explained that the Williamsburg County charge was originally for\r\nlewd act, and at the time of the Georgetown County plea, counsel had not read the\r\nwarrant indicating the charge had intensified, and he had not yet seen the discovery\r\nin the Williamsburg County case. However, plea counsel stated that he would\r\nhave discussed the ramifications of pleading guilty in Georgetown with Petitioner\r\nif he realized the severity of the Williamsburg County charges. On the other hand,\r\nPetitioner testified that although he had been charged initially with lewd act in\r\nWilliamsburg County, he became aware of the increased severity of the\r\nWilliamsburg County charges in November 2005. Petitioner testified that he was\r\nunaware until the PCR hearing that plea counsel misapprehended the severity of\r\nthese charges in Williamsburg County at the time of his Georgetown County plea.\r\n4For example, at one point during the proceeding, plea counsel explained: \"And—\r\nAnd I'm gone [sic]—I'm going to continue to say this: I made a mistake in this\r\ncase. The mistake is I didn’t tell [Petitioner] about the second strike . . . . I certainly\r\nwill never make that mistake again.\"\r\n5Petitioner testified he understood that all of his charges, including those alleged in\r\nWilliamsburg County, were connected and that he \"was taking the trash out at the\r\nsame time . . . . up until [he and plea counsel] literally were walking through the\r\ndoor to go in front of [the plea judge].\" Petitioner testified that, \"at that point, [plea\r\ncounsel] said, 'I was not able to take care of the stuff in Williamsburg, but go ahead\r\nand do this, and we'll take care of that later.'\"\r\n6 Conversely, plea counsel testified that Petitioner chose not to proceed to trial on\r\nthe Georgetown County charges as initially planned because, prior to trial, his\r\nwife's divorce attorney provided a disc to the Solicitor containing a recorded\r\n\n       Upon realizing his mistake, however, plea counsel testified he sought to\r\nmitigate the impact it would have on the Williamsburg County charges. To this\r\nend, plea counsel testified he approached the Solicitor in charge of Petitioner's case\r\nin Williamsburg County, and they came to an informal agreement under which the\r\nSolicitor would allow Petitioner to plead to the lesser-included offense of lewd act\r\nwith no sentencing recommendation made by the State during the plea. Plea\r\ncounsel testified he was confident that Petitioner would receive an identical and\r\nconcurrent sentence to his sentence for the Georgetown County charges. Plea\r\ncounsel testified the deal was contingent upon Petitioner's acceptance of these\r\nterms, yet Petitioner remained adamant that he would not plead guilty to the\r\nWilliamsburg County charges. Around this time, the relationship between\r\nPetitioner and plea counsel began to deteriorate because Petitioner was angry with\r\nplea counsel for failing to inform him of the consequences of the Georgetown\r\nCounty plea. Therefore, prior to the formalization of the agreement orchestrated\r\nby plea counsel, Petitioner fired plea counsel and hired new counsel to handle the\r\nWilliamsburg County case. Petitioner's new counsel never communicated with the\r\nSolicitor concerning the plea deal, and Petitioner proceeded to trial on the\r\nWilliamsburg County charges.\r\n\r\n       At the evidentiary hearing, the PCR court also questioned Petitioner\r\nextensively about the particulars of his exchange with the Georgetown County plea\r\njudge, and Petitioner admitted that he declared unequivocally at the plea that he\r\nwas guilty of the charges and subsequently engaged in a lengthy colloquy with the\r\nplea judge concerning the voluntariness of his plea. However, Petitioner asserted\r\nthat he was not in fact guilty of CSC 2nd, and that plea counsel failed to investigate\r\nevidence that would have exonerated him.\r\n\r\n      Specifically, Petitioner pointed to a discrepancy in the alleged date on which\r\nthe CSC 2nd occurred. The arrest warrant indicated the CSC occurred in June or\r\nJuly 1999. Shortly before the Georgetown County plea, the indictment was\r\nprepared, alleging the CSC 2nd occurred \"on or about August 5, 1999 through\r\nAugust 7, 1999.\" According to the statement of facts presented at the plea\r\n\r\nconversation in which Petitioner admitted to the facts of the Georgetown County\r\nallegations. Plea counsel testified that once Petitioner listened to the recorded\r\nconversation, he decided to plead guilty to the Georgetown County charges instead\r\nof proceeding to trial. At the PCR hearing, Petitioner denied the conversation\r\nrelated to the crimes charged and that he decided to plead guilty because of the\r\nexistence of the recorded conversation.\r\n\nproceeding, the victim alleged he and Petitioner had gone to the beach. When\r\nPetitioner discovered the boys waiting to shower at the church, he offered to allow\r\nthe victim to shower at his home, where they engaged in the sexual act forming the\r\nallegations against Petitioner.\r\n\r\n       Petitioner presented evidence at the PCR hearing that the showers at the\r\nchurch were not in operation that summer, which he claimed plea counsel could\r\nhave presented as evidence to refute the victim's testimony for either the June/July\r\ndates or the August dates. In addition, Petitioner testified he was assisting several\r\nmembers of the church with renovations on another member's home on August 5–\r\n7, 1999. Therefore, he claimed he could not have committed the crimes on the\r\ndates alleged in the Indictment. Although Petitioner claimed he would not have\r\npleaded guilty to the Georgetown County charges had he known about the date\r\nchange in the Indictment, the Record reveals that Petitioner was advised by the\r\ntime of the plea that the dates for the alleged CSC 2nd had changed to August 5–7.\r\nMoreover, plea counsel testified that Petitioner never advised counsel of his\r\npotential alibi or the information available to him for purposes of discrediting the\r\nvictim's testimony about the showers at the church. In fact, plea counsel testified\r\nthat, prior to the plea, Petitioner informed him he knew of a witness who would\r\nexonerate him. However, counsel testified that when he interviewed the supposed\r\nwitness, he remembered nothing about the time period in question or the particular\r\nbeach trip. According to plea counsel, Petitioner never advised him of the fact that\r\nthere were no working showers at the church. Furthermore, plea counsel testified\r\nhe did not discover any information which would have aided Petitioner in\r\ndefending against the CSC 2nd charge.\r\n\r\n       The PCR court issued an Order of Dismissal denying Petitioner's application\r\nas to all issues. Specifically relevant to this appeal, the PCR court found that the\r\nrecidivist consequence of Petitioner's plea resulting in enhancement of Petitioner's\r\nsentence was a collateral consequence of the plea about which counsel had no duty\r\nto advise Petitioner. The PCR court further found that, even if the recidivist\r\nconsequence were a circumstance about which Petitioner should have been\r\nadvised, he did not find credible Petitioner's testimony that he would have gone to\r\ntrial on the Georgetown charges had he known about the consequence, as\r\nPetitioner indicated he expected to be exonerated on the Williamsburg County\r\ncharges. Consequently, Petitioner believed an LWOP sentence would have been \"a\r\nmere future contingency that he thought would never apply to him.\" In addition,\r\nthe PCR judge found Petitioner, a thirty-six year old, failed to point to a significant\r\ndifference between an LWOP sentence and the fifty year sentence, of which he\r\nwould have to serve eighty-five percent, he would face on the Williamsburg\r\n\nCounty charges if he had not had a prior conviction for a \"most serious\" offense.\r\nFinally, the PCR judge found the Solicitor offered to allow Petitioner to plead to a\r\nlesser-included offense in the Williamsburg County case, which would not have\r\nsubjected him to an LWOP sentence, and although plea counsel strongly urged\r\nPetitioner to accept the offer, Petitioner chose to exercise his right to a jury trial,\r\nthereby subjecting himself to an LWOP sentence. Accordingly, the PCR judge\r\nfound Petitioner's LWOP sentence was a direct result of his knowing and voluntary\r\ndecision to reject the plea offer in the Williamsburg County case and his ultimate\r\nconviction on those charges.\r\n\r\n       With respect to the failure to investigate claim, the PCR court found that\r\nPetitioner failed to prove counsel's performance fell below reasonable professional\r\nnorms or that he suffered any prejudice because: (1) counsel and Petitioner\r\nreviewed discovery prior to the plea; (2) through his investigation, counsel learned\r\npertinent witnesses had no memory of the events surrounding the allegations, but\r\nsome recalled facts that were harmful to Petitioner's case; (3) Petitioner and his\r\nfamily were aware of the date change prior to the plea, and at no time did\r\nPetitioner tell counsel that the new dates impacted his decision to plead guilty; (4)\r\nthe alibi testimony presented by Petitioner did not necessarily refute that the crime\r\noccurred; and (5) Petitioner never mentioned the inoperability of the showers to his\r\ncounsel. Based on these facts, the PCR court found counsel's investigation was\r\nreasonable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n      Petitioner appealed to this Court for a writ of certiorari, and we granted\r\nreview on the briefs pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\nI.\t    Whether plea counsel's failure to advise Petitioner of the recidivist\r\n       consequence of his plea on another pending criminal charge\r\n       constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\n\r\nII.\t   Whether defense counsel's failure to conduct a sufficient investigation\r\n       into the criminal sexual conduct charge constitutes ineffective\r\n       assistance of counsel.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      On appeal in a PCR action, this Court applies an \"any evidence\" standard of\r\nreview. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989). The\r\n\n\"PCR court's ruling should be upheld if it is supported by any evidence of\r\nprobative value in the record.\" Speaks v. State, 377 S.C. 396, 399, 660 S.E.2d 512,\r\n514 (2008) (citing Cherry, 300 S.C. at 119, 386 S.E.2d at 626).\r\n\r\n       A criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to effective assistance of\r\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. U.S. Const.\r\namend. VI; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). \"Where allegations of\r\nineffective assistance of counsel are made, the question becomes, 'whether\r\ncounsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\r\nthat the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.'\" Butler v. State,\r\n286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at\r\n686). As such, courts evaluate allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nusing a two-pronged test. Cherry, 300 S.C. at 117, 386 S.E.2d at 625 (citing\r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 668). First, the applicant must demonstrate counsel’s\r\nrepresentation was deficient, which is measured by an objective standard of\r\nreasonableness. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687–88. \"Under this prong, '[t]he proper\r\nmeasure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing\r\nprofessional norms.'\" Cherry, 300 S.C. at 117, 386 S.E.2d at 625 (quoting\r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688). Second, the applicant must demonstrate he was\r\nprejudiced by counsel’s performance in such a manner that, but for counsel’s error,\r\nthere is a reasonable probability the result of the proceedings would have been\r\ndifferent. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. \"A reasonable probability is a probability\r\nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In the context of a guilty plea, the deficiency prong inquiry turns on whether\r\nthe plea was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered. Anderson v. State,\r\n342 S.C. 54, 57, 535 S.E.2d 649, 651 (2000); see also Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\r\n52, 56 (1985) (\"The longstanding test for determining the validity of a guilty plea\r\nis 'whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the\r\nalternative courses of action open to the defendant.'\" (quoting North Carolina v.\r\nAlford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970))). \"The second, or 'prejudice,' requirement . . .\r\nfocuses on whether counsel's constitutionally ineffective performance affected the\r\noutcome of the plea process.\" Hill, 474 U.S. 52 at 59. In other words,\r\n\r\n      A defendant who enters a plea on the advice of counsel may only\r\n      attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea by showing\r\n      that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of\r\n      reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\r\n      counsel's errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty, but would\r\n      have insisted on going to trial.\r\n\nHolden, 393 S.C. at 572, 713 S.E.2d at 615 (quoting Rolen v. State, 384 S.C. 409,\r\n413, 683 S.E.2d 471, 474 (2009)); see also Hill, 474 U.S. at 59 (footnote omitted).\r\n\"There is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and\r\nexercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in\r\nthe case.\" Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007) (citations\r\nomitted).                         LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      I.\t    Counsel's Failure to Advise on Recidivist Consequences of\r\n             Pleading Guilty\r\n\r\n       This petition presents the novel question of whether plea counsel's failure to\r\nadvise Petitioner of CSC 2nd's status as a \"most serious\" offense, which could be\r\nused to enhance his sentence for pending charges under section 17-25-45,\r\nconstitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\n\r\n       Petitioner argues that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Padilla\r\nv. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), forecloses this Court from considering the\r\ndirect/collateral consequences distinction and consequently renders plea counsel's\r\nperformance deficient in this case.7 On the other hand, the State argues that the\r\n\r\n7 In Padilla, the PCR petitioner had lawfully resided in the United States for forty\r\nyears, and faced deportation after he pleaded guilty in Kentucky to transporting a\r\nlarge quantity of marijuana in his truck. Padilla, 130 S. Ct. at 1477. On collateral\r\nattack, the petitioner argued his counsel rendered deficient advice for failing to\r\ninform him of the deportation consequence of pleading guilty to the drug charge,\r\nbut also affirmatively advising him prior to his plea that he \"did not have to worry\"\r\nabout his immigrant status. Id. at 1478. In actuality, upon pleading guilty,\r\ndeportation under the circumstances became \"virtually mandatory.\" Id. The\r\nKentucky Supreme Court denied Petitioner relief, classifying deportation as a\r\ncollateral consequence, and therefore holding the Sixth Amendment did not shield\r\nthe petitioner from his attorney's wrong advice concerning the immigration\r\nconsequences of his conviction. Id. at 1478 & 1481. On appeal, the United States\r\nSupreme Court reversed due to the unique nature of deportation, stating that\r\ndeportation could not be categorized as either a direct or collateral consequence.\r\nId. at 1481–82 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the Supreme Court held that plea\r\ncounsel was defective in failing to affirmatively advise the criminal defendant\r\nwhether his guilty plea carried a risk of deportation. Id. at 1483–84.\r\n\nSupreme Court never meant for Padilla to apply retroactively, but regardless,\r\nPadilla's application is limited to the consequence of deportation.8 In the\r\nalternative, Petitioner argues his plea was still involuntarily entered because of plea\r\ncounsel's failure to inform him of the recidivist consequences of pleading guilty to\r\nCSC 2nd under our State's direct/collateral consequence distinction. On the other\r\nhand, the State argues that the LWOP sentence was not a certainty at the time of\r\nthe Georgetown plea because Petitioner's receipt of an LWOP sentence \"required\r\napplication of legal principles entirely extraneous to the criminal statutes\" in\r\nquestion, and the \"future imposition of an LWOP sentence was entirely contingent\r\nupon events occurring after Petitioner's guilty plea, and upon actions taken by\r\nindividuals other than the plea court.\" Thus, Respondent contends, the recidivist\r\nconsequence was collateral.\r\n\r\n       In our opinion, Petitioner's Padilla claim is a red herring, as Padilla has no\r\napplication to Petitioner's plea, and further, we need not determine whether or not\r\nthe failure to advise of the recidivist consequences of a plea is a direct or collateral\r\nconsequence here because Petitioner cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by\r\ncounsel's mistake, which is fatal to Petitioner's claim. See Roscoe v. State, 345\r\nS.C. 16, 20 n.6, 546 S.E.2d 417, 419 n.6 (2001) (\"Although we have consistently\r\nheld a defendant must have a full understanding of the consequences of his plea\r\nand of the charges against him, . . . the defendant must also demonstrate prejudice\r\nto be entitled to relief on PCR.\" (internal citations omitted)). To satisfy the\r\nprejudice prong, Petitioner must prove, through the presentation of probative and\r\ncredible evidence, that he would have gone to trial instead of pleading guilty but\r\nfor counsel's deficient advice. See Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135, 139, 631 S.E.2d\r\n260, 261–62 (2006).\r\n\r\n      Despite Petitioner's assertions to the contrary, there is probative evidence in\r\nthe Record before us that he would not have chosen to proceed to trial on the\r\nGeorgetown County charges had counsel told him about the strike.\r\n\r\n       The PCR court found that Petitioner lacked credibility, and neither Petitioner\r\nnor the witnesses he called to testify provided specific reasons why knowledge of\r\nthe recidivist statute would have caused Petitioner to change his plea. More\r\nimportantly, the PCR court found that Petitioner expected to be exonerated in the\r\n\r\n\r\n8Incidentally, during the pendency of this Court's consideration of this case, the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court held that Padilla does not apply retroactively.\r\nChaidez v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 1103, 1007 (2013).\r\n\nWilliamsburg case, and therefore, at the time he pleaded guilty in Georgetown\r\nCounty, \"[LWOP] would have been a mere future contingency that he thought\r\nwould never apply to him.\" Moreover, the Solicitor had in fact offered Petitioner a\r\nplea bargain, allowing him to plead guilty to the lesser-included offense of lewd\r\nact, which would not have subjected Petitioner to the LWOP sentence. Plea\r\ncounsel (prior to his discharge) strongly advised Petitioner to accept the plea\r\nbargain and claimed he was confident that Petitioner would receive a sentence\r\nconcurrent to that received in Georgetown County. As stated by the PCR court,\r\n\"[h]ad he agreed to do so, [Petitioner] most likely would not have served any\r\nadditional time in prison, and he absolutely would not currently be serving a[n]\r\n[LWOP] sentence.\" Thus, the PCR court found \"that [Petitioner] . . . proceeded to\r\ntrial in Williamsburg with full awareness that he would receive [an LWOP\r\nsentence] if convicted, and he alone had the opportunity to completely avoid what\r\nmight be considered a harsh result.\" We could not agree more with the PCR\r\ncourt's assessment. In addition to the reasons cited by the PCR judge, we note that\r\ncounsel presented additional evidence at the PCR hearing that the catalyst for\r\nPetitioner's decision to plead guilty to the Georgetown County charges was\r\nlistening to a tape recording in the possession of the Solicitor detailing his\r\ninvolvement in the incidents forming the allegations against him.\r\n\r\n       Thus, under these facts, we hold that counsel was not ineffective for failing\r\nto inform Petitioner of the recidivist consequence of his guilty plea because\r\nPetitioner has not demonstrated he was prejudiced by counsel's deficient\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n      II.    Failure to Investigate\r\n\r\n      Petitioner contends plea counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate the\r\nCSC 2nd charge when Petitioner could show inaccuracies in the victim's claims\r\nconcerning the dates of the alleged crime. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Specifically, Petitioner argues that because his arrest warrant stated the CSC\r\n2nd allegedly occurred \"between the date[s] of June 01, 1999 and July 30, 1999,\"\r\nbut the Indictment provided to him prior to his plea indicated the CSC 2nd\r\noccurred \"on or about August 5, 1999 through August 7, 1999,\" which were also\r\nthe dates provided to the plea judge by the Solicitor during the plea as the potential\r\ndates the CSC 2nd could have occurred, counsel should have investigated these\r\nfactual discrepancies. Petitioner further claimed that the CSC 2nd could not have\r\noccurred between the dates of August 5–7, 1999, and presented evidence in\r\nsupport of this claim at the PCR hearing.\r\n\n       Counsel has a duty to undertake reasonable investigations or to make a\r\ndecision that renders a particular investigation unnecessary. Strickland, 466 U.S.\r\nat 691. Thus, \"[a] criminal defense attorney has the duty to conduct a reasonable\r\ninvestigation to discover all reasonably available mitigation evidence and all\r\nreasonably available evidence tending to rebut any aggravating evidence\r\nintroduced by the State.\" McKnight v. State, 378 S.C. 33, 46, 661 S.E.2d 354, 360\r\n(2008) (citation omitted). In reviewing a claim that defense counsel failed to\r\nproperly investigate a defense to a crime, a court's principle concern is whether the\r\ninvestigation \"was itself reasonable.\" Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 522–23\r\n(2003) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Moreover, counsel's decision not\r\nto investigate should be assessed for reasonableness under all the circumstances\r\nwith heavy deference to counsel's judgment. Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587,\r\n597, 627 S.E.2d 701, 706 (2006).\r\n\r\n       The PCR court found: (1) Petitioner was aware of the date change on his\r\nCSC 2nd indictment prior to entering his plea, and did not advise counsel the new\r\ndates impacted his decision to plead guilty; (2) Petitioner unequivocally admitted\r\nhis guilt at the plea proceeding, which was in \"sharp contrast\" to the allegation that\r\nhe had an alibi; (3) the indictment alleged the incident occurred \"on or about\"\r\nAugust 5–7, and was not limited to those specific days; (4) Petitioner's alibi was\r\nonly for August 5–7, and, therefore, did not cover the entire period; and (5)\r\nPetitioner failed to advise counsel of his contention that the showers at the church\r\nwere not working the summer of the incident, and counsel had no reason to suspect\r\notherwise. Thus, the PCR court concluded that plea counsel's investigation was\r\nreasonable in light of the circumstances.\r\n\r\n       We agree with the State that probative evidence in the Record supports the\r\nPCR court's findings. McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 559, 455 S.E.2d 686, 687–88\r\n(1995) (citation omitted) (this Court must affirm the rulings of the PCR judge if\r\nthere is any evidence to support the decision). Thus, we affirm the PCR court's\r\nfinding that plea counsel conducted a reasonable investigation under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\n                                CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n    For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the PCR court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Cassandra\r\nCrawford and James Warrington (collectively, Petitioners) own properties facing\r\nforeclosure. Prior to these foreclosure actions, Petitioners obtained loan\r\nmodifications from their respective lenders to extend their loans' maturity dates and\r\nreceive additional time to pay. Petitioners failed to make timely payments under\r\nthe modified loan terms, and now seek to prevent foreclosure by arguing that their\r\nlenders engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by modifying the loans\r\nwithout an attorney. We disagree, and hold that modifying a loan without the\r\nparticipation of an attorney does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\n                   FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n                                    I. Crawford\r\n\r\n       Crawford purchased a home in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina in 2005.\r\nShe financed the purchase by obtaining a mortgage from Central Mortgage\r\nCompany (Central). Under the terms of the 2005 loan documents, Crawford\r\nborrowed $290,000 with an adjustable interest rate of 7.875 percent per annum and\r\nagreed to make monthly payments of $1,903.13 for 360 months. A licensed\r\nattorney supervised the closing of the original note and mortgage.\r\n\r\n       Crawford failed to make timely payments on the original mortgage, and\r\nrequested a loan modification from Central. Central approved her request by letter\r\ndated November 7, 2008. Central notified Crawford that the modification would\r\nreduce her interest rate from 7.875 percent per annum to a new fixed rate of 5.875\r\npercent per annum for the remaining life of the loan, and extend the time to repay\r\nthe loan until November 1, 2048. Central also informed Crawford that past-due\r\npayments, escrow shortages, and legal fees/costs would be capitalized, including a\r\n\ndelinquent interest of $5,709.09 and escrow shortage of $718.65, for a total\r\ncapitalization of $6,427.74. Central added this amount to Crawford's current\r\nunpaid balance of $289,985.46, resulting in a new unpaid balance of $296,413.20.\r\n\r\n       Crawford took the notification and modification documents to the law firm\r\nthat had closed her original loan and had the documents witnessed and notarized.1\r\nOn November 17, 2008, an attorney at the law firm mailed the signed modification\r\ndocuments back to Central. Central recorded the loan modification on November\r\n21, 2008, at the Charleston County Register of Deeds.\r\n\r\n       Crawford subsequently requested a second loan modification. On January\r\n21, 2010, Central informed Crawford she was eligible for a second modification.\r\nUnder the second modification agreement, the unpaid principal balance became\r\n$320,875.39, but the maturity date remained November 1, 2048. Central further\r\nreduced the interest rate on the loan from 5.875 percent per annum to 2.25 percent\r\nper annum for the first five years, 3.25 percent per annum for the sixth year, 4.25\r\npercent per annum for the seventh year, and 5 percent per annum for the eighth\r\nthrough thirty-ninth years. The modification resulted in a monthly principal and\r\ninterest payment ranging from $1,034.65 for years 1 through 5, and $1,490.72 for\r\nyears 8 through 39. Crawford signed and executed the agreement in front of a\r\nnotary as required by the loan documents. Under a document entitled \"Attorney\r\nSelection Notice,\" Central informed Crawford that \"[b]y signing below, it is\r\nunderstood and agreed that you may hire a lawyer or attorney to advise you\r\nregarding this transaction and its consequences.\" Crawford signed her\r\nacknowledgement of the notice on January 28, 2010, and returned the agreement to\r\nCentral for recording. Crawford never hired an attorney, and Central admits that\r\nthe loan modification agreement was not prepared by a licensed attorney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Crawford and Central disagree as to whether the firm's attorney actually reviewed\r\nthe loan documents with Crawford. Crawford \"does not recall or believe that the\r\n2008 modification was actually reviewed by an independent attorney,\" while\r\nCentral claims that \"a partner at the firm informed [Central's] counsel that the law\r\nfirm's involvement would have included a review of the documents being signed.\"\r\nCentral has chosen not to pursue this matter as this case concerns the second loan\r\nmodification. Central acknowledges that the second modification, occurring in\r\n2010, was not supervised by an attorney.\r\n\n      On July 14, 2010, Central filed a an action in the circuit court alleging\r\nCrawford defaulted on monthly mortgage payments since April 1, 2010, and\r\nseeking foreclosure of the mortgage. Crawford petitioned this Court for\r\ndeclaratory relief in the Court's original jurisdiction. On March 8, 2012, this Court\r\nissued an order granting Crawford's petition and expediting this matter for oral\r\nargument pursuant to Rule 245, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                  II. Warrington\r\n\r\n       Warrington purchased land on Goat Island in Charleston County and\r\nfinanced it with a commercial loan obtained from The Bank of South Carolina (the\r\nBank). Warrington, a real estate investor, intended to develop the property by\r\nsubdividing it into parcels for resale. Consequently, he obtained a variable rate\r\nloan from the Bank, set at the Bank's prime rate, and with interest-only payments\r\ndue in two years' time. A licensed attorney oversaw the closing of the original note\r\nand mortgage.\r\n\r\n       Warrington could not make payment after the original note matured in\r\nNovember 2008. Warrington requested and received three successive loan\r\nmodifications from the Bank to extend the loan maturity date and provide him\r\nadditional time to pay. The first modification extended the maturity date to March\r\n20, 2009, with interest-only payments required in the interim. Warrington's unpaid\r\nbalance was $474,542.70, and his interest rate rose one-quarter percent to 4.25\r\npercent per annum. The second modification extended the maturity date to\r\nOctober 20, 2009, again with payments to be made on an interest-only basis. The\r\nunpaid balance remained $474,542.70, but at an increased interest rate of 6 percent\r\nper annum. The third modification did not necessitate periodic interest payments\r\nbut extended the maturity date of the loan to March 20, 2010, at which time all\r\nprincipal and interest was due in a single payment. The unpaid balance remained\r\n$474,542.70, but the interest rate increased to 6.5 percent.\r\n\r\n       The Bank prepared each of the three modification agreements using standard\r\nmodification forms containing blanks. The Bank's employees filled in these blanks\r\nwith input from various loan officers. The modification agreements were signed in\r\nthe Bank's office and recorded by the Bank without the participation of a licensed\r\nattorney. The Bank's employee primarily responsible for executing the\r\nmodification agreement testified he did not give any legal advice to Warrington\r\nduring this process.\r\n\n          On March 20, 2010, when the loan matured, Warrington could not pay the\r\n   amount due, and the loan went into default. Approximately nine months later, on\r\n   January 25, 2011, the Bank filed a foreclosure action against Warrington in circuit\r\n   court. On January 26, 2012, Warrington petitioned this Court in its original\r\n   jurisdiction for declaratory relief. On March 8, 2012, this Court granted\r\n   Warrington's petition and stayed further proceedings in the lower court pursuant to\r\n   Rule 245, SCACR.\r\n\r\n          As these two cases, which the Court heard separately, involve the same legal\r\n   issues, they have been consolidated for review. See Rule 214, SCACR (\"Where\r\n   there is more than one appeal from the same order, judgment, decision or decree,\r\n   or where the same question is involved in two or more appeals in different cases,\r\n   the appellate court may, in its discretion, order the appeal to be consolidated.\").\r\n\r\n                                        ISSUES\r\n\r\n I.\t     Whether lenders engage in the unauthorized practice of law by \n\r\n         preparing and mailing loan modification documents to borrowers and \n\r\n         recording the executed documents without the participation of a \n\r\n         licensed attorney. \n\r\n\r\nII.\t     Whether the Court should deem Petitioners' mortgages void if the\r\n         Court finds a loan modification completed without the involvement of\r\n         a licensed attorney constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.2\r\n\r\n\r\n   2 The Bank also raised two additional issues. First, whether the master-in-equity's\r\n   judgment for Bank based on Warrington's discovery abuse is res judicata as to\r\n   Warrington's case, and whether Warrington waived his right for declaratory relief\r\n   by participating in the foreclosure action in the lower court. This Court granted\r\n   Warrington's petition for declaratory relief prior to the filing of the master-in-\r\n   equity's judgment, and therefore no final judgment exist for res judicata to apply.\r\n   Additionally, the Bank's waiver claim is not grounded in proper law or supported\r\n   by appropriate argument, and is thus abandoned. See In the Matter of the Care and\r\n   Treatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (holding an\r\n   issue is deemed abandoned if the argument in the brief is not supported by\r\n   authority or is only conclusory); see also Solomon v. City Realty Co., 262 S.C. 198,\r\n   201, 203 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1974) (deeming a conclusory argument abandoned).\r\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n                         I. Unauthorized Practice of Law\r\n\r\n       Petitioners allege that Central and the Bank (collectively, Respondents)\r\nengaged in the unauthorized practice of law by modifying a loan without the\r\nparticipation of a licensed attorney. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The South Carolina Constitution delegates the duty to regulate the practice\r\nof law in South Carolina to this Court. See S.C. Const. art. V, § 4; In re\r\nUnauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. 304, 305, 422 S.E.2d 123, 124\r\n(1992); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 40-5-10 (2011). \"The generally understood\r\ndefinition of the practice of law 'embraces the preparation of pleadings, and other\r\npapers incident to actions and special proceedings, and the management of such\r\nactions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts.'\" State v.\r\nDespain, 319 S.C. 317, 319, 460 S.E.2d 576, 577 (1995) (quoting In re Duncan, 83\r\nS.C. 186, 189, 65 S.E. 210, 211 (1909)). The practice of law, however, \"is not\r\nconfined to litigation, but extends to activities in other fields which entail\r\nspecialized legal knowledge and ability.\" State v. Buyers Serv. Co., Inc., 292 S.C.\r\n426, 430, 357 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1987). The unauthorized practice of law\r\njurisprudence in South Carolina is driven by the public policy of protecting\r\nconsumers. See In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. at 307, 422\r\nS.E.2d at 123 (\"We hope by this provision to strike a proper balance between the\r\nlegal profession and other professionals which will ensure the public's protection\r\nfrom the harms caused by the unauthorized practice of law.\"). For this reason, this\r\nCourt has consistently refrained from adopting a specific rule to define the practice\r\nof law. Id. at 305, 422 S.E.2d at 124 (stating \"it is neither practicable nor wise\" to\r\nformulate a comprehensive definition of the practice of law). Instead, whether an\r\nactivity constitutes the practice of law remains flexible and turns on the facts of\r\neach case. Id.\r\n\r\n       Previously, in State v. Buyers Service Company, Incorporated, 292 S.C. 426,\r\n357 S.E.2d 15 (1987) and Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 585 S.E.2d 773 (2003),\r\nthis Court addressed the unauthorized practice of law in the context of real estate\r\ntransactions. In Buyers Service, we divided the purchase of residential real estate\r\ninto four steps: (1) title search; (2) preparation of loan documents; (3) closing; and\r\n(4) recording title and mortgage, and held that a licensed attorney must supervise\r\n\neach of these steps.3 Id. at 430–34, 357 S.E.2d at 17–19 (emphasizing protection\r\nof the public as the paramount concern).\r\n\r\n       In Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 312, 585 S.E.2d 773, 776 (2003), the\r\nCourt mandated attorney supervision for the refinancing of mortgages.4 In that\r\ncase, the lender attempted to distinguish Buyers Service by arguing that in\r\nMcMaster the transaction centered on refinancing an existing mortgage rather than\r\ndealing with the purchase of a new property. Id. at 312, 585 S.E.2d at 776. We\r\nheld this essentially a distinction without a difference because refinancing a\r\nmortgage entails the same four steps involved in purchasing a property. Id.\r\nMcMaster, like Buyers Service, emphasized the public policy of advancing\r\nconsumer interests. Id. at 311 n.3, 585 S.E.2d 776 n.3 (citation omitted) (\"[T]his\r\nCourt grounds its unauthorized practice rules in the State's ability to protect\r\nconsumers in the state and not as a method to enhance the business opportunities\r\nfor lawyers.\").\r\n\r\n       Petitioners argue loan modifications \"change the existing terms of the legal\r\nrights of the parties\" by altering interest rates and repayment terms. Petitioners\r\nfurther assert that because the modification agreements have a \"legal effect,\" the\r\nagreements must constitute the unauthorized practice of law. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       This case is distinguishable from both Buyers Service and McMaster. A\r\nloan modification is an adjustment to an existing loan to accommodate borrowers\r\nwho have defaulted. In contrast, refinancing is the issuance of an entirely new\r\nloan, often used by home owners to take advantage of lower interest rates. Thus,\r\nthe same public policy that requires attorney supervision for home purchases and\r\n\r\n3 See also Doe Law Firm v. Richardson, 371 S.C. 14, 18, 636 S.E.2d 866, 868\r\n(2006) (\"Viewed in isolation, it cannot be said that the disbursement of loan\r\nproceeds in and of itself \"entail[s] specialized legal knowledge and ability,\" such\r\nthat it constitutes the practice of law . . . . [H]owever, the disbursement of funds in\r\nthe context of a residential real estate loan closing cannot and should not be\r\nseparated from the process as a whole. Accordingly, we hold that the disbursement\r\nof the funds must be supervised by an attorney.\").\r\n4See also Matrix Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Frazer, 394 S.C. 134, 139, 714 S.E.2d 532,\r\n534–35 (2011) (holding a lender engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by\r\nrefinancing a mortgage without attorney supervision).\r\n\nrefinancing does not apply to loan modifications. Requiring attorney supervision\r\nover a loan modification would create a cost to the consumer outweighed by the\r\nbenefit. Additionally, the existence of a robust regulatory regime and competent\r\nnon-attorney professionals militates against extending the attorney supervision\r\nrequirement to loan modifications.\r\n\r\n       Thus, we hold that lenders do not engage in the unauthorized practice of law\r\nby preparing and mailing loan modifications to borrowers and recording the\r\nexecuted documents without participation of a licensed attorney. Given our\r\nrejection of the allegation that Respondents practiced law without authorization, it\r\nis unnecessary to reach Petitioners' issue as to whether this Court should deem their\r\nmortgages void. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C.\r\n598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we hold that modifying a loan without attorney\r\nsupervision does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENTS.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

We\r\naccept the Agreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state\r\nfor twelve (12) months. In addition, we impose all of the conditions stated above.\r\nThe facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                      Facts\r\n\r\n                                     Matter I\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, Complainant A retained respondent to pursue a divorce and custody\r\nmatter against his wife. Complainant A paid the costs of the action and paid\r\nrespondent $200.00 a month toward the $1,500.00 fee. The fee was fully paid in\r\nearly 2010.\r\n\r\nIn May 2010, respondent filed a Summons and Complaint and served the\r\ndocuments on the wife. Complainant A's name was misspelled on most of the\r\ndocuments filed with the Court. Respondent admits she did not correct the\r\nmisspelling.\r\n\r\nA hearing was scheduled for July 27, 2010, but was delayed so that the wife could\r\nattend. The hearing was then held on July 29, 2010. Respondent prepared a\r\nsettlement agreement at Complainant A's direction. Pursuant to the agreement,\r\nComplainant A was to receive sole custody of his two children. The Agreement\r\nwas initialed and signed by both parties and notarized on July 29, 2010. The\r\nAgreement was filed with the Court on July 30, 2010.\r\n\r\nAn Order and Decree of Divorce, prepared by respondent, was not filed until\r\nNovember 1, 2010. Respondent admits she was not diligent in preparing the order.\r\nIn the order, respondent wrote \"[u]nder the terms of the Agreement, Plaintiff and\r\nDefendant will share joint custody of the children…\" This was contrary to the\r\nAgreement itself which clearly stated Complainant A was to receive sole custody\r\nof the children. Respondent represents she has now corrected the order to reflect\r\nthat Complainant A has custody of the children with reasonable visitation by the\r\nchildren's mother.\r\n\r\nIn early 2011, Complainant A attempted to obtain a hard copy of the Order and\r\nDecree of Divorce from respondent. Respondent did not return Complainant A's\r\ncalls and never mailed a hard copy of the Order to Complainant A. Respondent\r\nadmits she did not respond to Complainant A's calls and did not send him a hard\r\ncopy of the Order even though he had requested the Order on several occasions.\r\nRespondent represents she had previously emailed Complainant A a copy of the\r\nfinal Order.\r\n\n                                     Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained in July 2008 to represent Complainant B in a domestic\r\nmatter. Respondent failed to keep Complainant B reasonably informed about the\r\nstatus of his case and failed to promptly comply with the client's request for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nOn September 26, 2011, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation\r\nrequesting a response to the complaint within fifteen (15) days. When no response\r\nwas received, respondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of\r\nTreacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), again requesting a response.\r\nRespondent did not respond to the Treacy letter or to the Notice of Investigation.\r\nRespondent did make an appearance before Disciplinary Counsel and answered\r\nquestions on the record and under oath.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter III\r\n\r\nIn August 2010, Complainant C retained respondent for a domestic matter.\r\nRespondent failed to keep Complainant C reasonably informed about the status of\r\nhis case and failed to promptly comply with the client's requests for information.\r\nRespondent failed to respond to Complainant C's emails, certified mail, and\r\nnumerous telephone calls for several weeks at a time.\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to inform Complainant C of a scheduled pre-trial conference in\r\nOctober 2011. Complainant C learned of the pre-trial conference from the\r\nopposing party in the domestic action.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, 2011, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen days. When no response was received,\r\nrespondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id., again\r\nrequesting a response. Respondent did not respond to the Treacy letter or to the\r\nNotice of Investigation. Respondent did make an appearance before Disciplinary\r\nCounsel and answered questions on the record and under oath.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter IV\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, respondent was retained to represent Complainant D in a domestic\r\nmatter. Respondent failed to notify the Court or opposing counsel of her\r\nrepresentation and failed to file an answer to the Summons and Complaint. As a\r\nresult Complainant D was served with a \"Request for and Notice of Default\r\n\nHearing and Final Hearing.\" Complainant D retained new counsel and requested a\r\nrefund of unearned fees from respondent. Respondent failed to return the unearned\r\nfees to Complainant D.\r\n\r\nOn January 9, 2012, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen days. When no response was received,\r\nrespondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id., again\r\nrequesting a response. Respondent did not respond to the Treacy letter or to the\r\nNotice of Investigation.             Matter V\r\n\r\nIn October 2011, respondent was retained to represent Complainant E in a\r\ndomestic matter. Respondent failed to keep Complainant E reasonably informed\r\nabout the status of her case and failed to promptly comply with Complainant E's\r\nrequests for information. Respondent represents that the matter has now been\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 2012, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting\r\na response to the complaint within fifteen days. When no response was received,\r\nrespondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id., again\r\nrequesting a response. Respondent did not respond to the Treacy letter or to the\r\nNotice of Investigation.             Matter VI\r\n\r\nComplainant F retained respondent to represent her in a custody action.\r\nRespondent failed to keep Complainant F reasonably informed about the status of\r\nher case and failed to promptly comply with Complainant F's requests for\r\ninformation. Respondent failed to respond to Complainant F's emails and\r\nnumerous telephone calls.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2012, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen days. Respondent's response was received\r\non June 27, 2012, approximately ninety-eight (98) days past the due date for the\r\nresponse. Respondent represents Complainant F is now being represented by new\r\ncounsel.\r\n\n                                    Matter VII\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained in August 2010 to represent Complainant G in a domestic\r\nmatter. Respondent failed to keep Complainant G reasonably informed about the\r\nstatus of her case and failed to promptly comply with Complainant G's requests for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 2012, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen days. When no response was received,\r\nrespondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id., again\r\nrequesting a response. After retaining counsel, respondent's response was received\r\nby Disciplinary Counsel on July 2, 2012, approximately forty-six (46) days past\r\nthe due date for the response.     Matter VIII\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, Complainant H retained respondent for representation in a\r\ndomestic action. Respondent was paid $3,000 for the representation. Respondent\r\nfailed to keep Complainant H reasonably informed about the status of her case and\r\nfailed to promptly comply with the client's requests for information. Respondent\r\nfailed to respond to her client's telephone calls, text messages, voicemails, and\r\nemails. Respondent also failed to diligently represent Complainant H in the\r\ndomestic action. Complainant H terminated respondent's service by letter dated\r\nApril 16, 2012, and requested a refund of $2,000 in unearned fees. Respondent\r\nrefunded the requested amount and provided a letter of apology on or about July 1,\r\n2012.                               Matter IX\r\n\r\nRespondent ordered deposition transcripts from a court reporting agency on\r\nAugust 30, 2011. Respondent failed to timely pay for the transcripts in spite of\r\nnumerous re-billings and letters over a one year period. The amount billed for the\r\ntranscripts was $ 61.75.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 2012, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting\r\na response within fifteen days. When no response was received, Disciplinary\r\nCounsel attempted to serve respondent with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of\r\nTreacy, id. The Treacy letter was returned to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\nmarked \"unclaimed\" by the United States Postal Service.\r\n\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by her conduct she has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall\r\nprovide competent representation); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by client's\r\ndecisions concerning the objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer\r\nshall keep client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly\r\ncomply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15(d) (lawyer shall\r\nsafekeep client funds and promptly remit to third party funds to which party is\r\nentitled); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to\r\nthe extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as refunding\r\nany advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred); Rule\r\n3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the\r\ninterests of the client); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a\r\nlawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and\r\nRule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\nprejudicial to administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits she has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a) (1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe hereby accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend\r\nrespondent from the practice of law in this state for twelve (12) months.1 Within\r\nthirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred\r\nin the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission\r\nand, within six (6) months of the date of this opinion, respondent shall complete\r\nthe Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and provide proof of\r\ncompletion of the program to the Commission.

Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Section 15-79-125 of the South Carolina Code\r\nrequires a pre-suit mediation process for medical malpractice claims. The statute\r\nfurther requires that the pre-suit mediation conference be completed within a 120-\r\nday period, which may be extended for an additional 60-day period. This appeal\r\npresents the question of whether the failure to complete the mediation conference\r\nin a timely manner divests the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and requires\r\ndismissal. We hold that the failure to complete the mediation conference in a\r\ntimely manner does not divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and\r\ndismissal is not mandated. We reverse the contrary decision of the trial court and\r\nremand for the pre-suit mediation process to be completed.\r\n\r\n                                               I.\r\n\r\n                                           A.\r\n\r\n              Section 15-79-125 and the pre-suit mediation conference\r\n\r\nAs part of the Tort Reform Act of 2005 Relating to Medical Malpractice,1 the\r\nLegislature enacted section 15-79-125 of the South Carolina Code, which requires\r\na medical malpractice plaintiff to file and serve a Notice of Intent to File Suit\r\n(Notice of Intent) before the plaintiff may initiate a civil action. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n15-79-125(A) (Supp. 2012). The Notice of Intent must contain a statement of the\r\nfacts upon which the plaintiff's claim is based, be accompanied by an affidavit of\r\nan expert witness identifying at least one negligent act or omission claimed to\r\nexist, and include the standard interrogatories required by the South Carolina Rules\r\nof Civil Procedure (SCRCP). Id. Filing the Notice of Intent tolls the statute of\r\nlimitations. Id. at § 15-79-125(C).\r\n\r\nFollowing service of the Notice of Intent, the parties are required to participate in a\r\nmediation conference. Specifically, subsection (C) provides:\r\n\r\n         Within ninety days and no later than one hundred twenty days from\r\n         the service of the Notice of Intent to File Suit, the parties shall\r\n         participate in a mediation conference unless an extension for no more\r\n         than sixty days is granted by the court based upon a finding of good\r\n         cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n1   2005 Act No. 32, § 5, eff. July 1, 2005.\r\n\nId. § 15-79-125(C) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSubsection (C) is silent as to the consequences of failing to timely comply with the\r\nmediation conference. Subsection (C) does, however, provide that the South\r\nCarolina Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules (SCADRR or alternative dispute\r\nresolution rules) govern the mediation process, unless the alternative dispute\r\nresolution rules are inconsistent with the statute. Id. § 15-79-125(C). Regarding\r\nenforcement, subsection (D) explicitly recognizes the circuit court's authority to\r\nensure parties comply with the statutory pre-suit mediation requirements. Id. §15-\r\n79-125(D). Only if the matter cannot be resolved through mediation may a\r\nplaintiff thereafter initiate a civil action by filing a summons and complaint. Id.\r\n§15-79-125(E).                             B.\r\n\r\n       Appellant's allegations of medical malpractice and section 15-79-125\r\n\r\nOn two separate occasions Appellant John Thomas Ross reported to Waccamaw\r\nCommunity Hospital2 with severe abdominal pain and was seen by Respondents,\r\nDr. Webster N. Jones and Dr. David R. Anderson. It is alleged that Appellant had\r\na bowel obstruction. Although a CT scan was performed each visit, neither Dr.\r\nJones nor Dr. Anderson recommended that Appellant undergo a follow-up\r\ncolonoscopy, and each time Appellant's colon condition was allegedly\r\nmisdiagnosed. Appellant believed Respondents' failure to recommend a\r\ncolonoscopy and properly diagnose his bowel obstruction amounted to professional\r\nnegligence. Appellant served a Notice of Intent upon Respondents on November\r\n25, 2008. Therefore, the section 15-79-125 mediation time period of 120 days\r\nexpired on March 25, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe parties initially scheduled mediation for March 12, 2009. Due to a subsequent\r\nscheduling conflict, however, Appellant's counsel requested that mediation be\r\npostponed one week until March 18, 2009—which was within the 120-day period.\r\nHowever, Appellant's counsel was thereafter required to appear for trial of another\r\ncase on March 18, 2009, and the mediation conference was rescheduled once\r\nagain, this time for May 20, 2009—outside the 120-day time period.3 The\r\n\r\n2   Waccamaw Community Hospital is not a party to this appeal.\r\n3   Although this date was outside the 120-day period, it was within the sixty-day\r\n\nmediation conference was rescheduled for May 20 with the consent of all involved.\r\nNone of the parties sought an extension from the circuit court to enlarge the\r\nstatutory time period, and all parties proceeded as though the mediation would\r\noccur, even after the 120-day deadline lapsed.4\r\n\r\nNevertheless, six days before mediation was scheduled to take place, Respondents\r\nrefused to participate, claiming the mediation conference was untimely under\r\nsection 15-79-125(C) because Appellant failed to seek a sixty-day extension from\r\nthe circuit court. Specifically, Respondents contended section 15-79-125 is a\r\njurisdictional statute and that, absent a sixty-day extension granted for good cause,\r\na Notice of Intent automatically expires if mediation is not conducted within 120\r\ndays of its filing, and the circuit court no longer has jurisdiction to entertain the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWishing to proceed with the rescheduled conference, Appellant filed a motion to\r\ncompel the mediation. Appellant contended that nothing in section 15-79-125\r\ndeprived the circuit court of jurisdiction if the mediation conference fails to take\r\nplace within 120 days and that such a reading of the statute would be contrary to\r\nthe Legislature's intent. Appellant further pointed to subsection (D), which\r\nspecifically recognizes the circuit court's jurisdiction to enforce the mandatory\r\nmediation requirement.5 Moreover, and also with regard to legislative intent,\r\nAppellant cited to the SCADRR, which grant the court wide latitude in enforcing\r\nalternative dispute resolution requirements.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Respondents moved to dismiss Appellant's Notice of Intent pursuant to\r\nRule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, reiterating their argument that section 15-79-125 prohibits\r\nmediation beyond the 120-day deadline and the parties' failure to mediate within\r\nthe 120-day deadline deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction to enforce the\r\nprovisions of that statute. Respondents concluded that the trial court was required\r\nto dismiss the Notice of Intent. The trial court accepted Respondents' argument in\r\nits entirety, granting Respondents' motion to dismiss and denying Appellant's\r\n\r\nextension period available under 15-79-125(C).\n\r\n4 For example, defense counsel pursued a subpoena for Appellant's medical records \n\r\nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs on April 16, 2009—three weeks past the \n\r\n120-day deadline. \n\r\n5Section 15-79-125(D) states \"[t]he circuit court has jurisdiction to enforce the \n\r\nprovisions of this section.\" \n\r\n\nmotion to compel the scheduled mediation. In addition, the trial court dismissed\r\nnot only the Notice of Intent, but also purported to dismiss the underlying medical\r\nmalpractice action, which had not yet been filed. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\n                                      Analysis\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred by granting Respondents' motions to\r\ndismiss. We agree and hold that the circuit court retained jurisdiction after the\r\nexpiration of the 120-day mediation period. We further hold that under the facts\r\npresented and the motions before the circuit court, the court should have granted\r\nAppellant's motion to compel mediation.\r\n\r\n\"'Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which we are free to\r\ndecide without any deference to the court below.'\" Grier v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc.,\r\n397 S.C. 532, 535, 725 S.E.2d 693, 695 (2012) (quoting CFRE, LLC v. Greenville\r\nCnty.

Town of James Island, 393 S.C. 176, 192,\r\n712 S.E.2d 416, 425 (2011)).\r\n\r\nFurther, \"statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed.\"\r\nId. at 536, 725 S.E.2d at 696 (citing Epstein v. Coastal Timber Co., 393 S.C. 276,\r\n285, 711 S.E.2d 912, 917 (2011)). \"Under this rule, a statute restricting the\r\ncommon law will 'not be extended beyond the clear intent of the legislature.'\" Id.\r\n(quoting Crosby v. Glasscock Trucking Co., 340 S.C. 626, 628, 532 S.E.2d 856,\r\n857 (2000)). \"Statutes subject to this rule include those which 'limit a claimant's\r\nright to bring suit.'\" Id. (quoting 82 C.J.S. Statutes § 535).\r\n\r\nAlthough section 15-79-125(C) provides that the mediation conference should\r\noccur within 120 days, the statute is silent as to the consequences of the parties'\r\nfailure to do so within the prescribed timeframe. Significantly, the General\r\nAssembly expressly identified the SCADRR as the governing procedural rules,\r\n\nwhich favor pretrial dispute resolution in lieu of litigation. See, e.g., Rule 1,\r\nSCADRR (\"These rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, inexpensive\r\nand collaborative resolution in every action to which they apply.\"). It is clear that\r\nthe Legislature enacted section 15-79-125 to provide an informal and expedient\r\nmethod of culling prospective medical malpractice cases by fostering the\r\nsettlement of potentially meritorious claims and discouraging the filing of frivolous\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nTo accept the view advanced by Respondents would lead to an absurd statutory\r\nconstruction. Specifically, Respondents would have this Court construe section\r\n15-79-125 as a trap for plaintiffs with potentially meritorious claims. Given the\r\npressures of practicing law for even the moderately busy practitioner, completion\r\nof the mediation conference in a timely manner will not always be achievable.\r\nRespondents' interpretation is ripe for mischief, as defendants could easily thwart\r\ntimely completion of the mediation conference, and then seek dismissal of the\r\nNotice of Intent and reinstatement of the statute of limitations. A mandated\r\npenalty of dismissal, as urged by Respondents, for lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction is fundamentally at odds with the language and purpose of section 15-\r\n79-125.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the time period set forth in section 15-79-125 was not intended to\r\nplace limitations on the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction. Indeed, the plain\r\nlanguage of subsection (D) refutes such an interpretation, as it unambiguously\r\nacknowledges the circuit court's jurisdiction to enforce that section's provisions\r\nwithout limitation. Thus, we hold that failing to comply with the 120-day statutory\r\ntime period is a non-jurisdictional procedural defect. C.f. Skinner v. Westinghouse\r\nElec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 93-94, 668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008) (noting that the\r\nfailure to comply with procedural time limits does not affect the circuit court's\r\npower to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\nquestion belong). We further find that the circuit court retains discretion to permit\r\nthe mediation process to continue beyond the 120-day time period and may\r\nconsider principles of estoppel and waiver to excuse noncompliance. See Mende v.\r\nConway Hosp., Inc., 304 S.C. 313, 315, 404 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1991) (finding where\r\nboth parties agreed to delay trial temporarily and resume proceedings at a later\r\ndate, the circumstances involved and the defendant's conduct indicated the\r\ndefendant waived any objection based on the expiration of the statute of\r\nlimitations).\r\n\r\nThis is not to say the 120-day time period is meaningless. Indeed, it demonstrates\r\n\nthe Legislature's desire that pre-suit mediation takes place expeditiously. And the\r\nfailure to comply with the 120-day time period could result in dismissal (as the\r\nSCADRR provide), but as a function of the court's discretion based on the facts\r\nand circumstances, and not as a mandated one-size-fits-all result.6\r\n\r\nTo claim that the statutory time period is a jurisdictional issue is something\r\naltogether different, for the Legislature would have used more exacting language\r\nhad it intended the expiration of the stated time period to forever divest the circuit\r\ncourt of jurisdiction. We find persuasive the opinion of the Supreme Court of\r\nWisconsin, which addressed this very issue.\r\n\r\nWhen presented with a similar situation involving the failure to conduct a pre-suit\r\nmediation session within a 90-day statutory time period in a medical malpractice\r\ndispute, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rejected the very argument advanced by\r\nRespondents. Schulz v. Nienhuis, 448 N.W.2d 655 (Wis. 1989). In Schulz, as in\r\nthis case, mediation was rescheduled at the request of plaintiff's counsel twice due\r\nto scheduling conflicts. Id. at 656-57. Subsequently, plaintiff's counsel requested\r\nthat the mediation be rescheduled, but defendants refused to participate, arguing\r\nthat if no mediation session is held within the statutory period, a claimant loses the\r\nright to proceed to trial. Id. at 657.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that argument, reasoning:\r\n\r\n       If the legislature intended the result the defendants urge, it could have\r\n       expressly stated that a claimant's failure to participate in a mediation\r\n       session within the statutory mediation period results in dismissal. It\r\n       did not do so. In the absence of express language, we are unwilling to\r\n       read the harsh penalty of dismissal of the lawsuit into the mediation\r\n       statute. The tenor of modern law is to avoid dismissal of cases on\r\n\r\n6   Rule 10(b), SCADRR, provides:\r\n\r\n       If any person or entity subject to the ADR Rules violates any\r\n       provision of the ADR Rules without good cause, the court may, on its\r\n       own motion or motion by any party, impose upon that party, person or\r\n       entity, any lawful sanctions, including, but not limited to, the payment\r\n       of attorney's fees, neutral's fees, and expenses incurred by persons\r\n       attending the conference; contempt; and any other sanction authorized\r\n       by Rule 37(b), SCRCP.\r\n\n      technical grounds and to allow adjudication on the merits.\r\n\r\n      Moreover, strong practical reasons militate against reading the\r\n      mediation statute as requiring dismissal of the lawsuit if a claimant\r\n      does not participate in a mediation session within the statutory\r\n      mediation period. A multitude of events could cause a mediation\r\n      session to be delayed beyond the statutory period: illness or weather;\r\n      fixing a date convenient for all parties; the need to appoint different\r\n      mediators. The defendants' interpretation of [the mediation statute]\r\n      would mean that a claimant, regardless of fault, would lose all legal\r\n      redress because the mediation session did not occur within the 90-day\r\n      period. This interpretation contradicts the legislature's expressed\r\n      intent of providing an informal, inexpensive, and expedient mediation\r\n      system.\r\n\r\nSchulz, 448 N.W.2d at 658-59 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Wisconsin\r\nSupreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the action and remanded the\r\nmatter for further proceedings. Id. at 659.\r\n\r\nWe find the reasoning of the Schulz court is consistent with this Court's decision in\r\nGrier v. AMISUB of S.C., in which we declined to \"judicially engraft extra\r\nrequirements to [section 15-79-125]\" that were not plainly included \"under the\r\nguise of judicial interpretation.\" 397 S.C at 540, 725 S.E.2d at 698. Although, the\r\n\"additional requirements\" urged in Grier were claimed to further legislative intent,\r\nthe same cannot be said here. Indeed, construing section 15-79-125 to require\r\ndismissal if the 120-day mediation period is not met would undermine the\r\nLegislature's manifest intent and South Carolina's strong public policy favoring\r\nalternative dispute resolution. As noted, given the legislatively designed\r\ninterrelationship between section 15-79-125 and the SCADRR, we find that\r\njudicially engrafting a dismissal mandate into section 15-79-125 would lead to an\r\nabsurd result not intended by the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         III.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the decision of the trial court was controlled by an error of law, for nothing\r\nin section 15-79-125 deprives the circuit court of jurisdiction or mandates\r\ndismissal if the parties fail to mediate within the 120-day time period. Rather, the\r\ntrial court retains jurisdiction to permit the mediation process to continue beyond\r\n\nthe 120-day time period, and situations of noncompliance are to be resolved\r\nthrough application of the relevant provisions of the SCADRR. In this case, there\r\nis no basis justifying dismissal. Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting\r\nRespondents' motions to dismiss and in failing to compel mediation. We reverse\r\nand remand the matter to the circuit court for the pre-suit mediation process to be\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27277","title":"Ripley v.

Code Ann. §§ 33-44-101–1208 (2006).\r\n\nEmerald Investments, LLC formed Ashley River Properties II, LLC (Ashley River\r\nII) for the purpose of developing a parcel of property. Emerald made in-kind\r\ncontributions for its share in Ashley River II, and Kriti contributed $1.25 million.\r\nImmediately, Emerald and its sole member, Stuart Longman (collectively,\r\nRespondents), diverted and misappropriated those funds. Upon learning of\r\nEmerald and Longman's wrongdoing, Kriti and Ashley River II (collectively,\r\nAppellants) procured a judgment against Emerald and Longman, and Emerald was\r\nstripped of its voting rights in and management of Ashley River II. Since that\r\ntime, Emerald and Longman have refused to pay any amount towards the judgment\r\nand instead have engaged in a pattern of abusive litigation. Attempting to collect\r\non the judgment, Kriti and Ashley River II obtained a charging order against\r\nEmerald's interest and later moved to foreclose on that interest. The circuit court\r\ndenied the motion for foreclosure, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\n       We hold the circuit court committed several errors of law in denying the\r\nmotion to foreclose. Generally, we find the court improperly considered\r\nunavailable remedies as weighing against foreclosure and incorrectly characterized\r\nthe seriousness of foreclosure. Furthermore, the court failed to consider the\r\nrelevant factor of the likelihood of satisfaction of the judgment through\r\ndistributions. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for foreclosure on and the sale\r\nof Emerald's interest in Ashley River II.\r\n\r\n                  FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      Emerald, a Connecticut LLC managed by Longman, undertook to develop\r\ncondominiums and a marina on a piece of property in Charleston. The project\r\nexperienced financial difficulties in 2003, and Emerald turned to Kriti as an outside\r\ninvestor. Kriti is a Delaware LLC of which Davidson Williams is the managing\r\nmember. Emerald and Kriti entered into an operating agreement under which\r\nEmerald became a 70% member and Kriti became a 30% member in Ashley River\r\nII. Kriti contributed $1.25 million in capital for its interest, and Emerald\r\ncontributed the property and permits, together valued at $2.5 million.\r\n\r\n      The operating agreement states that any dispute arising thereunder is subject\r\nto arbitration pursuant to the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act.2 It also\r\nprovides that any dispute must be submitted to arbitration in New York and that\r\nthe courts of the state of New York have \"sole and exclusive jurisdiction.\" The\r\nagreement prohibits the commingling of Ashley River II's funds with other funds\r\nand provides that the LLC cannot make any expenditure outside the approved\r\n\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-48-10–240 (2005 & Supp. 2012).\r\n\nbudget attached to the agreement or future budgets approved by the members.\r\nEmerald can default under the agreement by taking specified actions, and the\r\nremedies Kriti may elect to exercise when Emerald defaults are the forfeiture of\r\nEmerald's voting rights, the termination of the project development agreement, and\r\nthe purchase of Emerald's membership interest for the price of its unreturned\r\ncapital contribution. Dissolution is provided only upon the occurrence of one of\r\nseveral specified events. Finally, the agreement provides that distributions are to\r\nbe made by a vote of the members and prohibits distributions if they would cause\r\nthe LLC to not be able to pay its debts or cause its debts to be greater than its\r\nassets.Immediately upon formation of the LLC, Emerald and Longman diverted\r\nKriti's capital contribution to Longman and other entities controlled by Longman,\r\ncaused Ashley River II to make payments not on approved budgets, and\r\ncommingled the contribution with other funds unrelated to Ashley River II. One of\r\nthe wrongful diversions caused Ashley River II to incur an $84,000 penalty due to\r\na delay in paying a vendor. Additionally, Emerald and Longman failed to disclose\r\nto Kriti contracts for the purchase of condominium units and marina slips and the\r\nbankruptcy of an entity owned by Longman that was involved in the development.\r\n\r\n       Emerald continued to manage Ashley River II until January 14, 2005, when\r\nKriti, having discovered Emerald and Longman's wrongful conduct, terminated the\r\ndevelopment agreement and alleged default under the operating agreement. At that\r\npoint, Kriti took control of Ashley River II. On March 23, 2005, Kriti and Ashley\r\nRiver II brought an arbitration action in New York (the 2005 Arbitration). They\r\ncontended Emerald defaulted under the operating agreement and sought damages,\r\nforfeiture of Emerald's voting rights, forfeiture of Emerald's interest in the LLC,\r\nand alternatively, an order permitting Kriti to buy Emerald's interest for its\r\noutstanding capital contributions.\r\n\r\n       Around the same time, Kriti issued a capital call and informed Emerald that\r\nto satisfy the capital call, Emerald would first have to pay Ashley River II the\r\nfunds at issue in the 2005 Arbitration. Emerald refused to provide the requested\r\ncapital, and Kriti purportedly reduced Emerald's membership interest to 21.3%\r\naccording to a formula provided in the operating agreement.\r\n\r\n       Emerald then counterclaimed in the 2005 Arbitration seeking dissolution of\r\nAshley River II on the grounds Kriti engaged in oppressive conduct towards\r\nEmerald, including an improper capital call, frustration of a loan extension,\r\nencouragement of litigation against Ashley River II, and improperly refusing an\r\noffer to purchase the subject property.\r\n\n       On October 31, 2005, the New York arbitration panel issued an award\r\nfinding Emerald wrongfully diverted, commingled, and mishandled Ashley River\r\nII's funds and failed to disclose material information. As a result, the panel found\r\nEmerald had forfeited all voting rights in Ashley River II, the development\r\nagreement was validly terminated, Kriti and Ashley River II were entitled to an\r\naward of $706,225 consisting of indemnification, legal fees, and arbitrator fees,3\r\nand Kriti had the option to purchase Emerald's interest in Ashley River II by\r\npaying Emerald $2.5 million—the amount of its unreturned capital contributions—\r\nwithin 120 days of the award.4 The panel concluded that forfeiture of Emerald's\r\nmembership interest in Ashley River II was not an available remedy because\r\nEmerald had probable cause to challenge the capital call.5 However, the arbitrators\r\ndid not make any factual findings as to the propriety of the capital call, instead\r\nlimiting their findings to the probable cause of challenging the capital call. Finally,\r\nthe panel denied Emerald's counterclaim for dissolution.\r\n\r\n       Emerald and Longman filed suit in the Charleston County Court of Common\r\nPleas seeking to set aside the 2005 Arbitration award and dissolve Ashley River II\r\n(the 2005 Dissolution Suit).6 As the basis for their claims, the plaintiffs asserted\r\nKriti engaged in the oppressive conduct of making the 2005 capital call,\r\nobstructing a loan closing, encouraging litigation against Ashley River II, and\r\ndeclining an offer to purchase the subject property. Kriti and Ashley River II\r\nmoved to dismiss, and the motion was granted in part and denied in part. The\r\nclaims to vacate or modify the arbitration award were dismissed on the ground the\r\ncourt lacked jurisdiction because those claims must be brought in New York. The\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Specifically, the panel found Kriti and Ashley River II were entitled to $400,000\r\nin indemnification from Emerald and Longman for claims made against Ashley\r\nRiver II by third-party vendors, $251,000 for legal fees and disbursements, and\r\n$55,225 for administrative and arbitrator fees.\r\n4 Kriti later attempted to exercise the option to purchase Emerald's interest but was\r\nrebuffed, litigation ensued in New York, and the attempt to purchase ultimately\r\nfailed.\r\n5 The operating agreement provides that \"In the event that [Emerald] shall contest\r\nany of the foregoing remedies and shall not prevail, then the Emerald Member\r\nshall forfeit all of its Membership Shares in the Company, and the Membership\r\nShares in the Company shall be reallocated between or among the remaining\r\nMembers on a pro-rata basis . . . .\"\r\n6 A third plaintiff was Ashley River Properties I, LLC, an entity controlled by\r\nLongman that was involved in the development.\r\n\ncourt also dismissed the claim for judicial dissolution, finding that issue had\r\nalready been decided in the 2005 Arbitration.7\r\n\r\n       Kriti and Ashley River II filed suit in New York (the 2006 Confirmation\r\nSuit) for confirmation of the 2005 Arbitration award and an order directing\r\nEmerald to transfer its membership interest in Ashley River II to Kriti pursuant to\r\nits buyout option under the 2005 Arbitration award. Two days later, Emerald filed\r\nsuit against Kriti in New York requesting a declaration that Kriti failed to make a\r\nproper tender for Emerald's interest in Ashley River II, that Kriti's right to make a\r\ntender for Emerald's interest had lapsed, and that Emerald continued to hold a 70%\r\ninterest in Ashley River II (the 2006 Declaratory Judgment Suit).\r\n\r\n       In the 2006 Confirmation Suit, the New York court issued an order\r\nconfirming the arbitration award. The court also denied without prejudice Kriti's\r\nrequest to compel Emerald to transfer its membership interest. On April 29, 2008,\r\nKriti and Ashley River II registered the judgment in the Charleston County Court\r\nof Common Pleas. They then brought the instant action for a lien based on that\r\njudgment (the Lien Suit). On October 17, 2008, Kriti and Ashley River II\r\nperfected a lien on Emerald's distributional interest in Ashley River II through a\r\ncharging order.\r\n\r\n        On January 30, 2009, Emerald filed suit in the Charleston County Court of\r\nCommon Pleas for a determination of its interest in and the dissolution of Ashley\r\nRiver II (the 2009 Dissolution Suit). Specifically, Emerald sought a declaration\r\nthat it still owned 70% of Ashley River II and dissolution on the ground Kriti had\r\nengaged in oppressive conduct. Emerald subsequently filed a demand for\r\narbitration in New York (the 2010 Arbitration), seeking a declaration that Emerald\r\nowned 70% of Ashley River II and that Kriti breached the operating agreement,\r\nbreached its fiduciary duty, and engaged in waste. As a remedy, Emerald sought\r\nthe expulsion of Kriti from Ashley River II and damages, or alternatively, the\r\nreinstatement of Emerald's voting rights. As a result and by consent order, the\r\n2009 Dissolution Suit was stayed pending resolution of the arbitration.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 The sole remaining claim was Ashley River I's claim for a declaration of its rights\r\nunder the operating agreement.\r\n8 The consent order also dismissed with prejudice the claim for a declaratory\r\njudgment as to Emerald's interest based on the parties' agreement to arbitrate that\r\nclaim. Additionally, the consent order provided that the resulting award in the\r\n2010 Arbitration would be admissible and binding in the 2009 Dissolution Suit.\r\n\n       A New York arbitration panel issued an award in the 2010 Arbitration\r\nfinding Emerald had a 70% interest in Ashley River II because \"the capital call was\r\ndefective on its face\" in \"imposing conditions on the application of Emerald's\r\ncapital contribution which were contrary to the terms of the operating agreement\"\r\nand, thus, the capital call was \"ineffective to trigger a dilution of Emerald's\r\nmembership interests.\" However, the panel did not find that the capital call was\r\nunnecessary or made with an intent to dilute Emerald's interest. Other than finding\r\nthe capital call defective, the panel rejected all of Emerald's claims. It found there\r\nwas no basis to dissociate or dissolve Ashley River II under the operating\r\nagreement, Kriti had neither violated the operating agreement nor engaged in\r\ncorporate waste, and all of Kriti's actions were within its business judgment. It\r\nnoted that Emerald's claims and evidence were \"at best, the observations of Stuart\r\nLongman who believed that he could develop the property better.\"\r\n\r\n       On February 1, 2011, Kriti and Ashley River II filed the motion at issue\r\nhere, seeking to foreclose on Emerald's interest in Ashley River II. Attached in\r\nsupport of the motion were Williams' affidavit and as exhibits thereto, the financial\r\nstatements for Ashley River II for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Shortly thereafter, a\r\nsecond affidavit by Williams was filed with exhibits consisting of the 2010\r\nArbitration award, a letter from Kriti's counsel to Emerald's counsel offering to\r\nconfirm the 2010 Arbitration award by consent, a judgment entered by a New York\r\ncourt against Longman on July 10, 1996, and a complaint filed in a Connecticut\r\ncourt against Longman on September 30, 2010.\r\n\r\n       Williams' first affidavit recounted the procedural history of the case and\r\nstated that Kriti and Ashley River II had not recovered anything on their judgment\r\nand that it was unlikely Ashley River II would make distributions in the\r\nforeseeable future. The financial statements attached showed that from 2008 to\r\n2010, the members' equity decreased each year—from $1,777,586 in 2008 to\r\n$1,219,570 in 2009 and to $1,061,470 in 2010. Additionally, each year the\r\ncompany suffered a loss—$899,498 in 2008, $588,016 in 2009, and $157,432 in\r\n2010. Ashley River II has remained a going concern primarily because of loans\r\nKriti and its affiliated entities have made to the company.\r\n\r\n      In his second affidavit, Williams recounted the 2010 Arbitration award and\r\ninformed the court of an outstanding judgment against Longman in New York, an\r\nattempt by the judgment creditor to collect on that judgment in Connecticut, and\r\nthree other suits pending against Emerald or Longman in Connecticut. The\r\nappended judgment from New York was entered against Longman personally in\r\n1996 for $1,261,546.88 in actual damages and interest and $2,702,500 in punitive\r\ndamages for fraud in a real estate transaction. Longman had secretly obtained a\r\n\nmortgage in the name of a corporation, concealed the mortgage from the other\r\nshareholder, and used the mortgage proceeds for his own purposes. The 2010\r\njudgment creditor filed suit against Longman, Emerald, and other entities\r\nassociated with Longman in Connecticut seeking to recover on the 2010 judgment.\r\nAs of the filing of the Connecticut complaint, the judgment creditor had yet to\r\ncollect any amount towards the judgment, now totaling $9,017,392.30.\r\n\r\n       In response to the motion to foreclose, Longman filed his own affidavit with\r\nexhibits including Ashley River II's operating agreement, the project development\r\nagreement, the 2005 Arbitration award, the 2010 Arbitration award, an appraisal of\r\nthe underlying property, three offers to purchase the property, and a promissory\r\nnote executed by Ashley River II in 2006 in favor of Bank of America in exchange\r\nfor a $9 million loan. In his affidavit, Longman noted that in the 2009 Dissolution\r\nSuit Emerald sought dissolution based on \"Kriti's persistent mismanagement\" of\r\nAshley River II and continues to seek dissolution on that ground. The affidavit\r\nalso asserted that the financial statements presented by Williams undervalue\r\nAshley River II's real estate holdings, and asserted based on an appended appraisal\r\nthat the \"as is\" value for the underlying property is $17.25 million. Longman also\r\nstated that Kriti mismanaged Ashley River II by turning down offers to purchase\r\nthe underlying property, by not selling marina slips as \"dockominiums,\" and by\r\noverly indebting the company through the Bank of America loan.\r\n\r\n      The appraisal submitted by Longman was prepared on behalf of Bank of\r\nAmerica as Ashley River II's lender and valued the vacant land \"as is\" as of\r\nSeptember 25, 2009, at $7,720,000. The marina was valued at $9,530,000 if sold\r\nas \"dockominium\" units and $2,340,000 if leased as wet slips.\r\n\r\n       The first offer to purchase the property was an offer of $14.5 million made\r\nby Centex Destination Properties in 2005. However, that offer was for both the\r\nproperty owned by Ashley River II and adjacent property owned by an entity\r\ncontrolled by Longman but in which Kriti had no interest. Kriti declining the offer\r\nwas raised by Emerald as a ground for relief in the 2010 Arbitration. There, Kriti\r\nasserted that it attempted to proceed with the Centex offer, but Emerald refused to\r\nagree to place the proceeds in escrow pending a decision in the 2005 Arbitration,\r\nand Kriti and Emerald could not agree on an allocation of the proceeds between\r\nAshley River II and the adjacent property owner. The arbitrators found Kriti had\r\nnot engaged in mismanagement or waste in relation to the offer, but rather properly\r\nexercised its business judgment.\r\n\r\n      Longman also presented a 2007 offer by East Coast Horizons, LLC of $20\r\nmillion for the property. However, again in the 2010 Arbitration, this issue was\r\n\nraised, Kriti explained that it attempted to accept the offer but the purchaser would\r\nnot accept the proposed contract, and the arbitrators found there was no\r\nmismanagement or waste.\r\n\r\n       Finally, Longman presented a 2008 offer by Lucorp of $20 million for the\r\nproperty. Again, this issue was raised in the 2010 Arbitration, Kriti explained that\r\nLucorp offered deceptive information and lacked proper references, and the\r\narbitrators found Kriti had not engaged in mismanagement or waste.\r\n\r\n       A hearing was held on the motions pending in both the Lien Suit and the\r\n2009 Dissolution Suit, and the circuit court entered a brief order denying Kriti's\r\nmotion to foreclose. The order was devoid of factual findings and contained only\r\nthe following legal analysis:\r\n\r\n             The Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (LLC Act) grants\r\n      broad judicial discretion in fashioning remedies in actions by a\r\n      member of an LLC against the LLC and/or other members. See\r\n      Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 673\r\n      S.E.2d 448 (2009). In addition to allowing an order of forced\r\n      dissolution, the statute empowers a court to grant other relief,\r\n      including ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholder,\r\n      either by the corporation or by other shareholders. See Hendley v.\r\n      Lee, 676 F. Supp. 1317 (D.S.C. 1987). Because it is a drastic remedy,\r\n      foreclosure on a member's distributional interest is discretionary with\r\n      the Court, not mandatory. See S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-504(b) (\"The\r\n      court may order a foreclosure lien on a distributional interest subject\r\n      to the charging order.[\"])\r\n\r\n            South Carolina Courts have a long standing [sic] judicial policy\r\n      to avoid forfeitures. See National Fire Insurance Company of\r\n      Hartford v. Brown & Martin Company, Inc., 726 F. Supp. 1036\r\n      (D.S.C. 1989) (citing Elliot v. Snyder, 246 S.C. 186, 143 S.E.2d 374\r\n      (1965) (\"Forfeitures are not favored in law and Courts will seize upon\r\n      even slight evidence to prevent one.\")). See also South Carolina Tax\r\n      Commission v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 266 S.C. 34,\r\n      221 S.E.2d 522 (1975) (\"both in law and equity forfeitures are\r\n      abhorred.\").\r\n\r\n             In the present case, foreclosure may not be the appropriate\r\n      remedy. The previously issued charging order is sufficient to protect\r\n      the judgment creditors' interests and the debtor has presented evidence\r\n\n      that the debt could be satisfied without the necessity of a forced sale\r\n      of its distributional interest. The Plaintiff's Motion to Foreclose\r\n      Judgment Lien is denied.\r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.9       ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\nI.    Is the denial of the motion for foreclosure appealable?\r\n\r\nII.   Did the circuit court err in denying the motion to foreclose?\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    APPEALABILITY\r\n\r\n       Respondents argue the denial of a motion to foreclose on a charging order\r\nlien is not immediately appealable and this appeal should therefore be dismissed.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n      Generally, only final judgments are appealable, unless a statute provides an\r\nexception. Culbertson v. Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 23, 471 S.E.2d 163, 164 (1996).\r\nSection 18-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (2012) provides that \"an appeal may\r\nbe taken to the Supreme Court or the court of appeals in the cases mentioned in\r\nSections 14-3-320 and 14-3-330.\" In turn, Section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (1976) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of\r\n      errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n\r\n            (1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case\r\n            involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of\r\n            common pleas and general sessions, brought there by the\r\n            original process or removed there from any inferior court or\r\n            jurisdiction, and final judgments in such action . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 Subsequently, Kriti had the 2010 Arbitration award confirmed by a New York\r\ncourt. Also, a bench trial was held in the 2009 Dissolution Suit and the circuit\r\ncourt found \"no evidence forming a sufficient basis for dissolution\" and denied\r\nEmerald's request for dissolution.\r\n\n             (2) An order affecting a substantial right in an action when such\r\n             order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a\r\n             judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues\r\n             the action . . .\r\n\r\n             (3) A final order affecting a substantial right made in any\r\n             special proceeding or upon a summary application in any action\r\n             after judgment . . .\r\n\r\nWhile section 14-3-330 states it applies to \"law cases,\" we have recognized it as\r\napplicable in equity cases as well. See Ex parte Wilson, 367 S.C. 7, 12 n.2, 625\r\nS.E.2d 205, 207 n.2 (2005).\r\n\r\n       The denial of Kriti's motion for foreclosure, while it also likely satisfies\r\nother subsections of section 14-3-330, was unquestionably a final judgment. A\r\nfinal judgment is an order that \"'dispose[s] of the cause, . . . reserving no further\r\nquestions or directions for future determination. It must finally dispose of the\r\nwhole subject-matter or be a termination of the particular proceedings or action,\r\nleaving nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.'\"\r\nGood v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 201 S.C. 32, 41–42, 21 S.E.2d 209, 212\r\n(1942) (quoting 2 Am. Jur. 860 § 22). Here, the only relief requested or available\r\nin the action was the issuance of a charging order and foreclosure upon the lien.\r\nOnce foreclosure was denied, the action was over and nothing was left to be done.\r\nTherefore, as a final judgment, the order is immediately appealable.\r\n\r\nII.   FORECLOSURE\r\n       Appellants argue the circuit court erred in denying its motion for foreclosure\r\nby considering other remedies under the LLC Act, construing foreclosure as a\r\ndrastic remedy, and characterizing foreclosure as a forfeiture. Appellants further\r\ncontend the court erred in denying foreclosure on the facts of this case. We agree.\r\n\r\n      Appellants obtained a charging order and sought to foreclose under Section\r\n33-44-504 of the South Carolina Code (2006) which provides:\r\n\r\n      (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited\r\n      liability company or of a member's transferee, a court having\r\n      jurisdiction may charge the distributional interest of the judgment\r\n      debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of\r\n      the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment\r\n      debtor and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries\r\n\n      the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances\r\n      may require to give effect to the charging order.\r\n\r\n      (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's\r\n      distributional interest. The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on\r\n      a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time. A\r\n      purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment\r\n      creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the\r\n      judgment debtor's distributional interest in a limited liability company.\r\n\r\n       Foreclosure being an equitable claim, the decision to grant or deny\r\nforeclosure under section 33-44-504(b) is equitable. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n324 S.C. 570, 576, 479 S.E.2d 510, 513 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"Actions for foreclosure\r\nor the cancellation of instruments are actions in equity.\"), aff'd 330 S.C. 71, 497\r\nS.E.2d 731 (1998). Accordingly, an appellate court reviewing a decision to grant\r\nor deny foreclosure under section 33-44-504(b) may find facts in accordance with\r\nits own view of the preponderance of the evidence. See Townes Assocs., Ltd. v.\r\nCity of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\n      A.     Consideration of Other Remedies under the LLC Act\r\n       Appellants first contend the circuit court erred by considering other\r\nprovisions of the LLC Act as providing alternative remedies weighing against\r\nforeclosure on the charging order. The court broadly stated that other remedies\r\nexisted under the LLC Act and specifically mentioned forced dissolution or the\r\ncompelled purchase of the shares of any shareholder. Those considerations\r\nconstituted an error of law because the other provisions of the LLC Act were not\r\navailable remedies, and thus, were irrelevant. Appellants confirmed their\r\njudgment, obtained a charging order, and sought foreclosure not as members of an\r\nLLC, but as judgment creditors. Their status as judgment creditors did not give\r\nthem the legal right to seek dissolution or other relief under the LLC Act.\r\nMoreover, even considering their status as an LLC and a member of the LLC,\r\nrespectively, the fact that they were judgment creditors did not give them a right to\r\nany remedies under the LLC Act, other than those provided in section 33-44-504.\r\nAs that section provides, it is the \"exclusive remedy\" for a judgment creditor\r\nseeking to satisfy a judgment through the debtor's interest in an LLC. In short,\r\nthere were no other available remedies, and the circuit court's conclusion that the\r\n\navailability of other remedies weighed against ordering foreclosure was an error of\r\nlaw.  B.     Foreclosure as a Drastic Remedy\r\n      Appellants also contend the court committed an error of law when it\r\nconsidered foreclosure to be a \"drastic remedy.\" We agree.\r\n\r\n       Foreclosure is certainly a more drastic remedy than simply charging a\r\nmember's distributional interest in an LLC. See 91st St. Joint Venture v. Goldstein,\r\n691 A.2d 272, 283 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1997) (stating that foreclosure on a\r\ncharging order is a \"more drastic method\" of recovering on a debt than a charging\r\norder). However, generally, foreclosure is not a drastic remedy. It is a remedy\r\ncommonly used around the country when a charging order on a debtor's interest in\r\nan entity alone will not result in payment of a judgment. See, e.g., Nigri v. Lotz,\r\n453 S.E.2d 780 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995); Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Birchwood\r\nBuilders, Inc., 573 A.2d 182 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1990).10 It is also a remedy\r\nroutinely used in this state for the satisfaction of debts. Moreover, the statute\r\nprovides no indication that foreclosure is \"drastic\" or only to be used in extreme\r\ncircumstances. A judgment creditor has a right to collect on his judgment, and\r\ncharacterizing the remedy of foreclosure as drastic wrongly implies that in order to\r\nforeclose on a charging order a debtor must make some showing beyond the simple\r\nnecessity of foreclosure.\r\n\r\n      C.     Foreclosure as Forfeiture\r\n       Appellants further contend the circuit court erred as a matter of law when it\r\nconsidered foreclosure to be a form of forfeiture and thus, disfavored. Again, we\r\nagree. We have defined a forfeiture as \"that which is lost, or the right to which is\r\nalienated, by a crime, offense, neglect of duty, or breach of contract,\" and went on\r\nto make clear that forfeiture is a \"penalty.\" Tate v. LeMaster, 231 S.C. 429, 442,\r\n99 S.E.2d 39, 46 (1957). Similarly, Black's Law Dictionary defines a forfeiture as:\r\n\"1. The divestiture of property without compensation. 2. The loss of a right,\r\nprivilege, or property because of a crime, breach of obligation, or neglect of duty. .\r\n\r\n\r\n10 These cases deal with charging orders against partnership interests under the\r\nUniform Limited Partnership Act and Uniform Partnership Law, rather than LLC\r\ninterests. However, that distinction is immaterial here.\r\n\n. . 3. Something (esp. money or property) lost or confiscated by this process, a\r\npenalty.\" Black's Law Dictionary 677 (8th ed. 1999).\r\n\r\n       Foreclosure is not a penalty, but rather is simply the ultimate remedy for\r\ncollection of a debt owed. Foreclosure on an LLC member's interest does not\r\ndivest the member of the interest without compensation or cause him to lose his\r\ninterest. The member simply has a debt that must be paid. Furthermore, the\r\nmember can avoid the foreclosure by paying the judgment.\r\n\r\n      D.     Denial of Foreclosure\r\n       Finally, setting aside the circuit court's errors of law, appellants assert the\r\ncircuit court erred in denying foreclosure. We agree.\r\n\r\n       As an equitable matter, the decision whether to grant foreclosure under\r\nsection 33-44-504 requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances in\r\neach individual case. See, e.g., Carroll v. Page, 264 S.C. 345, 349, 215 S.E.2d\r\n203, 205 (1975) (holding that in \"an action in equity . . . 'the equities of both sides\r\nare to be considered, and each case must be decided on its own particular facts.'\"\r\n(quoting 30 C.J.S. Equity § 89)). However, the primary, and usually determinative,\r\nfactor for a circuit court to consider is whether the judgment will be paid within a\r\nreasonable amount of time through distributions. See Nigri, 453 S.E.2d at 783\r\n(\"[T]he further step of ordering a sale may be considered appropriate where it is\r\napparent that distributions under the charging order will not pay the judgment debt\r\nwithin a reasonable period of time.\"); Birchwood Builders, 573 A.2d at 185 (\"If the\r\ncourt is convinced the creditor's claim will not be satisfied in a reasonably\r\nexpedient manner by diverting the debtor's income from the partnership to satisfy\r\nthe debt, then sale should be ordered.\"). In short, if a judgment will not be paid\r\nthrough distributions in the reasonably foreseeable future, then foreclosure usually\r\nshould be ordered.\r\n\r\n      Here, the circuit court failed to make any findings as to whether the\r\njudgment would be satisfied in the foreseeable future through distributions, and\r\ntherefore, erred in denying foreclosure. Moreover, had the circuit court considered\r\nwhether the judgment would be satisfied through distributions, it could only have\r\nfound that distributions would not be made in the foreseeable future. At the time\r\nthe motion to foreclose was denied, the charging order had been in existence for\r\ntwo years and eight months and had yielded no funds towards satisfaction of the\r\njudgment. The only evidence presented as to Ashley River II's financial health\r\n\nwere the financial statements for 2008, 2009, and 2010.11 Those statements\r\nshowed the equity in the company was shrinking each year as the liabilities\r\nsteadily grew. The company only remains able to pay its debts due to loans made\r\nby Kriti and affiliated entities. In that situation and without a capital infusion,\r\ndistributions not only would not be expected, they would not be permissible under\r\nthe operating agreement. Furthermore, Kriti can hardly be expected to make a\r\ncapital contribution when Emerald continues to impede the company's business at\r\nevery turn. Finally, we find no evidence that Kriti has managed the company so as\r\nto avoid making distributions.\r\n\r\n       Rather than considering the availability of distributions, the circuit court\r\nfound the \"charging order is sufficient to protect the judgment creditors' interests\r\nand the debtor has presented evidence that the debt could be satisfied without the\r\nnecessity of a forced sale of its distributional interest.\" This seems to indicate the\r\ncourt believed the judgment could be paid through the sale of the property and\r\nresulting distributions or through dissolution. However, in part for reasons already\r\nstated, those considerations are improper. Kriti and Ashley River II bear no\r\nobligation to forego what they believe to be a potentially profitable business\r\nventure in order to aid Emerald and Longman in paying their debt. If Kriti and\r\nAshley River II believe the development of the property can still be made to turn a\r\nprofit, they are free to pursue that goal.\r\n\r\n        While Emerald and Longman have protested for years, not only in this\r\nlitigation but also in collateral litigation, that Kriti has acted inequitably and this\r\nweighs against ordering foreclosure, we find the opposite to be true. Emerald and\r\nLongman have attempted to game the system in order to avoid any consequences\r\nfor their wrongful acts while at the same time trying to make a profit at Kriti and\r\nAshley River II's expense. On the other hand, throughout the events underlying\r\nthis case, Kriti has repeatedly been found to have acted appropriately. Most\r\nnotably, in the 2010 Arbitration, Emerald and Longman presented all of the\r\nallegations of wrongful conduct by Kriti that they present here, and the arbitrators\r\ndenied their claims finding that Kriti had consistently acted within its business\r\njudgment. Again, in Emerald and Longman's most recent attempt, the 2009\r\nDissolution Suit, the court found that Kriti had not engaged in any misconduct.\r\nAdditionally, Kriti tried to give Emerald a way out of Ashley River II without the\r\n\r\n11 While Longman presented evidence—the Bank of America appraisals—\r\nchallenging the property values contained in those financial statements, the\r\nappraisals are irrelevant to whether the company was losing money and unable to\r\nmake distributions.\r\n\nloss of any of its capital contribution by offering to purchase Emerald's interest\r\npursuant to the 2005 Arbitration award, but Emerald refused. Also, it bears\r\nrepeating that Emerald and Longman find themselves in this position because of\r\ntheir wrongful acts. In conclusion, contrary to Emerald and Longman's assertions,\r\nto the extent the parties' conduct is relevant to the decision whether to grant\r\nforeclosure, we find it weighs against Emerald and Longman.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n      For those reasons, we hold the circuit court erred in denying the motion for\r\nforeclosure. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the foreclosure on and sale\r\nof Emerald's interest in Ashley River II through the normal foreclosure process and\r\nwithout further delay.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

The single commissioner and an Appellate Panel of the South\r\nCarolina Workers' Compensation Commission issued orders denying the claim.\r\nUnder the procedure then in place, Bone appealed to the circuit court, which\r\nconcluded the injury was compensable and remanded the matter to the\r\nCommission for further proceedings.1\r\n\r\n      Petitioners appealed the circuit court's order, and the Court of Appeals\r\ndismissed the appeal on the basis the order was not a \"final judgment\" and thus not\r\nimmediately appealable because further proceedings were ordered before the\r\nadministrative agency. Bone v. U.S. Food Service, S.C. Ct. App. Order dated June\r\n30, 2010. This Court granted Petitioners' petition for a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals, and we affirmed. Bone v. U.S. Food Service,\r\n399 S.C. 566, 733 S.E.2d 200 (2012).\r\n\r\n       We subsequently granted a petition for rehearing filed by Petitioners, and we\r\nadditionally granted the following two motions: (1) Bone's motion to argue against\r\nprecedent, and (2) the motion of the South Carolina Defense Trial Attorneys'\r\nAssociation to accept its Amicus Curiae Brief in support of Petitioners. After\r\nconsidering the record in this matter, as well as the briefs and arguments, we\r\nadhere to our original decision to affirm.\r\n\r\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n\r\n     Cathy C. Bone filed a workers' compensation claim form (Form 50) dated\r\nAugust 7, 2007 alleging that she injured her back on Tuesday, June 26, 2007 while\r\n1 This case arose under prior law that required an appeal from the Commission to\r\nbe made first to the circuit court. Such appeals are now directed to the Court of\r\nAppeals for all injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2007. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-\r\n17-60 (Supp. 2012); Pee Dee Reg'l Transp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 375 S.C.\r\n60, 650 S.E.2d 464 (2007).\r\n\nemployed with U.S. Food Service. Her job consisted of power washing and\r\ncleaning the insides of truck trailers that transported food. Bone alleged that she\r\nhurt her back when she lifted two pallets inside a trailer to clean underneath them.\r\n\r\n      According to Bone, she did not report the incident immediately as she\r\nneeded to continue working and believed she would be okay, but she thereafter\r\ndeveloped increasing pain. On her way to work on Tuesday, July 3, 2007, Bone's\r\nvehicle developed a flat tire, and she called in to advise her office of this fact.\r\nShortly after she arrived at work on July 3, Bone orally reported to one of her\r\nsupervisors, Richard Thompson, that she had suffered an injury while working on\r\nJune 26.\r\n\r\n      Petitioners (the employer and carrier) denied Bone's claim, disputing that\r\nshe had injured her back on June 26 and asserting the injury had occurred, instead,\r\nwhen her tire was changed on July 3.\r\n\r\n       At the hearing in this matter, Bone testified that she did not physically\r\nchange the tire herself; rather, she had pulled off the road and a gentleman in the\r\nparking lot of a nearby business had changed the tire for her. In contrast, Bone's\r\nsupervisor, Thompson, testified that Bone was crying as she reported her injury on\r\nJuly 3 (which Bone conceded, explaining she was in a lot of pain). In addition, he\r\nrecalled that Bone had told him that \"she had to change her tire on her truck,\"\r\nwhich he interpreted to mean that she had personally changed the tire, and Bone\r\nnever stated anyone had changed it for her. Bone disagreed with this interpretation\r\nas well as with the exact wording of her statement to Thompson. The supervisor\r\ndid not dispute the fact that Bone had reported that her back injury occurred on\r\nJune 26 as a result of lifting the pallets in the trailer.\r\n\r\n       The single commissioner found Bone failed to meet her burden of showing\r\nthat she had sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her\r\nemployment. The Appellate Panel of the Commission upheld the single\r\ncommissioner's findings and conclusions in full.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court reversed. The circuit court stated, \"The Commission\r\ndenied the claim finding Claimant did not suffer an on the job injury, ostensibly\r\nfinding Claimant injured her back while changing her tire on July 3. However, a\r\nreview of the records shows no evidence to support this finding.\"\r\n\r\n      The circuit court noted Petitioners \"do[] not contest the existence or the\r\ndegree of [Bone's] injury\" and that \"[t]he sole issue is when [her] injury occurred.\"\r\n\nThe circuit court stated Bone gave consistent statements to Petitioners and to\r\nphysicians that her injury occurred on June 26 and \"there is absolutely no evidence\r\nin the record, let alone substantial evidence, that Claimant injured her back while\r\nchanging a tire on the way to work on July 3, 2007.\" The circuit court noted\r\nPetitioners had argued that the supervisor's testimony that Bone reported having a\r\nflat tire on her way to work and having to change it, which the supervisor\r\ninterpreted to mean she did it herself, together with the single commissioner's\r\nfinding that Bone was not credible, supported the decision below. However, the\r\ncircuit court stated the finding regarding credibility \"goes only to the weight\r\nafforded [Bone's] testimony and in no way establishes [that her] injury occurred on\r\nJuly 3.\"\r\n\r\n      The circuit court concluded:\r\n\r\n            The evidence of record shows Claimant sustained a\r\n      compensable injury. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary.\r\n      When the evidence is susceptible of only one inference, then [the]\r\n      question is one of law for the Court. As such, as a matter of law, the\r\n      Decision and Order of the Workers' Compensation Commission is\r\n      hereby REVERSED and REMANDED to the Commission for\r\n      proceedings consistent with this Order.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. Bone moved to dismiss the\r\nappeal on the ground the circuit court's order was not immediately appealable. The\r\nCourt of Appeals agreed and dismissed the appeal, finding the order remanding the\r\nmatter to the Commission for further proceedings did not constitute a \"final\r\njudgment\" and thus was not immediately appealable, citing, inter alia, Montjoy v.\r\nAsten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 52, 446 S.E.2d 618, 618 (1994) (stating our\r\ncourts \"have consistently held that an order of the circuit court remanding a case\r\nfor additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly\r\nappealable\") and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority v. South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Health & Environmental Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d 894\r\n(2010) (explaining that the general appealability statute, S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-\r\n330(1) (1976), allowing appeals of intermediate orders \"involving the merits,\" did\r\nnot apply to appeals involving administrative agencies, which were governed by a\r\ndifferent statutory scheme). Bone v. U.S. Food Service, S.C. Ct. App. Order dated\r\nJune 30, 2010.\r\n\r\n      This Court granted Petitioners' petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndetermination of the Court of Appeals and affirmed. Bone v. U.S. Food Service,\r\n\n399 S.C. 566, 733 S.E.2d 200 (2012). The Court subsequently granted Petitioners'\r\npetition for rehearing as well as Bone's motion to argue against precedent and the\r\nmotion of the South Carolina Defense Trial Attorneys' Association to accept its\r\nAmicus Curiae Brief in support of Petitioners.\r\n\r\n                               II. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) was enacted in 1977 and\r\n\"purports to provide uniform procedures before State Boards and Commissions for\r\njudicial review after the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\" Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\nInc., 276 S.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981). The APA establishes the\r\nstandard for judicial review of decisions of the Commission. Pierre v. Seaside\r\nFarms, Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 689 S.E.2d 615 (2010); Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276\r\nS.E.2d at 306; Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 584 S.E.2d\r\n390 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n       Under section 1-23-380(A) of the APA, \"[a] party who has exhausted all\r\nadministrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a\r\nfinal decision in a contested case2 is entitled to judicial review . . . .\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-380(A) (Supp. 2007). \"An agency decision which does not decide the\r\nmerits of a contested case . . . is not a final agency decision subject to judicial\r\nreview . . . .\" S.C. Baptist Hosp. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envt'l Control, 291 S.C.\r\n267, 270, 353 S.E.2d 277, 279 (1987). \"A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate\r\nagency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency\r\ndecision would not provide an adequate remedy.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(A).\r\n\r\n       In this case, the Commission denied Bone's claim in toto, and all parties\r\nagree the Commission's order was a final decision subject to initial appellate\r\nreview in the circuit court because it disposed of the entirety of Bone's claim.\r\nHowever, the order under review by this court is the Court of Appeals's dismissal\r\nof the appeal of the circuit court's order that reversed the Commission and\r\nremanded the matter. The circuit court found that the Commission erred as a\r\nmatter of law. Neither the Commission nor the circuit court addressed the severity\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Section 1-23-380 originally provided for review by the circuit court, but it was\r\namended in 2006 to direct appeals to the Court of Appeals. The workers'\r\ncompensation statutory amendment making this change (§ 42-17-60) was not\r\nenacted until 2007 and applies to injuries on or after July 1, 2007, which is after\r\nthe date of Bone's accident.\r\n\nof Bone's injury, whether or not she had reached MMI, or if she should be provided\r\nmedical treatment. No award of any kind was made.\r\n\r\n       It is patently clear that the order from the circuit court remanding the matter\r\nto the Commission is not a final order. However, a preliminary, procedural, or\r\nintermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the\r\nfinal agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy. S.C. Code Ann § 1-\r\n23-380(A). Petitioners have an adequate remedy in that they may raise the issue of\r\ncompensability on appeal of a final award.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners argue that the lack of an order awarding benefits to Bone is\r\nirrelevant. Petitioners posit that the circuit court's conclusion that Bone's injury is\r\ncompensable as a matter of law is tantamount to a final judgment and is\r\nimmediately appealable.\r\n\r\n      Section 1-23-390 of the APA, governing further appellate review, provides:\r\n\"An aggrieved party may obtain a review of a final judgment of the circuit court or\r\nthe court of appeals pursuant to this article by taking an appeal in the manner\r\nprovided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules as in other civil cases.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-390 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).3 At issue here is the\r\nmeaning of a \"final judgment\" under section 1-23-390.\r\n\r\n       \"Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and\r\nthis Court reviews questions of law de novo.\" Town of Summerville v. City of N.\r\nCharleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008). \"When a statute's\r\nlanguage is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the\r\ncourt has no right to impose another meaning.\" Regions Bank v. Strawn, 399 S.C.\r\n530, 541, 732 S.E.2d 230, 236 (Ct. App. 2012). \"When 'the language of an act\r\ngives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may\r\nsearch for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself.'\" Id. at 542, 732 S.E.2d\r\n                                                              \r\nat 236 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The phrase \"in the manner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules\r\nas in other civil cases\" simply refers to following the same procedures for briefing\r\nschedules, preparation of records, etc., as in other civil cases, and these rules do not\r\nsupersede the APA provisions.\r\n\n       On its face, the statute refers to a \"final judgment,\" which is a well-\r\nestablished term of art in the law to which great significance is attached. See Good\r\nv. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 201 S.C. 32, 21 S.E.2d 209 (1942) (holding if\r\na judgment determines the applicable law while leaving open questions of fact, it is\r\nnot a final judgment); see also Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nHealth & Envt'l Control, 387 S.C. 265, 267, 692 S.E.2d 894, 895 (2010) (\"A final\r\njudgment disposes of the whole subject matter of the action or terminates the\r\nparticular proceeding or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by\r\nexecution what has been determined.\" (citing Good)).\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals dismissed Petitioners' appeal of the ruling of the\r\ncircuit court, which found Bone's claim was compensable and ordered a remand to\r\nthe Commission for further proceedings in light of this initial determination. The\r\ndismissal was based on the fact that there was no \"final judgment\" as required by\r\nsection 1-23-390 of the APA. We agree that the order remanding the matter to the\r\nCommission for further proceedings before entry of a final award was an\r\nintermediate judgment that did not dispose of the entirety of the action leaving\r\nnothing else for determination, nor did it terminate the proceedings, as articulated\r\nin Charlotte-Mecklenburg.\r\n\r\n       Charlotte-Mecklenburg concerned the interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. § 1-\r\n23-610(A)(1) (Supp. 2009), which allows judicial review only from \"final\r\ndecisions\" of the ALC. 387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894. The Court there\r\nreasoned that appeals in administrative agency matters are governed solely by the\r\nAPA, not by the general appealability statute of section 14-3-330(1), which permits\r\nreview of \"[a]ny intermediate judgment\" involving the merits. Id. The Court\r\nstated the concepts applicable in general appeals were not applicable under the\r\nAPA, as specialized statutes prevail over more general statutes. Id. In doing so,\r\nthe Court specifically overruled both ALC and workers' compensation cases to the\r\nextent they applied this concept of \"involving the merits\" under section 14-3-330.\r\nId. (overruling Canteen v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504\r\n(Ct. App. 2009) and Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envt'l\r\nControl, 381 S.C. 120, 671 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2009)).\r\n\r\n       We apply this reasoning in concluding that the meaning of a \"final\r\njudgment\" as used in section 1-23-390 is not defined by using the exceptions that\r\nare present in the general appealability statute, whether or not the statute is\r\nspecifically referenced.\r\n\n       In doing so, we also rely upon the long-standing precedent of Montjoy v.\r\nAsten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618 (1994), which involved an\r\nappeal from an order of the circuit court remanding the case to the Commission.\r\nThis Court dismissed the appeal in Montjoy on the basis the circuit court's order\r\nwas not directly appealable under the \"final judgment rule\" of the predecessor\r\nstatute of section 1-23-390, which is substantially the same as the version\r\napplicable here. Montjoy, 316 S.C. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618. In Montjoy, the Court\r\nobserved that \"we have consistently held that an order of the circuit court\r\nremanding a case for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not\r\ndirectly appealable.\" Id. The Court's order provides in full as follows:\r\n\r\n             This appeal is from an order of the circuit court remanding this\r\n      case to the Workers' Compensation Commission. Respondent moves\r\n      to dismiss the appeal on the ground the order is interlocutory and not\r\n      directly appealable. We agree and dismiss the appeal.\r\n\r\n             S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-390 (1986) provides:\r\n\r\n                    An aggrieved party may obtain a review of any\r\n             final judgment of the circuit court under this article by\r\n             appeal to the Supreme Court. The appeal shall be taken\r\n             as in other civil cases.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we have consistently held that an order of the circuit\r\n      court remanding a case for additional proceedings before an\r\n      administrative agency is not directly appealable. Owens v. Canal\r\n      Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984); Hunt v. Whitt, 279\r\n      S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983). To the extent our recent decision in\r\n      Blakely v. State Board of Medical Examiners, 310 S.C. 29, 425 S.E.2d\r\n      37 (1993), may be read to allow such an appeal, it is hereby overruled.\r\n\r\nId. at 52-53, 446 S.E.2d at 618.\r\n\r\n      Petitioners contend Montjoy did not specify the circumstances for the\r\nremand, so the cases that were string-cited in Montjoy are illustrative of the\r\ncircumstances under which an appeal will lie.4\r\n\r\n4 In Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984), the Court\r\nheld that a circuit court order remanding a workers' compensation case for the\r\ntaking of additional testimony on the existence of an employer-employee\r\n\n       In contrast, we view the Court's failure in Montjoy to identify the nature of\r\nthe remand as indicative that this was not a determinative factor. As we stated in\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, the general appealability statute allowing appeals from\r\ndecisions \"involving the merits\" has no place in the APA, which established a\r\ndifferent appellate scheme.\r\n\r\n       In any event, a review of the record reveals that the underlying\r\ncircumstances in Montjoy support our conclusion. In Montjoy the claimant sought\r\nworkers' compensation benefits for the death of her husband, who she contended\r\ndied of lung cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos at his workplace. Prior to\r\nany award of benefits, a hearing was held to determine the date of the husband's\r\nlast exposure and the proper insurance carrier for coverage. The single\r\ncommissioner determined the date of last asbestos exposure and identified the\r\nappropriate insurer. The Commission reversed. On appeal, the circuit court\r\nvacated the Commission's order and remanded the matter to the Commission for\r\nfurther action. The circuit court, Judge Jackson V. Gregory presiding, found that\r\nthe Commission erred by considering evidence outside of the record. The\r\nemployer and insurer appealed and argued that the remand order affected the\r\nmerits and a substantial right as the Commission would be allowed to consider\r\nevidence from unrelated cases as long as this evidence is included in the record.\r\n\r\n      It is noteworthy that this Court apparently found that the assertion of the\r\nemployer and insurer that the circuit court's order \"involved the merits and affected\r\na substantial right\" was irrelevant. This Court's opinion made no mention of their\r\n\r\n\r\nrelationship did not involve the merits of the action and was, therefore,\r\ninterlocutory and not reviewable by the Supreme Court for lack of finality. Neither\r\nsection 1-23-390 nor any other provision of the APA was cited, nor the general\r\nappealability statute.\r\n\r\n       In Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983), which was also cited\r\nin Montjoy, the Court considered an appeal by the employer from an order of the\r\ncircuit court reversing and remanding the case to the Commission to take\r\nadditional medical testimony from the claimant. The Court stated that, because the\r\ninterlocutory order did not involve the merits of the action, it was not reviewable\r\nfor lack of finality. Again, the Court did not reference section 1-23-390, the APA,\r\nor the general appealability statute, but did overrule prior cases that could be\r\nconstrued as authorizing such appeals under the same circumstances. The cases\r\noverruled were all cases that predated the APA.\r\n\nassertion that the circuit court's order involved the merits and affected a substantial\r\nright. This Court simply decided that the matter was remanded to the agency;\r\nconsequently, it was not immediately appealable.\r\n\r\n       In their petition for rehearing, Petitioners seek a \"case-by-case analysis of\r\nfinality\" rather than \"a rigid and formulaic approach that mandates dismissal of any\r\ninterlocutory appeal . . . .\"5 Petitioners essentially ask that we ignore the clear\r\nwording of section 1-23-390, which requires a \"final judgment.\" This Court's\r\njurisprudence is in accord with the definition of a final judgment found in Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary. It defines a final judgment as \"[a] court's last action that settles\r\nthe rights of the parties and disposes of all issues in controversy, except for the\r\naward of costs . . . and enforcement of the judgment.\" Black's Law Dictionary 919\r\n(9th ed. 2009).\r\n\r\n      Petitioners assert the circuit court's determination that the injury was\r\ncompensable \"constituted a final determination of the rights of the parties and left\r\nnothing to be done by the Commission on remand other than execute the\r\njudgment.\" To the contrary, there is no enforceable judgment at this stage as the\r\nCommission is tasked with further obligations in determining the extent of Bone's\r\ncompensation and in setting forth a final award that constitutes an executable\r\njudgment. An order as to compensability, without addressing the claimant's\r\ncurrent medical status and specific benefits to be awarded, is not a final judgment\r\ndisposing of the entirety of the action and leaving nothing further to be done but\r\nexecution of the judgment.6\r\n\r\n\r\n5 We believe the reference to an \"interlocutory appeal\" is a tacit recognition that\r\nthere is a lack of finality.\r\n6 See generally Fisher v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours, 282 S.E.2d 543 (N.C. Ct. App.\r\n1981) (stating where the North Carolina Industrial Commission had determined the\r\nclaimant had suffered a compensable injury by accident, but had not yet\r\ndetermined an award of compensation although it entered an order for costs, the\r\nappeal was premature; the court stated since the award of compensation the\r\nplaintiff is entitled to receive had not been determined, no final award had been\r\nentered for purposes of appellate review); see also Sign Plex v. Tholl, 863 So. 2d\r\n1113 (Ala. Civ. App. 2003) (stating a judgment determining only the\r\ncompensability of an injury, but which contains no provision specifying the\r\namount of compensation, was not a final judgment for purposes of appeal).\r\n\n       Petitioners attempt to distinguish Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Montjoy,\r\narguing there are cases since Montjoy that have applied the \"involving the merits\"\r\nlanguage. However, these are cases arising post-APA that apply a pre-APA\r\nappealability analysis of whether the order \"involves the merits.\" For example,\r\nmany of the cases purporting to allow an appeal involving the merits stem from a\r\nreliance on pre-APA cases such as Chastain v. Spartan Mills, 228 S.C. 61, 65, 88\r\nS.E.2d 836, 837 (1955).7 The Chastain Court properly found the order in that\r\nappeal was interlocutory and not appealable, but it used \"affecting the merits\"\r\nlanguage that was correct at the time, but which did not survive the adoption of the\r\nAPA. Later cases, primarily from the Court of Appeals, as noted by the dissent,\r\ncontinued to repeat this concept, however.\r\n\r\n       For example, in King v. Singer Co., 276 S.C. 419, 420, 279 S.E.2d 367, 367\r\n(1981), this Court held that a circuit court order reversing a determination of the\r\nIndustrial Commission that the hearing commissioner erred in failing to submit the\r\ncase to a medical board was not immediately appealable because it \"is a matter not\r\naffecting the merits of the cause of action.\" In so ruling, the Court cited both\r\nChastain and S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330 (1976) for this standard. Id. As noted in\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, however, any reliance on section 14-3-330 and its\r\nconcepts is inappropriate in APA matters.\r\n\r\n        In addition, in Canteen v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617,\r\n682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009), the Court of Appeals found the Appellate Panel's\r\norder reversing the hearing commissioner's finding of compensable brain damage\r\ninvolved the merits and was, therefore, immediately appealable. In support of this\r\nstandard of \"involving the merits,\" the Court of Appeals in Canteen did not\r\nspecifically cite to section 14-3-330; however, it did cite a case for this proposition\r\nthat, in turn, cited Chastain. Id. at 621, 682 S.E.2d at 505-06 (citing Green v. City\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Chastain v. Spartan Mills, 228 S.C. 61, 65, 88 S.E.2d 836, 837 (1955) (holding\r\nthe Commission's order reversing an award and remanding the case to the single\r\ncommissioner to take further testimony was not final and not appealable to the\r\ncircuit court until the Commission's final determination regarding the single\r\ncommissioner's award; the Court construed the language in a provision of the Code\r\nthat states appeals from the Commission to the circuit court \"shall be 'under the\r\nsame terms and conditions as govern appeals in ordinary civil actions'\" and stated\r\n                                                                          \r\nan appeal to the circuit court will not lie from an interlocutory order of the\r\nCommission unless it \"affects the merits\" (citation omitted)). However, the Court\r\ndid not cite to any specific provisions for this standard.\r\n\nof Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 79-80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687 (Ct. App. 1993)). Canteen\r\nwas overruled by this Court in our Charlotte-Mecklenburg decision.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners assert the concept of allowing appeals from intermediate\r\njudgments involving the merits has always been applied in these cases, and some\r\ncases do not appear to specifically rely upon section 14-3-330. Although some\r\ncases do not explicitly cite to section 14-3-330, they often fail to cite to any\r\nsupporting authority for the application of this standard. In addition, we overruled\r\nCanteen even though it did not specifically reference section 14-3-330, as it relied\r\nupon its concepts. We find it would be inconsistent to declare that section 14-3-\r\n330's standard of \"involving the merits\" does not apply to APA cases, while\r\nsimultaneously allowing the same concept of \"involving the merits\" to be applied\r\nby simply asserting the statute is not being relied upon. Under any name, the end\r\nresult is the same. To impose a changeable definition of a \"final judgment,\" in the\r\nabsence of a statutory directive to do so, would create more, rather than less,\r\nuncertainty in appellate practice in this area.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners would have us conflate the statutorily-required appellate\r\nprocedure for actions governed by the APA with the general appellate procedure\r\nfor civil actions. This would create a hybrid appellate process within the APA\r\nwhere immediate appealability is determined not by finality of judgment, but by\r\nthe agency that issued the challenged order. If the order originates from the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission final judgment is irrelevant; however, if it\r\noriginates from any other agency, finality of judgment is dispositive. Petitioners'\r\nposition imposes an unwarranted complication in the appellate process for\r\nadministrative matters and would serve only to delay the final resolution of cases.\r\nPetitioners misapprehend the policy interest at play here. The legislative policy\r\nexpressed in section 1-23-390 is intended to avoid the undue delay and waste of\r\njudicial resources caused by interlocutory appeals.\r\n\r\n       The dissent and Petitioners repeatedly make reference to Court of Appeals\r\ncases that utilized the pre-APA \"affecting the merits\" language. A case from the\r\nCourt of Appeals, Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546\r\n(Ct. App. 2005), cites to Montjoy and Montjoy's reference to Owens and Hunt, all\r\ncases from this Court. However, these cases are distinguishable. Although the\r\n\"affecting the merits\" language was used, each of those cases was remanded to take\r\nadditional evidence. Therefore, they were clearly interlocutory and did not affect\r\nthe merits.\r\n\n       More importantly, the dissent and Petitioners overlook our reference in\r\nMontjoy to Blakely v. State Board of Medical Examiners, 310 S.C. 29, 425 S.E.2d\r\n37 (1993). We specifically said that Blakely was overruled to the extent that it may\r\nbe read to allow an appeal of a circuit court order remanding a case for additional\r\nproceedings. Montjoy, 316 S.C. at 52-53, 446 S.E.2d at 618. In Blakely, the Board\r\nof Medical Examiners had issued a final order suspending Blakely, fined him\r\n$2,500, and required him to complete additional continuing medical education and\r\npass the Special Purpose Examination. Blakely, 310 S.C. at 30, 425 S.E.2d at 38.\r\nBlakely appealed to the circuit court, which remanded the case to the Board with\r\ninstructions. Id. at 30-31, 425 S.E.2d at 38. The Board failed to follow the circuit\r\ncourt's instructions and instead issued an amended order. Id. Four months later,\r\nBlakely moved to compel compliance with the court's first order of remand. Id. at\r\n31, 425 S.E.2d at 38. The circuit court granted Blakely's motion to compel and the\r\nBoard appealed. Id. Although this Court denied Blakely's motion to dismiss the\r\nappeal8 we said:\r\n\r\n      We also note the Board should have appealed the first order of the\r\n      circuit court, as it is apparent from the record the Board did not agree\r\n      with the circuit court's order. Because the orders were not\r\n      interlocutory orders and not timely appealed, the orders became the\r\n      law of the case.\r\n\r\nId. at 31-32, 425 S.E.2d at 39 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       The circuit court's remand orders in Blakely undoubtedly affected the merits\r\nof the case. The import of the Blakely reference in Montjoy is that, contrary to the\r\nBlakely Court, this Court in Montjoy wanted it understood that, although the circuit\r\ncourt orders were not interlocutory, they were not immediately appealable because\r\nthe circuit court's orders remanded the case to the Board. That being said, Montjoy\r\nmakes it clear that the only relevant question here is whether or not the case has\r\nbeen remanded to the administrative agency. In the current appeal, all parties\r\nagree that it was. Therefore, the order of remand is not appealable. Montjoy's\r\nreference to Blakely also makes it clear that the fact that the circuit court heard the\r\nmatter in its appellate capacity is irrelevant and does not change the analytical\r\nframework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 The motion to compel in Blakely was construed as an appeal of the Board's\r\nsecond order. As such it was untimely.\r\n\n       Petitioners and the South Carolina Defense Trial Attorneys' Association9\r\nlastly argue it is \"unfair\" and \"inequitable\" to allow a claimant to receive benefits\r\nwhile the matter is pending on appeal, since there is no stay of an award applicable\r\nhere. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-17-60 (Supp. 2012) (\"In the case of an appeal from\r\nthe decision of the commission on questions of law, the appeal does not operate as\r\na supersedeas and, after that time, the employer is required to make weekly\r\npayments of compensation and to provide medical treatment ordered by the\r\ncommission involved in the appeal or certification until the questions at issue have\r\nbeen fully determined in accordance with the provisions of this title.\"); Rule\r\n241(b)(7), SCACR (stating the general rule that a notice of appeal acts to\r\nautomatically stay matters decided in the order does not apply to \"[w]orkers'\r\ncompensation awards as provided in S.C. Code Ann. § 42-17-60\"). Petitioners'\r\nallegation of unfairness is both unfounded and unpersuasive.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners, however, do not address the opposite result, i.e., what happens\r\nwhen a claimant is denied benefits and is made to wait during the pendency of\r\nappeals by their employer and the insurance carrier, when the ultimate\r\ndetermination is made that the claimant suffered a compensable injury for which\r\nmedical care and benefits were wrongfully withheld? The claimant may receive\r\ninterest after the fact, per S.C. Code Ann. § 42-17-60, but there is no provision for\r\nmedical support during this time. Claimants and employers are treated the same\r\ndepending upon who prevails before the Commission. Moreover, there has been\r\nno definitive, enforceable award entered in this case. That is the point being made\r\nhere. The legislature, in using a well-known term of art such as \"final judgment,\"\r\nmeant exactly what \"final judgment\" has always been understood to mean:\r\nsomething that finally disposes of the whole subject matter of the action or\r\nterminates the action, leaving nothing to be done but to execute the judgment,\r\nwhich comports with the definition in Charlotte-Mecklenburg.\r\n\r\n       If the legislature did not then or no longer intends this result, it is free to\r\namend the specific language it chose to use and can allow appeals in other\r\ncircumstances, including those specified in section 14-3-330. Until there is a\r\ndefinitive statement to the contrary from the legislature, however, it is arguably\r\nmore equitable not to deny workers their benefits in these circumstances since the\r\nlegislature clearly intended awards to continue during appeal, per S.C. Code Ann.\r\n\r\n\r\n9   The Association has filed an Amicus Curiae Brief in support of Petitioners.\r\n\n§ 42-17-60, as is also recognized by Rule 241(b)(7), SCACR. Moreover, a \"case-\r\nby-case\" determination, as urged by Petitioners, would frustrate the main goals of\r\nboth the workers' compensation scheme, which is to streamline the process for\r\nproviding benefits to injured workers in exchange for the employee's release of the\r\nemployer from tort liability, and that of the APA, which is to provide clear and\r\nuniform procedures in agency cases.\r\n\r\n                               III. CONCLUSION\r\n       In agency appeals, the APA is controlling over general provisions that\r\nconflict with its terms. In this case, there is a specific statute in the APA that\r\ngoverns appeals in administrative cases, section 1-23-390, and it limits appeals to\r\nthose from final judgments. Therefore, section 14-3-330, a general appealability\r\nstatute allowing interlocutory appeals in certain instances, and its concepts are not\r\napplicable here. The definition of a \"final judgment\" used in Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg, as further detailed in the reference to Black's Law Dictionary\r\nincorporated in this opinion, should be the point of reference in any analysis of that\r\nterm when applying section 1-23-390. Consequently, we affirm the decision of the\r\nCourt of Appeals, which found the current order remanding the matter to the\r\nCommission for further proceedings does not constitute a final judgment as\r\nrequired by section 1-23-390 and, therefore, is not immediately appealable.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\nHEARN, J., dissenting in a separate opinion, in which KITTREDGE, J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\n\n       JUSTICE HEARN: I respectfully dissent. While I agree that Section 1-23-\r\n390 is the controlling statute, I do not agree that the circuit court's order resolving\r\nthe issue of compensability was not a final order from which a further appeal could\r\nbe taken.\r\n\r\n       To begin, I agree with the majority that the APA governs appealability in\r\nadministrative cases, which means the general rules of appealability do not apply.\r\nThe APA provides appealablilty standards for two different stages of appeals: from\r\nthe administrative body to the judiciary and further appellate review within the\r\ncourts. This case involves only the latter, which is controlled by section 1-23-390.\r\nI also agree that the heart of this case is what the words \"final judgment\" in section\r\n1-23-390 mean, but I disagree with the majority's interpretation of that term. In my\r\nview, the test which has heretofore been applied to determine whether an appellate\r\ndecision is a \"final judgment\" eligible for further review under section 1-23-390 is\r\nwhether the order finally determines an issue affecting a substantial right on the\r\nmerits. The circuit court order under review in this case is just such an order.\r\n\r\n       The first time we expressly interpreted this statute was in Montjoy v. Asten-\r\nHill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618 (1994). At the time that case was\r\ndecided, section 1-23-390 read: \"An aggrieved party may obtain a review of any\r\nfinal judgment of the circuit court under this article by appeal to the Supreme\r\nCourt. The appeal shall be taken as in other civil cases.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-\r\n390 (1986). Under this standard, which is similar to the present version of section\r\n1-23-390, \"we have consistently held that an order of the circuit court remanding a\r\ncase for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly\r\nappealable.\" Montjoy, 316 S.C. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618 (1994).\r\n\r\n       Because the scope of the remand in Montjoy is not apparent from the\r\nopinion, it is necessary to examine the two workers' compensation cases relied on\r\ntherein in order to fully understand the parameters of its holding: Hunt v. Whitt,\r\n279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983), and Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C.\r\n491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984).10 In both Hunt and Owens, the circuit court remanded\r\nto the full commission for the taking of additional testimony. We held that neither\r\norder was reviewable by this Court because they did not involve the merits of the\r\naction and were therefore interlocutory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10Section 1-23-390 was passed into law in 1977. See 1977 Act No. 176, Art. II, §\r\n9. Accordingly, even though they do not cite this statute, Hunt and Owens were\r\ngoverned by it.\r\n\n       The circuit court order in this case, however, unlike the orders in Hunt and\r\nOwens, resolved the issue of compensability with finality and was clearly\r\nappealable, just as the full commission's order, which was also a final decision on\r\ncompensability, was appealable by Bone in the first instance. Both parties\r\nconceded at re-argument that upon remand, the full commission will have no\r\nalternative but to make an award to Bone, the circuit court having reached the\r\nultimate issue in the case—whether Bone suffered a compensable injury.\r\nNevertheless, Bone has stunningly succeeded in arguing to the majority that while\r\nshe was entitled to appeal the full commission's decision to the circuit court, once\r\nthe circuit court reversed the commission's finding of no compensability, the order\r\nwas transformed into an unappealable order and the employer is precluded from\r\nappealing further until after the remand results in an award to Bone. I cannot\r\naccept the premise that by reversing the commission on a factually-driven issue\r\nand remanding, an appellate court—in this instance the circuit court—can cut off\r\nfurther review up the appellate chain. If Bone could appeal the full commission's\r\ndecision against her on the issue of compensability, then surely the employer is\r\nentitled to appeal the circuit court's order reversing that finding. In other words,\r\nappealability, once established, should not be extinguished by one level of\r\nappellate review; appealability should not be a moving target.\r\n\r\n       I would argue a bright line rule is not only impermissible under the statutory\r\nframework and Charlotte-Mecklenburg, but also is not necessary. In the years\r\nsince Montjoy, the court of appeals had many opportunities to evaluate\r\nappealability under section 1-23-390. In particular, the court of appeals examined\r\nthe issue at length in Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d\r\n546 (Ct. App. 2005). There, Brown, a worker in a cotton mill, developed breathing\r\nproblems after years of service. Id. at 383, 622 S.E.2d at 549. Although he also\r\nsmoked cigarettes for forty-five years, he claimed the respiratory troubles he\r\ndeveloped were caused by his work in the mill. Id. at 382, 622 S.E.2d at 548.\r\nDespite the evidence to the contrary, the single commissioner concluded Brown's\r\n\"respiratory disease arose out of and in the course of his employment; said disease\r\nwas due to hazards of the employment which are excess of hazards normally\r\nincident to normal employees.\" Id. at 384, 622 S.E.2d at 550. The full\r\ncommission affirmed. Id. at 385, 622 S.E.2d at 550. The circuit court, however,\r\nheld Brown's smoking was a contributing cause of his illness, and therefore the\r\nmill was entitled to a reduction in the compensation it owed. Id. at 386, 622 S.E.2d\r\nat 550. Accordingly, the circuit court remanded for a determination of the size of\r\nthe reduction. Id.\r\n\n      Brown appealed, and the mill argued the order remanding to the commission\r\nwas not immediately appealable. Id. at 386, 622 S.E.2d at 550-51. The court of\r\nappeals, citing section 1-23-390, Montjoy, Owens, and Hunt, held that \"in\r\ndetermining whether the court's order constitutes a final judgment, we must inquire\r\nwhether the order finally decides an issue on the merits.\" Id. at 387, 622 S.E.2d at\r\n551. As the court went on to note, \"'An order involves the merits if it finally\r\ndetermines some substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of\r\naction or defense in the case.'\" Id. (quoting Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C.\r\n78, 80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687 (Ct. App. 1993)). Because the circuit court finally\r\ndetermined that Brown's smoking contributed to his injuries, its order was a final\r\njudgment under section 1-23-390 and therefore was appealable. Id. at 388, 622\r\nS.E.2d at 551. The fact the circuit court had also remanded the proceedings was of\r\nno moment because \"the panel would have no choice but to allocate some part of\r\nBrown's disability to the non-compensable cause.\" Id. As both parties conceded at\r\nre-argument, this is precisely the situation facing the commission upon remand\r\nhere.  The court of appeals reached the same result in Mungo v. Rental Uniform\r\nService of Florence, Inc., 383 S.C. 270, 678 S.E.2d 825 (Ct. App. 2009). In that\r\ncase, the claimant, Mungo, alleged a change in condition that would entitle her to\r\nmore benefits than she originally was awarded for her injuries. See id. at 276, 678\r\nS.E.2d at 828. The single commissioner denied her request because the report she\r\nused to show a change in condition was completed prior to the original hearing. Id.\r\nThe full commission affirmed, and Mungo appealed to the circuit court. Id. The\r\ncourt reversed, holding the report could be considered and Mungo had\r\ndemonstrated a change in condition. Id. at 276-77, 678 S.E.2d at 828.\r\nAccordingly, the court remanded to the commission for a determination of \"the\r\nprecise benefits owed to [Mungo] for her change in condition and for her\r\npsychological condition.\" Id. at 277, 678 S.E.2d at 828-29.\r\n\r\n       The employer sought review before the court of appeals, and the threshold\r\nquestion was whether the circuit court's order was appealable. Id. at 277, 678\r\nS.E.2d at 829. Relying in part on Brown, the court found it was appealable,\r\nstating:\r\n\r\n      The circuit court's order mandates an award for change of condition . .\r\n      . . This ruling is a decision on the merits because it decides with\r\n      finality whether [Mungo] proved these changes in her condition.\r\n      Although the circuit court remanded the issue of the precise damages\r\n      to be awarded to [Mungo], the single commissioner would have no\r\n\n      choice but to award some damages to [her]. Accordingly, the circuit\r\n      court's order constitutes a final decision and is appealable.\r\n\r\nId. at 278, 678 S.E.2d at 829.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals also has used this same framework to determine when\r\nan order of the circuit court is not appealable. For example, in Foggie v. General\r\nElectric Corp., 376 S.C. 384, 656 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 2008), the circuit court\r\nheld the full commission's finding of permanent total disability rested, at least in\r\npart, on evidence which should have been excluded. Id. at 387, 656 S.E.2d at 397.\r\nThe court also found the commission did not make any findings regarding a\r\npotential credit to the employer for previous psychological injuries the employee\r\nsustained. Id. at 387-88, 656 S.E.2d at 397. Consequently, the court remanded\r\nwith instructions for the commission to review the record without the excluded\r\nevidence and determine whether the employee was still permanently and totally\r\ndisabled, and to make findings regarding the employer's entitlement to the credit.\r\nId.   The employee appealed, and the court of appeals held the circuit court had\r\nnot made a final determination of whether the employee was totally and\r\npermanently disabled or whether the employer could receive any credit. Id. at 389,\r\n656 S.E.2d at 398. Accordingly, the circuit court's order was not immediately\r\nappealable. Id.; see also McCrea v. City of Georgetown, 384 S.C. 328, 333, 681\r\nS.E.2d 918, 921 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"The circuit court's order was not a final\r\njudgment and did not involve the merits of the case. The circuit court remanded\r\nthe case to the Commission so that additional evidence could be entered into the\r\nrecord without determining whether Claimant was disabled or whether Employer\r\nwas entitled to stop payments. As such, this appeal is interlocutory.\").\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, prior to today, the test consistently applied in this State to\r\ndetermine whether an appellate decision was eligible for further review under\r\nsection 1-23-390 was whether the order finally determined an issue affecting a\r\nsubstantial right on the merits. Under that framework, there could be little question\r\nthat employer is entitled to appeal the circuit court's decision that there was no\r\nevidence to support the full commission's conclusion that Bone was not injured on\r\nthe job because that decision affected a substantial right on the merits—Bone's\r\nentitlement to benefits. However, rather than applying this traditional test, the\r\nmajority holds that Charlotte-Mecklenburg rejected the \"involving the merits\"\r\nanalysis under the APA and implicitly overruled a long line of cases. While I\r\nbelieve Charlotte-Mecklenburg was properly decided, it has no impact on this case.\r\n\n       In Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the Administrative Law Court (ALC) partially\r\ngranted summary judgment and remanded for the Department of Health and\r\nEnvironmental Control to decide whether any party was entitled to a certificate of\r\nneed.11 387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894. One of the parties appealed the ALC's\r\norder, and we dismissed the appeal as interlocutory. Id. The controlling statute in\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg was not section 1-23-390. Instead, it was Section 1-23-\r\n610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011), which provides \"for judicial review\r\nof a final decision of an administrative law judge.\"12 (emphasis added). We\r\ndefined a final decision in this context as follows:\r\n\r\n      If there is some further act which must be done by the court prior to a\r\n      determination of the rights of the parties, the order is interlocutory. A\r\n      judgment which determines the applicable law, but leaves open\r\n      questions of fact, is not a final judgment. A final judgment disposes\r\n      of the whole subject matter of the action or terminates the particular\r\n      proceeding or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by\r\n      execution what has been determined.\r\n\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, 387 S.C. at 267, 692 S.E.2d at 894-95 (internal citations\r\nomitted). Because the ALC's order did not finally determine whether any party\r\nwas entitled to a certificate of need, the order under review was not a final decision\r\nand thus not immediately appealable.13 Id. at 267, 692 S.E.2d at 895.\r\n\r\n\r\n11 In order to obtain permission to construct certain healthcare facilities, the facility\r\nmust demonstrate the need for the proposed facility. See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-\r\n110, et seq. (2002 & Supp. 2011).\r\n12 The statute governing appeals from the Workers' Compensation Commission is\r\nSection 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011), a sister statute of\r\nsection 1-23-610, which similarly provides that \"[a] party who has exhausted all\r\nadministrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a\r\nfinal decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review.\" I agree with the\r\nmajority that Charlotte-Mecklenburg's interpretation of section 1-23-610 applies\r\nequally to section 1-23-380.\r\n13  In reaching this result, we overruled two cases \"to the extent [they] rely on\r\n[Section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1976)] to permit the appeal of\r\ninterlocutory orders of the ALC or an administrative agency.\" Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg, 387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894. The cases were Canteen v.\r\nMcLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n\n       The majority therefore is correct that Charlotte-Mecklenburg rejected an\r\n\"involving the merits\" analysis with respect to administrative and agency\r\ndecisions. See id. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894 (\"[A]lthough § 14-3-330 permits\r\nappeals from interlocutory orders which involve the merits, that section is\r\ninapplicable in cases where a party seeks review of a decision of the ALC because\r\nthe more specific statute, § 1-23-610, limits review to final decisions of the\r\nALC.\"). Charlotte-Mecklenburg therefore examined a different statute and a\r\ndifferent stage in the appellate process for administrative cases. Rather than\r\ndetermining whether an order of the circuit court sitting in an appellate capacity or\r\nthe court of appeals is ripe for further review up the appellate chain, Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg only concerned whether the administrative order itself is final and\r\ntherefore appealable to the judicial branch in the first instance. It went no further\r\nthan that, and I believe the majority is in error in stretching it's holding beyond the\r\nclearly delineated bounds of the opinion. Indeed, the opinion in Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg was issued without either briefing or oral argument; it was issued\r\nsolely on the basis of a motion to dismiss and supporting memoranda. It is\r\ninconceivable that we could have intended to undo years of appellate precedent,\r\nnot to mention impact the appealability of orders at an entirely different stage in\r\nthe proceedings.\r\n\r\n       Put in the context of this case, Charlotte-Mecklenburg governs the\r\nappealability of the full commission's decision, not the appealability of the circuit\r\ncourt's order reviewing the commission's decision. Because the full commission\r\nfound Bone's claim was not compensable, it rendered a final judgment and the\r\ncircuit court could entertain the appeal under Charlotte-Mecklenburg. At this\r\npoint, appealability ceased to be governed by Charlotte-Mecklenburg and was then\r\ncontrolled by section 1-23-390. Thus while I believe that Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\nis correct, given its procedural posture, I do not believe it has any impact on the\r\ncase before us.\r\n\r\n      The majority also suggests its decision will not only further judicial\r\neconomy but also serve the Workers' Compensation Act's underlying purpose of\r\naffording compensation to injured workers. The majority asserts that, as between\r\nthe two parties, the employer is in a better position to shoulder the payment of\r\n\r\n\r\nand Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health &\r\nEnvironmental Control, 381 S.C. 120, 671 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2009). Both of\r\nthese cases concerned the initial appeal of an administrative order, not further\r\nappellate review of an order of the circuit court. See Canteen, 384 S.C. at 624, 682\r\nS.E.2d at 507; Oakwood, 381 S.C. at 132, 671 S.E.2d at 653.\r\n\nbenefits during the pendency of an eventual appeal. That position misses the point\r\nthat the Act is designed to provide benefits to workers who are injured on the job,\r\na fact which the employer disputes and which the full commission decided in its\r\nfavor. No employer should have to pay benefits until the worker establishes before\r\nthe fact-finder, which is the full commission, that she has sustained a compensable\r\ninjury. Bone simply has not done that yet, and it cannot be good public policy to\r\nrequire employers to pay benefits without the issue of compensability of the claim\r\nbeing finally adjudicated. The employer is entitled, not only under the law, but\r\nalso on public policy grounds, to have the circuit court's order on compensability\r\nreviewed by the highest court. It is neither good law nor good policy to hold that\r\nthe appellate chain can be broken when, at the first layer of appellate review, the\r\ncourt reverses the fact-finder and sends the case back for the commission to\r\nperform the perfunctory task of setting compensation for the worker.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, the interests of judicial economy demand a rejection of the\r\nmajority's view. Taken to its logical conclusion, the majority's position could have\r\ncases trapped in a cycle of remands for years. In this case, once the full\r\ncommission renders a decision on the benefits owing to Bone, the parties will\r\nreturn again to the court of appeals. In doing so, the employer runs the risk that the\r\ncourt of appeals will again remand the case, at which point it will have to start the\r\nprocess all over again. Only after that court issues its \"final\" order—assuming it\r\nfinds nothing else warranting a remand—will the employer finally be able to argue\r\nto this Court that the full commission correctly held Bone's claim was not\r\ncompensable back in June of 2008.\r\n\r\n       Because I believe the issue of compensability was finally decided by the full\r\ncommission and the circuit court, sitting in an appellate capacity, could not thwart\r\nfurther appellate review by ordering a remand, I would find the order appealable\r\nunder section 1-23-390. See Mungo, 383 S.C. at 278, 678 S.E.2d at 829\r\n(\"Although the circuit court remanded the issue of the precise damages to be\r\nawarded to Claimant, the single commissioner would have no choice but to award\r\nsome damages to Claimant. Accordingly, the circuit court's order constitutes a\r\nfinal decision and is appealable.\"); Brown, 366 S.C. at 387-88, 622 S.E.2d at 551\r\n(holding circuit court's order that apportionment was required was final and\r\nappealable even though the court remanded for a determination of the amount of\r\napportionment due). Nothing in Charlotte-Mecklenburg impacts this decision;\r\nrather, it results from a straight-forward application of section 1-23-390, which\r\npermits an appeal from a final decision involving the merits of the substantive\r\nissue in this case. I would hold that the court of appeals erred in dismissing the\r\nemployer's appeal.\r\n\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27279","title":"Limehouse v.

Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\n       JUSTICE BEATTY: Lawton Limehouse, Sr. (\"Father\") and Lawton\r\nLimehouse, Jr. (\"Son\") separately sued Paul Hulsey, an attorney, and Hulsey's law\r\npractice (collectively, \"Hulsey\") for defamation arising out of statements Hulsey\r\nmade regarding L&L Services, LLC (\"L&L\"), a staffing agency owned and\r\noperated by Father and Son. Hulsey removed the case to federal court based on an\r\nunderlying RICO action1 involving the operation of L&L. The federal court\r\nremanded the case to state court on the ground it lacked federal question\r\njurisdiction over the issues presented. After the remand, the state court clerk of\r\ncourt entered a default against Hulsey.\r\n\r\n      Following a damages hearing, a jury awarded Father $2.39 million in actual\r\ndamages and $5 million in punitive damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nLimehouse v. Hulsey, 397 S.C. 49, 723 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 2011). While the\r\nappeal in Father's case was pending, a damages hearing was held for Son's case. A\r\njury awarded Son $1 million in actual damages and $2.6 million in punitive\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n       This Court granted Hulsey's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\nopinion of the Court of Appeals. Subsequently, this Court issued an order\r\ncertifying the appeal in Son's case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. Because the\r\ndispositive issue in each case is identical, we consolidated the matters for oral\r\nargument and for the purpose of this opinion.2 As will be discussed, we find the\r\n\r\n1\"RICO\" is an acronym for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\r\nAct. 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1961-1968.\r\n2 See Rule 214, SCACR (\"Where there is more than one appeal from the same\r\norder, judgment, decision or decree, or where the same question is involved in two\r\nor more appeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion, order\r\nthe appeal to be consolidated.\").\r\n\nstate court proceedings are void as the lack of a certified remand order precluded\r\nthe state court from resuming jurisdiction over the cases. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals, vacate the state court proceedings, and\r\nremand to the circuit court to recommence the cases from the procedural point at\r\nwhich the state court received a certified remand order from the federal court.\r\n\r\n                         I.    Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n       Father and Son owned and operated an employment staffing agency known\r\nas L&L Services, LLC, which was located in Charleston County. Between\r\nFebruary 11, 2004, and February 24, 2004, The Post and Courier published four\r\narticles concerning housing raids performed on homes rented by L&L and fines\r\nassessed for overcrowding, inadequate heating and plumbing, and running illegal\r\nboarding houses. On Sunday, March 21, 2004, The Post and Courier published a\r\nfront page article entitled, \"The Hidden Economy, Local company accused of\r\ntrafficking in illegal immigrant labor.\" Several of L&L's employees were\r\ninterviewed and quoted in the article. The employees admitted they were\r\nundocumented and accused L&L of selling them false citizenship documents and\r\nfailing to pay for overtime work.\r\n\r\n       On April 23, 2004, Hulsey filed a class action lawsuit in federal court on\r\nbehalf of former employees of L&L, alleging violations of the RICO Act and other\r\nstate and federal laws (the \"RICO case\"). Hulsey named Father, Son, and L&L as\r\ndefendants in the RICO case. In the Complaint, it was alleged that defendants\r\nhired undocumented workers and exploited them under the threat of deportation by\r\nfailing to pay overtime wages, manufacturing and providing false identification\r\nand immigration documents and reports, and harboring them in substandard\r\nhousing.3\r\n\r\n     On April 24, 2004, The Post and Courier printed an article entitled,\r\n\"Lawsuit Targets Staffing Agency.\" The article quoted Hulsey as stating:\r\n\r\n      (1)   L&L engaged in a \"classic racketeering scheme\";\r\n      (2)   L&L's conduct set \"the community back 150 years\";\r\n      (3)   L&L engaged in \"a blatant case of indentured servitude\"; and\r\n      (4)   L&L \"created a perfect racketeering enterprise, just like Tony Soprano.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The RICO case was never certified as a class action and ultimately settled for\r\n$20,000.\r\n\nNeither Father nor Son was mentioned by name in the article. Evidence was\r\npresented that the estimated readership for The Post & Courier on April 24, 2004\r\nwas 237,952.\r\n\r\n        On April 19, 2006, Father and Son, separately but with identical pleadings,\r\ninitiated the current defamation action against Hulsey in state court, alleging the\r\nstatements in the article were false and damaged their reputation, health, and\r\nbusiness. Hulsey's law practice was served with a copy of the Complaint on April\r\n20, 2006, and Hulsey was served individually on April 21, 2006. On May 5, 2006,\r\nbefore Hulsey's Answer was due in state court, Hulsey filed a notice of removal to\r\nfederal district court. On June 2, 2006, Father and Son filed a motion to remand\r\nthe cases to state court.\r\n\r\n       By order dated July 19, 2006, the federal district court remanded the cases to\r\nstate court on the ground that federal question jurisdiction was not present. The\r\nfederal court electronically transmitted the order to counsel on July 20, 2006;\r\nhowever, the electronic copy was neither manually embossed nor did it contain an\r\nelectronic seal. The Charleston County Clerk of Court received an uncertified\r\ncopy of the remand order on July 21, 2006, which it filed the same day. On July\r\n27, 2006, the clerk mailed notice of the filing to the parties.\r\n\r\n       On August 21, 2006, Father and Son moved for entry of default in state\r\ncourt on the ground Hulsey failed to timely file an Answer to the Complaint. The\r\nCharleston County Clerk of Court entered default on August 21, 2006, and filed it\r\non August 22, 2006. The clerk mailed the Form 4 order to all parties on August\r\n24, 2006, noticing the entry of default. On August 29, 2006, upon receipt of the\r\nForm 4 order, Hulsey filed an Answer and a motion to set aside the entry of default\r\npursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP. Following a hearing, then Circuit Court Judge\r\nDaniel F. Pieper issued a written order denying the motion.\r\n\r\n       On February 4-6, 2008, Circuit Court Judge Roger M. Young presided over\r\nthe damages hearing involving Father's case. Because Hulsey was deemed in\r\ndefault, Judge Young limited Hulsey's participation in the hearing to cross-\r\nexamination and objection to Father's evidence. The jury returned a verdict against\r\nHulsey for $2.39 million in actual damages and $5 million in punitive damages.\r\nOn February 15, 2008, Hulsey filed several post-trial motions, including a motion\r\nto dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after discovering the Charleston\r\nCounty Clerk of Court had not received a certified copy of the remand order from\r\nthe federal court. Following a hearing, Judge Young denied Hulsey's post-trial\r\nmotions. Hulsey appealed to the Court of Appeals.\r\n\n       In a divided opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Limehouse v. Hulsey,\r\n397 S.C. 49, 723 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 2011). In so ruling, the majority held: (1)\r\nthe circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action upon remand as the\r\nmailing of a certified order is a procedural, rather than jurisdictional, requirement;\r\n(2) Judge Pieper properly denied Hulsey's motion to set aside the entry of default\r\nas Hulsey's explanation for the untimely Answer did not support a finding of good\r\ncause; (3) Judge Young properly limited Hulsey's participation in the damages\r\nhearing to cross-examination and objection to Father's evidence; (4) Judge Young\r\ndid not comment on the facts of the case when he responded to a question posed by\r\nthe jury during deliberations; (5) Judge Young properly submitted to and instructed\r\nthe jury on the issue of punitive damages; and (6) the award of punitive damages\r\nwas supported by the evidence. Id. at 60-80, 723 S.E.2d at 217-28.\r\n\r\n       In contrast, the dissent found the circuit court was without jurisdiction over\r\nthe proceeding as the federal court's failure to mail a certified copy of the remand\r\norder precluded jurisdiction from re-vesting in the state court. Id. at 81, 723 S.E.2d\r\nat 228-32. Alternatively, the dissent believed Judge Pieper erred in ruling on\r\nHulsey's motion to set aside the entry of default in light of this Court's decision in\r\nSundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Industries, Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 681 S.E.2d 885\r\n(2009). Because the dissent believed Sundown changed the analytical framework\r\nfor ruling on \"good cause,\" the dissent would have reversed Judge Pieper's order\r\nand remanded the case for a determination of whether good cause existed under\r\nSundown. Id. at 89-94, 723 S.E.2d at 233-35.\r\n\r\n      This Court granted Hulsey's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n       While the appeal of Father's case was pending before the Court of Appeals,\r\nJudge Young presided over a jury trial for damages in Son's case on November 9-\r\n13, 2009. 4 Because Hulsey was deemed in default, Judge Young again limited\r\nHulsey's participation in the hearing to cross-examination and objection to Son's\r\nevidence. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Son in the amount of $1 million\r\nactual damages and $2.6 million in punitive damages. Hulsey appealed to the\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n\r\n      After granting the writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision\r\nin Limehouse v. Hulsey, 397 S.C. 49, 723 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 2011), this Court\r\n\r\n4 Hulsey filed a motion to stay the trial of Son's case due to the pending appeal in\r\nFather's case. Judge Young, however, denied this motion and set the matter for a\r\ndamages trial.\r\n\ncertified the appeal in Son's case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. We now\r\nconsider the consolidated matters.II.   Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Jurisdiction of the State Court\r\n\r\n       Hulsey asserts the circuit court was without subject matter jurisdiction over\r\nthe proceedings as the federal removal statutes require the state court to receive a\r\ncertified order for jurisdiction to be re-vested.\r\n\r\n        Section 1446(d) of the United States Code provides that after an action has\r\nbeen removed to federal court, \"the State court shall proceed no further unless and\r\nuntil the case is remanded.\" 28 U.S.C.A. § 1446(d) (West 2013). A remand order\r\nthat is based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction is governed by section 1447(c).\r\nSection 1447(c), entitled \"Procedure after removal generally,\" provides in relevant\r\npart: (c) A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than\r\n      lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after\r\n      the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any\r\n      time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks\r\n      subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded . . . A certified\r\n      copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of\r\n      the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such\r\n      case.\r\n\r\nId. § 1447(c) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       In ruling on this issue, a majority of the Court of Appeals focused on\r\nwhether mailing was required to divest the federal court of jurisdiction.\r\nLimehouse, 397 S.C. at 60, 723 S.E.2d at 217. Although the court recognized that\r\n\"a majority of federal circuits take the position that the finality of the remand and\r\nthe accompanying loss of federal jurisdiction requires both entry of the order with\r\nthe federal clerk of court and a certified copy being mailed to the state court,\" it\r\nadopted the minority view espoused by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Id. at\r\n60, 723 S.E.2d at 217.\r\n\n       Relying on the reasoning of In re Lowe, 102 F.3d 731 (4th Cir. 1996),5 the\r\nmajority of the Court of Appeals concluded that mailing of the certified remand\r\norder is not a jurisdictional requirement, but instead the federal court lost\r\njurisdiction when the remand order was entered. Limehouse, 397 S.C. at 61-62,\r\n723 S.E.2d at 217-18.\r\n\r\n        In analyzing whether jurisdiction re-vested in the state court upon mailing of\r\nthe remand order to the clerk, the majority noted the state court's jurisdiction is\r\ngeneral as it is derived exclusively from our state constitution and not federal law.\r\nId. at 62, 723 S.E.2d at 218. The majority proceeded to compare the general\r\njurisdiction of the state court to the limited jurisdiction of the federal court and\r\n\r\n5 In Lowe, Katherine Lowe sued her employer, \"Wal-Mart Stores\", and two Wal-\r\nMart managers in North Carolina state court. Lowe, 102 F.2d at 732. After Wal-\r\nMart removed the case to federal court, Lowe moved to remand the case to state\r\ncourt based on a lack of diversity jurisdiction. Id. at 733. The remand order was\r\nentered on the district court docket on August 25, 1995. Id. The federal court\r\nmailed a copy of the order to the state court. However, the state court's copy of the\r\nremand order lacked the blue backing necessary to show the order was certified.\r\nId. Wal-Mart moved before the federal court for reconsideration of its remand\r\norder. Id. Ultimately, the federal court reinstated the case to the federal docket.\r\nId. Lowe filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Fourth Circuit Court of\r\nAppeals asking the court to order the district court to return her case to the state\r\ncourt. Id. In analyzing whether the district court had jurisdiction when it\r\nreconsidered the remand order, the Fourth Circuit was required to determine the\r\npoint at which the district court lost jurisdiction over the case. Id. at 734. Lowe\r\nclaimed the district court lost jurisdiction when it entered the remand order. In\r\ncontrast, Wal-Mart asserted the district court retained jurisdiction until it mailed a\r\ncertified copy of the remand order to the state court. Id. The Fourth Circuit ruled\r\nin favor of Lowe. In so ruling, the court found that \" '[l]ogic . . . indicates that it\r\nshould be the action of a court (entering an order of remand) rather than the action\r\nof a clerk (mailing a certified copy of the order) that should determine the vesting\r\nof jurisdiction.' \" Id. at 735 (quoting Van Ryn v. Korean Air Lines, 640 F. Supp.\r\n284, 285 (C.D. Cal. 1985)). The court stated that to \"hold otherwise would\r\nimpermissibly elevate substance over form.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Our Court of Appeals also referenced the Fourth Circuit case of Bryan v.\r\nBellSouth Communications, Inc., 492 F.3d 231 (4th Cir. 2007), wherein the court\r\nstated in a footnote that a remand order based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction\r\nis effective when entered. Id. at 235 n.1.\r\n\nfound the state court's jurisdiction is limited only by the federal court's proper\r\nexercise of jurisdiction over a case pursuant to a congressional act, \"which\r\naccording to Fourth Circuit jurisprudence in Lowe, ceased upon entry of the\r\nremand order.\" Id. at 63, 723 S.E.2d at 218.\r\n\r\n       Because the majority found jurisdiction transferred to the state court upon\r\nentry of the order in federal court, the court believed it was unnecessary to\r\ndetermine whether the federal court had to mail a certified order. Id. at 62, 723\r\nS.E.2d at 218. The court, however, found that since the issue of mailing was\r\nprocedural and not jurisdictional, it was not preserved for appellate review as\r\nHulsey failed to make a timely objection. Id. at 65, 723 S.E.2d at 220.\r\nAdditionally, the court noted that to warrant reversal on procedural grounds,\r\nHulsey was required to show that he was prejudiced by the fact that the Charleston\r\nCounty Clerk of Court did not receive a certified copy of the order. Id. at 66, 723\r\nS.E.2d at 220. Because Hulsey received personal notice of the remand order, the\r\nmajority found that Hulsey failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the\r\nprocedural defect. Id. at 67, 723 S.E.2d at 221.\r\n\r\n       In contrast, the dissent found the plain language of section 1447(c) requires\r\nthat a certified copy of the remand order be mailed before the state court is re-\r\nvested with jurisdiction. Id. at 81, 723 S.E.2d at 228. Because a certified copy of\r\nthe remand order was never mailed to the state court clerk, the dissent concluded\r\nthe state court had no power to proceed. Id. The dissent explained that \"[b]ecause\r\nthe state court acted when federal law prohibited it from doing so, the resulting\r\njudgment was void.\" Id. Accordingly, the dissent found the trial court's failure to\r\ngrant relief from the judgment was error and warranted reversal. Id.\r\n\r\n        In reaching its ultimate conclusion, the dissent rejected the majority's\r\nreliance on Lowe. Id. at 82, 723 S.E.2d at 228-29. The dissent found Lowe\r\ndistinguishable from the instant case as the Fourth Circuit considered the point in\r\ntime when the federal court's decision to remand becomes unreviewable. Id. at 83-\r\n84, 723 S.E.2d at 229. The dissent further contended that whether the mailing\r\nrequirement was procedural or jurisdictional was irrelevant because the prohibition\r\ncontained in section 1447(c), which provides that a state court cannot proceed until\r\na certified copy of the remand order is mailed to it, cannot be avoided by labeling\r\nthe mailing requirement procedural. Id. at 84, 723 S.E.2d at 230. Additionally,\r\nthe dissent believed the majority incorrectly relied on the Fourth Circuit's decision\r\nin Bryan because the remand order in that case was not based on lack of subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction and, thus, was governed by another clause of section 1447(c).\r\nId. at 86-87, 723 S.E.2d at 231.\r\n\n       Although the dissent acknowledged that a plain reading of section 1447(c)\r\ncreates a brief period of time in which neither the federal court nor the state court\r\nhas the power to act, i.e., a \"jurisdictional hiatus,\" it concluded that a certified copy\r\nof a remand order based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be mailed to\r\nthe state court before the state court can proceed. Id. at 88, 723 S.E.2d at 232.\r\n\r\n       Undoubtedly, there is support for both positions espoused by the Court of\r\nAppeals as the federal and state courts are divided on the jurisdictional\r\nimplications of section 1447(c).6 See 14C Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller,\r\nEdward H. Cooper & Joan E. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3739\r\n(4th ed. 2013) (discussing section 1447(c) and outlining state and federal court\r\ndecisions applying this provision). Thus, we are now confronted with definitively\r\n\r\n\r\n6  In addition to Lowe, a few federal and state courts have held that jurisdiction\r\ntransfers back to the state court upon entry of the order of remand. See, e.g.,\r\nWhiddon Farms, Inc. v. Delta & Pine Land Co., 103 F. Supp. 2d 1310 (S.D. Ala.\r\n2000); Van Ryn v. Korean Air Lines, 640 F. Supp. 284 (C.D. Cal. 1985); Health for\r\nLife Brands, Inc. v. Powley, 57 P.3d 726 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002); Citizens Bank &\r\nTrust Co. v. Carr, 583 So. 2d 864 (La. Ct. App. 1991); State ex rel. Vill. of Los\r\nRanchos de Albuquerque v. City of Albuqurque, 889 P.2d 204 (N.M. Ct. App.\r\n1993), aff'd, 889 P.2d 185 (N.M. 1994); Int'l Lottery, Inc. v. Kerouac, 657 N.E.2d\r\n820 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995).\r\n\r\n   However, the majority of courts considering this issue have held that the federal\r\ncourt is not divested of jurisdiction until a certified copy of the remand order is\r\nmailed to the state court. See, e.g., Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Santiago Plaza, 598\r\nF.2d 634 (1st Cir. 1979); Trans Penn Wax Corp. v. McCandless, 50 F.3d 217 (3d\r\nCir. 1995); Browning v.

The word \"jurisdiction\" does not in every context connote subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction, but rather, is \"a word of many, too many, meanings.\" Rockwell\r\nInt'l Corp. v. U.S., 549 U.S. 457, 467 (2007) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\r\nBetter Env't, 523 U.S. 83 (1998)).\r\n\r\n       Jurisdiction is generally defined as \"the authority to decide a given case one\r\nway or the other. Without jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all in any cause;\r\njurisdiction is the power to declare law, and when it ceases to exist, the only\r\nfunction remaining to a court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the\r\ncause.\" 32A Am. Jur. 2d Federal Courts § 581 (2007) (footnotes omitted).\r\nSpecifically, \"[j]urisdiction is composed of three elements: (1) personal\r\njurisdiction; (2) subject matter jurisdiction; and (3) the court's power to render the\r\nparticular judgment requested.\" Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 1 of Okla. County v. Scott,\r\n15 P.3d 1244, 1248 (Okla. Civ. App. 2000).\r\n\r\n       \"Although federal and state courts form one system of jurisprudence, federal\r\ncourts have no general supervisory power over the state courts, and there is nothing\r\na state court can do to affect federal practice and procedure.\" 21 C.J.S. Courts §\r\n274 (Supp. 2013). The United States Supreme Court (\"USSC\") has explained that\r\n\"the courts of the two jurisdictions are not foreign to each other, nor to be treated\r\nby each other as such, but as courts of the same country, having jurisdiction partly\r\ndifferent and partly concurrent.\" Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729, 735 (2009)\r\n(quoting Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S. 130, 136-37 (1876)).\r\n\r\n       A case filed in state court may be removed to federal court only when the\r\ncase originally could have been filed in federal court. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1441(a)\r\n(West 2013) (authorizing a defendant to remove \"any civil action brought in a State\r\ncourt of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\");\r\nCaterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987) (\"Only state-court actions\r\nthat originally could have been filed in federal court may be removed to federal\r\ncourt by the defendant.\").\r\n\r\n      A federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over primarily two types of\r\ncases: (1) those involving \"federal question jurisdiction,\" which \"aris[e] under the\r\nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\"; and (2) those involving\r\n\"diversity jurisdiction,\" which include parties who are residents of different states\r\n\nand the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 1331, 1332 (West\r\n2013).Removal proceedings impact the jurisdiction of the state court in that\r\nremoval of a state case to federal court \"divests\" the state court of jurisdiction. See\r\nMichael J. Kaplan, Annotation, Effect, on Jurisdiction of State Court, of 28\r\nU.S.C.A. § 1446(e), Relating to Removal of Civil Case to Federal Court, 38 A.L.R.\r\nFed. 824 (1978 & Supp. 2013) (analyzing jurisdictional and procedural\r\nimplications of removal of state court case to federal court).\r\n\r\n       Although most cases speak in terms of \"divesting\" the state court of\r\njurisdiction during removal proceedings, we believe the more accurate terminology\r\nis a \"suspension\" of the state court's jurisdiction. Here, the circuit court had\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the defamation claims and acquired personal\r\njurisdiction over the parties upon the filing and service of their pleadings. See\r\nSkinner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 93, 668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008)\r\n(\"Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the\r\ngeneral class to which the proceedings in question belong.\" (citations omitted));\r\nBrown v. Evatt, 322 S.C. 189, 470 S.E.2d 848 (1996) (citing Rule 3(a), SCRCP,\r\nand recognizing that circuit court acquires personal jurisdiction over the parties\r\nonce the action is commenced by the filing and service of the summons and\r\ncomplaint); Boan v. Jacobs, 296 S.C. 419, 421, 373 S.E.2d 697, 698 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (\"The concept of jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court over a\r\nparticular person (personal jurisdiction) or the authority of a court to entertain a\r\nparticular action (subject matter jurisdiction).\").\r\n\r\n       Neither of these jurisdictional elements was affected by Hulsey's motion to\r\nremove the case to federal court.7 Instead, the remaining element, i.e., the state\r\ncourt's power to render the particular judgment requested, was suspended or held in\r\nabeyance until a determination was made as to whether the cases involved a federal\r\nquestion more appropriately decided by the federal court. See Sioux Honey Ass'n\r\nv. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 672 F.3d 1041, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\" 'Power' refers to\r\nthe court's ability, when it has subject matter jurisdiction, to grant equitable and\r\nlegal relief to a party.\").\r\n\r\n     Because removal proceedings encroach upon a state court's jurisdiction,\r\nremoval statutes must be strictly construed and any doubts are to be resolved in\r\n\r\n7 Indeed, if a state court was divested of personal jurisdiction and subject matter\r\njurisdiction following removal proceedings, the parties would have to re-file a\r\nlawsuit each time a federal court issued an order remanding the case to state court.\r\n\nfavor of state court jurisdiction and remand. Brierly v. Alusuisse Flexible\r\nPackaging, Inc., 184 F.3d 527, 534 (6th Cir. 1999); Gaus v. Miles, Inc., 980 F.2d\r\n564, 566 (9th Cir. 1992). The USSC has explained:\r\n\r\n      The removal statute[,] which is nationwide in its operation, was\r\n      intended to be uniform in its application, unaffected by local law\r\n      definition or characterization of the subject matter to which it is to be\r\n      applied. Hence the Act of Congress must be construed as setting up\r\n      its own criteria, irrespective of local law, for determining in what\r\n      instances suits are to be removed from the state to the federal courts.\r\n\r\nShamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100, 104 (1941). Furthermore, as\r\nthe rules of statutory construction dictate, it is also necessary for courts to\r\nconsider the legislative history in order to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\r\nSee Kennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 348, 549 S.E.2d 243, 247 (2001)\r\n(stating that where \"the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to\r\nlegislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the\r\nborders of the act itself\").\r\n\r\n      Applying these rules, the California Court of Appeal explained:\r\n\r\n             Before 1948, the statute governing remand stated in relevant\r\n      part, \"Whenever any cause shall be removed from any State court into\r\n      any district court of the United States, and the district court shall\r\n      decide that the cause was improperly removed, and order the same to\r\n      be remanded to the State court from whence it came, such remand\r\n      shall be immediately carried into execution, and no appeal . . . from\r\n      the decision of the district court so remanding such cause shall be\r\n      allowed.\" (Judicial Code § 28 (1911), italics added; see also 28 U.S.C.\r\n      § 71 (1940).) In 1948, Congress revised title 28 of the United States\r\n      Code, and placed the procedures governing remand in section 1447.\r\n      In doing so, Congress deleted the former provision stating that the\r\n      \"remand shall be immediately carried into execution,\" replacing it\r\n      with a command that the district court clerk mail a certified copy of\r\n      the remand order to the state court clerk, and providing that \"[t]he\r\n      state court may thereupon proceed with [the] case.\" (§ 1447, as\r\n      enacted June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 939.) Although some\r\n      courts—including the Ninth Circuit—had interpreted even the former\r\n      provision as requiring a certified copy of the remand order to be filed\r\n      with the clerk of the state court before jurisdiction was transferred\r\n\n      (see, e.g., Bucy v. Nevada Const. Co. (9th Cir. 1942) 125 F.2d 213,\r\n      217), the new statutory language makes that requirement explicit.\r\n\r\nSpanair S.A. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 172 Cal. App. 4th 348, 357 (Cal. Ct.\r\nApp. 2009). Although the California Court of Appeal recognized its interpretation\r\nappeared to elevate \"form over substance,\" it emphasized \"the history and plain\r\nlanguage of section 1447(c), leave no doubt that Congress made the mailing of a\r\ncertified copy of the remand order the 'determinable jurisdictional event after\r\nwhich the state court can exercise control over the case without fear of further\r\nfederal interference.' \" Id. (quoting Trans Penn Wax Corp. v. McCandless, 50 F.3d\r\n217, 225 (3d Cir. 1995)). Despite legitimate concerns over the wisdom of this\r\nrule, the court declined to \"second-guess Congress by rewriting the statute.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       As evidenced by the language in Spanair, Congress purposefully included\r\nthe mailing of a certified order as a jurisdictional requirement and, thus, the mere\r\nentry of an order is not self-executing as to the jurisdiction of the state court. See\r\nArnold v. Garlock, Inc., 278 F.3d 426, 437-38 (5th Cir. 2001) (\"A § 1447(c) order\r\nof remand is not self-executing . . . This provision creates legal significance in the\r\nmailing of a certified copy of the remand order in terms of determining the time at\r\nwhich the district court is divested of jurisdiction. On that basis, the federal court\r\nis not divested of jurisdiction until the remand order, citing the proper basis under\r\n§ 1447(c), is certified and mailed by the clerk of the district court.\" (emphasis\r\nadded) (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n     We believe the reasoning for this inclusion is sound. As explained by the\r\nMissouri Court of Appeals:\r\n\r\n      Requiring the state to wait to proceed with the case until after a\r\n      certified remand order has been sent ensures that the federal court has\r\n      indeed ceased to exercise jurisdiction over the merits of the case.\r\n      Under the case law of most circuits, federal courts have the power to\r\n      review, alter, or reverse an erroneous order of remand during the short\r\n      period between the signing of a remand order and the certification and\r\n      mailing to the state court. Thus, a rule making clear that jurisdiction\r\n      to proceed does not immediately revert back to the state court upon\r\n      the signing of the order allows a civil defendant to retain the right to\r\n      assert that the order of remand was improvidently entered. Because\r\n      remands are not appealable, 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), it makes sense to\r\n      allow the federal district court an opportunity to correct any error or\r\n      misunderstanding before the remand order is final. A clear rule\r\n      avoids confusing litigants about where jurisdiction may lie when one\r\n\n      of the parties is attempting to obtain an order setting aside of the order\r\n      of remand.\r\n\r\nState ex rel. Nixon v. Moore, 108 S.W.3d 813, 818 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003) (citation\r\nomitted). Furthermore, we do not believe the fear of a brief jurisdictional hiatus\r\nbetween the federal and state court should dictate a result that is clearly contrary to\r\nthe plain terms of the statute.\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Judge Young and, in turn, the\r\nCourt of Appeals erred in finding the state court had jurisdiction to conduct the\r\nproceedings as the absence of the certified order precluded jurisdiction from\r\nresuming in the state court. Although this Court often defers to Fourth Circuit\r\ndecisions interpreting federal law, which in the instant case would be Lowe, it is\r\nnot obligated to do so in view of the lack of uniformity amongst the federal\r\ncircuits. See State Bank of Cherry v. CGB Enters., 984 N.E.2d 449, 459 (Ill. 2013)\r\n(\"While we are bound only by the United States Supreme Court, if the lower\r\nfederal courts are uniform on their interpretation of a federal statute, this court, in\r\nthe interest of preserving unity, will give considerable weight to those courts'\r\ninterpretations of federal law and find them to be highly persuasive. However, if\r\nthe federal courts are split, we may elect to follow those decisions we believe to be\r\nbetter reasoned.\" (citation omitted)); Cash Distrib. Co., v. Neely, 947 So. 2d 286,\r\n294-95 (Miss. 2007) (declining to follow Fifth Circuit's minority position and\r\nstating, \"While this Court often defers to Fifth Circuit decisions interpreting federal\r\nlaw, we are under no obligation to do so\").\r\n\r\n       Admittedly, this conclusion appears to elevate form over substance and, in\r\nturn, may be viewed as harsh considering the significant verdicts. However, we\r\nbelieve it is legally correct and consistent with this Court's position on other\r\njurisdictional issues, such as the effect of the issuance of a remittitur. See Rule\r\n221(b), SCACR (\"The remittitur shall contain a copy of the judgment of the\r\nappellate court, shall be sealed with the seal and signed by the clerk of the court,\r\nand unless otherwise ordered by the court shall not be sent to the lower court or\r\nadministrative tribunal until fifteen (15) days have elapsed (the day of filing being\r\nexcluded) since the filing of the opinion, order, judgment, or decree of the court\r\nfinally disposing of the appeal.\" (emphasis added)); Wise v. S.C. Dep't of Corrs.,\r\n372 S.C. 173, 174, 642 S.E.2d 551, 551 (2007) (\"When the remittitur has been\r\nproperly sent, the appellate court no longer has jurisdiction over the matter and no\r\nmotion can be heard thereafter.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n     Because the absence of a certified order precluded jurisdiction from\r\nresuming in the state court, we hold the state court proceedings conducted after the\r\n\nfederal court's entry of the remand order are void. As a result, we reverse the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals, vacate both judgments, and remand the cases to\r\nrecommence in the state court from the procedural point at which the Charleston\r\nCounty Clerk of Court received a certified copy of the federal court's remand\r\norder.8 See Davis v. Davis, 267 S.C. 508, 229 S.E.2d 847 (1976) (concluding that\r\nall orders issued by state court after proceeding was removed to federal court were\r\nvoid); Peoples Trust & Sav. Bank v. Humphrey, 451 N.E.2d 1104 (Ind. Ct. App.\r\n1983) (noting that, during the pendency of the removal petition, any proceedings\r\nby the state trial court are void until remand by the federal court); 77 C.J.S.\r\nRemoval of Cases § 154 (Supp. 2013) (\"Proceedings in the state court after the\r\nrequirements for removal are met are not merely erroneous, but null and void. No\r\nsubsequent pleadings can be filed in the state court.\" (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\r\n       Although this ruling would be dispositive of both appeals, we believe the\r\nbench and bar would benefit from a definitive ruling on certain remaining issues.\r\nSpecifically, we address: (1) the computation of time for filing responsive\r\npleadings following the state court's receipt of a certified remand order; and (2) the\r\nlevel to which a defendant may participate in a post-default damages hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.      Time for Filing an Answer Following a Properly Filed Remand Order\r\n\r\n      Here, Father and Son served their Complaints on Hulsey's law firm on April\r\n20, 2006, and on Hulsey individually on April 21, 2006. On May 5, 2006, Hulsey\r\nremoved the case to federal court. The remand order was dated July 19, 2006, and\r\nHulsey's counsel was given electronic notice of the remand order on July 20, 2006.\r\nThe Charleston County Clerk of Court filed the uncertified copy of the remand\r\norder on July 21, 2006, and mailed notice of the filing on July 27, 2006, pursuant\r\nto Rule 77, SCRCP.9 Father's and Son's motions for entry of default, which were\r\n\r\n8 On March 5, 2009, the Charleston County Clerk of Court received the certified\r\nremand order from the federal district court. Hulsey filed and served his Answer\r\non March 13, 2009.\r\n9    Rule 77(d), SCRCP, provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n        Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall\r\n        serve a notice of the entry by first class mail upon every party affected\r\n\ndated August 9, 2006, were filed on August 21, 2006, and Hulsey was found in\r\ndefault that same day. The entry of default was filed on August 22, 2006.\r\n\r\n       On August 29, 2006, Hulsey filed an Answer and moved to set aside the\r\nentry of default. During the hearing before Judge Pieper, Hulsey stated that he\r\nbelieved he had thirty days from service of notice of the remand order from the\r\nCharleston County Clerk of Court to file an Answer to the Complaint in state court.\r\nBecause the state court noticed him of the remand order, he believed he had an\r\nadditional five days to Answer. Based on these beliefs, Hulsey claimed his\r\nAnswer was timely made as it was not due until August 31, 2006. Additionally,\r\nHulsey asserted he had a meritorious defense to the action and that the Limehouses\r\nwould suffer no prejudice if the entry of default was set aside.\r\n\r\n       Judge Pieper denied Hulsey's motion to set aside the entry of default. In so\r\nruling, Judge Pieper analyzed the threshold question of when the \"30 day time\r\nperiod for the defendants to file an answer began to run and what effect the\r\nremoval of the case and its subsequent remand had on that time period.\" Noting\r\nthat this issue was a matter of first impression in this state, Judge Pieper ruled that\r\nany unexpired portion of the thirty-day time period to answer was tolled during the\r\ntime the case was removed to federal court. Therefore, Hulsey had until August 5,\r\n2006,10 to file an Answer to the Complaint. Judge Pieper found it unnecessary to\r\ndecide whether Hulsey was entitled to five additional days for mailing pursuant to\r\nRule 6(e), SCRCP because Hulsey's Answer was filed twenty-four days outside of\r\nthe tolled time frame. Accordingly, Judge Pieper found the entry of default was\r\nproper.11 He further ruled that \"there was no good reason presented by the\r\n\r\n      thereby who is not in default for failure to appear, and shall make a\r\n      note in the case file or docket sheet of the mailing. Such mailing shall\r\n      not be necessary to parties who have already received notice. Such\r\n      mailing is sufficient notice for all purposes for which notice of the\r\n      entry of an order or judgment is required by these rules; but any party\r\n      may in addition serve a notice of entry on any other party in the\r\n      manner provided in Rule 5 for the service of such papers.\r\n10 Because Hulsey removed the case fourteen days after he was served, Judge\r\nPieper found Hulsey had sixteen days following the remand order to file his\r\nAnswer.\r\n11In support of his method of time computation, Judge Pieper relied on Cotton v.\r\nFederal Land Bank of Columbia, 269 S.E.2d 422 (Ga. 1980), and Dauenhauer v.\r\n\ndefendants for their failure to file a timely answer other than attorney confusion\r\nabout the deadline for when an answer was due.\" Judge Pieper found \"no\r\nreasonable basis for defense counsel's assumption that the 30 day time to file\r\nanswer starts completely anew upon remand from the federal court.\" Thus, Judge\r\nPieper declined to set aside the entry of default.\r\n\r\n       The majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Pieper's decision,\r\nfinding there was no authority in this state to support Hulsey's position that a\r\nremoving party is entitled to a fresh thirty days to answer a Complaint upon\r\nremand. Limehouse, 397 S.C. at 68-69, 723 S.E.2d at 221-22. After reviewing\r\nstate and federal rules of procedure,12 the majority declined to adopt a new rule that\r\nextended the time for filing beyond the thirty-day limit. Id. at 69, 723 S.E.2d at\r\n222.   Although there is authority from other jurisdictions to support Hulsey's\r\nclaim that the time for filing began anew after the case was properly remanded to\r\nstate court,13 we agree with the Court of Appeals and decline to adopt such a rule.\r\n\r\n       As previously discussed, once the case was removed to federal court, the\r\nstate court's jurisdiction was suspended or held in abeyance until the case was\r\nproperly remanded. When the state court resumed jurisdiction, it had a duty \"to\r\n\r\nSuperior Court In and For Sonoma County, 307 P.2d 724 (Cal. Ct. App. 1957),\r\nwherein the appellate courts tolled the time for filing during removal.\r\n12 The majority considered Rule 12(a), SCRCP (stating, \"A defendant shall serve\r\nhis answer within 30 days after the service of the complaint upon him\"), and Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 81(c)(2) (providing a defendant twenty-one days to file an Answer after\r\na civil action is removed from a state court).\r\n13 See Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(3) (West 2013) (providing an adverse party with thirty\r\ndays from receipt of notice that the remand order was filed in state court to file an\r\nAnswer); Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.90 (West 2013) (providing thirty days from\r\nthe state court's receipt of the order of remand to file an Answer); Iowa Code Ann.\r\n§ 1.441(7) (West 2013) (providing that the time for pleadings shall begin anew\r\nafter a remand order is filed in the state court); N.C.

P. 237a (West 2013)\r\n(providing fifteen days to file an answer after notice that a remand order was filed\r\nin state court).\r\n\nproceed as though no removal had been attempted.\" State v. Columbia Ry., Gas &\r\nElec. Co., 112 S.C. 528, 537, 100 S.E. 355, 357 (1919). Thus, the time for filing\r\nan Answer was tolled until the state court resumed jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n       Notably, other jurisdictions have reached a similar conclusion. See Lucky\r\nFriday Silver-Lead Mines Co. v. Atlas Mining Co., 395 P.2d 477, 480 (Idaho 1964)\r\n(\"While the cause is before the Federal court, the state court has no jurisdiction or\r\nauthority to receive any pleadings in the cause nor can it issue any orders\r\nconcerning the cause. . . . Thus the period of time the cause is before the Federal\r\ncourt, cannot be considered in computing the time within which the appellant had\r\nto appear and plead to the cause.\"); Peoples Trust & Sav. Bank v. Humphrey, 451\r\nN.E.2d 1104, 1109 (Ind. Ct. App. 1983) (finding removal of action to federal court\r\ntolled ten-day time limit to apply for change of venue and stating that \"tolling the\r\ntime period eliminates uncertainty, preserves the status quo, and is easily applied\");\r\nJatczyszyn v. Marcal Paper Mills, Inc., 27 A.3d 213 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.\r\n2011) (concluding that discovery period established by state court rules is tolled\r\nduring the time a motion to remand is pending before the federal court); see also\r\nGen. Elec. Credit Corp. v. Smith, 484 So. 2d 75 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986) (holding\r\nthat time for filing appeal was tolled during period when case was removed to\r\nfederal court); Hartlein v.

Defaulting Defendant's Limited Participation in Damages Hearings\r\n\r\n       Hulsey contends Judge Young erred in imposing unduly restrictive\r\nlimitations on evidence presented at the damages hearings. In support of this\r\ncontention, Hulsey claims this Court's ruling in Howard v. Holiday, Inns, Inc., 271\r\nS.C. 238, 246 S.E.2d 880 (1978), which limits the defendant's ability to participate\r\nin the damages hearing, is no longer applicable as it pre-dates the 1985 adoption of\r\nRule 55. Specifically, Hulsey urges this Court to re-examine Howard in light of\r\nthe language of Rule 55(b)(2), which requires the trial court \"to establish the truth\r\nof any averment of evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter.\"14\r\n\r\n14 Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP, provides more fully that, in cases where default has\r\nbeen entered and the plaintiff's damages are not a sum certain, a trial judge may\r\nschedule a hearing on damages if it would \"enable the court to enter judgment or to\r\n\n       Prior to and throughout the damages hearings, Hulsey sought to call\r\nwitnesses and present evidence. In Son's case, Hulsey also sought to engage in\r\ndiscovery so that he could fully prepare for cross-examination. Based on Howard,\r\nJudge Young limited Hulsey's participation to cross-examination and objection to\r\nthe plaintiffs' evidence. The Court of Appeals agreed with Judge Young's ruling\r\nand specifically declined to \"diverge from longstanding rules established by\" this\r\nCourt. Limehouse, 397 S.C. at 72-73, 723 S.E.2d at 223-24.\r\n\r\n      This case presents an opportunity for this Court to re-examine our decision\r\nin Howard in conjunction with Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP. As will be more\r\nthoroughly discussed, we reaffirm our decision in Howard and the procedures\r\nadopted therein.\r\n\r\n       In 1978, under the former statutes governing default proceedings,15 this\r\nCourt issued its decision in Howard, wherein it assessed three approaches as to\r\nhow a defaulting defendant could contest the issue of damages. Howard, 271 S.C.\r\nat 241, 246 S.E.2d at 882. Specifically, this Court noted that it could allow\r\ndamages to be determined: (1) in an ex parte proceeding, denying the defendant\r\nany right to participate; (2) after a full adversary contest, including the right of the\r\ndefendant to produce evidence in rebuttal or in mitigation; or (3) with defense\r\ncounsel's participation limited to cross-examination and objection to plaintiff's\r\nevidence. Id. This Court found the third approach was the proper one and\r\napproved it for use in the courts of this state. Id.\r\n\r\n       For the past thirty-five years, our appellate courts have consistently adhered\r\nto the decision in Howard. See, e.g., Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., of Florence, 332\r\nS.C. 75, 504 S.E.2d 311 (1998); Solley v. Navy Fed. Credit Union, 397 S.C. 192,\r\n723 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. App. 2012). Although our courts have scrutinized default\r\njudgments involving punitive damages in order to prevent harsh results, we have\r\ndeclined to expand a defendant's participation in these hearings beyond what was\r\napproved of in Howard. See Lewis v. Congress of Racial Equality and/or\r\nC.O.R.E., Inc., 275 S.C. 556, 274 S.E.2d 287 (1981) (citing Howard and raising\r\nthe issue of the amount of damages ex mero motu where plaintiff obtained a default\r\n\r\n\r\ncarry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of \n\r\ndamages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an \n\r\ninvestigation of any other matter.\"\n\r\n15  S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-35-310 & -320 (1976) (repealed 1985). \n\r\n\njudgment for $150,000 in actual damages and $100,000 in punitive damages in an\r\nunliquidated claim and remanding to trial court for a de novo hearing on damages).\r\n\r\n       However, in an apparent reaction to juries awarding significant verdicts of\r\nactual and punitive damages, other jurisdictions have allowed defendants to call\r\nwitnesses and present evidence. See B. Finberg, Annotation, Defaulting\r\nDefendant's Right to Notice and Hearing as to Determination of Amount of\r\nDamages, 15 A.L.R.3d 586, § 5 (1967 & Supp. 2013) (identifying state cases\r\nwhere defaulting defendant had the right to cross-examine plaintiff's witnesses and\r\nto introduce affirmative testimony on his own behalf in mitigation of the damages);\r\n46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 299 (2006) (citing state cases where courts have\r\napproved varying levels of defendant's participation in post-default proceedings);\r\nPayne v. Dewitt, 995 P.2d 1088, 1094-95 (Okl. 1999) (recognizing defaulting\r\ndefendant's statutory right to cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence and\r\nstating, \"The trial court must leave to a meaningful inquiry the quantum of actual\r\nand punitive damages without stripping the party in default of basic forensic\r\ndevices to test the truth of the plaintiff's evidence\").16\r\n\r\n       Despite these concerns and the authority from other jurisdictions, we adhere\r\nto the procedures adopted in Howard. If our courts were to allow a defaulting\r\ndefendant to fully participate in a post-default hearing, we believe there would be\r\nno consequence of default. See Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., of Florence, 332 S.C.\r\n75, 81, 504 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1998) (\"It is well settled that by suffering a default,\r\nthe defaulting party is deemed to have admitted the truth of the plaintiff's\r\n\r\n16 In reaching this conclusion, the court in Payne relied on the following\r\nauthorities: J&P Constr. Co. v. Valta Constr. Co., 452 So. 2d 857 (Ala. 1984);\r\nDungan v. Superior Court In and For Pinal County, 512 P.2d 52 (Ariz. Ct. App.\r\n1973); Kohlenberger, Inc. v. Tyson's Foods, Inc., 510 S.W.2d 555 (Ark. 1974);\r\nPittman v. Colbert, 47 S.E. 948 (Ga. 1904); Stewart v. Hicks, 395 N.E.2d 308 (Ind.\r\nCt. App. 1979); Greer v. Ludwick, 241 N.E.2d 4 (Ill. App. Ct. 1968); Howard v.\r\nFountain, 749 S.W.2d 690 (Ky. Ct. App. 1988); Bissanti Design/Build Group v.\r\nMcClay, 590 N.E.2d 1169 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992); Lindsey v. Drs. Keenan,\r\nAndrews & Allred, 165 P.2d 804 (Mont. 1946); Gallegos v. Franklin, 547 P.2d\r\n1160 (N.M. Ct. App. 1976); Napolitano v. Branks, 513 N.Y.S.2d 185 (N.Y. App.\r\nDiv. 1987); Bashforth v. Zampini, 576 A.2d 1197 (R.I. 1990); Adkisson v.\r\nHuffman, 469 S.W.2d 368 (Tenn. 1971); Ne. Wholesale Lumber, Inc., v. Leader\r\nLumber, Inc., 785 S.W.2d 402 (Tex. Ct. App. 1989); Synergetics By and Through\r\nLancer Indus., Inc. v. Marathon Ranching Co., 701 P.2d 1106 (Utah 1985);\r\nMidwest Developers v. Goma Corp., 360 N.W.2d 554 (Wis. Ct. App. 1984).\r\n\nallegations and to have conceded liability.\"). Furthermore, unlike Hulsey, we\r\ndiscern no basis in the language of Rule 55(b)(2) that would require us to depart\r\nfrom Howard.\r\n\r\n        Finally, we note there are due process safeguards for cases involving\r\npunitive damages. It is well established that the relief granted in a default\r\njudgment is limited to that supported by the allegations in the Complaint and the\r\nproof submitted at the damages hearing. Jackson v. Midlands Human Res. Ctr.,\r\n296 S.C. 526, 529, 374 S.E.2d 505, 506 (Ct. App. 1988) (\"In a default case, the\r\nplaintiff must prove by competent evidence the amount of his damages, and such\r\nproof must be by a preponderance of the evidence. Although the defendant is in\r\ndefault as to liability, the award of damages must be in keeping not only with the\r\nallegations of the complaint and the prayer for relief, but also with the proof that\r\nhas been submitted. A judgment for money damages must be warranted by the\r\nproof of the party in whose favor it is rendered.\" (citations omitted)). Moreover,\r\ntrial judges and appellate courts conduct a review of the award to ensure the\r\nverdict is not excessive and is supported by the evidence. See Mitchell v. Fortis\r\nIns. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 686 S.E.2d 176 (2009) (discussing the history of due\r\nprocess limitations on punitive damages awards and identifying guideposts for\r\npost-judgment review of punitive damages awards).\r\n\r\n       Having found that Howard still governs post-default proceedings, we hold\r\nthat Judge Young correctly precluded Hulsey from engaging in discovery and\r\nlimited his participation to cross-examination and objection to the plaintiff's\r\nevidence.                        III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold the lack of a certified remand order\r\nprecluded jurisdiction from resuming in the state court. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals and vacate the state court proceedings. We\r\nremand the cases to recommence from the procedural point at which the\r\nCharleston County Clerk of Court received the federal court's certified remand\r\norder. Additionally, we find the time for filing responsive pleadings was tolled\r\nduring the removal proceedings as no subsequent pleadings could be filed in state\r\ncourt until jurisdiction resumed. Finally, we reaffirm our decision in Howard\r\nwherein we limited a defendant's participation in a post-default hearing to cross-\r\nexamination and objection to the plaintiff's evidence as we find this effectuates the\r\npurpose of default proceedings and is consistent with Rule 55(b)(2).\r\n\r\n      REVERSED, VACATED, AND REMANDED.\r\n\n    TOAL, C.J., HEARN, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
