Mitchell Brown, Zoe S. Nettles, and Elizabeth H. Campbell, all of Nelson, \r\n  Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nW. Jefferson Leath, Jr. and Timothy W. Bouch, both of Leath, Bouch &amp; Crawford, \r\n  LLP, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:  This is an unusual informed \r\n  consent case.  The jury returned verdicts against appellant Trident Medical \r\n  Center (Hospital), finding doctors were the Hospitalâ€™s actual agents for purposes \r\n  of obtaining informed consent.  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent Vivian Newell \r\n  (Vivian) sought medical care from Dr. Thomas for gall bladder problems.  Dr. \r\n  Thomas recommended surgery and Vivian agreed.  The surgery took place at Hospital, \r\n  where Dr. Thomas held staff privileges.  At the time of Vivianâ€™s surgery, one \r\n  of Dr. Thomasâ€™ partners (Dr. Litton) in the practice known as Tri-County Surgical \r\n  Associates was Chief of Staff at Hospital.  \r\nDuring Vivianâ€™s laparoscopic \r\n  gall bladder removal surgery, Dr. Thomas severed Vivianâ€™s common bile duct rather \r\n  than the cystic duct, leading to numerous medical complications.  Vivian and \r\n  her husband, respondent William Newell (Husband), sued Dr. Thomas, Tri-County \r\n  Surgical Associates, and Hospital for battery, negligence, and loss of consortium.   \r\n  Vivian and Husband settled all their claims against Dr. Thomas and Tri-County.  \r\n  The jury trial against Hospital resulted in a verdict for Vivian of $3,500,000 \r\n  actual damages and $7,000,000 punitive damages, and $100,000 for Husband on \r\n  his consortium claim.  The trial judge set-off these verdicts based on the prior \r\n  settlements.\r\nAs noted at the outset, \r\n  this case was tried on an informed consent theory.  Vivian contended that Dr. \r\n  Thomas inadequately explained the surgical risk of severing the common bile \r\n  duct during laparoscopic gall bladder surgery, and failed to inform her that \r\n  he would be undergoing elective coronary triple bypass surgery three days after \r\n  operating on her.  Vivian alleged that Dr. Thomas was the Hospitalâ€™s agent for \r\n  the purposes of obtaining informed consent and that his failure to do so is \r\n  attributable to the Hospital.  Vivian also contends that since Dr. Thomasâ€™ partner, \r\n  Dr. Litton, was Hospitalâ€™s Chief of Staff at the time of her surgery, that position \r\n  combined with his personal knowledge of Dr. Thomasâ€™ impending heart surgery \r\n  gave rise to a separate duty on the part of Hospital to inform Vivian of that \r\n  operation.\r\nISSUE\r\nWas there any evidence that \r\n  either Dr. Thomas or Dr. Litton was Hospitalâ€™s agent for purposes of obtaining \r\n  Vivianâ€™s informed consent?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe dispositive issue in \r\n  this case is whether the trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict for \r\n  Hospital because neither doctor was the Hospitalâ€™s agent for purposes of obtaining \r\n  Vivianâ€™s informed consent.  We find that the Hospital was entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict, and reverse.         \r\nThe Hospitalâ€™s â€œMedical \r\n  Staff Bylawsâ€ (Bylaws) define â€œMedical Staffâ€ as â€œthe single organized Medical \r\n  Staff which includes all duly licensed Physicians and dentists who have been \r\n  granted Privilegesâ€¦.The Staff is an integral part of the Health System and is \r\n  not a separate legal entity.â€  The Bylawsâ€™ preamble states in part â€œthe Medical \r\n  Staff must cooperate with and is subject to the ultimate authority of the Board \r\n  of Directors.â€  \r\nVivian introduced \r\n  into evidence a document created by Hospital entitled â€œFundamentals of Consent.â€  \r\n  In part, this document provides:\r\n\r\nINFORMED CONSENT\r\nIt is the duty of the physician \r\n  or surgeon to inform the patient of the nature of the illness, the proposed \r\n  treatment, the risks and chances involved in the proposed treatment, the alternative \r\n  treatments, if any, and the risk of failure in the alternative procedure.  The \r\n  patient must have a true understanding of the procedure and its seriousness.  \r\n  Though there is a duty to inform, there likewise is a duty not to inform which \r\n  is a matter of judgment to be exercised in each particular situation.\r\nIt is not the responsibility \r\n  of hospital personnel to undertake to inform the patient.  This remains the \r\n  responsibility of the attending physician or surgeon.  However, when it is apparent \r\n  to the hospital personnel that the patient has not been informed, it should \r\n  be immediately brought to the physicianâ€™s attention.  Some hospitals in concert \r\n  with the surgeon may wish to document â€œinformed consentâ€ through a form signed \r\n  by the patient and the physician.\r\n\r\nThe Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  â€œMedical Staff Rules &amp; Regulationsâ€ (Rules &amp; Regs) were also introduced \r\n  into evidence.  The Rules &amp; Regs include this provision:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Practitioners \r\n  shall be responsible for obtaining informed consent prior to treatment.  When \r\n  an adult patient is able to appreciate the nature and implications of his condition \r\n  and the proposed health care and is able to communicate his decisions in an \r\n  unambiguous manner, the Physician shall obtain informed consent from the patient \r\n  prior to treatment.  When an adult patient is unable to consent, the Physician \r\n  shall follow the provisions of the South Carolina Adult Health Care Consent \r\n  Act, S.C. Code 44-66-10 et. [sic] seq. to determine inability to consent, document \r\n  the inability to consent, and determine the individual who has priority to make \r\n  health care decisions for the patient.  If the adult patient is unable to consent, \r\n  the Physician must obtain informed consent from the individual with priority \r\n  to make health care decisions for the patient unless the situation falls within \r\n  an exemption as set forth in the Adult Health Care Consent Act.  The patient \r\n  or person with priority must be informed of 1) diagnosis; 2) general nature \r\n  of the contemplated procedure; 3) the material risks associated with the procedure; \r\n  4) probability of success if the procedure is carried out; 5) prognosis if the \r\n  procedure is not carried out; and 6) alternatives to the procedure.  If the \r\n  treatment requires a written consent form according to Health System policy, \r\n  both the patient, or person with priority, and the Practitioner shall sign the \r\n  consent form affirming that the Practitioner personally obtained informed consent \r\n  from the patient or person with priority prior to signing the form.  Space shall \r\n  be provided on the form for the Practitioner to document what was explained \r\n  to the patient or person with priority and that the patient or person with priority \r\n  understood and agreed to the proposed treatment.\r\n  \r\n\r\nVivian also introduced \r\n  a Hospital document titled â€˜Consent: Obtaining Signature of Patient on Form \r\n  Entitled â€œConsent to Operation, Anesthesia &amp; Other Medical Services.â€â€™  \r\n  This Nursing Protocol document provides:\r\n\r\nPURPOSE:\r\nTo establish the nursing \r\n  protocol in completing the hospital form.  It is a statement by the patient \r\n  and the physician that the procedure is authorized by the patient and that the \r\n  physician has PREVIOUSLY and INDEPENDENTLY obtained informed consent.\r\nPOLICY:\r\nSouth Carolina case law \r\n  concerning the doctrine of informed consent requires that a physician who performs \r\n  a diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedure has a duty to disclose the \r\n  following things to a patient who is of sound mind, in the absence of an emergency \r\n  that warrants immediate medical treatment:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      the diagnosis\r\n    \r\n      the general nature of the \r\n  contemplated procedure\r\n    \r\n      the material risks involved \r\n  in the procedure\r\n    \r\n      the probability of success \r\n  associated with the procedure\r\n    \r\n      the prognosis if the procedure \r\n  is not carried out\r\n    \r\n      the existence of any alternatives \r\n  to the procedure\r\n  \r\nTo inform a patient of the \r\n  above information requires the unique knowledge of a physician.  Therefore, \r\n  the hospital and its employees shall not under any circumstances participate \r\n  in the process of the physician obtaining informed consent from the patient.\r\nThe hospital form entitled \r\n  â€œConsent to Operation, Anesthesia and Other Medical Servicesâ€  [1]  does not constitute informed \r\n  consent and is not intended as a part of informed consent.\r\nA signed hospital form is \r\n  a statement to the hospital by the patient and the surgeon who has obtained \r\n  informed consent that:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      the surgical procedure is \r\n  authorized by the patient\r\n    \r\n      the physician has previously \r\n  obtained informed consent\r\n    \r\n      the patient acknowledges \r\n  and authorizes that if unforeseen conditions arise, additional or different \r\n  procedures or services may be utilized\r\n    \r\n      anesthetics may be utilized\r\n    \r\n      the patient consents to \r\n  disposal of bodily tissues\r\n    \r\n      the patient understands \r\n  the form\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis Nursing Protocol goes \r\n  on to explain the Hospitalâ€™s internal use of these â€˜consent forms.â€™\r\nFinally, Vivian \r\n  introduced her signed copy of the â€œConsent to Operation, Anesthesia and Other \r\n  Medical Services Formâ€ (Surgical Consent Form), promulgated by Hospital, which \r\n  is the subject of the foregoing Nursing Protocol.  This Surgical Consent Form \r\n  is reproduced below:\r\n\r\n Date:          ___________________\r\n Time:          ___________________\r\n\r\nI authorize the performance \r\n

She argues \r\n  first that the Medical Staff is defined as a part of the Hospital.  #6 Bylaws.  \r\n  The Medical Staff is subject to Hospitalâ€™s Board of Trustees, Bylaws Preamble, \r\n  and are required to abide by the Medical Staff Rules &amp; Regs.  Â§ 33(10) Bylaws.  \r\n  The Rules &amp; Regs require the practitioners to obtain informed consent.  \r\n  Â¶ 20 Rules &amp; Regs.  According to Vivian, since the Hospitalâ€™s Rules &amp; \r\n  Regs require the Medical Staff to obtain informed consent, and since the Staff \r\n  is a part of the Hospital, they act as the Hospitalâ€™s agents when obtaining \r\n  this consent.  In support of these contentions, Vivian relies heavily on what \r\n  she alleges are inconsistencies and imperfections in the Surgical Consent Form \r\n  which she refers to, inaccurately, as the â€œInformed Consent Form.â€\r\nâ€œThe test to determine \r\n  agency is whether or not the purported principal has the right to control \r\n  the conduct of the alleged agent.â€  Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, \r\n  293 S.E.2d 424 (1982)(italics in original).  Reading the Bylaws, the Rules &amp; \r\n  Regs, the Nursing Protocol, and the Surgical Consent Form together leads to \r\n  the conclusion that, under the Hospitalâ€™s rules and in accord with South Carolina \r\n  law, obtaining informed consent is a matter solely for the attending physician, \r\n  to be done within the privacy and sanctity of the physician-patient relationship.  \r\n  See Hook v. Rothstein, 281 S.C. 541, 316 S.E.2d 690, certiorari \r\n  denied in order expressly approving Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, 283 \r\n  S.C. 64, 320 S.E.2d 35 (1984) (physician must obtain informed consent before \r\n  treatment).\r\nTo hold, as Vivian \r\n  urges, that Dr. Thomas was the Hospitalâ€™s agent for purposes of obtaining informed \r\n  consent would represent an enormous expansion of this Courtâ€™s existing hospital-physician \r\n  agency jurisprudence.  See Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  319 (2001) (hospital may owe duty to patient who chooses treatment at that facility \r\n  under Â§ 429 of the Restatement (second) of Torts) citing Simmons v. \r\n  Tuomey Reg. Med. Center, 341 S.C. 32, 533 S.E.2d 312 (2000) (hospital may \r\n  be liable for independent contractor doctorâ€™s negligence under ostensible agency \r\n  theory).  Further, Vivian cites no authority from another jurisdiction \r\n  that adopts her agency theory as a basis for holding a hospital liable, \r\n  nor has our independent research revealed any support.  Finally, while South \r\n  Carolina has not explicitly considered this type of agency claim, the reasoning \r\n  in Simmons and Osborne preclude a recovery under the actual \r\n  agency theory advanced by Vivian. \r\nIn Simmons, \r\n  this Court held that a hospital might be vicariously liable under an apparent \r\n  agency theory for the acts of its emergency room physicians, even though those \r\n  physicians are independent contractors.  In order to hold the hospital liable, \r\n  the injured person must demonstrate:\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hospital held itself out to the public by offering \r\n  to provide services;\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the injured person looked to the hospital rather \r\n  than to the individual physician for care; and\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a similarly situated person reasonably would have \r\n  believed the doctor treating the patient was a hospital employee.\r\n\r\nSimmons  at 52, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d at 323 (emphasis supplied).\r\nThe Simmons Court went on to emphasize:\r\n\r\nOur holding does not extend \r\n  to situations in which the patient is treated in an emergency room by the patientâ€™s \r\n  own physician after arranging to meet the physician there.  Nor does our \r\n  holding encompass situations in which a patient is admitted to a hospital by \r\n  a private, independent physician whose only connection to a particular hospital \r\n  is that he or she has staff privileges to admit patients to the hospital.  Such \r\n  patients could not reasonably believe his or her physician is a hospital employee.\r\nId.  at 52, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  at 323 (emphasis supplied.)\r\n\r\nIn Osborne, \r\n  the Court reversed a grant of summary judgment to the hospital, finding the \r\n  plaintiff had made a prima facie showing that the hospital could be liable \r\n  under an apparent agency theory for the negligence of the neonatologists practicing \r\n  there.  The Court noted the plaintiff presented evidence that the hospital had \r\n  marketed itself as having a specialized neonatal unit; that she had selected \r\n  the hospital, rather than the doctors practicing there, based on the hospitalâ€™s \r\n  representations; and that the hospitalâ€™s marketing efforts would lead a reasonable \r\n  person to believe that the physicians were employees of the hospitalâ€™s specialized \r\n  unit.  The Osborne decision cited from Simmons, emphasizing the \r\n  limitations of the apparent agency theory:\r\n\r\nThe [Simmons] decision \r\n  was limited, however, â€œto those situations in which a patient seeks services \r\n  at the hospital as an institution, and is treated by a physician who reasonably \r\n  appears to be a hospital employee.â€  [internal citation omitted]  The holding \r\n  did not â€œencompass situations in which a patient is admitted to a hospital by \r\n  a private, independent physician whose only connection to a particular hospital is that \r\n  he or she has staff privileges to admit patients to the hospital.â€  Id. \r\nOsborne  at 8, 550 \r\n  S.E.2d at 321.\r\n\r\nVivian concedes, as she must, that she cannot meet the Simmons/Osborne \r\n  apparent agency test and dismisses it as â€œsimply irrelevant.â€  Instead, she \r\n  argues that Hospitalâ€™s control of physicians holding staff privileges, as evidenced \r\n  by the documents recited above, establishes actual agency.  If Vivian is correct, \r\n  then hospitals are potentially more responsible for the acts of admitting \r\n  physicians than for the actions of physicians who are independent contactors \r\n  as in Osborne and Simmons. We find neither precedent nor public \r\n  policy support such a re-allocation of responsibility and liability between \r\n  hospitals and physicians with staff privileges.  We decline to adopt such a \r\n  rule, and emphasize that hospital liability for non-employee physician negligence \r\n  is limited to apparent agency situations.  Osborne, supra; Simmons, \r\n  supra.\r\nNo actual agency relationship regarding informed \r\n  consent existed between Hospital and Dr. Thomas by virtue of the Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  Bylaws, Rules &amp; Regs, Nursing Protocol, and/or Consent Form.  Further, the \r\n  fortuitous happenstance that Dr. Thomasâ€™s partner, Dr. Litton, was Chief of \r\n  the Medical Staff, and was aware of Dr. Thomasâ€™ upcoming elective coronary surgery, \r\n  does not give rise to any duty on the part of the Hospital to inform Vivian \r\n  of the planned surgery.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the judgments, finding no agency relationship \r\n  between the doctors and the Hospital.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    The text of the Consent Form is reproduced in \r\n    the opinion, infra.

John, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25816\r\nHeard March 4, 2004 - Filed May 3, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, \r\n  of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Senior Assistant Attorney General Charles \r\n  H. Richardson, all of Columbia; and John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Petitioner Corey Sparkman \r\n  (â€œSparkmanâ€) was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to twenty years in \r\n  prison.  He now seeks to reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling affirming the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s denial of his motion for mistrial.  Sparkman alleges that during \r\n  voir dire, the juryâ€™s foreman, Arthur Scott (â€œScottâ€), intentionally \r\n  concealed that he had been the victim of an assault and that this concealment \r\n  materially diminished Sparkmanâ€™s use of peremptory challenges and wrongfully \r\n  influenced the jury, resulting in his conviction.  We disagree and affirm Sparkmanâ€™s \r\n  conviction.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn March 31, 2001, at approximately 2:15 a.m., \r\n  two men entered a Days Inn in Myrtle Beach.  Christopher Newton (â€œNewtonâ€), \r\n  the assistant manager, was in the back office counting money when he heard the \r\n  men at the front desk. When the men requested a room, Newton told them that \r\n  none were available, so the men turned to leave. As Newton returned to the back \r\n  office, the men accosted him.  The taller of the two men drew a switchblade \r\n  and demanded money. He took money from the cash drawers and then demanded that \r\n  Newton open the safe.  After Newton told the men that he could not open the \r\n  safe, the taller man stabbed Newton twice in the shoulder.  Then, the shorter \r\n  man struck Newton in the head and knocked him unconscious.  When Newton regained \r\n  consciousness, he called the police. \r\nDuring questioning, the police asked Newton to \r\n  identify his attackers out of a photo line-up.  He identified Sparkman as one \r\n  of his attackersâ€”on two separate occasionsâ€”from two different photographs. \r\n  [1]          \r\nDuring voir dire, the trial judge asked \r\n  the venire members whether they had been a victim of a serious crime.  Scott \r\n  did not stand up.  The trial judge asked those who stood up whether being a \r\n  victim of a crime would affect their ability to be impartial during deliberation, \r\n  and they all replied that it would not. None of the people who stood up were \r\n  drawn for the jury.  However, Scott was drawn and named foreman.\r\nAfter deliberating for eight hours, the jury found \r\n  Sparkman guilty. [2]   Because the jury did not present \r\n  a verdict until the late evening, the trial judge postponed Sparkmanâ€™s sentencing \r\n  hearing until the following morning. \r\nSometime before the sentencing hearing, a member \r\n  of the jury, Regina Jenerette (â€œJeneretteâ€), contacted the public defenderâ€™s \r\n  office and told Sparkmanâ€™s attorney that a fellow juror might have decided to \r\n  convict Sparkman based upon â€œsomething that happened in [sic] him in the past.â€ \r\n  At the hearing, Jenerette testified that during jury deliberation, upon discussing \r\n  eyewitness credibility, Scott announced that forty years ago he had been the \r\n  victim of an attack and that he would never forget the face of his attacker. [3]    The trial judge questioned \r\n  Scott about the past incident, asking Scott why he did not stand up during voir \r\n  dire and inform the parties that he was a victim of a serious crime.  Scott \r\n  explained that he did not remember his attack until after deliberations began \r\n  and that he was unsure whether the attack was a â€œseriousâ€ crime.  \r\nThe trial judge then asked \r\n  every jury member whether Scottâ€™s recount of his attack affected their decision \r\n  to convict Sparkman, and they unanimously replied that it did not, including\r\nJenerette.&nbsp; \r\nSparkmanâ€™s counsel then made a motion for mistrial, \r\n  which was denied, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Sparkman submits the following \r\n  issue for review:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s denial of Sparkmanâ€™s motion for mistrial based upon juror misconduct?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nSparkman argues that this Court should overturn \r\n  his conviction because (1) Scott intentionally concealed that he was the victim \r\n  of a serious crime during voir dire; and (2) in telling the jury that \r\n  he would never forget his attacker, Scott unfairly heightened the credibility \r\n  of the victimâ€™s eyewitness testimony, which is the only evidence connecting \r\n  Sparkman to the crime.  Sparkman asserts that his trial counsel would have used \r\n  one of eight remaining peremptory strikes to strike Scott had counsel known \r\n  about Scottâ€™s attack, and consequently the trial judge erred in denying his \r\n  motion for a mistrial.  We disagree. \r\nA trial judgeâ€™s ruling on a motion will not be \r\n  disturbed absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.  State \r\n  v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E. 2d 626, 628 (2000).\r\nThis Court granted a criminal defendant a new trial \r\n  because a juror failed to provide the trial judge with an honest answer to a \r\n  question asked during voir dire.  State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 282 (2001).  In Woods, during voir dire, a juror failed \r\n  to inform the parties that she worked as a volunteer victimsâ€™ advocate in the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s office.  The Court developed a two-part test to determine whether \r\n  a jurorâ€™s failure to disclose a potential bias warranted granting the defendant \r\n  a new trial.  First, the court determines if â€œthe juror intentionally concealed \r\n  the information during voir dire,â€ and if the answer to the first inquiry \r\n  is yes, the court must then â€œdetermine if the information concealed would have \r\n  supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material factor in the \r\n  use of respondentâ€™s peremptory challenges.â€  Id. at 588-590, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  at 284-285 (citing State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 146, 502 S.E.2d 99, \r\n  106-107 (1998)).  \r\nIntentional or Unintentional Concealment\r\nWhether a jurorâ€™s failure to respond is intentional \r\n  is a fact intensive determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis. \r\n  Woods, 345 S.C. at 588, 550 S.E.2d at 284.  In Woods, this Court \r\n  distinguished intentional concealment from unintentional concealment:\r\n\r\nintentional concealment occurs when the question presented \r\n  to the jury on voir dire is reasonably comprehensible to the average \r\n  juror and the subject of the inquiry is of such significance that the jurorâ€™s \r\n  failure to respond is unreasonable.  Unintentional concealment, on the other \r\n  hand, occurs where the question posed is ambiguous or incomprehensible \r\n  to the average juror, or where the subject of the inquiry is insignificant \r\n  or so far removed in time that the jurorâ€™s failure to respond is reasonable \r\n  under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nId.  (emphasis added).\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that Scottâ€™s concealment \r\n  was unintentional.  State v. Sparkman, Op. No. 2003-UP-165 (Ct. App. \r\n  Filed February 27, 2003).  We agree that Scottâ€™s failure to recall his attack \r\n  was reasonable under the circumstances.         \r\nFirst, Scottâ€™s attack occurred approximately forty \r\n  years agoâ€”a lapse of time that we believe renders his failure to respond reasonable.  \r\n  Scott testified that he did not remember his attack until he began to discuss \r\n  whether he believed that Newtonâ€™s eyewitness testimony was credible.  In our \r\n  review, it is reasonable that Scott did not recall his attack until he began \r\n  to draw from his own experiences while considering the evidence.\r\nSecond, Scott testified that he was unsure whether \r\n  his attack was a â€œserious crime.â€  We understand that the term â€œserious crimeâ€ \r\n  is ambiguous and recognize that it was reasonable that Scott was unable to distinguish \r\n  between â€œseriousâ€ crimes and other, â€œnon-seriousâ€ crimes.\r\nWe find that Scott unintentionally concealed that \r\n  he was the victim of an attack.\r\nConcealment as a Material Factor in Defenseâ€™s Use of Peremptory Challenges         \r\nThe Court of Appeals held that if Scottâ€™s concealment \r\n  was unintentional, the court does not â€œneed to determine whether the information \r\n  would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material factor \r\n  in the defenseâ€™s use of a peremptory challenge.â€ State v. Sparkman, Op. \r\n  No. 2003-UP-165 (Ct. App. Filed February 27, 2003).   In Woods, we held \r\n  that â€œwhere the failure to disclose is innocent, no inference of bias can be \r\n  drawn.â€ Woods, 345 S.C. at 388, 500 S.E.2d at 284.\r\nBecause Scottâ€™s concealment was unintentional our \r\n  inquiry is over, however, we fail to see how Sparkman was prejudiced given that \r\n  the trial judge questioned the jury after the verdict.   In Woods, this \r\n  Court said, â€œ[w]here a juror, without justification, fails to disclose a relationship, \r\n  it may be inferred, nothing to the contrary appearing, that the juror \r\n  is not impartial.â€ Id. (emphasis added).\r\nAfter being informed of Scottâ€™s attack, the trial \r\n  judge asked every member of the jury, individually, if Scottâ€™s comments persuaded \r\n  them to convict Sparkman and no one answered affirmatively, including Regina \r\n  Jenerette.  Usually we must develop inferences of jury bias because we do not \r\n  have the luxury of post-verdict juror testimony.  However, in this case, the \r\n  juror testimony is clearly â€œcontraryâ€ to an inference of bias or prejudice, \r\n  and the trial judge was in the best position to make a factual decision concerning \r\n  the effects of Scottâ€™s alleged misconduct. See Harris, 340 S.C. \r\n  at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 627 (2000) (citing Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d \r\n  at 104) (â€œThe trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegation of juror \r\n  misconductâ€¦[t]he determination of whether extraneous material received by a \r\n  juror during the course of the trial is prejudicial is a matter for determination \r\n  by the trial court.â€)\r\nConclusion         \r\nWe hold that the Court of Appeals did not err in \r\n  upholding Sparkmanâ€™s conviction because (1) Scott did not intentionally conceal \r\n  that he had been the victim of an attack, and (2) all of the jurors testified \r\n  that Scottâ€™s recount of his attack did not affect their decision to convict \r\n  Sparkman.  Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling upholding \r\n  Sparkmanâ€™s conviction.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Roger \r\n  M. Young, concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]    Newton identified Sparkman as the man who knocked him unconscious.  \r\n    His eyewitness testimony was the sole evidence connecting Sparkman to the \r\n    crime.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]   After six and a half hours, the jury reported being deadlocked and \r\n    the trial judge gave an Allen charge.  See Allen v. United States, \r\n    164 U.S. 492, 17 S. Ct. 154, 41 L.

Thomas, of Rogers Townsend &amp; Thomas, PC, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ACTING JUSTICE MACAULAY:   We \r\n  granted certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Lucas v. Rawl \r\n  Family Ltd. Partnership, Op. No. 2003-UP-62 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January \r\n  22, 2003).  We reverse.  \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner purchased approximately 118 \r\n  acres of land in Lexington County in 1990, where he grew Coastal Bermuda grass \r\n  and other crops.  He also built a home on the property and used a pond for recreation \r\n  and fishing.\r\nIn 1996, respondents purchased a 146-acre tract north of \r\n  and adjacent to petitionerâ€™s property.  Respondentsâ€™ land is higher in elevation, \r\n  and water naturally flows from respondentsâ€™ property to petitionerâ€™s property.  \r\n  Sometime after the purchase, respondents cleared approximately forty acres of \r\n  land for farming by cutting trees and removing the stumps.           \r\nOn May 5, 1998, heavy \r\n  rains caused extensive flooding on petitionerâ€™s property.  When petitioner and \r\n  his son-in-law, Robert Howell, arrived to inspect the property, they saw that \r\n  surface water, silt, and debris from respondentsâ€™ land had washed over the fields \r\n  and into the pond.  The fields were covered in standing water and the pond was \r\n  flooded, causing extensive damage.  The pond dam was eroding and Howell was \r\n  forced to remove boards holding the dam in place to relieve the pressure and \r\n  prevent the dam from bursting and flooding the nearby Pelion School.  Petitioner \r\n  presented evidence that the property now floods every time there is a heavy \r\n  rain and, as noted by the Court of Appeals, the flood-damaged fields do not \r\n  produce Coastal Bermuda as vigorously as they did prior to respondentsâ€™ clearing \r\n  their land.                   \r\nPetitionerâ€™s suit against respondents \r\n  alleged negligence, trespass, and nuisance.  Respondents moved for a directed \r\n  verdict following the presentation of evidence.  The trial judge ruled that \r\n  the case did not properly sound in negligence, and granted the directed verdict \r\n  motion on the negligence claim.  However, the trial judge refused to grant a \r\n  directed verdict on the trespass and nuisance causes of action.\r\nThe jury found in favor of respondents \r\n  on the trespass cause of action, and found for petitioner on the nuisance cause \r\n  of action. [1]   Respondents appealed, \r\n  arguing, among other things, that they were entitled to a directed verdict on \r\n  the nuisance cause of action.\r\n The Court of Appeals reversed and found \r\n  that, because the common enemy rule did not apply, the trial judge erred in \r\n  failing to direct a verdict on the nuisance claim.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that the trial \r\n  judge should have granted the motion for a directed verdict on the nuisance \r\n  cause of action?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPrior to ruling on whether the trial \r\n  court erred in refusing the directed verdict motion, the Court of Appeals held \r\n  the common enemy rule did not apply because respondents were merely preparing \r\n  the land for farming and did not intend to influence the course of surface water.  \r\n  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held the nuisance exception to the common \r\n  enemy rule could not apply, and that respondents were entitled to clear their \r\n  land irrespective of the future effect it would have on surface water.  This \r\n  was error.\r\nSouth Carolina follows the common enemy rule with respect to the diversion \r\n  of surface waters naturally flowing across land.  Baltzeger v. Carolina Midland \r\n  Ry. Co., 54 S.C. 242, 247-48, 32 S.E. 358, 360 (1899); Johnson v. Phillips, \r\n  315 S.C. 407, 412, 433 S.E.2d 895, 898 (Ct. App. 1993), revâ€™d on other grounds \r\n  by Smith v. Phillips, 318 S.C. 453, 458 S.E.2d 427 (1995); William \r\n  T. Toal, Surface Water in South Carolina, 23 S.C. L. Rev. 82, 83 (1971).  \r\n  The rule allows a landowner to treat surface water as a common enemy and dispose \r\n  of it as the landowner sees fit.  Glenn v. School Dist. No. Five of Anderson \r\n  County, 294 S.C. 530, 533, 366 S.E.2d 47, 49 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThere are, however, two exceptions.  First, the common enemy rule is \r\n  subject to the law of nuisance and an individual may not obstruct or alter the \r\n  flow of water to create a nuisance per se.  Johnson v. Phillips, \r\n  id. at 414, 433 S.E.2d at 899; Baltzeger v. Carolina Midland Ry. Co., \r\n  id. at 247, 32 S.E. at 359-60.  Second, except by contractual or prescriptive \r\n  right, an upper landowner may not, by means of a ditch, impoundment or other \r\n  artificial structure, collect surface water on his own land and cast it in a \r\n  concentrated form upon lower adjoining land.  Johnson v. Phillips, id. \r\n  at 414, 433 S.E.2d at 899. \r\nIn his complaint, petitioner alleged respondents began an active and aggressive \r\n  program of grading, clearing, bulldozing, ditching, land alteration, and removal \r\n  of trees and vegetation from a substantial portion of their property prior to \r\n  May 5, 1998.  Petitioner alleged those actions resulted in an â€œalteration and/or \r\n  diversion in the natural flow of surface water so as to create a nuisance and/or \r\n  also [respondents] artificially collected surface water and cast it in a concentrated \r\n  form upon [petitionerâ€™s] land.â€  \r\nNeither respondents nor petitioner ever argued that the common enemy rule did \r\n  not apply.  Further, petitioner objected to respondentsâ€™ proposed jury charge \r\n  on the common enemy rule because it failed to charge the nuisance and casting \r\n  exceptions.  The trial judge agreed with petitioner, and charged both exceptions.  \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals initially noted that both parties had agreed the \r\n  damage to petitionerâ€™s land was caused by surface water runoff from respondentsâ€™ \r\n  land.  The Court of Appeals then stated that the extension of the common law \r\n  doctrine, known as the common enemy rule, applies only â€œwhen a landowner takes \r\n  direct action addressing surface water to the detriment of an adjoining landowner, \r\n  such as obstructing or altering its natural flow.â€  Concluding that the record \r\n  was devoid of any evidence that the clearing of trees and stumps from respondentsâ€™ \r\n  property was for any purpose other than to prepare the land for farming, the \r\n  Court of Appeals found there was no evidence respondents intended to influence \r\n  the natural flow of surface water.  Therefore, the Court of Appeals held the \r\n  common enemy rule, together with its nuisance exception, could not apply.\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred for two reasons.  First, neither petitioner nor respondent \r\n  ever argued that the common enemy rule did not apply at trial or on appeal. \r\n  [2]   It is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, \r\n  an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court.  Holy Loch Distributors, Inc. v. Hitchcock, \r\n  340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000); Smith v. Phillips, id. \r\n  at 455, 458 S.E.2d at 429.  Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred because the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s unappealed ruling that the common enemy rule applied was the law \r\n  of the case.  Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 160, \r\n  177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (stating that an issue which is not challenged on \r\n  appeal, whether right or wrong, becomes the law of the case).\r\nSecond, even if the Court of Appeals did not err in addressing the issue, it \r\n  erred in holding that the common enemy rule is merely an extension of the common \r\n  law rule.  \r\nThere are three basic rules governing the disposal of unwanted surface \r\n  water: (1) the common law or common enemy rule, (2) the civil law rule, and \r\n  (3) the reasonable use or modified civil law rule.  Toal, 23 S.C. L. Rev. at \r\n  82.  In adopting the common law rule in Edwards v. Charlotte, C. &amp; A.R. \r\n  Co., 39 S.C. 472, 475, 18 S.E. 58, 59 (1893), this Court held that, â€œ[u]nder \r\n  the common law rule, surface water is regarded as a common enemy.â€  See \r\n  also Janet Fairchild, Modern Status of Rules Governing Interference \r\n  with Drainage of Surface Waters, 93 A.L.R.3d 1193, 1199 (1979) (under â€œthe \r\n  common enemy, common law, or Massachusetts doctrine,â€ each landowner is entitled \r\n  to take whatever steps he pleases, on his own land, to dispose of surface water \r\n  without liability to adjoining landowners). \r\nIt is clear that the â€œcommon lawâ€ and â€œcommon enemyâ€ \r\n  rules are the same rule.  Further, despite the fact that respondents did not \r\n  intend to alter the flow of surface water, there was ample evidence that respondentsâ€™ \r\n  clear-cutting prevented surface water from being absorbed into the soil and \r\n  increased the flow of water onto petitionerâ€™s land, including testimony from \r\n  respondentsâ€™ own expert that clearing the land decreased surface water absorption \r\n  and increased runoff.  Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that \r\n  the common law rule applied, that the common enemy rule did not apply, and that \r\n  the common enemy rule was merely an â€œextensionâ€ of the common law rule.  \r\nRespondents argue that, even if the Court of Appeals erred in holding \r\n  the common enemy rule did not apply, respondents were still entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict on the nuisance cause of action because petitioner failed to prove respondentsâ€™ \r\n  actions amounted to a nuisance per se.  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, a court \r\n  must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party.  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, \r\n  334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999); Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, \r\n  331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).  The trial court should deny \r\n  the motion where either the evidence yields more than one inference, or its \r\n  inference is in doubt.  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, \r\n  585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).  This Court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s rulings \r\n  on a directed verdict motion only where there is no evidence to support the \r\n  ruling or where the ruling is controlled by an error of law.  Hinkle v. National \r\n  Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003).\r\nRespondents argue, as they did at trial and before the Court of Appeals, \r\n  that petitioner provided no evidence respondentsâ€™ actions amounted to a nuisance \r\n  per se.  Accordingly, respondents contend the trial judge erred \r\n  in submitting the case to the jury.  \r\nThe traditional test for determining the existence of a nuisance per \r\n  se is whether the nuisance has become dangerous at all times and under \r\n  all circumstances to life, health, or property.  Suddeth v. Knight, 280 \r\n  S.C. 540, 545, 314 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1984); Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1094 \r\n  (7th ed. 1999) (a nuisance per se is an interference so severe \r\n  that it would constitute a nuisance under any circumstances). \r\nIn the present case, there was evidence that petitionerâ€™s fields now \r\n  flood in every heavy rain and that petitioner has been unable to grow crops \r\n  on a portion of his land because of the standing water, silt, and other debris \r\n  that accompany the flooding.    Accordingly, there existed a jury question as \r\n  to whether the respondentsâ€™ actions constituted a nuisance per se \r\n  and were dangerous to the property at all times because of the continuing nature \r\n  of the flooding and because of the diminished production of the Coastal Bermuda \r\n  fields. Deason v. Southern Ry. Co., 142 S.C. 328, 140 S.E. 575 (1927) \r\n  (â€œwhether or not the nuisance â€˜had become dangerous at all times and under all \r\n  circumstances to life, health, or propertyâ€™ was for the juryâ€); Suddeth v. \r\n  Knight, id. at 545-46, 314 S.E.2d at 15 (it was peculiarly a question \r\n  for the jury as to whether the flooding of plaintiffâ€™s property and its attendent \r\n  problems was dangerous at all times and under all circumstances to life, health, \r\n  or property).\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the verdict, as \r\n  offset by the trial judge, is reinstated.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a \r\n  separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals setting aside the jury verdict in this case.\r\nIn my opinion, the facts of this case demonstrate that respondentsâ€™ \r\n  actions were not an attempt to deal with the â€œcommon enemy,â€ but instead establish \r\n  that respondents were simply preparing their land for agricultural use.  To \r\n  hold, as the majority does, that these actions implicate the common enemy doctrine \r\n  flirts with adoption of an expansive view of the â€œNew Jersey Ruleâ€ which \r\n  we rejected in Irwin v. Michelin Tire Corp., 288 S.C. 221, 341 S.E.2d \r\n  783 (1986). [3]   Since, however, the parties tried this matter \r\n  as if the doctrine were applicable, I agree that we should review whether there \r\n  was any evidence of nuisance per se here. \r\n I find no evidence of nuisance per se warranting submission of this \r\n  case to the jury.  The nuisance exception to the common enemy rule requires, \r\n  as a predicate for its application, the existence of evidence that surface water \r\n  has accumulated.  See, e.g., Deason v. Southern Ry. Co., 142 S.C. \r\n  328, 140 S.E. 575 (1927)(jury issue whether defendantâ€™s creation of pond by \r\n  raising embankment and stopping up drainage ditch created a nuisance per \r\n  se); Baltzeger v. Carolina Midland Ry. Co., 54 S.C. 242, 32 S.E. \r\n  358 (1899)(grant of demurrer on nuisance per se reversed where complaint \r\n  alleged defendant constructed embankment and ditches causing surface water to \r\n  accumulate and stagnate); Suddeth v. Knight, 280 S.C. 540, 314 S.E.2d \r\n  11 (Ct. App. 1984)(jury issue where evidence that defendantâ€™s construction caused \r\n  standing water 40 inches deep to accumulate and stagnate on plaintiffâ€™s property \r\n  for 6-10 months a year);  see also F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The \r\n  South Carolina Law of Torts (2nd ed. 1997) pp. 222-223 (â€œ. . \r\n  . accumulations of water can have other effects in addition to direct impacts \r\n  like floodingâ€”providing a place for mosquitoes to breed, for example; and there \r\n  may be a nuisance for these other effectsâ€).  That the nuisance per se exception \r\n  is limited to situations where the accumulation of surface water leads to secondary \r\n  problems, and that it is those secondary effects which give rise to the nuisance \r\n  is exemplified by the requirement that one alleging the nuisance must show that \r\n  â€œit has become dangerous, at all times and under all circumstances, to life, \r\n  health, or property.â€  Baltzeger at 360. Unlike the majority, I find \r\n  no evidence of continuing danger in the possibility of periodic flooding, nor \r\n  do I perceive any danger to life, health, or property in the reduced productivity \r\n  of petitionerâ€™s turf farming operation.\r\nWhile I am not unsympathetic to the impact of respondentsâ€™ agricultural development \r\n  on petitionerâ€™s property, this is a situation damnum absque injuria.  \r\n  For these reasons, I would affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The jury awarded $128,000 in damages.  However, the trial judge permitted \r\n    a $10,000 offset from an earlier settlement petitioner had received from another \r\n    adjoining landowner.  Therefore, the trial judge entered a verdict for $118,000.      \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In fact, respondents argued in their brief to the Court of Appeals \r\n    that, â€œthe common law, common enemy rule applies.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  â€œObviously, every construction project of any \r\n    magnitude could decrease the absorption, seepage, and percolation rate of \r\n    the land, and potentially allow every lower riparian or adjoining landowner \r\n    to institute a cause of action.  If there is to be such a fundamental change \r\n    in the law, we believe that it should be by legislative action and not judicial \r\n    decision.â€  Irwin at 225, 341 S.E.2d at 785.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Phillip Wayne Hudson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-04-26-01","description":"This order concerns the interim suspension of a judge.","date":"2004-05-03","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Phillip \r\n  Wayne Hudson, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  (ODC) has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim \r\n  suspension pursuant to Rule 17(b) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.

A civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed   with the clerk of court if:\r\n  \r\n    (1) the summons and   complaint are served within the statute of limitations in any manner prescribed   by law; or\r\n    (2) if not served within the   statute of limitations, actual service must be accomplished not later than one   hundred twenty days after filing.\r\n  \r\n  (b) Filing In Forma Pauperis. A plaintiff who desires to file an action in forma pauperis shall file in   the court a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, together with the   complaint proposed to be filed and an affidavit showing the plaintiff's   inability to pay the fee required to file the action. If the motion is granted,   the plaintiff may proceed without further application and file the complaint in   the court without payment of filing fees.\r\n\r\n(2) The following   note is added to the end of Rule 3:\r\nNote to 2004   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  This amendment rewrote subsection   (a), deleted subsection (b), and renumbered subsection (c) as subsection (b).   These changes are intended to reflect the legislative intent expressed in &sect;   15-3-20 as amended by 2002 S.C. Act No. 281, &sect; 1.\r\n\r\n(3) Rule 63 is amended   to read:\r\nRULE   63\r\n  DISABILITY OF A JUDGE\r\n\r\n  If at any time after a trial or   hearing has been commenced, but before the final order or judgment has been   issued, the judge is unable to proceed, a successor judge shall be assigned. The   successor judge may proceed upon certifying familiarity with the record and   determining that the proceedings may be completed without prejudice to the   parties. In a hearing or a trial without a jury, the successor judge shall, at   the request of a party, recall any witness whose testimony is material and   disputed and who is available to testify without undue burden. A successor judge   may also provide for the recall of any witnesses.\r\n\r\n(4) The following note is   added to the end of Rule 63: \r\n \r\nNote to 2004   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  The 2004 Amendment rewrote this   Rule to provide a clear procedure when a judge who has heard some or all of a   case is unable to proceed. The language is similar to Rule 63 of the Federal   Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\n\r\n(5) Rule 71.1(f) is   re-lettered 71.1(g) and new Rule 71.1(f) shall read as follows:\r\n\r\n  (f) Filing and Service of Order. The post-conviction relief judge shall submit the signed final order or   judgment to the clerk for filing and the clerk of court shall provide notice of   entry of judgment and serve a copy of the order or judgment to the parties as   provided in Rule 77(d), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n(6) The following note is   added to the end of Rule 71.1:\r\nNote to 2004   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  The 2004 Amendment clarifies the   process for filing and notification of parties of filed orders in   post-conviction relief actions.\r\n\r\n(7) The following two   sentences are added to the end of Rule 77(d):\r\n\r\n  In addition to the above, in   post-conviction relief actions, the post-conviction relief judge shall submit   the signed order or judgment to the clerk of court for filing and the clerk   shall promptly provide notice of the entry of judgment and serve a copy of the   signed order to the parties. Pursuant to Rule 5(b) service shall be made solely   on the attorney when the applicant is represented by counsel and, where an   applicant is proceeding pro se, service shall be made upon the applicant at the   last known address provided to the clerk by the   applicant.\r\n\r\n(8) The following note is   added to the end of Rule 77:\r\nNote to 2004   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  The 2004 amendment clarified the   process for clerks of court providing notice of entry of judgment and copies of   the final signed order to the parties. It made clear that service is to be made   on the attorney of a represented applicant and only on applicants when they are   proceeding pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25818","title":"State v.

Zelenka, Senior Assistant \r\n  Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia, and Ralph E. Hoisington, \r\n  of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  Wesley Myers (Appellant) was \r\n  convicted of murder and arson in the third degree.  Appellant was sentenced \r\n  to thirty years imprisonment for murder and ten years imprisonment for arson.  \r\n  Appellant appealed his convictions on multiple grounds.  This appeal was certified \r\n  from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn Thursday, March 13, 1997, at 3:15 am the fire department responded to an \r\n  emergency call and found the Mill Inn Tavern on fire.  A body was discovered \r\n  in the bar after the fire was extinguished.  The body was that of Teresa Haught \r\n  (Teresa), Appellantâ€™s girlfriend and manager of the bar.  Teresa had been hit \r\n  in the head, and then the bar had been set on fire.  During the investigation \r\n  of the scene, some hairs were found in Teresaâ€™s hand.  \r\nThe police interviewed Appellant three different times: at the scene of the \r\n  fire (early Thursday morning), and twice at the police station (Friday and Saturday).  \r\n  On Thursday and Friday, Appellant was cooperative and consistently offered to \r\n  help the police find the killer.  During a skillfully conducted interrogation \r\n  on Friday, the police sought, and obtained, Appellantâ€™s agreement that the hair \r\n  found in Teresaâ€™s hand must have come from the head of the person who killed \r\n  her.  \r\nAt the meeting on Saturday with Appellant, the police told Appellant \r\n  that South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) had matched the hair found \r\n  in Teresaâ€™s hand to the hair that Appellant had given the police for testing. [1]   At that point, Appellant confessed \r\n  to killing Teresa. Appellantâ€™s confession stated:\r\n\r\nOn March 13th, 1997 at about 2:00am or so I drove to the Mill Inn \r\n  to check on my girlfriend, Theresa (sic) Haught.  I parked my truck beside her \r\n  Mercury parked in front of the Mill Inn.  I went to the front door and knocked.  \r\n  Teresa came to the door about 5-10 minutes later.  It is not uncommon for me \r\n  to go by and check on her at closing time.  There was no one in there or I donâ€™t \r\n  think there was anyone in there.  While I was in the bar, I found a pink note \r\n  on the bar.  It was a note signed by Allen White.  I think it said that â€œIâ€™ll \r\n  see you laterâ€ and it was signed by him.  I thought that they might have had \r\n  something going.  I had seen Allen pinch her and kiss her on the lips.  I asked \r\n  her about the note and she said that it was none of my business.  Teresa pushed \r\n  me by the chin and the chest hard.  I told her â€œdonâ€™t push me Teresa.â€  She \r\n  hit me in my chest with her fist.  Then, she pushed me up against the bar.  \r\n  I told her not to hit on me.  Teresa grabbed the glass wine craft (sic) and \r\n  she told me to get away.  I grabbed the wine craft (sic) from her.  Then, she \r\n  pushed me in the face.  I struck her in the center of the head with the wine \r\n  craft (sic).  Both of us went down to the floor.  Like a blur, I lost control.  \r\n  I went around the counter behind the bar.  I believe I held her for a while \r\n  on the floor before I went around the counter.  I think I struck her twice.  \r\n  I was raged upset, real mad.  I couldnâ€™t believe what she was saying.  She called \r\n  me a fool.  I grabbed â€œclosed on Sunday signâ€ and some papers.  At that state \r\n  I grabbed anything around.  I piled some papers up behind the bar and lit it \r\n  with a lighter.  I remember I wanted to die.  I wanted to burn up in there with \r\n  her. I sat there and closed my eyes and the fire was getting really big.   I \r\n  went out the back door and went to the right.  I went around front and got into \r\n  my truck.  I put a purse behind the seat of my truck.  I donâ€™t remember what \r\n  I did with the purse.  I drove home.  I forgot to mention that I opened the \r\n  cabinet behind the bar looking for something to burn.  \r\n\r\n The hair that was found in Teresaâ€™s hand was lost when SLED sent the hair \r\n  to the FBI for DNA analysis, so there is no physical evidence linking Appellant \r\n  to the crime.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.       Did the trial court err in admitting Appellantâ€™s confession?  \r\n2.       Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence an anger management \r\n  questionnaire completed by Appellant, in which he acknowledged problems with \r\n  controlling his emotions?\r\n3.       Did the trial judge err in sealing letters from the solicitor to the \r\n  police department because the letters contained impeachment or exculpatory evidence?\r\n4.       Did the trial court err in ruling Dr. Saul Kassin, an expert in social \r\n  psychology, could not use examples or facts from other states to illustrate \r\n  his opinion about false confessions?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n1. Confession\r\nAppellant argues that the confession should have been suppressed because it \r\n  was the product of police trickery and coercion.  The totality of the circumstances \r\n  does not demonstrate that Appellantâ€™s will was overborne by the police. As there \r\n  is no evidence that the confession was not voluntary we therefore hold that \r\n  the trial court did not err in admitting Appellantâ€™s confession.  \r\nInitially, Appellant gave a statement to a police officer on Thursday, \r\n  at the scene of the fire.  Before giving the statement, Appellant was advised \r\n  of his rights.  Appellant did not say anything incriminating in this statement.  \r\n\r\nOn Friday, Appellant met with Officer McHale at the police station. When Appellant \r\n  arrived at the station, the officers were leaving for lunch and invited Appellant \r\n  to join them.  Appellant declined.  After the officers returned, McHale read \r\n  Appellant his Miranda rights, and Appellant waived his rights.  During Fridayâ€™s \r\n  interview, McHale used the â€œReid Techniqueâ€ of interrogation. \r\n  [2]    The Reid technique involves nine steps.  The first part of the process \r\n  involves â€œbreaking the suspect downâ€ by asserting the suspectâ€™s guilt and not \r\n  allowing the suspect to deny his or her guilt.  The second part of the process \r\n  involves â€œdevelopment of alternative questionsâ€ in which the interrogator gives \r\n  the suspect a â€œface-saving or moral-justifying alternative.â€ For example, the \r\n  interrogator would say â€œmaybe you were provokedâ€ or â€œmaybe it was an accidentâ€ \r\n  or â€œI know this isnâ€™t something that you wanted to do or planned.â€  \r\nInitially, Appellant agreed to take a polygraph examination, but during the \r\n  interview with McHale, Appellant told McHale that Appellant had been up all \r\n  night, had 24 beers to drink the night before, and had taken caffeine pills.  \r\n  McHale decided to send Appellant home, and asked Appellant to get a good nightâ€™s \r\n  rest before meeting with the police on Saturday.  McHale testified that he stopped \r\n  the interrogation because he wanted to make sure that if the police elicited \r\n  a confession, it would be admissible in court.  Appellant did not make any incriminating \r\n  statements on Friday.    \r\nOn Saturday, Officer Clayton took Appellant to breakfast, then Clayton \r\n  took Appellant to the station for the interrogation.  Appellant was again advised \r\n  of his rights.  During this interrogation, the officers spoke with Appellant \r\n  for about an hour and a half before Lt. Cumbee arrived and asked Appellant to \r\n  come into his office.  Appellant agreed with the police that â€œthe hair that \r\n  was found in [Teresaâ€™s] hand belonged to the person who [murdered her].â€  After \r\n  Appellant said this, Lt. Cumbee left the office and when he came back he â€œtold \r\n  the [Appellant] that [Lt. Cumbee] just received a phone call from SLED and that \r\n  SLED said the hair that was found in [Teresaâ€™s] hand is from, came from [Appellant]â€¦that \r\n  it matched.â€  In reality, the police had received the phone call on Friday from \r\n  SLED stating that the hair matched. \r\n  [3]    When Appellant was confronted with this information, he said â€œI must \r\n  have did it then.â€  Lt. Cumbee said â€œWell, donâ€™t you think you need to say youâ€™re \r\n  sorry?â€  Appellant said â€œIâ€™m sorry, Teresa.  I didnâ€™t mean to do it.  It was \r\n  an accident.â€  Then, Lt. Cumbee pulled out a photograph of Teresa, and Appellant \r\n  started rubbing the photograph and saying that he was sorry.  Appellant told \r\n  the police the details of the murder. At this point, the police took Appellant \r\n  to the park where he said he hid Teresaâ€™s purse, however, they were unable to \r\n  locate the purse.  They returned to the police station and Appellant signed \r\n  the written statement.  Appellant was placed under arrest.\r\nAfter Appellant signed the written statement, Lt. Cumbee asked Appellant \r\n  if he wanted to speak to Teresaâ€™s mother.  He said yes, and Teresaâ€™s mother \r\n  was brought into a conference room.  There, Appellant told her he was sorry \r\n  and that he lost control and that he had killed Teresa. \r\nAfter the arrest, Lt. Cumbee called the media and informed them he had made \r\n  an arrest, and that the police would be escorting Appellant to the county jail \r\n  later in the afternoon.  When Appellant was escorted out of the station, he \r\n  told the reporters that he wanted to make a statement.  Both Lt. Cumbee and \r\n  Officer Tetanich testified that they advised Appellant not to talk to the media, \r\n  but that Appellant told them that â€œI want to tell the world how sorry I am.â€  \r\n  Appellant told the reporters that he killed Teresa and that he was sorry for \r\n  what he had done.  \r\nAppellant argues the initial confession was coerced, and therefore \r\n  the statement to Teresaâ€™s mother and the statement to the media were inadmissible \r\n  as fruit of the poisonous tree.  We disagree.  A confession is not admissible \r\n  unless it was voluntarily made.  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d 689 (1996) (quoting State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d \r\n  839 (1989)).  A determination whether a confession was â€œgiven voluntarily requires \r\n  an examination of the totality of the circumstances.â€  Von Dohlen, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d at 694-95.  On appeal, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling as to the voluntariness \r\n  of the confession will not be disturbed unless so erroneous as to constitute \r\n  an abuse of discretion.  Id.  â€œBoth this Court and the United States \r\n  Supreme Court have recognized that misrepresentations of evidence by police, \r\n  although a relevant factor, do not render an otherwise voluntary confession \r\n  inadmissibleâ€¦The pertinent inquiry is, as always, whether the defendantâ€™s will \r\n  was â€˜overborne.â€™â€  Id.\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the confession \r\n  into evidence.  Appellant was advised of his rights three different times.  \r\n  Not one of the interrogations lasted more than a few hours. Appellant was offered \r\n  food by the police and told he was free to leave the station at any time on \r\n  Friday.  Also, the police made sure that Appellant was well rested and fresh \r\n  before they interrogated him on Saturday.  In addition, when the police told \r\n  Appellant that the hair found in Teresaâ€™s hand matched Appellantâ€™s hair, they \r\n  were communicating the information that they received from SLED.  Even if the \r\n  information were untrue, it is not, alone, enough to render the confession involuntary.  \r\n  See Von Dohlen, 471 S.E.2d at 695; State v. Rabon, 275 \r\n  S.C. 459, 272 S.E.2d 634 (1980)(â€œA misrepresentation, while relevant, may be \r\n  insufficient to render inadmissible an otherwise valid confessionâ€); State \r\n  v. Register, 323 S.C. 471, 476 S.E.2d 153 (1996)(holding defendantâ€™s confession \r\n  was voluntary and admissible when police misrepresented to defendant that he \r\n  had been seen with the victim the night she was murdered, that his tires and \r\n  shoe matched impressions found at the murder scene, and that the police had \r\n  DNA evidence establishing defendantâ€™s guilt).  Since the initial confession \r\n  was voluntary, the subsequent statements were properly admitted.\r\nWhile we find no fruit of the poisonous tree here, we cannot let pass without \r\n  comment the police conduct in arranging media coverage of Appellantâ€™s â€œperp \r\n  walk.â€  Such actions were improper and reflect poorly on the professionalism \r\n  of the department.  \r\n2. Anger Management Questionnaire\r\nAppellant argues that the trial judge should have excluded an anger \r\n  management questionnaire taken by Appellant because any probative value was \r\n  substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect under Rule 403, SCRE.  We \r\n  agree that the questionnaire should have been excluded, but affirm the trial \r\n  court because its erroneous admission was harmless error.\r\nThe police found the questionnaire during a search of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  house. The questionnaire was from an adult outpatient treatment program that \r\n  Appellant attended for alcoholism.  It is titled â€œAnger Questionnaire Worksheet.â€ \r\n  Appellant answered yes to both â€œIâ€™ve gotten so angry at times, that Iâ€™ve become \r\n  physically violent, hitting other people or breaking thingsâ€ and â€œAt times, \r\n  Iâ€™ve felt angry enough to kill,â€ among other questions.  The Stateâ€™s theory \r\n  of the case was that Appellant killed Teresa in a fit of rage.  Appellant argued \r\n  that it was unclear when Appellant filled out the questionnaire, and that it \r\n  was too prejudicial to be admitted into evidence.  \r\nThis Court reviews 403 rulings pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard, \r\n  and gives great deference to the trial judgeâ€™s decision.  State v. Aleksey, \r\n  343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000).  We agree with Appellant that the prejudicial \r\n  value of the questionnaire substantially outweighed the probative value and \r\n  should have been excluded from evidence.  It is unclear when, or under what \r\n  circumstances, the questionnaire was filled out.  However, this error was harmless \r\n  in light of Appellantâ€™s confession.  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 \r\n  S.E.2d 241 (1990).   \r\n3.  Sealed letters\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in sealing two letters as \r\n  the letters contained impeachment or exculpatory evidence related to police \r\n  misconduct. Judge Cottingham ruled in a pre-trial hearing that these letters \r\n  were work product, and ordered the letters sealed.  We have reviewed the letters \r\n  and determined that the trial court did not err in sealing the letters, as one \r\n  of the letters is work product and the other is not relevant. \r\nThere are two letters at issue in this case.  First is a copy of a letter to \r\n  Chief Caldwell of the North Charleston Police Department from David Schwacke, \r\n  Solicitor, Ninth Judicial Circuit, written on January 29, 1998 (hereinafter \r\n  â€œJanuary letterâ€).  The second letter is from Amie Clifford, Assistant Solicitor, \r\n  Ninth Judicial Circuit, to Chief Caldwell, sent on July 15, 1999 (hereinafter \r\n  â€œJuly letterâ€). The July letter is specifically about the case at hand, and \r\n  is written to Chief Caldwell regarding numerous issues with the case.  \r\nRule 5(a)(2) SCRCrimP, exempts from discovery work product, or â€œinternal prosecution \r\n  documents made by the attorney for the prosecution or other prosecution agents \r\n  in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the caseâ€¦.â€   In essence, \r\n  Rule 5 SCRCrimP exempts â€œinternal prosecution documents made in connection with \r\n  an investigation.â€  State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999).  \r\n  The July letter clearly falls into the exemption under Rule 5.  The letter was \r\n  written to the North Charleston Chief of Police regarding the prosecution of \r\n  the case.  Thus, the July letter was an internal prosecution document and not \r\n  subject to discovery.  See State v. Gill, 319 S.C. 283, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  412 (1995)(holding that a summary report prepared by police officers for the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s use in prosecuting the case was not subject to discovery), vacated \r\n  on other grounds, State v. Gill, 327 S.C. 253, 489 S.E.2d 478 (1997).  \r\n  In addition, the July letter does not contain any impeachment or exculpatory \r\n  evidence.  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Giglio \r\n  v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972).  \r\nThe January letter, on the other hand, was not prepared for the prosecution \r\n  of the case and thus does not fall under Rule 5, SCRCrimP.  However, the January \r\n  letter is not relevant to the case at hand.  The only paragraph regarding Appellant \r\n  was about the â€œperp walk.â€  The jury heard evidence that the officers called \r\n  the media to let them know about the â€œperp walk,â€ so although the letter might \r\n  have bolstered the testimony that the police called the media, it had no independent \r\n  evidentiary value.  Finally, the letter does not contain any impeachment or \r\n  exculpatory evidence.  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling.  \r\n4. Dr. Kassinâ€™s testimony\r\nDr. Kassin is a psychology professor at Williams College and was \r\n  qualified in this case as an expert in social psychology.  Dr. Kassin testified \r\n  about the psychology of confessions and false or coerced confessions.  Appellant \r\n  alleges that the trial court erred in preventing Dr. Kassin from testifying \r\n  about specific case studies, in contravention of Rule 702, SCRE, because the \r\n  testimony would have been helpful to the jury.  We have determined there was \r\n  no error, and affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling.  \r\nIn the Jackson v. Denno hearing, Dr. Kassin testified about \r\n  the facts of particular cases in Connecticut [4]  and Indiana [5]  \r\n  in which people confessed to crimes, but later were exonerated.  Before Dr. \r\n  Kassin testified before the jury, the solicitor objected to Dr. Kassin testifying \r\n  about â€œcases that donâ€™t involve this particular caseâ€ because they were irrelevant.  \r\n  The trial judge stated â€œJust object to the things you wantâ€¦letâ€™s try to keep \r\n  it as much as you can to something that fits the facts of this case generally.â€  \r\n\r\nDr. Kassin testified that he reviewed the videotape of the interview that Officer \r\n  McHale conducted of Appellant on Friday, and that he was concerned that the \r\n  techniques used by McHale could lead to a coerced confession.  Dr. Kassin testified \r\n  in great detail about coerced confessions.  However, on redirect when he was \r\n  asked to give â€œanecdotal examples of false confessionâ€ the judge stated â€œIâ€™m \r\n  not going to allow it unless you got a case exactly like this.â€  Dr. Kassin \r\n  went on to say â€œthereâ€™s a case in Indiana thatâ€™s very similar.  Thereâ€™s a case \r\n  in Connecticutâ€¦â€  The solicitor objected again. \r\nDespite these objections, the record reflects that in fact Dr. Kassin was allowed \r\n  to testify about specific cases of false confession.  For example, Dr. Kassin \r\n  testified that there were incidences of people confessing to a â€œshaken babyâ€ \r\n  case when the child died of other causes.  He testified that sometimes someone \r\n  confesses to a murder and some time later the victim turns up alive, so no crime \r\n  was ever committed. Dr. Kassin testified about the â€œInnocence Projectâ€ in which \r\n  DNA testing has exonerated people convicted of crimes and that 22% of the people \r\n  had given false confessions.  Finally, Dr. Kassin testified that people can \r\n  give very detailed false confessions. For example, a man accused of killing \r\n  his mother gave a reason for killing her as well as the thoughts that were going \r\n  through his head as he killed her.  His confession was a documented false confession.      \r\n\r\nA trial court's ruling â€œto exclude or admit expert testimony will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.â€  Mizell v. Glover, 351 \r\n  S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002).  Dr. Kassin did testify about specific cases, \r\n  he just did not use names or say in which state the crime happened.  In addition, \r\n  the Indiana case was so dissimilar that there was no evidentiary value.  See \r\n  footnote 5 supra.  Although the Connecticut case was similar, the trial \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the information.  Dr. Kassin \r\n  was able to testify at length about false and coerced confessions, and he was \r\n  able to touch briefly on the Connecticut case.  However, assuming error in limiting \r\n  testimony about the Connecticut case, Appellant cannot show prejudice in light \r\n  of Dr. Kassinâ€™s other testimony.  See State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. \r\n  78, 512 S.E.2d 795 (1999)(exclusion of evidence is harmless where cumulative).  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe AFFIRM the trial courtâ€™s rulings.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  John W. Kittredge., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The police actually received the call from SLED \r\n    on Friday, before the interview with Appellant began.      \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  During the Friday interview, McHale told Appellant, \r\n    among other things, that McHale sometimes thought about killing his own wife, \r\n    and that he had once pushed his wife when she was pregnant.  McHale testified \r\n    that the purpose behind these statements was for Appellant to relate to McHale \r\n    and also for McHale to gauge the reaction of Appellant.  Also, McHale suggested \r\n    to Appellant that the police had evidence that Appellant was in the bar the \r\n    night of Teresaâ€™s murder, even though the police did not have any such evidence.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  SLED had not conducted a DNA analysis on the hair, \r\n    but had inspected the hair through a microscope.Â  There was a microscopic \r\n    match, meaning that the hair was consistent with Appellantâ€™s hair.Â  However, \r\n    this analysis does not yield a positive identification, like DNA.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The Connecticut case involved a man whose mother \r\n    was killed.Â  The police told the man he failed a polygraph examination, and \r\n    that the test was infallible.Â  The man told the police that he could not have \r\n    killed his mother.Â  But the interrogator told him that â€œpeople black out these \r\n    sort ofÂ  things.â€Â  The man then said â€œWell, then I guess I must have done \r\n    it.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  The Indiana case involved a man who was accused \r\n    of killing his daughter and throwing her into a lake.Â  The man confessed to \r\n    the police that he clubbed the girl to death, which was consistent with what \r\n    was known about the crime at the time.Â Â  However, when the body was analyzed, \r\n    it turns out she was stabbed to death, not clubbed to death.Â  So, the actual \r\n    confession did not match the facts of the case.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25819","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of the South \r\n  Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia, \r\n  and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Hastings Arthur Wise (Appellant)\r\nwas convicted of four counts of murder, three counts of assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill, one count of second-degree burglary, and four counts of \r\n  possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  The jury found \r\n  two aggravating circumstances:Â  a murder was committed during the commission \r\n  of a burglary; and two or more persons were murdered by one act or pursuant \r\n  to one scheme or course of conduct.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) \r\n  (2003 and Supp. 2003).\r\nAppellant was sentenced to death on the juryâ€™s recommendation \r\n  for each count of murder, twenty years consecutive on each count of assault \r\n  and battery with intent to kill, fifteen years concurrent for burglary, and \r\n  five years concurrent on each weapon possession conviction.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant drove into the employeesâ€™ parking lot at the R.E. \r\n  Phelon manufacturing plant in Aiken County at about 3 p.m. on September 15, \r\n  1997, as the work shifts were changing.Â  He had been fired from his job as a \r\n  machine operator at the plant several weeks earlier.  \r\n  [1] \r\nStanley Vance, the security officer on duty, testified he \r\n  believed Appellant had come to pick up his personal belongings which were stored \r\n  in the guard station.Â  Appellant exited his vehicle, walked to the guard station, \r\n  and shot Vance once in the upper abdomen with a semi-automatic pistol.\r\nDuring the guilt phase of the trial, in addition to two security \r\n  officers, the State presented fifteen employees as witnesses to the shootings \r\n  at the plant.Â  All identified Appellant as the perpetrator.Â  Their testimony, \r\n  along with the testimony of law enforcement investigators and the medical examiner, \r\n  established the following events:\r\nAfter tearing out telephone lines in the guard station, \r\n  Appellant entered the plantâ€™s human resources office.Â  He shot personnel manager \r\n  Charles Griffeth, age 56, twice in the back, killing him as he sat at his desk.Â  \r\n  Appellant held his pistol to the head of aÂ  secretary as he exited Griffethâ€™s \r\n  office, tore out the secretaryâ€™s telephone line, and continued into the plant.\r\nAppellant walked to the tool and dye area where several \r\n  employees were working.Â  He fired his pistol repeatedly at the employees, killing \r\n  David W. Moore, age 30, and Earnest L. Filyaw, age 31.Â  Lucius Corley and John \r\n  Mitchell were wounded.Â  Mitchell was shot in the chest, and suffered extensive \r\n  and severe internal injuries which required multiple surgical procedures.\r\nAppellant walked toward another area of the plant as employees, \r\n  who gradually had become aware of the shootings in the plant, fled the building.Â  \r\n  He shot Cheryl Wood, age 27, in the back and leg as she stood near a doorway.Â  \r\n  She was fatally shot after she fell to the floor, described by the prosecutor \r\n  as an execution-style slaying.\r\nAppellant continued firing his pistol at other employees \r\n  in other areas of the plant.Â  Witnesses observed Appellant reload his pistol \r\n  several times as he progressed through the plant.Â  Investigators recovered four \r\n  empty, eight-round magazines at the scene, plus four full magazines and 123 \r\n  additional rounds in Appellantâ€™s possession.Â  Some witnesses related Appellant \r\n  was â€œscreaming somethingâ€ unintelligible during the shootings.\r\nAppellant walked to an upstairs office, shooting through glass windows \r\n  and doors.Â  He entered an office, lay down on the floor, and swallowed or attempted \r\n  to swallow an insecticide.Â  Police found Appellant lying there semi-conscious, \r\n  arrested him, and transported him to a hospital.\r\nThe trial judge ruled Appellant competent to stand trial.Â  \r\n  Appellant did not present witnesses or evidence during the guilt or sentencing \r\n  phases of the trial.Â  He refused before trial to identify for his attorneys \r\n  family or friends as favorable witnesses.Â Â  During the sentencing phase, Appellant \r\n  refused to allow his attorneys to call thirteen mitigation witnesses to present \r\n  evidence that life imprisonment without parole was the appropriate sentence.Â  \r\n\r\nAppellantâ€™s refusal prompted the trial judge to again have \r\n  Appellant examined during the trial by a psychiatrist, who again testified Appellant \r\n  was competent.Â  Although his attorneys had evidence of the presence of the hallucinogenic \r\n  drug LSD in his body when the shootings occurred, Appellant told the judge â€œI \r\n  was in total control of my faculties at the time.â€\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the trial judge err in excusing a potential juror for cause during \r\n  individual voir dire without allowing defense counsel to examine her about personal \r\n  religious beliefs that would preclude her from finding Appellant guilty of the \r\n  crimes charged?\r\nII.Â  Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow a surviving victim, called \r\n  by the State to provide victim-impact evidence, to testify on cross-examination \r\n  that he previously had stated Appellant should not receive the death penalty?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits only to review \r\n  errors of law which have been properly preserved, i.e., the issue has been raised \r\n  to and ruled on by the trial court.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d \r\n  61, 65 (1973); State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 113, 485 S.E.2d 360, 363 \r\n  (1997).Â  The appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  made in response to preliminary motions when there is conflicting testimony, \r\n  or when the findings are supported by any evidence and not clearly erroneous \r\n  or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, \r\n  452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000); State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, 193, \r\n  493 S.E.2d 349, 352 (1997).Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter \r\n  addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not \r\n  be disturbed in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion accompanied by \r\n  probable prejudice.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, \r\n  93 (2002); State v. Frank, 262 S.C. 526, 533, 205 S.E.2d 827, 830 (1974).Â  \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either \r\n  lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. \r\n  McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000); State v. Manning, \r\n  329 S.C. 1, 7, 495 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1997).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Individual voir dire issue\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in excusing a potential \r\n  juror (Juror) for cause during individual voir dire without first permitting \r\n  his lawyers to personally examine her.Â  Appellant contends the judge did not \r\n  have the discretion to excuse Juror.Â  We disagree.\r\nJuror was the fourth venireman examined during individual \r\n  voir dire.Â  Responding to questions from the trial judge, Juror testified she \r\n  would accept and apply the law as instructed by the court.Â  She testified she \r\n  could find a defendant not guilty in a criminal case; however, she could not \r\n  find a defendant guilty.Â  Juror testified she was a member of the â€œHolinessâ€ \r\n  religion, did not believe in judging anyone, and would be unable under any circumstances \r\n  to find a defendant guilty.Â  Juror testified, â€œI mean, they could be guilty \r\n  but Iâ€™m not going to sit on the jury stand and say that theyâ€™re guilty because \r\n  itâ€™s not right to say whether theyâ€™re guilty or not.â€ \r\nThe judge and attorneys discussed Jurorâ€™s responses outside \r\n  her presence.Â  The judge requested Appellantâ€™s attorneys suggest questions he \r\n  might ask Juror.Â  No questions were suggested, but Appellantâ€™s attorneys requested \r\n  an opportunity to examine and possibly rehabilitate Juror by clarifying her \r\n  responses.Â  The judge denied the request, but examined her further about the \r\n  source of her beliefs.Â  Juror testified her beliefs were personal, and she was \r\n  unaware of any pastoral counseling or similar program she could undergo in order \r\n  to sit in judgment of another person.Â  Juror testified she could not find someone \r\n  guilty in â€œso serious as this case isâ€ and she did not â€œwant to have [any] part \r\n  in saying what, you know, where heâ€™s going to be at, you know.â€\r\nThe judge excused Juror for cause over defense counselâ€™s \r\n  objection, relying primarily on State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d \r\n  99 (1999). \r\nâ€œThe presiding judge shall determine whether any juror is \r\n  disqualified or exempted by law and only he shall disqualify or excuse any juror \r\n  as may be provided by law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1010 (Supp. 2003).Â  The authority \r\n  and responsibility of the trial court is to focus the scope of the voir dire \r\n  examination as set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1020 (Supp. 2003).Â  State \r\n  v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 103, 501 S.E.2d 122, 127 (1998) (citing State v. \r\n  Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619 (1984)).Â  A capital defendant has the \r\n  right to examine jurors through counsel pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(D) \r\n  (Supp. 2003), but that statute does not enlarge the scope of voir dire permitted \r\n  under Section 14-7-1020. [2] Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The scope of voir dire and the manner in which it is conducted generally \r\n  are left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Id. (citing State \r\n  v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 299 S.E.2d 686 (1982), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)). \r\n&nbsp;â€œVoir dire examination serves the dual purposes of enabling the court \r\n  to select an impartial jury and assisting counsel in exercising peremptory challenges.â€Â  \r\n  Muâ€™Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 431, 111 S.Ct. 1899, 1908, 114 L.Ed.2d \r\n  493, 509 (1991).Â  A capital defendantâ€™s right to voir dire, while grounded in \r\n  statutory law, also is rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \r\n  of the U.S. Constitution.Â  See id.; Morgan v. Illinois, \r\n  504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, 503 (1992).Â  To be \r\n  constitutionally compelled, it is not enough that a question may be helpful.Â  \r\n  Rather, the trial courtâ€™s failure to ask or allow a question must render the \r\n  defendantâ€™s trial fundamentally unfair.Â  Muâ€™Min, 500 U.S. at 425, 111 \r\n  S.Ct. at 1905, 114 L.Ed.2d at 506; State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 10, 512 \r\n  S.E.2d 99, 103 (1999).Â  \r\nAn appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s disqualification \r\n  of a prospective juror when there is a reasonable basis from which the trial \r\n  court could have concluded the juror would not have been able to faithfully \r\n  discharge his responsibilities as a juror under the law.Â  Tucker, 334 \r\n  S.C. at 11, 512 S.E.2d at 104 (citing State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 \r\n  S.E.2d 157 (1990)).\r\nWe conclude the trial judge properly excused Juror for cause.Â  \r\n  Section 14-7-1010 requires the judge determine whether a juror is disqualified \r\n  or exempted by law, a determination that may be made before parties are given \r\n  an opportunity to examine the juror in a death penalty case.Â  A juror who testifies \r\n  she would not be able to find a criminal defendant guilty under any circumstances \r\n  is disqualified by law.Â  Such a person may not be seated because she would be \r\n  unable to fulfill her duties as a juror or apply the law as it is given to her \r\n  by the court.Â  See also State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 5, 313 S.E.2d \r\n  619, 621 (1984) (court repeatedly has said test of jurorâ€™s qualification under \r\n  Section 16-3-20 is ability to both reach a verdict of either guilt or innocence \r\n  and, if necessary, to vote for death sentence).\r\nIn addition, the trial judgeâ€™s excusal of Juror is supported \r\n  by Tucker, supra.Â  In that case, the trial court excused for cause \r\n  a juror, a Jehovahâ€™s Witness, because the juror stated he could not sit in judgment \r\n  without undergoing religious counseling that might take four days.Â  The juror \r\n  was excused during the general qualifying of the jury pool.Â  We rejected the \r\n  argument that the excusal improperly prevented defense counsel from rehabilitating \r\n  the juror during individual voir dire as to his views on the death penalty and \r\n  the special circumstances which might allow him to sit as a juror.Â  We found \r\n  the trial court properly excluded the juror because his religious beliefs which \r\n  prohibit judging another person would prevent or substantially impair the performance \r\n  of jurorâ€™s duties; therefore, a reasonable basis existed in support of the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s excusal of the juror for cause.Â  Tucker, 334 S.C. at 10-11, 512 \r\n  S.E.2d at 103-104.\r\nIn the present case, the trial judgeâ€™s lengthy colloquy \r\n  with Juror revealed she would be unable to return a verdict of guilty under \r\n  any circumstances.Â  Her belief she should not sit in judgment of another rendered \r\n  her incapable of fulfilling her basic responsibilities as a juror, and would \r\n  have prevented or substantially impaired the performance of her duties as a \r\n  juror.Â  Consequently, a reasonable basis existed for the trial judgeâ€™s excusal \r\n  for cause of Juror.Â  See Sections 14-7-1010 and -1020; Tucker, \r\n  supra; Plath, supra.Â  Furthermore, we conclude her excusal \r\n  for cause did not render Appellantâ€™s trial fundamentally unfair.Â  See \r\n  Muâ€™Min, supra; Tucker, supra.\r\nAppellant argues we should find State v. Atkins, \r\n  293 S.C. 294, 360 S.E.2d 302 (1987), overruled on other grounds by Torrence, \r\n  supra, to be controlling, not Tucker.Â  In Atkins, the trial \r\n  court excused four potential jurors for cause, without allowing counsel for \r\n  either side to examine them, after concluding they were opposed to the death \r\n  penalty.\r\nWe emphasized in Atkins that case law and the mandatory \r\n  language of Section 16-3-20(D) â€œmake it clear that the trial courtâ€™s discretion \r\n  does not extend so far as to authorize it to refuse counsel the right to conduct \r\n  any examination at all in a capital case.Â  When our legislature has seen fit \r\n  to enact special statutory requirements to be followed in death penalty cases, \r\n  the courts should endeavor to see that these are strictly followed.â€Â  Atkins, \r\n  293 S.C. at 297, 360 S.E.2d at 304. \r\nWe explained in Atkins that further examination by \r\n  counsel might reveal the juror would be able to subordinate his personal views \r\n  and apply the law of the state.Â  The error could not be deemed harmless as the \r\n  defendant was sentenced to death; therefore, we reversed and remanded for a \r\n  new penalty phase proceeding.Â  Id; see also State v. Owens, \r\n  277 S.C. 189, 192, 284 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1981) (finding error in trial courtâ€™s \r\n  dismissal of two potential jurors for cause, without allowing defense counsel \r\n  to examine them, when jurors indicated opposition to death penalty, although \r\n  issue was moot because defendant was given a life sentence). \r\n Atkins is distinguishable on two grounds.Â  First, \r\n  the juror qualification issue in Atkins was the ability of jurors to \r\n  consider both the death penalty and life imprisonment.Â  In the present case, \r\n  the qualification issue was whether Juror believed she could sit on a jury in \r\n  judgment of another person at all.Â  Her comments and belief she could never \r\n  find someone guilty in such a serious case disqualified her, at a more fundamental \r\n  level than the jurors in Atkins, to serve.Â  See Plath, \r\n  supra. \r\nSecond, it is clear from this record that further examination \r\n  of Juror would have been unlikely to reveal she could subordinate her views \r\n  and apply the law of the state.Â  Juror unequivocally and repeatedly stated during \r\n  thorough examination by the trial judge she would be unable to find the defendant \r\n  guilty.Â  In fact, Appellantâ€™s attorneys were given an opportunity to suggest \r\n  additional questions to the trial judge, but suggested none.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  the trial judge after conferring with counsel examined Juror further to ascertain \r\n  the basis of her beliefs.\r\nAppellant also contends Tucker is distinguishable \r\n  because Juror was excused during individual voir dire, while the juror in Tucker \r\n  was excused during the general juror qualification process.Â  This distinction \r\n  is unpersuasive because the basic requirement of ensuring a juror is qualified \r\n  and able to render a fair and just verdict to either party based on the facts \r\n  and the law applies throughout the jury selection process.\r\nWe do not intend, by this decision or the decision in Tucker, \r\n  to dilute the mandate of Section 16-3-20(D) as expressed in Atkins, supra.Â  \r\n  When the record reveals a juror plainly is not qualified, after thorough examination \r\n  by the trial judge, to serve and it does not reasonably appear further examination \r\n  would likely reveal the juror could subordinate his views and apply the law \r\n  of the state, a reasonable basis exists for excusal for cause of the juror without \r\n  further examination by defense counsel.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not \r\n  err and properly exercised his discretion in excusing Juror for cause.Â  \r\nII.Â  Cross-examination of victim \r\n  impact witness\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred by refusing to \r\n  allow a surviving victim to testify on cross-examination during the sentencing \r\n  phase of the trial that he did not personally believe appellant should receive \r\n  the death penalty.Â  We disagree.\r\nSecurity officer Vance testified during both the guilt and \r\n  sentencing phases of the trial.Â  Vance was shot once in the upper abdomen by \r\n  Appellant, resulting in temporary paralysis in his legs, rendering him totally \r\n  disabled, unable to work.Â  Vance testified he suffers constant, intense pain \r\n  requiring daily medications.Â  He has weekly psychiatric appointments and has \r\n  been diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.Â  Vance testified \r\n  he knew Appellant only by sight and had little or no interaction with him on \r\n  the job.\r\nDuring cross-examination in the sentencing phase, Appellantâ€™s \r\n  attorney attempted to question Vance about a statement he made to a newspaper \r\n  reporter shortly after the shootings, in which Vance reportedly said Appellant \r\n  should not receive the death penalty.Â  The trial judge sustained the Stateâ€™s \r\n  objection and did not allow the testimony. [3] \r\nA capital defendant is prohibited from directly eliciting \r\n  the opinion of family members or other penalty-phase witnesses about the appropriate \r\n  penalty.Â  Such questions go to the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury \r\n  - life in prison versus the death penalty - and are properly reserved for determination \r\n  by the jury.Â  State v. Matthews, 296 S.C. 379, 393, 373 S.E.2d 587, 595 \r\n  (1988) (affirming exclusion of family membersâ€™ opinion about appropriate penalty \r\n  and what effect the death penalty would have on them, although defendant could \r\n  show no prejudice because his mother expressed her opinion to jury despite judgeâ€™s \r\n  ruling); State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d 582 (1981) (whether \r\n  death penalty should be imposed is an ultimate issue reserved for juryâ€™s determination), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by Torrence, supra.\r\nSimilarly, a capital defendant may not present a penalty-phase \r\n  witness to testify explicitly what verdict the jury â€œoughtâ€ to reach.Â  Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. at 51, 406 S.E.2d at 319.Â  A capital defendant may not present witnesses \r\n  merely to testify of their religious or philosophical attitudes about the death \r\n  penalty.Â  Id.\r\nOn the other hand, a capital defendant may present witnesses \r\n  who know and care for him, and who are willing on that basis to plead with the \r\n  jury for mercy on his behalf.Â  Thus, a close relative of a defendant, such as \r\n  his mother, may make a general plea for mercy for the life of her son.Â  Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. at 51, 406 S.E.2d at 319.Â  A close relative of a defendant, such as \r\n  his sister, may be asked whether she wants the defendant to die, which is akin \r\n  to asking her to make a general plea for mercy and not explicitly directed toward \r\n  eliciting her opinion of what verdict the jury should reach.Â  State v. Johnson, \r\n  338 S.C. 114, 125-127, 525 S.E.2d 519, 524-525 (2000) (while trial court erred \r\n  in limiting sisterâ€™s testimony, defendant was not prejudiced because sister \r\n  was able to make a general plea for mercy on his behalf and clearly expressed \r\n  her love and affection for him).\r\nWe are unpersuaded by Appellantâ€™s argument he should have \r\n  been allowed to cross-examine Vance pursuant to Torrence and Johnson.Â  \r\n  We accept as true the proffer by Appellantâ€™s attorney Vance would testify he \r\n  told the media shortly after the shootings he did not personally believe Appellant \r\n  should receive the death penalty.Â  However, such a statement by Vance would \r\n  not constitute a plea for mercy on behalf of Appellant.Â  Instead, it would constitute \r\n  Vanceâ€™s opinion of what verdict - life in prison versus the death penalty - \r\n  the jury should reach.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge properly disallowed the \r\n  question, recognizing it was an attempt to elicit an inadmissible opinion from \r\n  a witness.Â  See Matthews, 296 S.C. at 393, 373 S.E.2d at 595.\r\nPROPORTIONALITY \r\n  REVIEW\r\nAs required, we conduct a proportionality review \r\n  of Appellantâ€™s death sentence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  The United \r\n  States Constitution prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when it is \r\n  either excessive or disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  \r\n  State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 590, 300 S.E.2d 63, 74 (1982).Â  In conducting \r\n  a proportionality review, we search for similar cases in which the death sentence \r\n  has been upheld.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the \r\n  death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary \r\n  factor, and the juryâ€™s finding of statutory aggravating circumstances for each \r\n  of the four murders is supported by the evidence.Â  Furthermore, a Â review of \r\n  prior cases shows the death sentence in this case is proportionate to that in \r\n  similar cases and is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the crime.Â  See \r\n  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003) (death penalty warranted \r\n  for defendant convicted of murders of former live-in lover, loverâ€™s thirteen \r\n  year-old daughter, and loverâ€™s mother; aggravating circumstances included two \r\n  or more persons were murdered pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, and \r\n  murder was committed during commission of burglary); State v. Wilson, \r\n  306 S.C. 498, 413 S.E.2d 19 (1992) (death penalty warranted where defendant \r\n  was convicted of two counts of murdering two schoolchildren, eight counts of \r\n  assault and battery with intent to kill, one count of assault and battery of \r\n  a high and aggravated nature, and one count of illegally carrying a firearm \r\n  in shootings at an elementary school); State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 721 (2000) (death penalty warranted where defendant shot and killed \r\n  former girlfriend and another woman in a home); State v. Rosemond, 335 \r\n  S.C. 593, 518 S.E.2d 588 (1999) (death penalty warranted where defendant shot \r\n  and killed former girlfriend and her young daughter in their home); State \r\n  v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 347 (1998) (death penalty warranted where \r\n  defendant shot and killed both parents of his former girlfriend).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and \r\n  Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  \r\n    Appellant did not present a defense.Â  His lawyersâ€™ examination of some plant \r\n    employees during the trial indicated Appellant may have been upset because \r\n    he had not received a promotion from machine operator to the tool and dye \r\n    division.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  \r\n    Section 14-7-1020 provides:\r\n  \r\n  The court shall, on motion of either party in the suit, \r\n    examine on oath any person who is called as a juror to know whether he is \r\n    related to either party, has any interest in the cause, has expressed or formed \r\n    any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein, and the party \r\n    objecting to the juror may introduce any other competent evidence in support \r\n    of the objection.Â  If it appears to the court that the juror is not indifferent \r\n    in the cause, he must be placed aside as to the trial of that cause and another \r\n    must be called.\r\n  \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 16-3-20(D) provides:\r\n  \r\n  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14-7-1020, \r\n    in cases involving capital punishment a person called as a juror must be examined \r\n    by the attorney for the defense.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â Â  \r\n    The judge earlier had refused to allow Appellant to question Vance about the \r\n    same alleged statement to the media during the guilt phase, as it was irrelevant.Â  \r\n    This ruling obviously was proper.Â  Appellant now challenges only the ruling \r\n    during the penalty phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25820","title":"SCE&G v.

(BEC) for a writ \r\n  of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in South Carolina \r\n  Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Town of Awendaw, 351 S.C. 491, 570 S.E.2d 542 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nRural electrical cooperative BEC provided service to all \r\n  of Townâ€™s residents when Town was incorporated in 1992.Â  About 1,033 residents \r\n  live in Town, located in northern Charleston County.Â  Town enacted an ordinance \r\n  and adopted a franchise agreement in 1993 which designated BEC as the primary \r\n  supplier of electricity to Town and granted BEC the right to use public streets \r\n  to construct and maintain its facilities.Â  In exchange, BEC agreed to pay Town \r\n  an annual franchise fee equaling three percent of its gross revenues from the \r\n  sale of electricity within Townâ€™s limits.\r\nTown subsequently annexed the property of residents who \r\n  are served by South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co., a wholly owned subsidiary \r\n  of SCANA Corp. (collectively, SCE&amp;G).Â  Some twenty-six residential customers \r\n  inside Townâ€™s limits are now served by SCE&amp;G, which has about 770 feet of \r\n  line on four poles located along public streets in Townâ€™s limits.Â  SCE&amp;G \r\n  served those customers prior to annexation because they were located within \r\n  unincorporated areas previously assigned to the company by the S.C. Public Service \r\n  Commission pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-640 (1976).\r\nTown requested SCE&amp;G enter into a franchise agreement.Â  \r\n  Town and SCE&amp;G unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the terms of such an \r\n  agreement from 1995 to 1999.Â  In late 1998, Town enacted a business license \r\n  ordinance.Â  That ordinance imposed franchise fees of three percent of gross \r\n  revenues collected on sales within Townâ€™s limits on various utility providers, \r\n  including electrical utilities.Â  SCE&amp;G paid franchise fees to Town under \r\n  protest, paying $941 in 1999 and $760 in 2000.\r\nIn 1999, SCE&amp;G initiated a lawsuit challenging Townâ€™s \r\n  authority to impose a franchise fee on SCE&amp;Gâ€™s operations in Townâ€™s limits \r\n  in the absence of a franchise agreement. [1] Â  BEC intervened in support of Town.Â  SCE&amp;G \r\n  subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing because it had no franchise \r\n  agreement with Town, Town had no authority to unilaterally impose a franchise \r\n  fee on SCE&amp;G.Â  SCE&amp;G asserted, inter alia, the resolution of \r\n  the issue is controlled by City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. Co-op, Inc., \r\n  287 S.C. 361, 338 S.E.2d 831 (1985).Â  Town also moved for summary judgment, \r\n  contending the franchise fee was proper under state law and relying primarily \r\n  on BellSouth v. City of Orangeburg, 337 S.C. 35, 522 S.E.2d 804 (1999). \r\n\r\nThe master-in-equity granted Townâ€™s motion for summary judgment, \r\n  concluding the franchise fee is proper under state law and BellSouth, \r\n  supra.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed, interpreting City of Abbeville, \r\n  supra, to prohibit the municipalityâ€™s unilateral imposition of a franchise \r\n  fee because an existing utility provider is allowed to continue serving its \r\n  existing customers after annexation.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ majority distinguished \r\n  BellSouth, reasoning that case did not apply because Town and SCE&amp;G \r\n  never had entered into a franchise agreement, unlike the utility and municipality \r\n  in BellSouth.Â  The dissenting judge would have relied on BellSouth \r\n  to conclude the imposition of the franchise fee was proper, provided it was \r\n  not so unreasonable that it amounted to ouster of an existing utility provider \r\n  following annexation pursuant to City of Abbeville.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this \r\n  Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56, \r\n  SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Osborne \r\n  v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  â€œIn determining whether \r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate \r\n  court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and \r\n  from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding Town lacked the authority to impose \r\n  a franchise fee on an electrical utility provider in the absence of a franchise \r\n  agreement?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTown asserts the Court of Appeals misinterpreted state \r\n  law and this Courtâ€™s precedent to err in holding Town lacked the authority to \r\n  impose a franchise fee on SCE&amp;G in the absence of a franchise agreement.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nGovernmental franchises typically are obtained by service-type, \r\n  monopolistic businesses such as electricity, water, telephone, and cable television \r\n  providers.Â  A franchise constitutes a special privilege granted by the government \r\n  to particular individuals or companies to be exploited for private profits.Â  \r\n  Such franchisees seek permission to use public streets or rights of way in order \r\n  to do business with a municipalityâ€™s residents, and are willing to pay a fee \r\n  for this privilege.Â  Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 \r\n  S.C. 156, 165, 547 S.E.2d 862, 867 (2001); City of Cayce v. AT&amp;T Communications, \r\n  326 S.C. 237, 486 S.E.2d 92 (1997); State ex rel. Daniel v. Broad River Power \r\n  Co., 157 S.C. 1, 153 S.E. 537, 548 (1929).Â  While a franchise is a privilege, \r\n  it also is viewed as a function delegated to private individuals to be performed \r\n  for the furtherance of the public welfare and subject to public control.Â  12 \r\n  McQuillin Mun. Corp. Â§ 34.01 (3d ed. 1995).\r\nA municipality in South Carolina may enact ordinances and \r\n  regulations which â€œgrant franchises for the use of public streets and make charges \r\n  for them,â€ provided the ordinances and regulations are consistent with the Constitution \r\n  and general law of the state.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (Supp. 2003).Â  The state \r\n  Constitution vests the authority to make such decisions in a municipalityâ€™s \r\n  governing body.Â  See S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 15 (prohibiting Legislature \r\n  from enacting any law which grants the right to a utility provider to construct, \r\n  operate, or use the public streets or public property without first obtaining \r\n  the consent of the municipality).Â  \r\nWhen an area is incorporated into a new municipality or \r\n  annexed into an existing one, the municipality may not oust or evict a utility \r\n  provider which previously has lawfully served the area, in the absence of statutorily \r\n  delegated powers of eminent domain authorizing such an ouster.Â  City of Abbeville, \r\n  287 S.C. at 370-371, 338 S.E.2d at 836 (construing S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ \r\n  15 and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-670, and rejecting challenges to legitimacy and \r\n  constitutionality of amended statute which restricts municipalityâ€™s right to \r\n  oust existing utility providers by exercising eminent domain).\r\nUnder City of Abbeville, a franchisee possessing \r\n  a valid territorial assignment to serve an area subsequently annexed or newly \r\n  incorporated is permitted to continue serving premises in that area which were \r\n  being served as of the date of the annexation or incorporation.Â  However, the \r\n  franchisee is prohibited, without prior consent of the municipality, from extending \r\n  or expanding service in that area by the use of any streets, alley, public property, \r\n  or public ways after the date of the annexation or incorporation.Â  Id.\r\nIn BellSouth, we concluded a municipality may exercise \r\n  its authority under Â§ 5-7-30 to unilaterally impose a franchise fee on a utility \r\n  provider even though no such fee had ever been imposed during the existence \r\n  of a long-term franchise agreement.Â  BellSouth, 337 S.C. 35, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  804.Â  In that case, BellSouth operated under an 1894 franchise ordinance that \r\n  allowed it to use the public streets of the city of Orangeburg to erect poles \r\n  and wires and exempted BellSouth from â€œall municipal taxation, licenses, or \r\n  rentalsâ€ for a term of five years.Â  The original franchise agreement was expanded \r\n  in 1914 to include underground use of public streets, but again no fee was required.Â  \r\n  BellSouth never had been obligated to pay a franchise fee until the city of \r\n  Orangeburg enacted one by ordinance in 1993, ninety-nine years after the original \r\n  agreement.Â  BellSouth, 337 S.C. at 38-39, 522 S.E.2d at 806.\r\nWe upheld the unilaterally imposed franchise fee, rejecting BellSouthâ€™s \r\n  arguments the fee actually is an impermissible tax, it conflicted with federal \r\n  telecommunications law, the ordinance exceeded the municipalityâ€™s power to manage \r\n  public rights of way, the fee was not fair and reasonable, and it violated a \r\n  state statute which granted telephone companies the right to construct and maintain \r\n  its lines along public highways.Â  We concluded the franchise fee was consistent \r\n  with the state Constitution and state and federal law.Â  Id. at 39-46, \r\n  522 S.E.2d at 806-809. \r\nNeither BellSouth nor City of Abbeville directly \r\n  answers the question presented in this case, i.e., whether Town may impose a \r\n  franchise fee on SCE&amp;G in the absence of a franchise agreement.Â  BellSouth \r\n  is not directly on point because, as recognized in the Court of Appealsâ€™ majority \r\n  and dissenting opinions, the franchise fee was unilaterally imposed by a municipality \r\n  with an existing franchise agreement with the utility provider.Â  City of \r\n  Abbeville stands for the proposition that a utility providerâ€™s right to \r\n  serve its present customers continues upon annexation or incorporation, but \r\n  does not address the fee issue.\r\nWe conclude that in areas which are subsequently annexed \r\n  or newly incorporated, a new relationship is created by operation of law between \r\n  the municipality and the existing utility provider.Â  The new relationship is \r\n  municipality as franchisor and utility provider as franchisee, although the \r\n  relationship obviously is more limited in scope and nature than the typical \r\n  franchisor-franchisee relationship due to the lack of a franchise agreement. \r\n\r\nWe base our decision primarily on Â§ 5-7-30, which authorizes \r\n  a municipality to â€œmake chargesâ€ for the use of public streets, and on City \r\n  of Abbeville, supra.Â  The existing utility provider has the right \r\n  to continue serving its existing customers in subsequently annexed or newly \r\n  incorporated areas, and the municipality is prohibited from ousting the utility \r\n  provider, as we decided in City of Abbeville.Â  The utility provider does \r\n  not, however, have the right to continue using public streets which have come \r\n  under the purview and control of the municipality in pursuit of the utilityâ€™s \r\n  for-profit business interests without payment of a reasonable fee to the municipality. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, a municipality may, consistent with Â§ 5-7-30 \r\n  and S.C. Const. article VIII, Â§ 15, impose by ordinance a reasonable franchise \r\n  fee on an existing utility provider in subsequently annexed or newly incorporated \r\n  areas.Â  The amount of such a fee must be reasonable, as an inordinate fee would \r\n  be unreasonable and could constitute ouster pursuant to City of Abbeville, \r\n  supra.Â  See also BellSouth, 337 S.C. at 44, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  at 808 (finding no evidence imposition of annual franchise fee of five percent \r\n  of gross revenue and one-time administrative fee would actually effect an ouster \r\n  of BellSouth from its service of city residents).\r\nThis result is consistent with BellSouth, supra.Â  \r\n  While a franchise agreement existed in that case, the municipalityâ€™s imposition \r\n  of a franchise fee without the utility providerâ€™s consent admittedly was an \r\n  important and substantive change in the agreement.Â  We consistently have taken \r\n  the view a utility provider generally should not be allowed free use of a municipalityâ€™s \r\n  streets in light of the constitutional and statutory authority reserving or \r\n  granting power to municipalities to impose charges for such use.Â  See City \r\n  of Cayce, 326 S.C. 237, 486 S.E.2d 92 (holding the municipal consent power \r\n  provided by Article VIII, Â§ 15 of the constitution allows a municipality, before \r\n  facilities are constructed, to require payment of a fee as a condition of permitting \r\n  a telephone utility to construct and operate a fiber optic cable system using \r\n  public streets, even though fee could not be imposed as a franchise fee because \r\n  service relationship between municipality and utility was too attenuated to \r\n  be characterized as a franchise); see also Athens-Clarke County v. \r\n  Walton Elec. Membership Corp., 454 S.E.2d 510, 512-513 (Ga. 1995) (payment \r\n  of a franchise fee is a plausible prerequisite to the grant of a franchise; \r\n  therefore, municipality may impose a franchise fee in the absence of a franchise \r\n  agreement when the municipality enacts a franchise ordinance conditioning the \r\n  future grant of a franchise on the payment of a reasonable franchise fee).\r\nWe do not conclude a municipality may unilaterally impose \r\n  a franchise agreement on a utility provider.Â  Various terms and conditions of \r\n  an agreement generally are set forth in a written, enforceable contract between \r\n  the municipality and the franchisee.Â  See 12 McQuillin Â§Â§ 34.06, \r\n  34.45 and 34.45.10; 2 Antieau on Local Government Law Â§ 28.01 (2d ed. \r\n  2003).Â  A municipality does not have the authority to force a utility provider \r\n  to accept a franchise agreement.Â  See 12 McQuillin Â§ 34.74 (municipality \r\n  may not, under pretense of regulation as exercise of police power, force a franchise \r\n  agreement on a utility provider); 2 Antieau Â§ 28.01 and 28.05 (general \r\n  rule is that franchise agreement must be accepted by franchisee in order to \r\n  be valid). \r\nTherefore, a municipality may impose a reasonable franchise \r\n  fee, contained in a duly enacted ordinance, on an existing utility provider \r\n  in subsequently annexed or newly incorporated areas.Â  The municipality and utility \r\n  provider remain free to negotiate terms and enter into a traditional franchise \r\n  agreement to be adopted in the usual fashion by a franchise ordinance.Â  See \r\n  Quality Towing, 345 S.C. at 165-167, 547 S.E.2d at 867 (franchise contract \r\n  between city and single company, which granted single company the exclusive \r\n  right to charge the public for a vendorâ€™s services, was a classic example of \r\n  a franchise; however, the contract was invalid because the city had not granted \r\n  the franchise by enacting an ordinance as required by statute).\r\nIn the present case, a limited relationship of franchisor \r\n  and franchisee was created by law when Town annexed areas served by SCE&amp;G.Â  \r\n  Town has imposed a franchise fee on SCE&amp;G of three percent of gross revenue \r\n  the company earns from the sale of electricity within Townâ€™s limits.Â  The fee \r\n  imposed on SCE&amp;G is the same Town collects from BEC under a franchise agreement, \r\n  and the record reveals it is comparable to franchise fees imposed by other municipalities \r\n  across South Carolina.Â  Town imposed the fee in a duly enacted business license \r\n  ordinance.Â  Accordingly, the franchise fee is a lawful obligation of SCE&amp;G.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse, concluding a municipality may, consistent with \r\n  Â§ 5-7-30 and S.C. Const. article VIII, Â§ 15, impose by ordinance a reasonable \r\n  franchise fee on an existing utility provider in subsequently annexed or newly \r\n  incorporated areas.Â  We remand this matter to the circuit court for entry of \r\n  summary judgment in favor of Town. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  \r\n    The partiesâ€™ initial efforts to resolve the dispute before the Charleston \r\n    County Business License/Users Fee Appeals Board and their original court pleadings \r\n    focused on the legitimacy of Townâ€™s imposition of a business license tax.Â  \r\n    Town amended its Answer to clarify it was imposing a franchise fee - not a \r\n    business license tax - following the deposition of expert Roy D. Bates and \r\n    the publication of BellSouth v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Deborah S. McKeown, Assistant \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\r\nNorris O. Rearden, of Walterboro, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a \r\n  sanction pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement \r\n  and impose a six month suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement \r\n  are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nI.\r\nDefendant A was incarcerated on October 24, 2003; he paid \r\n  a $750 cash bond to respondent on that date.Â  Respondent prepared a deposit \r\n  ticket for his magistrate account dated October 26, 2003.Â  The ticket listed \r\n  the $750 bond money deposit, although respondent did not deposit the bond money \r\n  into his magistrate account on that date.Â  \r\nOn October 26, 2003, respondent issued a check from his \r\n  magistrate account payable to Magistrate Cobb for $750 to transmit Defendant \r\n  Aâ€™s bond money.Â  On October 31, 2003, the check was returned from the bank due \r\n  to insufficient funds and an overdraft fee was assessed against respondentâ€™s \r\n  magistrate account.Â  \r\nRespondent deposited Defendant Aâ€™s bond money into his \r\n  magistrate account on November 13, 2003.Â  Respondent represents he inadvertently \r\n  left the bond money in his deposit book until he learned the check had been \r\n  returned from the bank for insufficient funds.Â  Respondent acknowledges he failed \r\n  to deposit Defendant Aâ€™s bond money into his magistrate account in a timely \r\n  manner.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to report the returned check to South Carolina \r\n  Court Administration and ODC as required by the Order of the Chief Justice dated \r\n  November 9, 1999.Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nDefendant B was incarcerated on June 14, 2003, and, on that \r\n  date, paid a $1,164 cash bond to respondent.Â  After receiving Defendant Bâ€™s \r\n  bond money, respondent neglected to sign the â€œAuthorization for Release on Bondâ€ \r\n  form for Defendant B and, as a result, Defendant B was not released from jail \r\n  for six days.Â  Respondent represents his failure to sign the form was an oversight \r\n  and the jail staff did not bring Defendant Bâ€™s continued incarceration to his \r\n  attention.Â  \r\nRespondent prepared a deposit ticket for his magistrate \r\n  account dated July 25, 2003, (forty-one days after Defendant Bâ€™s original bond \r\n  money was received) that listed Defendant Bâ€™s bond money for deposit although \r\n  this money was not deposited in theÂ  magistrate account until August 4, 2003 \r\n  (fifty-one days after Defendant Bâ€™s bond money was received).Â  Respondent offers \r\n  no explanation as to the location of these funds from June 14 until August 4; \r\n  he offers no explanation why these funds were not deposited into his magistrate \r\n  account in a timely manner.Â  \r\nOn July 25, 2003, respondent issued a check from his magistrate \r\n  account payable to Magistrate Campbell for $1,164 to transmit Defendant Bâ€™s \r\n  bond money, but there were insufficient funds in the account to honor the check.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring Defendant Bâ€™s prolonged incarceration, Defendant \r\n  B hired a bail bondsman who paid an additional $1,172 bond on his behalf on \r\n  June 20, 2003.Â  On September 5, 2003, respondent returned Defendant Bâ€™s excess \r\n  bond money which had been paid as a result of his failure to execute the appropriate \r\n  release form (seventy-seven days after Defendant B paid the excess bond).Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges he failed to deposit Defendant Bâ€™s \r\n  bond money into his magistrate account in a timely manner as required by the \r\n  Order of the Chief Justice dated November 9, 1999.\r\nIII.\r\nODCâ€™s review of respondentâ€™s financial records reveals the \r\n  majority of information entered by respondent in his receipt books and deposit \r\n  tickets is illegible.Â  Respondent acknowledges that, in the majority of cases, \r\n  he cannot identify the defendants or the amount of bail received due to his \r\n  inadequate recordkeeping.Â  Additionally, the deposit tickets maintained by respondent \r\n  do not specify receipt numbers, contrary to the Order of the Chief Justice dated \r\n  November 9, 1999.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that, as a result of his poor recordkeeping, \r\n  as set forth in Parts I, II, and III, of this opinion, he has failed to comply \r\n  with Sections II(A) (frequency of bank deposits), IIC(2) (information which \r\n  must included on bank deposit slips), IIG (additional information which must \r\n  be included on bank deposit slips),Â  IIIB (procedure for handling bonds collected \r\n  from other magistrates, municipal judges, and clerks of court), and VIII (requirement \r\n  that magistrate immediately report in writing to Office of Court Administration \r\n  and ODC when any shortage of magistrate funds are noted or reported) of the \r\n  Order of the Chief Justice dated November 9, 1999.Â  \r\nCooperation with ODC\r\nODC states that, under best information and belief, respondent \r\n  has fully cooperated with its inquiries into these matters.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, \r\n  maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe \r\n  those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will \r\n  be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of \r\n  impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with \r\n  the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence \r\n  in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 3 (judge shall perform \r\n  the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3B(2) (judge \r\n  shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon \r\n  3B(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and \r\n  fairly); and Canon 3(C)(1) (judge shall diligently discharge his or her administrative \r\n  responsibilities without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence \r\n  in judicial administration, and should cooperate with other judges and court \r\n  officials in the administration of court business).Â \r\nBy violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has \r\n  also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In addition, he violated Rule 7(a)(7), RJDE, by willfully \r\n  violating a valid court order issued by a court of this state.Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a suspension from \r\n  judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and suspend respondent for six (6) months.Â  Before he may resume his judicial \r\n  duties, respondent shall attend and successfully complete the magistrate orientation \r\n  seminar for newly appointed magistrates and municipal judges. \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Davis Howser, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the sanction of disbarment.Â  \r\n  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this \r\n  state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nI.\r\nRespondent was admitted to practice law in November \r\n  2000.Â Â  Around March 2001, respondent entered into a business arrangement with \r\n  Carolina Title Services, Inc., (CTS) through its principal officer and manager \r\n  Amy Cook (Cook).Â  The purpose of the arrangement was to close large volumes \r\n  of real estate loans.Â  Neither Cook nor any other CTS employees were licensed \r\n  to practice law.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUnder respondent and CTSâ€™ arrangement, real estate \r\n  loan transactions would be closed, for the most part, in the following fashion:Â  \r\n  the handling of the underlying transactions were solicited and obtained by CTS; \r\n  the lenders sent the loan packages directly to CTS; CTSâ€™ non-lawyer staff would \r\n  conduct or obtain a title search which was completed by a non-lawyer; the non-lawyer \r\n  staff of CTS would prepare the closing documents; respondent attended closings, \r\n  reviewed closing documents with parties and signed HUD-1 Settlement Statements \r\n  as â€œsettlement agent;â€ thereafter, CTS would see to the recordation of the documents, \r\n  the disbursement of the proceeds of each transaction, the issuance of title \r\n  insurance policies, and other actions necessary to consummate the transactions.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor attending the closings, respondent was usually paid \r\n  a fee of $300 to $350 out of each transaction which was reflected on the Settlement \r\n  Statements.Â  CTS retained amounts collected for title examination, document \r\n  preparation, title insurance commitment/binder fees, and commissions on title \r\n  insurance premiums.Â  \r\nTo implement the foregoing arrangement, respondent opened \r\n  an IOLTA Trust Account at Bank A.Â  This account was styled â€œThe McMillian Law \r\n  Firm Trust Account.â€Â  Respondent gave Cook signatory authority over this trust \r\n  account.Â  The trust account checkbooks, bank statements, and cancelled checks \r\n  were maintained by Cook at the offices of CTS.Â  CTSâ€™ address was used for mailing \r\n  monthly bank statements and cancelled checks.Â  Deposits to and disbursements \r\n  from this account were usually made by Cook and/or employees of CTS without \r\n  respondentâ€™s supervision.Â  \r\nCook was a licensed agent for Chicago Title Insurance Company \r\n  (Chicago Title) which was the primary provider of title insurance for the transactions \r\n  closed in furtherance of the foregoing arrangement and, in most cases, Chicago \r\n  Title issued insured closing letters in connection with these transactions.Â  \r\n  Usually, loan packages were sent directly from lenders to CTS and almost all \r\n  negotiations and discussions with lenders related to these transactions were \r\n  handled by the staff of CTS and not respondent.Â  \r\nUnder this arrangement, approximately three hundred transactions \r\n  were closed by CTS with respondentâ€™s assistance and/or using one of respondentâ€™s \r\n  trust accounts between March or April 2001 and April 2002.Â  Respondent estimates \r\n  that he was present at 80% to 95% of the closings, however, because of the large \r\n  volume of transactions, it was impossible for him to attend all the closings.Â  \r\n  When respondent did not attend, closings were conducted by CTSâ€™ non-lawyer staff \r\n  without the presence of a licensed attorney.Â  In those cases, someone at CTS \r\n  would sign respondentâ€™s name to the HUD-1 Settlement Statements and any other \r\n  documents requiring respondentâ€™s signature.Â  While respondent never specifically \r\n  authorized anyone else to sign his name on documents, on a few occasions, respondent \r\n  had actual knowledge that Cook and/or one or more employees at CTS were signing \r\n  his name to closing documents and had constructive knowledge that this was occurring \r\n  on the other occasions when respondent was unable to be present at closings.Â  \r\n  Notwithstanding this knowledge, respondent did not prohibit Cook or other CTS \r\n  employees from signing his name to closing documents and, by not doing so, gave \r\n  his tacit approval to this practice.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDuring the entire period of the foregoing arrangement with \r\n  CTS, respondent maintained no files concerning the real estate transactions \r\n  (other than a list of closings for which he expected payment from CTS), failed \r\n  to reconcile or even review monthly bank statements, and failed to comply with \r\n  any of the money handling and record keeping requirements of Rule 417, SCACR, \r\n  notwithstanding establishment of an IOLTA Trust Account styled â€œLaw Offices \r\n  of William J. McMillian, III, Trust Account.â€Â  Contrary to Rule 417, SCACR, \r\n  no one involved in these transactions maintained ledgers or placed identifying \r\n  data on checks and deposit slips.Â  Any files maintained on these closings were \r\n  kept by CTS at its offices.Â  \r\nUnder this arrangement, neither clients nor lenders (for \r\n  the most part) were advised of respondentâ€™s limited role in the closing of these \r\n  real estate transactions through CTS.Â  Because respondent provided limited services \r\n  to clients in these closings, the fees charged for his services were excessive.Â  \r\n  By signing the HUD-1 Settlement Statements as â€œsettlement agent,â€ respondent \r\n  gave the parties and lenders the incorrect impression that he had or was going \r\n  to see to the proper disposition of the settlement proceeds when, in fact, he \r\n  did not do so.Â  Respondentâ€™s actions were contrary to the certification requirements \r\n  imposed by the Federal Truth in Lending Act.Â  \r\nBeginning in September 2001, respondent became aware of \r\n  non-sufficient fund (NSF) charges for checks written on the Bank A trust account.Â  \r\n  In November 2001, respondent became aware that there was a negative balance \r\n  of approximately $119,000 in the Bank A trust account.Â  In this time frame, \r\n  respondent learned that one or more lenders would no longer accept checks written \r\n  on this account because of the NSF problems. \r\nAs a result of checks on the Bank A trust account not being accepted \r\n  and because of negative balances in the account, respondent opened a new trust \r\n  account styled â€œMcMillian Law Firm, P.A., IOLTA Trust Accountâ€ at Bank B in \r\n  December 2001.Â  Notwithstanding the difficulties experienced and the irregularities \r\n  reported in the Bank A trust account managed by Cook, respondent allowed Cook \r\n  to be a signatory on the Bank B trust account and continued to allow Cook to \r\n  make deposits to and write checks from both his Bank A and Bank B trust accounts \r\n  in furtherance of closing real estate transactions pursuant to his arrangement \r\n  with CTS.Â  \r\nAfter opening the Bank B trust account, respondent became aware that \r\n  Cook was â€œfloatingâ€ funds between the Bank A and Bank B trust accounts.Â  Presumably, \r\n  the â€œfloatâ€ was necessary in order for checks to clear in spite of shortages \r\n  in the accounts.\r\nIn December 2001 and January 2002, respondent unsuccessfully attempted \r\n  to work with Cook to identify the nature and amounts of the bank account shortages \r\n  and then correct the shortages.Â  On or about February 5, 2002, respondent had \r\n  his last direct dealings with Cook.Â  After that occasion, respondent appeared \r\n  at the closing of one or two more loans for CTS.Â  Respondent ceased attending \r\n  closings for CTS in late March 2002.Â  \r\nAfter respondent ceased, for the most part, attending closings of \r\n  transactions with CTS in January 2002, Cook made arrangements with several other \r\n  attorneys to attend closings on behalf of CTS in place of respondent.Â  Even \r\n  after respondent terminated his working relationship with CTS, respondent continued \r\n  to allow Cook to be a signatory on and have control and use of both the trust \r\n  accounts until respondent was placed on interim suspension on May 1, 2002. \r\nODCâ€™s examination of the Bank A trust account revealed that this \r\n  account was assessed charges for overdrafts and/or NSF checks on approximately \r\n  309 occasions, had a negative balance on approximately sixteen occasions, had \r\n  a negative balance of $372.98 on April 30, 2002, and had shortages of approximately \r\n  $188,000 when the attorney to protect clientsâ€™ interests took charge of that \r\n  account.Â  ODCâ€™s examination of the Bank B trust account indicated overdrafts \r\n  and/or NSF checks on thirty-four occasions and a shortage of $250,000 on April \r\n  30, 2002.Â  \r\nRespondent learned of the approximately $119,000 shortage in the \r\n  Bank A trust account in November 2001, the approximately $188,000 shortage in \r\n  the Bank A trust account in February 2002, and the approximately $250,000 shortage \r\n  in the Bank B trust account in January 2002.Â  Respondent took no action to either \r\n  close the accounts or to remove Cook as signatory on the accounts.Â  Cook continued \r\n  to have the use of and control over both of the trust accounts until they were \r\n  placed under control of an attorney to protect clientsâ€™ interests by this Court.Â  \r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to respondent, Cook directed that Bank A place a â€œsweepâ€ \r\n  order on the Bank A trust account in March 2002.Â  Pursuant to this order, funds \r\n  in the account were â€œsweptâ€ out of that account on a daily basis and into Cookâ€™s \r\n  personal account or into some other account under her control.Â  \r\nChicago Title reported that, in compliance with the terms of its \r\n  title insurance policies and/or its insured closing letters, it had paid out \r\n  approximately $714,214 due to shortages in respondentâ€™s trust accounts and had \r\n  further paid out approximately $36,000 in negligence claims in connection with \r\n  transactions closed by CTS.Â  In addition, Chicago Title has, in the aggregate, \r\n  spent approximately $868,000 due to claims and expenses related to CTS (not \r\n  all of these claims relating to closings attended by respondent, but most being \r\n  related to the use of respondentâ€™s trust accountÂ  by CTS) and that approximately \r\n  sixty claims are still pending against Chicago Title arising out of transactions \r\n  which were closed or were supposed to have been closed by CTS.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn July 20, 2001, respondent used a counter \r\n  check to withdraw $4,140 for his own personal use out of the Bank A trust account.Â  \r\n  Respondent represents that this check was reimbursement for a personal check \r\n  he wrote to facilitate a closing where CTS had depleted the printed checks on \r\n  the Bank A trust account.Â  A personal check from respondentâ€™s personal checking \r\n  account in the amount of $1,765 was deposited into the Bank A trust account \r\n  in the relevant time frame.Â  Respondent explains the balance of $2,375 was for \r\n  unpaid fees and/or other amounts due respondent in connection with closings.Â  \r\n  Respondent cannot now document this representation.Â  \r\nOn September 19, 2001, using a counter check, respondent wrote a \r\n  check on his Bank A trust account for his own personal use in the amount of \r\n  $46,666.87.Â  Respondent represents this check was written to repay himself for \r\n  an advance he had made from his personal checking account to conclude a transaction \r\n  being handled by CTS.Â  There was, in fact, a check written on respondentâ€™s personal \r\n  account deposited to the Bank A trust account on that occasion in the amount \r\n  of $45,916.87.Â  Respondent represents the difference of $750 was for fees owed \r\n  to him in connection with that transaction.Â  Respondent cannot now document \r\n  this representation.Â  \r\nIn December 2001, respondent used a counter check to withdraw $1,504 \r\n  from the Bank A trust account for his own personal use.Â  Respondent represents \r\n  that this withdrawal was made because CTS had depleted the escrow checks, that \r\n  respondent had written a personal check to conclude a closing, and that the \r\n  check was reimbursement for that advance on respondentâ€™s personal checking account.Â  \r\n  No check in that exact amount wasÂ  located in respondentâ€™s personal checking \r\n  account in the relevant time frame. \r\nOn January 7, 2002, respondent withdrew $2,000 from the Bank A trust \r\n  account and on January 25, 2002, withdrew an additional $2,105 from that trust \r\n  account using either counter checks or withdrawal slips.Â  These withdrawals \r\n  were for respondentâ€™s own personal use and benefit.Â  Respondent represents these \r\n  amounts were in payment of fees due him for attending closings for which CTS \r\n  failed and refused to pay him.Â  Respondent cannot now document this representation.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent represents he maintained a list of fees due from CTS on \r\n  which he relied in making these withdrawals to himself out of the Bank A trust \r\n  account.Â  Respondent advises that the list on which he relied cannot be located. \r\n\r\nNone of the above-mentioned checks or withdrawals by respondent from \r\n  the Bank A trust account had any notations indicating the files or clients to \r\n  which they related.Â  Respondent now recognizes that, because of shortages in \r\n  the Bank A trust account, the money he withdrew in January 2002 for fees due \r\n  from CTS were, in all likelihood, taken from the proceeds of unrelated transactions.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nSubsequent to respondentâ€™s interim suspension, it became apparent \r\n  that there had been substantial misappropriations from both the Bank A and Bank \r\n  B trust accounts.Â  ODC does not contend respondent misappropriated any money \r\n  from these accounts and does not contend respondent was directly responsible \r\n  for the shortages in these accounts other than respondent allowing others to \r\n  have control over the trust accounts, his failure to manage, supervise, and \r\n  reconcile the trust accounts, and respondentâ€™s withdrawals for fees due in January \r\n  2002.Â  ODC does not allege respondent misappropriated any of the missing money, \r\n  except for concerns relative to payment of fees by respondent directly to himself \r\n  which (assuming these fees were in fact due) were likely paid out of proceeds \r\n  of unrelated transactions due to shortages in the trust accounts known to respondent \r\n  on the occasion he paid himself the fees.Â  While it appears the foregoing shortages \r\n  were the result of misappropriation on the part of someone, ODC does not allege \r\n  respondent was involved in, had actual knowledge of, or condoned any intentional \r\n  misappropriation out of the two trust accounts.Â Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nIn this matter, respondent served as the \r\n  closing attorney for the buyer in an August 2001 real estate transaction.Â  After \r\n  the buyer failed to receive a deed to the land and the title to the mobile home \r\n  as contemplated by the transaction, litigation ensued.Â  The complainant in this \r\n  matter is an attorney who defended the lender.Â  \r\nAs the underlying litigation progressed, it was learned that the \r\n  deed had not been witnessed, probated, or recorded, and that the loan proceeds \r\n  from the lender had been received into and disbursed out of respondentâ€™s trust \r\n  account, but the mortgage to the lender had never been prepared or signed by \r\n  the borrower.Â  When the lender inquired, the lender was furnished with a bogus \r\n  mortgage containing a forged signature and a falsified date/time stamp indicating \r\n  recordation of the mortgage.Â  The borrower defaulted on the obligation, raising \r\n  forgery of the alleged mortgage and failure to receive title to the real estate \r\n  or mobile home as a defense to the lenderâ€™s claim.Â  As a result, the lender \r\n  is now the holder of an unsecured note.Â  \r\nWhile respondent denies any involvement in the falsification of the \r\n  mortgage, he acknowledges he failed to properly review the closing documents, \r\n  failed to notice and/or take action to rectify the fact that there was no mortgage \r\n  in the closing package and the deed was unsigned, and he allowed CTS to disburse \r\n  the proceeds of that transaction using his trust account without his supervision.Â  \r\n  Although respondentâ€™s only involvement in the transaction was to be present \r\n  and superintend the execution of the documents, in doing so he failed to supervise \r\n  the CTS non-lawyer staff andÂ  failed to oversee the disbursements of the proceeds \r\n  of the transaction in accordance with the closing documents, thereby assisting \r\n  CTS and/or Cook in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nIn this matter, a bank branch manager filed complaints \r\n  concerning two NSF checks drawn on respondentâ€™s trust account and bearing the \r\n  signature â€œAmy Cook.â€Â  Both of these checks are dated March 26, 2003; one is \r\n  in the amount of $76,220.40 and the other is in the amount of $65,282.48.Â  It \r\n  is noted this bank branch had honored Cookâ€™s directions to â€œsweepâ€ this account \r\n  even though it was an IOLTA account in the name of the McMillian Law Firm. \r\nIV.\r\nIn this matter, the complainant reports \r\n  a loan was approved for its customer and closed by CTS in April 2002.Â  Complainant \r\n  received a check drawn on respondentâ€™s trust account and bearing the signature \r\n  of â€œAmy Cook.â€Â  Complainant was later notified by its bank that the â€œfunds were \r\n  uncollected.â€Â  In connection with the same matter, the customer did not receive \r\n  the mobile home she sought to purchase.Â  Respondent was not involved in the \r\n  underlying transaction, except that, by allowing CTS to use his trust account \r\n  in the underlying closing, respondent assisted CTSâ€™ non-lawyer staff in the \r\n  unauthorized practice of law. \r\nV.\r\nIn this matter, the complainant reports \r\n  a check drawn on respondentâ€™s trust account and bearing the signature â€œAmy Cookâ€ \r\n  was dishonored upon presentment.Â  Respondent was not involved in the underlying \r\n  transaction, except that, by allowing CTS to use his trust account in the underlying \r\n  closing, respondent assisted CTSâ€™ non-lawyer staff in the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law. \r\nVI.\r\nIn this matter, the complainant is an \r\n  attorney whose clients had either closed or had sought to close refinancing \r\n  transactions with CTS in early 2002.Â  Necessary transactions were not completed \r\n  and it took one year and the assistance of new counsel to close on the refinancings.Â  \r\n  Respondent was not involved in the underlying transactions except that, by allowing \r\n  CTS to use his trust account in the underlying closing, respondent assisted \r\n  CTSâ€™ non-lawyer staff in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  \r\nVII.\r\nThe complainant in this matter sought \r\n  to purchase a lot and mobile home through a real estate transaction handled \r\n  by CTS.Â  The closing was attended by an attorney who was hired by CTS (not respondent).Â  \r\n  This attorney did not otherwise participate in this transaction.Â  Various problems \r\n  arose and the attorney refused to assist the complainant in rectifying the situation.Â  \r\n  After the complainant hired another attorney, the impediments to the closing \r\n  were rectified.Â  Respondent was not involved in the underlying transactions \r\n  except that, by allowing CTS to use his trust account in the underlying closing, \r\n  respondent assisted CTSâ€™ non-lawyer staff in the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nVIII.\r\nIn this matter, the complainant closed \r\n  a real estate transaction through CTS.Â  The closing was attended by an attorney \r\n  who was hired by CTS (not respondent).Â  Subsequent to the closing, the complainantâ€™s \r\n  homeownerâ€™s insurance policy was cancelled because the check for the premium \r\n  had â€œbounced.â€Â  The check had been written on respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  Other \r\n  discrepancies concerning the closing were later identified.Â  Respondent was \r\n  not involved in the underlying transactions except that, by allowing CTS to \r\n  use his trust account in the underlying closing, respondent assisted CTSâ€™ non-lawyer \r\n  staff in the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nIX.\r\nAfter he was placed on interim suspension, \r\n  respondent applied for a position as a receptionist/legal secretary with a law \r\n  firm.Â  He deleted the fact that he had graduated from law school from his resume.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not disclose that he was an attorney or that he was under interim \r\n  suspension.Â Â Â  After ODC advised him that employment with the law firm would \r\n  violate Rule 34, RLDE, respondent withdrew his application.Â  \r\nRespondent states he now recognizes that \r\n  the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement prohibit a lawyer from attempting \r\n  to violate the professional rules.Â  He further recognizes that Rule 34, RLDE, \r\n  prohibits a suspended lawyer from being employed by a member of the South Carolina \r\n  Bar as a paralegal or in any other capacity connected with the law.Â  \r\nCooperation with \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel\r\nODC states that, under best information \r\n  and belief, respondent has fully cooperated with its inquires.Â  ODC further \r\n  states respondent has not been previously sanctioned nor found to have committed \r\n  professional misconduct.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct \r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to \r\n  a client); Rule 1.2(c) (lawyer may limit the objectives of the representation \r\n  if the client consents after consultation); Rule 1.5(a) (lawyerâ€™s fee shall \r\n  be reasonable); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s \r\n  possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own \r\n  property); Rule 5.3(a) (a partner in a law firm shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance \r\n  that a non-lawyer employee or associateâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional \r\n  obligations of the lawyer); Rule 5.3(b) (lawyer having direct supervisory \r\n  authority over a non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the \r\n  personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); \r\n  Rule 5.3(c) (lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of a non-lawyer that would \r\n  be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer \r\n  if either the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, \r\n  ratifies the conduct involved or the lawyer is a partner in the law firm in \r\n  which the non-lawyer is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the \r\n  non-lawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be \r\n  avoided or mitigated but fails to take remedial action); Rule 5.4(a) (a \r\n  lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a non-lawyer); Rule \r\n  5.4(b) (lawyer shall not form a partnership with a non-lawyer if any of the \r\n  activities of the partnership constitute the practice of law); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer \r\n  shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance \r\n  of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that \r\n  is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  In addition, respondent admits \r\n  his misconduct constitutes a willful violation of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Finally, \r\n  respondent admits he violated Rule 7 of Rule 413, RLDE, by attempting to gain \r\n  employment as a paralegal during his interim suspension.Â  See Rule 34, \r\n  RLDE.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the disbarment \r\n  be made retroactive to the date he was placed on interim suspension is denied.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of \r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing \r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender \r\n  his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\n\r\n DISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct =

Durlach, III \r\n  (Husband) appeals the family court order holding him in civil contempt, sentencing \r\n  him to serve not more than six months in jail, suspended on payment of $292,953.86.Â  \r\n  We affirm the contempt order but reduce the amount owed to $248,890.26, finding \r\n  that the family court erred in awarding pre-judgment interest.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn March 1, 1996, Husband filed \r\n  for divorce from Respondent Sherry T. Durlach (Wife). Wife counterclaimed and \r\n  was granted a divorce on grounds of physical cruelty by order dated April 16, \r\n  1998.Â  The parties have engaged in legal battles concerning the marital property \r\n  ever since.\r\nUpon divorce, the marital property was divided \r\n  equally.Â  Among other things, Wife was awarded King at Market LP (KAM), a business \r\n  formed during the marriage of which Wife was an original limited partner.Â  KAMâ€™s \r\n  business purpose is the ownership and management of historic buildings located \r\n  in the heart of Charlestonâ€™s retail and hospitality district.Â  A retail clothing \r\n  and accessories business incorporated by Wife three and a half years before \r\n  the marriage is located in one of the buildings.\r\nAccording to the April 16, 1998 divorce decree, KAM was to \r\n  be transferred to Wife effective December 10, 1997, the last day of trial.Â  \r\n  The transfer was to include, â€œall current assets, records, cash, receivables, \r\n  prepayments, deposits, rents and all other assets,â€ including any management \r\n  agreements with KAM held by Husband.Â  The decree also provided that â€œ[a]ny arrearage, \r\n  discrepancy, damage (including damages to or changes in the assets), debt, or \r\n  other charge on the [KAM] partnership or its assets shall be subject to review \r\n  by this Court â€¦.â€Â  Finally, the decree specified that â€œthe outstanding loan \r\n  to Wachovia Bank in the amount of $892,500 is secured by the Husbandâ€™s interest \r\n  in Parkshoreâ€ and therefore â€œHusband shall also be responsible for that debt.â€\r\nHusband appealed several provisions of the divorce decree. [1] Â  During the time the appeal was pending, Husband \r\n  and Wife entered into a consent order (the Parkshore \r\n  [2]  Order) dated October 15, 1998, which was approved by the Charleston \r\n  County Family Court.Â  The primary purpose of the Parkshore Order was to give \r\n  Husband the authority to re-finance a piece of marital property â€œto preserve \r\n  the marital estate.â€Â  In addition, the Parkshore Order provided the following:\r\n\r\na.Â  [Husband] continues to manage [KAM], but makes Wachovia \r\n  payments separately from his other funds.Â  Only ordinary, normal, reasonable \r\n  expenses shall be paid from the [KAM] account and all other [KAM] funds shall \r\n  be kept in the [KAM] account.\r\n&nbsp;â€¦\r\nc.Â  All issues concerning management, oversight and control \r\n  of marital property pending resolution of the various appeals shall be in the \r\n  jurisdiction of the Family Court, with hearing only after meaningful mediation \r\n  efforts.Â  These issues are designated herein by the parties as local issues.\r\n\r\nThe Parkshore Order also gave Wife the authority to hire \r\n  an agent to oversee the KAM accounts and management.Â  Â  \r\nApproximately six months later, Wife contended that Husband \r\n  had mismanaged KAM affairs.Â  In response to Wifeâ€™s claims, the family court \r\n  judge appointed a sequestrator (Legare) to manage and control KAM in every respect.Â  \r\n  The appointment was prompted after the court discovered canceled checks drawn \r\n  on the KAM account for payment of the Wachovia debt, [3]  which directly contradicted the terms of the \r\n  divorce decree and the Parkshore Order.Â  The judge also found that there was \r\n  an improper accounting of the KAM funds and â€œenjoined and restrained [Husband] \r\n  from making any withdrawals or disbursements from the accounts of [KAM].â€Â  Accordingly, \r\n  in addition to managing KAM, Legare was directed to investigate whether KAM \r\n  assets had been mismanaged.Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn his investigation, Legare found that Husband diverted \r\n  funds from KAM totaling $160,100.83.Â  Subsequently, Wife and Legare petitioned \r\n  the court for a rule to show cause, seeking reimbursement of the funds Husband \r\n  diverted (plus pre-judgment interest, Legareâ€™s fees, and Legareâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees), and requesting that Husband be held in contempt for violating court orders.Â  \r\n  Husband filed a return and counterclaimed.\r\nAfter a hearing on December 6, 2001, the court \r\n  found Husband in contempt, sentencing him to serve not more than six months \r\n  in jail, suspended on payment of $292,953.86, which represents the amount of \r\n  KAM funds diverted, pre-judgment interest, and fees owed to Legare and his attorney.Â  \r\n  Husband raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the family court properly hold Husband in contempt?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court properly order Husband to pay pre-judgment interest?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Was Husband denied due process?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing the factual findings of the family court, \r\n  this Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Woodall \r\n  v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  But if the evidence \r\n  is in dispute, the appellate court should give the trial judgeâ€™s findings broad \r\n  deference.Â  Id.\r\nMore specifically, this Court should reverse a decision regarding \r\n  contempt â€œonly if it is without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused \r\n  his discretion.â€Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d \r\n  840 (1988); see also Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d \r\n  125, 129 (1989) (â€œA finding of contempt rests within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge.â€).\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Civil \r\n  ContemptÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHusband argues that the family court erred by holding him \r\n  in contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\nCourts have the inherent power to punish for contempt. In \r\n  re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998).Â  Willful disobedience \r\n  of a court order may result in contempt.Â  In re Brown, 333 S.C. at 420, \r\n  511 S.E.2d at 355.Â  A willful act is one done voluntarily and intentionally, \r\n  with the specific intent of doing something the law forbids.Â  Id.Â  \r\nCivil contempt must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  \r\n  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 113, 502 S.E.2d 86, 89 (1998) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  â€œThe purpose of civil contempt is to â€˜coerce the defendant to do \r\n  the thing required by the order for the benefit of the complainant.â€™â€ Id. \r\n  at 111, 502 S.E.2d at 88.\r\nIn the present case, the family court judge held Husband \r\n  in contempt for the following: (1) using KAM funds to make payments on the Wachovia \r\n  debt in 1998 and 1999 in the amount of $140,040.41; (2) writing checks from \r\n  KAM funds to his attorney in the amounts of $4069 and $1900; (3) paying the \r\n  Commissioner of Public Works $148.67 from KAM funds for another, non-KAM property; \r\n  (4) failing to pay KAM $69,383 in unpaid rent and late charges for Durlach Associates \r\n  office space; (5) bartering rent with Louisâ€™s Restaurant, providing space at \r\n  KAM in return for a food-and-beverage credit of $350 per month, owing KAM $9,800; \r\n  (6) bartering rent at KAM for legal services related to the divorce, owing KAM \r\n  $11,980; (7) bartering advertising with Charleston Business Journal, owing KAM \r\n  $7,000; and (8) paying himself commissions from the KAM account in the amount \r\n  of $15,879.32.Â  \r\nIn sum, the judge found that Husband â€œmade repeated payments \r\n  of the funds of KAM for obligations of his own or obligations of other entities.Â  \r\n  He willfully and knowingly violated the requirements of the orders of this court.â€Â  \r\n  Based on these findings, Husband was ordered to pay $292,953.86, representing \r\n  the amount of misused KAM funds, pre-judgment interest, and professional fees \r\n  for Legare and his attorney.\r\nOn appeal, Husband does not dispute that he made the payments \r\n  and agreements delineated in the contempt order.Â  Instead, he contends that \r\n  his actions did not violate court orders.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe following orders and their relevant mandates were effective \r\n  throughout this litigation:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    August 19, 1996 Supplemental Order: â€œBoth parties are enjoined and restrained \r\n  from in any manner mortgaging, selling, secreting, pledging, encumbering, destroying, \r\n  damaging, giving away, or in any other manner disposing of any real or personal \r\n  property marital of the parties, pending the final hearing on the merits.â€\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    September 11, 1997 Ex Parte Restraining Order:Â  â€œ[Husband] or any other \r\n  entity or institution holding martial property is hereby enjoined and restrained \r\n  from in any manner mortgaging, selling, secreting, pledging, encumbering, destroying, \r\n  damaging, giving away, or in any other manner disposing of any real or personal \r\n  marital property of the parties, pending the final hearing on the merits.â€\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    September 24, 1997 Pre-trial Order:Â  â€œ[P]rior to the initiation of any \r\n  transaction involving the buying, selling, refinancing or leasing of real property \r\n  by [Husband] of any of [Husbandâ€™s] entities, the terms of the said transaction \r\n  shall be fully disclosed to [Wife] and the proposed transaction shall require \r\n  her consent.â€\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    April 16, 1998 Final Order, Decree of Divorce, and Judgment:Â  â€œBecause \r\n  the outstanding loan to Wachovia Bank â€¦ is secured by the Husbandâ€™s interest \r\n  in Parkshore, Husband shall be responsible for that debt.â€Â  The order also transfers \r\n  KAM to Wife effective December 10, 1997.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    October 15, 1998 Consent Order as to Parkshore Refinancing:Â  States that \r\n  â€œ[Husband] continues to manage [KAM] but makes Wachovia payments separately \r\n  from his other funds.â€Â Â \r\n\r\nFirst, Husband violated the divorce decree and the Parkshore \r\n  Order when he used KAM funds to make payments on the Wachovia debt in 1998 and \r\n  1999.Â  The April 16, 1998 divorce decree specifically stated that Husband was \r\n  personally responsible for the Wachovia debt.Â  This responsibility was reiterated \r\n  in the October 15, 1998 Parkshore Order.Â  Therefore, payment of the Wachovia \r\n  debt with KAM funds violated both the divorce decree and the Parkshore Order.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nSecond, Husband violated court orders when he bartered free \r\n  rental space at KAM properties in exchange for food-and beverage credits, legal \r\n  services, and advertising services.Â  Such activity benefited Husband alone and \r\n  diminished the value of KAM.Â  Agreements entered into before the divorce decree \r\n  violated pre-trial restraining orders, and those entered into afterward violated \r\n  the divorce decree itself.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThird, Husband violated the divorce decree when he paid himself \r\n  commissions from KAM funds between May 1998 and February 1999.Â  The divorce \r\n  decree terminated all management and leasing agreements held by Husband and \r\n  transferred those agreements, and commissions associated with those agreements, \r\n  to Wife.Â  In addition, Husband violated the divorce decree when he used KAM \r\n  funds to pay his own legal fees.Â  The receipt of commissions and the payment \r\n  of legal fees from KAM funds violated the divorce decree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFourth, Husband violated pre-trial restraining orders and \r\n  the divorce decree when he failed to pay overdue rent to KAM on office space \r\n  for Durlach Associates.Â  Delinquency prior to the date KAM was transferred to \r\n  Wife diminished the value of KAM in direct violation of the pre-trial restraining \r\n  orders.Â  Delinquency after the date KAM was transferred to Wife violated the \r\n  divorce decree itself.\r\nAgain, Husband does not deny that he engaged in the activity \r\n  outlined above.Â  He contends, instead, that he did not violate court orders \r\n  by managing KAM as he did.Â  Nonetheless, Husband would, at times, reimburse \r\n  KAM when he discovered that he â€œinadvertentlyâ€ drew from KAM funds.Â  We find \r\n  that these reimbursements signified Husbandâ€™s awareness that his conduct was \r\n  contrary to court orders.Â  By willfully disobeying court orders on multiple \r\n  occasions, Husband provided the family court with clear and convincing evidence \r\n  upon which to base its decision.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Husband was properly \r\n  held in contempt.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition to challenging the family courtâ€™s findings regarding \r\n  the misuse of KAM funds, Husband raises various challenges concerning other \r\n  findings in the order and events leading up to its issuance.Â  First, Husband \r\n  argues that the family court judge erred in requiring him to pay a majority \r\n  of Legareâ€™s and Legareâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Although the June 8, 1999 order for \r\n  sequestration provided that Legare would be paid by KAM, we believe that this \r\n  provision did not anticipate the extent of Husbandâ€™s inappropriate use of funds \r\n  and Husbandâ€™s failure to cooperate with Legare.Â  Therefore, we find that it \r\n  was within the judgeâ€™s discretionary authority to order Husband to pay a majority \r\n  of the fees.Â Â Â  \r\nSecond, Husband argues that the family court judge should \r\n  have permitted the parties to mediate their dispute before proceeding with a \r\n  hearing.Â  We find that it was within the judgeâ€™s discretion to conduct a hearing \r\n  concerning Legareâ€™s report (and subsequently issue the contempt order) without \r\n  first requiring that the parties engage in mediation.Â  The Parkshore Order provisions \r\n  concerning mediation applied during the period pending the appeal, which ended \r\n  November 8, 2000, one year before the hearing took place.Â  Consequently, it \r\n  was within the judgeâ€™s discretion to proceed with the hearing accordingly.\r\nThird, Husband argues that his management activities at KAM \r\n  before Legare was appointed as sequestrator should be deemed â€œvalidâ€ since the \r\n  original sequestrator did not object or otherwise contest Husbandâ€™s activities \r\n  during that time.Â  We disagree.Â  The original sequestratorâ€™s lack of objection \r\n  does not necessarily mean that Husband managed KAM in accordance with court \r\n  orders.Â  In addition, we find that (1) there is no evidence that the original \r\n  sequestrator even conducted an investigation, and (2) Legare replaced the original \r\n  sequestrator and became the sequestrator for all purposes, including for purposes \r\n  of investigating questions of mismanagement of assets.Â  \r\nFourth, Husband argues that Legare should not have considered \r\n  transactions occurring before December 10, 1997, the date KAM was effectively \r\n  transferred to Wife.Â  We disagree.Â  In his investigation, Legare reviewed activity \r\n  dating as far back as September 1997, the date of the ex parte restraining order \r\n  issued against Husband, which was appropriate given that this order controlled \r\n  Husbandâ€™s activities.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the family court \r\n  properly held Husband in contempt.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAward of Pre-Judgment Interest \r\n   \r\nHusband argues that the family court erred by ordering him \r\n  to pay pre-judgment interest.Â  We agree.\r\nParties must plead for pre-judgment interest in order for \r\n  it to be recovered.Â  Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 103, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  14, 17 (2000).Â  When such a plea is made, pre-judgment interest may be recovered \r\n  â€œon obligations to pay money from the time when, either by agreement of the \r\n  parties or operation of law, the payment is demandable, if the sum is certain \r\n  or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., \r\n  355 S.C. 361, 375, 585 S.E.2d 292, 299 (2003); see also S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 34-31-20(A) (2003) (authorizing pre-judgment interest at a rate of 8.75 percent \r\n  per year â€œin all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained \r\n  and dueâ€). \r\nIn the present case, we find that Wife and Legare pled for \r\n  pre-judgment interest in their petition in support of rule to show cause.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the court, relying on Legareâ€™s comprehensive report, was able to arrive at a \r\n  sum certain that was due KAM.Â  The sum certain represented the amount of money \r\n  Husband had used in violation of pre-trial restraining orders, the divorce decree, \r\n  and the Parkshore Order.Â Â Â  \r\nBut because the money due under the contempt order was not \r\n  part of the judgment in this case, we hold that Wife and Legare are not entitled \r\n  to pre-judgment interest.Â  The divorce decree represents the judgment in this \r\n  case, and there is no allegation that money due under the decree was not paid \r\n  or divided as ordered or agreed to by the parties.Â  The contempt order was issued \r\n  not because Husband failed to abide by the distribution of funds and property \r\n  in accordance with the divorce decree but because Husband misused funds \r\n  in violation of various court orders, including the decree itself.Â  \r\nThe purpose of the contempt order was to coerce Husband to \r\n  reimburse money spent in a manner not approved by the court.Â  As a coercive \r\n  device, the contempt order is more like a citation than a judgment.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the sums due under the contempt order are not subject to interest as are money \r\n  judgments.Â  For these reasons, Wife and Legare are not entitled to pre-judgment \r\n  interest on money due under the contempt order.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDue \r\n  Process  \r\nFinally, Husband argues that he was denied due process because \r\n  the family court did not conduct a â€œseparate and distinctâ€ hearing to â€œcertifyâ€ \r\n  Legareâ€™s report.Â  Further, Husband contends he was denied notice of the sequestratorâ€™s \r\n  claims and the opportunity to object.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA due process claim raised for the first time on appeal \r\n  is not preserved.â€Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 625, 576 S.E.2d 156, \r\n  163 (2003).\r\nHusbandâ€™s due process claim was not raised in the family \r\n  court and is raised for the first time here.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved \r\n  for review.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we affirm the \r\n  family court order finding Husband in contempt.Â  But we modify the contempt \r\n  order in one respect:Â  Husband is not required to pay $44,063.60 in pre-judgment \r\n  interest. Therefore, Husband owes KAM $248,890.26, representing the amount of \r\n  funds diverted from KAM and fees for Legare and his attorney.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  J. C. Nicholson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the divorce \r\n    decree in all material respects.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2] Parkshore Centre I L.P. (Parkshore) was a business formed by Husband for \r\n    the purpose of acquiring and developing property.Â  Husbandâ€™s partnership interest \r\n    in Parkshore was deemed marital property for purposes of equitable distribution.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The Wachovia loan was primarily secured by Husbandâ€™s interest in \r\n    Parkshore.Â  The court found that Husband was responsible for paying this debt.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25824","title":"Patel v.

Patel \r\n  (Husband) and Nalini Raja Patel (Wife) were married on July 7, 1980.Â  Three \r\n  children were born of the marriage.Â  The partiesâ€™ oldest son, is seventeen. \r\n  Â The partiesâ€™ only daughter, is thirteen.Â  The partiesâ€™ youngest son, is eleven. \r\n\r\n Husband sued Wife for divorce \r\n  in December 1995.Â  On October 23, 1997, the family court issued the final divorce \r\n  decree.Â  The family court ruled that neither party was entitled to alimony, \r\n  awarded custody of the children to Husband, split the marital estate 65 percent/35 \r\n  percent in favor of Husband, and awarded Husband $41,920.94 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\nIn June 1998, Husband informed \r\n  Wife by letter that he was relocating with the children to Southern California.Â  \r\n  The court denied Wifeâ€™s request for a restraining order prohibiting the move.Â  \r\n  The appeal of the relocation order was consolidated with the appeal from the \r\n  divorce decree.\r\nIn October 2000, the Court of \r\n  Appeals issued a unanimous, unpublished opinion, in which it (1) reversed the \r\n  family courtâ€™s award of custody and ordered Husband to return the children to \r\n  South Carolina, (2) reversed and remanded the denial of alimony to Wife, and \r\n  (3) reversed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Husband, but affirmed the 65/35 \r\n  property division in favor of Husband.Â  Patel v. Patel, Op. No. 2000-UP-653 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. dated Oct. 26, 2000).Â  In January 2001, this Court granted Husbandâ€™s \r\n  petition for an emergency supersedeas to stay the return of the children to \r\n  South Carolina.Â  \r\nThis Court denied Wifeâ€™s petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari on the property division issue, and granted Husbandâ€™s \r\n  petition on the alimony and custody matters.Â  The Court issued an opinion remanding \r\n  the issues to the trial court for a new hearing on the custody and alimony issues.Â  \r\n  Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 555 S.E.2d 386 (2001).\r\nWhile the remand trial was pending, \r\n  Wife filed a motion for pendente lite alimony.Â  The family court awarded Wife \r\n  $2,500.00 per month in pendente lite alimony.Â  The issue of retroactive alimony \r\n  was reserved for the final trial on remand. \r\nThe final \r\n  merits hearing on the remanded issues of alimony, child custody, and child support \r\n  was held over seven days in October and December 2002.Â  The trial court held \r\n  Wife was entitled to permanent periodic alimony of $1,500.00 per month beginning \r\n  February 1, 2003.Â  The court did not address the issue of retroactive alimony.Â  \r\n  The trial court awarded custody of the oldest child to Husband and awarded custody \r\n  of the two younger children to Wife.Â  The order required Husband to pay $1,150.00 \r\n  per month in child support and denied either party attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â Â  \r\n\r\nBoth Husband and Wife appeal.Â  \r\n  On February 18, 2003, this Court assumed jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 204(b), \r\n  SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the family court properly deny Husbandâ€™s motion to\r\n    recuse?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court abuse its discretion in awarding custody of the two younger \r\n  children to Wife?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court abuse its discretion in awarding alimony to Wife, denying \r\n  Wife retroactive alimony, and setting the amount of alimony at $1,500.00 per \r\n  month?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court abuse its discretion in setting the amount of child support \r\n  and denying Wife transportation expenses?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court abuse its discretion in denying Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  litigation expenses?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhere a family court order is \r\n  appealed, we have jurisdiction to find facts based on our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  The Court is not required to disregard the findings of the \r\n  trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to \r\n  evaluate their credibility.Â  Strout v. Strout, 284 S.C. 429, 327 S.E.2d \r\n  74 (1985).Â Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve the appealing party \r\n  of the burden of showing that the family court committed error.Â  Skinner \r\n  v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979).\r\nI.Â  Recusal\r\nThe underlying circumstances supporting Husbandâ€™s \r\n  motion to recuse arose after we remanded the case to the family court for a \r\n  new hearing on custody and alimony.Â  In August 2002, Wife contacted three State \r\n  Senators, asking for their help in having a trial date set for the remand trial. \r\n  [1] Â  All of these senators wrote letters on behalf of Wife to The Honorable \r\n  James A. Spruill III, the family court judge presiding over the matter.  [2] Â Â  Two of the senators sent copies of their \r\n  letters to Chief Justice Toal.&nbsp; \r\nJudge Spruill \r\n  wrote the three senators advising them that he was not permitted to consider \r\n  these communications and immediately set a trial date for October 14, 2002.Â  \r\n  Husband filed a Motion to Recuse and requested a continuance.Â  Judge Spruill \r\n  denied both motions.Â  Husband then filed suit in federal court against Judge \r\n  Spruill and the three senators alleging a violation of due process.Â  The pleadings \r\n  were served on Judge Spruill prior to the merits hearing.Â  The final hearing \r\n  on the merits began on October 14 and Husband renewed his motion for continuance \r\n  and recusal, both of which Judge Spruill denied.Â  \r\nHusband asks \r\n  this Court to acknowledge the appearance of impropriety with the activities \r\n  of the three senators, and their alleged attempts to sway the opinions of Judge \r\n  Spruill and Chief Justice Toal.Â  Husband does not wish for the case to be remanded \r\n  on the custody issue based on Judge Spruillâ€™s failure to disqualify himself.Â Â  \r\n  On the issue of alimony, Husband requests this Court deny alimony because he \r\n  was denied a hearing before an impartial tribunal.Â  We conclude Judge Spruill \r\n  was not required to disqualify himself.Â  Accordingly, Husband was not denied \r\n  an impartial tribunal based on Judge Spruillâ€™s failure to disqualify himself.\r\n Under South Carolina law, if there is \r\n  no evidence of judicial prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure to disqualify himself will \r\n  not be reversed on appeal.Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., 332 S.C. 75, \r\n  504 S.E.2d 311 (1998).Â  In Roche, the Court applied Canon 3(E)(1)(a) \r\n  of Rule 501, SCACR.Â  Under Canon 3(E)(1)(a), a judge should disqualify himself \r\n  in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including \r\n  but not limited to, instances where he has a personal bias or prejudice against \r\n  a party.Â  It is not sufficient for a party seeking disqualification to simply \r\n  allege bias; the party must show some evidence of bias or prejudice.Â  Mallet \r\n  v. Mallet, 323 S.C. 141, 473 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  If there is no \r\n  evidence of judicial bias or prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure to disqualify himself \r\n  will not be reversed on appeal.Â  Ellis v. Procter &amp; Gamble Dist. Co., \r\n  315 S.C. 283, 433 S.E.2d 856 (1993).Â  \r\nA judgeâ€™s impartiality might reasonably \r\n  be questioned when his factual findings are not supported by the record.Â  Ellis, \r\n  315 S.C. at 285, 433 S.E.2d at 857.Â  There is no evidence in the record suggesting \r\n  that Judge Spruill was prejudiced by the senatorsâ€™ letters.Â  Judge Spruill acted \r\n  promptly to alleviate any perception of injustice.Â  Shortly after receiving \r\n  the letters, Judge Spruill wrote the senators advising them that he is not permitted \r\n  to consider communications from outside the court.Â  Judge Spruill sent copies \r\n  of these letters to both partiesâ€™ attorneys.Â  In his January 2, 2003 order, \r\n  Judge Spruill chastised Wife for her â€œinappropriate attemptâ€ to influence the \r\n  court by her contact with the legislators.Â  Because there is no evidence in \r\n  the record supporting Husbandâ€™s contention, we conclude Judge Spruill did not \r\n  err in failing to disqualify himself.\r\nWe granted Husbandâ€™s motion to argue \r\n  against precedent on the issue of judicial recusal.Â Â  Husband urges this court \r\n  to adopt the standard for judicial recusal set forth in Liljeberg v. Health \r\n  Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 \r\n  (1988).Â  Additionally, Husband argues that this Court should adopt a de novo \r\n  standard of review on the recusal issue.Â  In Liljeberg, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court considered the construction of 28 U.S.C. Â§ 455(a) (2001).Â  The \r\n  federal statute is similar to Canon 3(E)(1)(a).Â  Section 455(a) provides, â€œ[a]ny \r\n  justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself \r\n  in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.â€ \r\n\r\n The issue before the Supreme Court was \r\n  whether Section 455(a) could be violated based on the appearance of partiality.Â  \r\n  The Court held that under Section 455(a), recusal is required even when there \r\n  is no evidence of bias if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, \r\n  would expect that the judge is biased.Â  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 860-61, \r\n  108 S.Ct. at 2203, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 at 872-73.Â  Husband argues that the Supreme \r\n  Courtâ€™s holding imputes an objective test in applying Section 455(a), in that \r\n  it does not require evidence of judicial prejudice to warrant disqualification.Â  \r\n\r\nWe have carefully considered Husbandâ€™s \r\n  arguments.Â  Assuming without deciding that there is merit in Husbandâ€™s policy \r\n  arguments supporting the federal rule and de novo standard of review, we decline \r\n  to adopt these standards at this time because Husband has not demonstrated that \r\n  he would prevail under the Liljeberg test under these facts even if reviewed \r\n  de novo.Â  There is no evidence in the record leading an objective observer to \r\n  question Judge Spruillâ€™s impartiality after he received the senatorsâ€™ letters.Â  \r\n  The letters would not have caused an objective mind, viewing all the facts of \r\n  the case, to determine Judge Spruill was biased.Â  Disqualification issues are \r\n  necessarily decided on the facts of each case.Â  In some cases, contact by legislators \r\n  with members of the judiciary may warrant disqualification.Â  However, to hold \r\n  that disqualification was mandated under the facts of this case, would require \r\n  every judge to recuse himself upon receiving unsolicited contact from the legislature, \r\n  or other potentially influential persons/ organizations, or even officious intermeddlers.Â  \r\n  Such a holding could invite the less scrupulous to employ this stratagem to \r\n  eliminate any judge.Â  Therefore, we conclude Husband has failed to show Judge \r\n  Spruill erred in failing to disqualify himself. \r\nII.Â  Custody\r\nIn a custody dispute, the \r\n  paramount and controlling factor is the welfare and best interests of the child.Â  \r\n  Matthews v. Matthews, 273 S.C. 130, 132, 254 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1979).\r\n The family court concluded the \r\n  older son should remain in California with Husband to complete the remainder \r\n  of his junior year and the entirety of his senior year in high school and that \r\n  the two younger children should return to South Carolina to live with Wife.Â  \r\n\r\n On appeal Husband argues the \r\n  family court erred in granting custody of the two younger children to Wife because \r\n  (1) the court expressed reservations about Wifeâ€™s fitness, (2) Dillon schools \r\n  were adequate only if the children attended in-state colleges, and (3) daughterâ€™s \r\n  preference for living with Wife was given controlling weight in awarding her \r\n  custody of daughter and younger son.Â  \r\nThe family court expressed reservations \r\n  about Wifeâ€™s many episodes of uncontrollable anger that took place within the \r\n  presence of the children.Â  The court found that Wifeâ€™s anger management problems \r\n  were ameliorated because the anger was directed toward Husband, not the children.Â  \r\n  Wifeâ€™s conduct is clearly unacceptable.Â  The recorded telephone calls between \r\n  Husband and Wife reveal the extent of her anger and use of profanity.\r\nHusbandâ€™s fitness as a parent \r\n  is also problematic.Â  Dr. Boland, a clinical psychologist, testified Husband \r\n  has exhibited signs of histrionic personality disorder.Â  One characteristic \r\n  associated with the disorder is a tendency to over-react to minor events and \r\n  display abrupt outbursts of sarcasm.Â  A former employee of the Days Inn in Dillon \r\n  testified Husband would scream at Wife when she called.Â  Additionally, Wifeâ€™s \r\n  calls to the children had to go through Husband first.Â  \r\nHusband has engaged in additional \r\n  acts of manipulative behavior.Â  While the children were in California, Husband \r\n  did not make any effort to keep Wife informed about their childrenâ€™s health.Â  \r\n  He did not inform Wife that older son was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder \r\n  and had been treated for depression.Â  Husband did not inform Wife that both \r\n  sons were seeing a psychiatrist.Â  \r\nBoth parents have exhibited \r\n  far less than exemplary behavior.Â  In determining custody, the trial court weighed \r\n  heavily the fact that Wife had been the primary caretaker before the separation.Â  \r\n  Although there is no rule of law requiring custody be awarded to the primary \r\n  caretaker, there is an assumption that custody will be awarded to the primary \r\n  caretaker.Â  Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina, 433 \r\n  (3d ed. 2001).Â  In the present case, the court found that Husband devoted long \r\n  hours to his work, but remained active in the lives of the children.Â  A breadwinnerâ€™s \r\n  work habits are relevant to custody decisions when considered in the context \r\n  of the time spent with the children.Â  See Paris v. Paris, 319 \r\n  S.C. 308, 311, 460 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1995) (awarding custody to the primary caretaker \r\n  over the primary breadwinner).Â  In the present case, Wife saw to the childrenâ€™s \r\n  day-to-day needs, prepared their meals, took them to school, and saw that the \r\n  children attended school related activities and religious functions.Â  \r\nUnder the facts of this case, we find \r\n  that the family court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Wife is \r\n  a fit parent, despite the courtâ€™s concerns.Â  Moreover, the court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in weighing heavily the fact that Wife was the childrenâ€™s primary \r\n  caretaker.Â  \r\nSecond, Husband \r\n  contends the trial court gave insufficient weight to the superiority of the \r\n  schools in California in making the custody decision.Â  The family court stated \r\n  that the schools in Dillon are sufficient to provide the children with the tools \r\n  to succeed in the colleges within South Carolina.Â  Husband relies primarily \r\n  on PPSE (Pupil Performance Scholarship Exams) scores in evaluating the schools.Â  \r\n  We conclude that the best interests of the children are not compromised by attending \r\n  the Dillon, South Carolina schools.Â  The Dillon schools do not directly and \r\n  adversely affect the best interests of the children, despite the fact that the \r\n  California schools have higher PPSE scores.Â  Therefore, we decline to modify \r\n  the custody award simply because one form of schooling is commonly considered \r\n  superior to another when both schools are adequate.\r\nThird, Husband argues daughterâ€™s preference \r\n  for living with Wife was given controlling weight in the family courtâ€™s custody \r\n  decision.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1515 (Supp. 2003) provides:\r\n\r\nIn determining the best interest of a \r\n  child, the court must consider the childâ€™s reasonable preference \r\n  for custody.Â  The court shall place weight upon the preference based \r\n  on the childâ€™s age, experience, maturity, judgment, and ability to express\r\npreference.Â  \r\n\r\nThe leading case is Guinan \r\n  v. Guinan, 254 S.C. 554, 176 S.E.2d 173 (1970).Â  In Guinan, the Court \r\n  gave â€œgreat weightâ€ to the wishes of a sixteen year old.Â  In this case, daughter, \r\n  who is now thirteen years old, has consistently expressed a definite desire \r\n  to live with Wife.Â  The younger son, who is now eleven years old, did not seem \r\n  to have as definite a preference, although he expressed some interest in staying \r\n  in California. [3] Â  \r\nWe hold that the family court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody of the two younger children \r\n  to Wife.Â  Several witnesses testified that the two younger children were happy \r\n  in Dillon when they visited their mother.Â  A teacher at Dillon Christian School \r\n  testified that her daughter and the partiesâ€™ daughter have maintained a friendship \r\n  and that daughter has other friends in Dillon.Â  Another parent with children \r\n  enrolled at the school testified that the partiesâ€™ daughter visited his daughter \r\n  in Dillon and has maintained friendships with other students.Â  Both parties \r\n  agree that the two younger children should not be separated.Â  We agree.Â  Although \r\n  the legislature gives family court judges the authority â€œto order joint or divided \r\n  custody where the court finds it is in the best interests of the child,â€ S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(42) (Supp. 2003), joint or divided custody should only \r\n  be awarded where there are exceptional circumstances.Â  Under the facts of this \r\n  case, we hold the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in awarding custody \r\n  of the two younger children to Wife. \r\nIII.Â  Alimony\r\nThe amount of alimony is within \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and should not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\n  an abuse of discretion is shown.Â  Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 627-28, \r\n  216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs either when a court \r\n  is controlled by some error of law, or where the order is based upon findings \r\n  of fact lacking evidentiary support.Â  Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. \r\n  70, 587 S.E.2d 118 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThe trial court awarded Wife \r\n  $1,500.00 per month in permanent, periodic alimony.Â  Husband appeals the award \r\n  of any alimony.Â  Wife appeals the amount of the award and the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of retroactive alimony.\r\nHusband argues any award of \r\n  alimony in this case discourages Wife from procuring employment. See \r\n  Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 358, 396 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1990) \r\n  (trial judge abused his discretion in the award of alimony because Wifeâ€™s expenses \r\n  appear excessive when considered in conjunction with the fact that she has not \r\n  procured employment since her separation).Â  We disagree and affirm the award \r\n  and amount of permanent, periodic alimony.\r\nThe \r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife alimony.Â Â  Three \r\n  important factors in awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; \r\n  (2) the overall financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of \r\n  the supporting spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault \r\n  than the other.Â  The fact that this was a long marriage of seventeen years weighs \r\n  in favor of alimony.Â  Second, Husband has the ability to pay the alimony award.Â  \r\n  The trial court found that both parties have substantial property from the division \r\n  of the estate. Third, Husband is highly educated, having degrees in biochemistry \r\n  and pharmacy.Â  Husband currently manages a successful motel business.Â  Wife \r\n  has a high school education and has been out of the work force for more than \r\n  twenty years.\r\nWife \r\n  contends the $1,500.00 per month alimony award is insufficient.Â  The trial court \r\n  gave considerable weight to Wife not seeking any employment in the five years \r\n  since the divorce.Â  Wife testified she has not sought employment for the last \r\n  five years because her efforts on this case have required her full attention.Â  \r\n  Wife has engaged in what she considers â€œcommunity serviceâ€ work in the Indian \r\n  community.Â  Wife writes and sells articles for the India Post \r\n  newspaper.Â  In working for the paper, Wife attends various conferences throughout \r\n  the country and is â€œreimbursedâ€ from the sponsoring organizations.Â  \r\nWe conclude the family court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in awarding Wife $1,500.00 per month in permanent, periodic alimony.Â  \r\n  The family courtâ€™s findings are consistent with an application of the factors \r\n  set forth in South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2003). \r\n  [4] Â  The family court noted the extended length of the marriage, Husbandâ€™s \r\n  superior educational background, and the employment history of the parties.Â  \r\n  Wife, thirty-six years old at the time of the divorce, has a twelfth-grade education.Â  \r\n  During the marriage she worked in both family businesses instead of seeking \r\n  salaried employment.Â  While an award of alimony is appropriate in this case, \r\n  we agree that any increase in the permanent, periodic alimony would act as a \r\n  disincentive to Wife in pursuing employment.Â  Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nWife \r\n  argues the Court should award her retroactive alimony.Â  We agree, albeit, not \r\n  in the amount Wife requests.Â  Wife asks this Court to award her $152,500.00 \r\n  in unpaid alimony plus judgment interest. \r\n  [5] Â  This Court has not specifically addressed whether a party is entitled \r\n  to retroactive alimony when an appellate court remands for reconsideration of \r\n  alimony (but does not award alimony on appeal) and the family court then awards \r\n  alimony.Â  In Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 465 S.E.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1995), \r\n  the Court of Appeals concluded that under these circumstances a family court \r\n  may award alimony retroactive to the date of the original hearing unless it \r\n  would be an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nUnder \r\n  our view of the facts, Wife should be awarded alimony for all months she was \r\n  not paid since the date of the original hearing at a rate of $1,500.00.Â  Therefore, \r\n  Wife should be awarded $1,500.00 per month in retroactive alimony for the sixty-one \r\n  months she requests. Husband owes Wife $91,500.00 plus interest at a rate of \r\n  fourteen percent per annum. [6] Â  \r\n  Interest is due on alimony at the time each support payment becomes due.Â  See \r\n  Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 114, 492 S.E.2d 86, 96 (1997).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Wifeâ€™s post-judgment interest on the alimony arrearage should be calculated \r\n  from the date each payment was due. \r\nIV.Â  Child Support\r\nChild \r\n  support awards are addressed to the sound discretion of the family court and \r\n  absent abuse of discretion will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Townsend, \r\n  supra.Â  Wife appeals the trial judgeâ€™s award of $1,150.00 in child support \r\n  per month.\r\nWife argues the \r\n  family court improperly imputed $900.00 per month in minimum wage to her and \r\n  improperly imputed $1,958.00 per month of interest on her income.Â  Wife contends \r\n  that even if the trial judge properly imputed income to her, the award of $1,150.00 \r\n  deviates from the South Carolina Department of Social Services Guidelines formula.\r\nWe hold the family \r\n  court properly imputed income to Wife.Â Â  It is proper to impute income to a \r\n  party who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.Â  Mazzone v. Miles, \r\n  341 S.C. 203, 532 S.E.3d 890 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Wife testified that she has not \r\n  sought employment because her full-time job is â€œto get custody of [her] children.â€Â  \r\n  Wife also indicated that she has no intention of seeking employment if she acquires \r\n  custody of the children.Â  Although Wife has been out of the work force for more \r\n  than twenty years, the family court found she is capable and energetic.Â  \r\nWife argues that \r\n  under the Guidelines, she is entitled to $1,605.00 in child support per month.Â  \r\n  The family court was not required to follow the Guidelines in this case.Â  In \r\n  cases where the parentsâ€™ combined income exceeds the highest amount contemplated \r\n  by the Guidelines, courts are to decide the issue of amount on a case-by-case \r\n  basis. [7] Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Reg. 114- 4710(A)(3) (Supp. 2003).Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s child support award.\r\nAdditionally, \r\n  Wife argues the trial judge erred in ordering that both parties share equally \r\n  in transportation expenses to effect the visitation order.Â  We hold that under \r\n  the circumstances of this case, and considering Husbandâ€™s unilateral action \r\n  in moving to California, Husband should bear the transportation expenses for \r\n  older son to travel to South Carolina and the two younger children to travel \r\n  to California to effect the visitation schedule set forth by the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order dated January 2, 2003 and filed January 6, 2003.\r\nV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  Fees and Litigation Expenses\r\nWife \r\n  argues the trial court erroneously failed to award her reasonable attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and litigation expenses.Â Â  We disagree. \r\nPursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2003), \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in the \r\n  family court.Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests within the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial judge and should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Ariail v. Ariail, 295 S.C. 486, 369 S.E.2d 146 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nWifeâ€™s counsel agreed to represent her in the remand trial for a \r\n  flat fee of $35,000.00.Â  The flat fee did not include costs such as depositions, \r\n  Guardian ad Litem fees, and other expenses.Â  The flat fee of $35,000.00 plus \r\n  other expenses totals more than $90,000.00.\r\nThe family court concluded that â€œeach party is well able to pay reasonable \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to their respective attorneyâ€ and each party should pay their \r\n  own attorneyâ€™s fees because each was â€œentirely unreasonable with respect to \r\n  part of the remand issues.â€Â Â  The family court went on to note that Husband \r\n  has substantially greater wealth than Wife, but Wife â€œappears to have paid her \r\n  fees prior to the trial and the fees will not affect the standard of living \r\n  of either party.â€Â  \r\nIn determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should \r\n  consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; the beneficial results \r\n  obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and \r\n  the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M, \r\n  307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992).Â  The only factor weighing in favor of Wife \r\n  is the beneficial results achieved by her attorney.Â  The trial judge found that \r\n  Wife could pay her attorneyâ€™s fees and that it would not affect her standard \r\n  of living.Â  The family court judge did not abuse his discretion.Â  Wife has not \r\n  shown she is unable to pay her attorneyâ€™s fees and by all accounts has, in fact, \r\n  paid the $35,000 portion of her fee.Â  See R.G.M. v. D.E.M., 306 \r\n  S.C. 145, 410 S.E.2d 564 (1991) (denying wifeâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  where the wife provided no reasons for not being able to pay fees).\r\nThe same considerations that apply to awarding attorneyâ€™s fees apply \r\n  to awarding litigation expenses.Â  Nienow v. Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 173, \r\n  232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977).Â  Wife has a stronger case for litigation expenses \r\n  than attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife argues she paid $6,000.00 for her California attorneys, \r\n  $811.38 for the two depositions, and $1,962.00 for Husbandâ€™s CPA in California.Â  \r\n  Wife would not have incurred these expenses had Husband not moved to California.Â  \r\n  The Court has awarded litigation expenses in other cases, where one party has \r\n  incurred expenses as a result of the unilateral action of another.Â  See \r\n  e.g., Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988) \r\n  (reimbursable expenses include the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred \r\n  in obtaining evidence of spouseâ€™s infidelity).Â  We order Husband to pay Wife \r\n  $8,773.38 in litigation expenses.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor \r\n  the foregoing reasons we affirm as modified the decision of the family court.Â  \r\n  We conclude (1) the family court judge did not abuse his discretion in failing \r\n  to recuse himself; (2) the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding \r\n  custody of the two younger children to Wife; (3) Wife is entitled to $1,500.00 \r\n  per month in permanent periodic alimony and $91,500.00 in retroactive alimony \r\n  plus interest at a rate of fourteen percent per annum; (4) Husband is to pay \r\n  Wife $1,150.00 per month in child support and transportation expenses needed \r\n  to effect the family courtâ€™s visitation schedule; and (5) Wife is responsible \r\n  for her own attorneyâ€™s fees, but is owed $8,773.38 in litigation expenses by \r\n  Husband.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice John W.

Patel (â€œHusbandâ€) and \r\n  Nalini Patel (â€œWifeâ€) were married on July 7, 1980.Â Â  The final decree of divorce \r\n  dated October 23, 1997, and filed November 12, 1997 awarded Husband 65 percent \r\n  of the marital estate and Wife 35 percent.Â  The marital estate included funds \r\n  in an A.G. Edwards brokerage account (the â€œaccountâ€).Â  The funds in the account \r\n  were generated primarily from the sale of the partiesâ€™ Holiday Inn and lot in \r\n  San Diego, California.Â  Husbandâ€™s attorney transferred these funds to an account \r\n  pursuant to an order issued by the family court appointing him trustee for the \r\n  parties and ordering him to place the funds in an interest bearing account.Â  \r\n\r\n On November 14, 1997, Husband, \r\n  who still maintained control of the account, withdrew the entire balance of \r\n  the account amounting to $1,870,143.63.Â  Husband used some of the funds to pay \r\n  taxes, leaving the remainder for disbursement between Husband and Wife.Â  Husband \r\n  issued Wife a check for $659,744.00. \r\n  [1] Â  Wife returned the check to Husbandâ€™s counsel to be reinvested in the \r\n  account.\r\nOn December 15, 1997, Wife filed \r\n  a motion requesting that Husband be required to re-deposit all funds withdrawn \r\n  from the account.Â  On January 12, 1998, the family court issued an order directing \r\n  Husband to restore $1,093,070.00 to the account, or other similar trust account, \r\n  bearing the best possible interest rate. [2] Â  The court ordered that these funds remain \r\n  in the account until conclusion of the appeal.\r\nOn November 19, 2001, Husband \r\n  and Wife executed an agreement to disburse the funds in the account.Â  However, \r\n  the parties disagreed on whether Husband was entitled to post-judgment interest \r\n  on the account and explicitly left this issue unresolved.Â  In their agreement, \r\n  the parties calculated their respective shares of the account based on the percentages \r\n  allocated in the final divorce decree.Â  The divorce decree awarded $701,655.00 \r\n  from the account to Wife, with the balance to Husband.Â  The $701,665.00 constituted \r\n  64.19 percent of the account, leaving 35.81 percent of the account for Husband. [3] Â  The parties agreed Wife would \r\n  receive $791,840.41, which amounted to 64.19 percent of the balance of the account \r\n  on the date of the agreement.Â  However, the parties agreed to subtract $150,000 \r\n  from Wifeâ€™s disbursement to remain in the account pending resolution of the \r\n  partiesâ€™ dispute over Husbandâ€™s entitlement to post-judgment interest.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to the agreement, Husband received his full 35.81 percent.\r\nOn May 17, 2002, Wife filed a \r\n  motion alleging Husband failed to communicate with her about resolving his post-judgment \r\n  interest claim on the 35.81 percent of the account he was awarded under the \r\n  partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  Wife requested the court award her the $150,000 plus accrued \r\n  interest, which had been withheld from her portion of the funds.Â  The court \r\n  awarded the $150,000 plus accrued interest held in escrow to Wife.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the family court err in denying Husbandâ€™s claim \r\n  for post-judgment interest and awarding Wife the $150,000 plus accrued interest \r\n  remaining in the A.G. Edwards account?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Husband argues \r\n  he is entitled to $142,447.00 minus the interest on the $41,000 in attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees originally assessed against Wife. [4] Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Casey v. Casey, 311 \r\n  S.C. 243, 428 S.E.2d 714 (1993), we held that fixed awards of money for equitable \r\n  distribution do, in fact, accrue interest at the post-judgment rate from the \r\n  date of the judgment.Â  However, we qualified our holding stating,\r\n\r\nWe leave intact the family courtâ€™s broad discretion \r\n  to provide for the payment of interest as part of \r\n  the equitable distribution award.Â  Thus, the family court may \r\n  provide for the amortization of payments \r\n  with a rate of interest different from the post-judgment rate or deny interest \r\n  altogether on payment due at a future date. \r\n\r\nId. at 716.Â  Our decision in Casey \r\n  is controlling.Â  The family courtâ€™s January 12, 1998 order specifically provided \r\n  that the $1,093,070.00, which the family court ordered to remain in the account \r\n  or other similar trust account, was to bear the â€œbest possible interest rate.â€Â  \r\n  In designating the controlling interest rate, the family court exercised its \r\n  discretion in providing for an interest rate other than the post-judgment interest \r\n  rate.Â  Therefore, Husband is not entitled to post-judgment interest on his share \r\n  of funds in the account.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the family court did not \r\n  err in awarding Wife the remaining $150,000 plus accrued interest. \r\nHusband argues that the divorce \r\n  decree dated October 23, 1997, was silent as to the rate of interest to be applied \r\n  to the equitable division award, rendering the post-judgment rate applicable.Â  \r\n  According to Husband, the post-judgment rate applies because Wife failed to \r\n  appeal within thirty days of the final divorce decree. \r\nIn appeals from \r\n  the family court, a notice of appeal must be served on respondents within thirty \r\n  days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Rule \r\n  203(b)(3), SCACR.Â  However, when a timely motion pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, \r\n  has been made, the time for appeal for all parties is stayed and runs from receipt \r\n  of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying the motion.Â  Rule \r\n  203(b)(1), SCACR.&nbsp; \r\nWife filed two \r\n  timely Rule 59(e) motions raising the issue of whether at least part of the \r\n  marital funds divided between the parties should be placed in escrow pending \r\n  appeal.Â  Wife subsequently filed a more specific motion requesting an emergency \r\n  hearing due to fears Husband might leave the jurisdiction and dispose of marital \r\n  funds.Â  The emergency hearing was held and resulted in the January 12, 1998 \r\n  order directing Husband to return funds to the brokerage account.Â  The January \r\n  12 order was reiterated in the June 4, 1998 order disposing of both of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  motions to reconsider.Â  Subsequently, Wife timely filed her notice of appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons we \r\n  affirm the holding of the family court and order the remaining $150,000 plus \r\n  accrued interest in the A.G. Edwards account be disbursed to Wife.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n MOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  [1] The divorce decree awarded Wife \r\n    $701,665.00 from this account.Â  Husband deducted $41,920.94 for attorneyâ€™s \r\n    fees and costs the family court ordered Wife to pay under the Final Divorce \r\n    Decree.Â  The attorneyâ€™s fee award was later reversed by the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\n    Patel v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Adrianne L. Turner, all of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nRobert M. Pachak, of Columbia, for respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Respondent Lewis Clarence Patterson \r\n  (Patterson) pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine, second offense, and \r\n  was sentenced to seven (7) years imprisonment and fined $10,000.Â  Patterson \r\n  was previously convicted of possession of marihuana.Â  Concluding trial counsel \r\n  rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by advising Patterson to plead guilty \r\n  to a second offense in connection with the crack cocaine charge, the post-conviction \r\n  (PCR) judge granted relief. \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR judge err in holding Pattersonâ€™s counsel was \r\n  ineffective because Patterson was sentenced as a second-time offender?\r\nANALYSIS\r\n The State argues the PCR judge erred by concluding Pattersonâ€™s \r\n  counsel was ineffective in advising him to plead guilty where Pattersonâ€™s sentence \r\n  for possession of crack cocaine was enhanced to second offense due to Pattersonâ€™s \r\n  1989 conviction for possession of marihuana.Â  We agree.\r\nTo establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \r\n  the PCR applicant must establish that trial counselâ€™s representation fell below \r\n  an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counselâ€™s errors, \r\n  there is a reasonable probability the result would have been different.Â  Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).Â Â  â€œA \r\n  reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in \r\n  the outcomeâ€ of trial.Â  Id. 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 698.Â  The PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld by this Court when they are \r\n  supported by any evidence of probative value.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. \r\n  115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  However, the Court will not uphold the findings \r\n  of the PCR court if no probative evidence supports those findings.Â  Holland \r\n  v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nThere is no statutory law or judicial \r\n  precedent in this State concluding, under similar facts, the trial judge improperly \r\n  enhanced Pattersonâ€™s sentence.Â  An attorney is not required to anticipate potential \r\n  changes in the law, which are not in existence at the time of the conviction.Â  \r\n  State v. Gilmore, 314 S.C. 453, 457, 445 S.E.2d 454, 456 (1994) overruled \r\n  on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  614 (1999).Â  Therefore, Pattersonâ€™s counsel was not deficient in advising Patterson \r\n  to plead guilty in connection with the crack cocaine charge.\r\nAlthough, unnecessary for resolution of \r\n  Pattersonâ€™s claim, we address whether Patterson was incorrectly sentenced as \r\n  a second- time offender.Â  Patterson was sentenced pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.&nbsp;\r\nÂ§ 44-53-375(A) (2002), which provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nFor a second offense, the offender is \r\n  guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned not more than ten yearsâ€¦. \r\n  For a third or subsequent offense, the offender is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned \r\n  not less than ten years nor more than fifteen yearsâ€¦.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(A) (2002).\r\nSection 44-53-375(A) does not define \r\n  second offense.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-470 (2002), generally defines \r\n  â€œsecond or subsequent offenseâ€ as when an offender â€œhas at any time been convicted \r\n  under this article or under any State or Federal statute relating to narcotic \r\n  drugs, marihuana, depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs.â€Â  \r\nUnder Section 44-53-470, a prior offense is any \r\n  drug offense, including possession of marihuana.Â  Sections 44-53-375(A) and \r\n  44-53-470 are part of the same general law and can be read together without \r\n  conflict.Â  Cf. In re Keith Lamont G., 304 S.C. 456, 405 S.E.2d \r\n  404 (1991) (statutory sections that are part of the same general statutory law \r\n  must be construed together).Â  Moreover, all rules of statutory construction \r\n  are secondary to the rule that legislative intent must prevail if it can be \r\n  reasonably discerned from the statutory language.Â Â  Samuels v. State, \r\n  356 S.C. 635, 591 S.E.2d 606 (2004).Â  The legislature could not have intended \r\n  to exclude marihuana possession as a second or subsequent offense under Section \r\n  44-53-375(A) when Section 44-53-470 specifically defines a â€œsecond or subsequent \r\n  offenseâ€ as any drug offense, including marihuana.Â  When the terms of a statute \r\n  are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  \r\n  Holley v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994).Â  \r\n  Therefore, Pattersonâ€™s sentence was properly enhanced based on his prior conviction \r\n  for marihuana.\r\nThe PCR judge relied on Rainey v. \r\n  State, 307 S.C. 150, 414 S.E.2d 131 (1992).Â  Rainey is inapposite \r\n  to the case at bar.Â  Rainey pled guilty to distribution of crack cocaine and \r\n  was sentenced as a second offender under former Section 44-53-375 because of \r\n  prior convictions for marihuana possession.Â Â  Under former Section 44-53-375(B) \r\n  (Supp. 1990), the prior offense was limited to narcotic drugs.Â  The Court explained:\r\n\r\n[Rainey] was sentenced as a second offender under the crack \r\n  cocaine statute [S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (Supp. 1990)] based on his prior convictions for marijuana and\r\npossession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to Â§ 44-53-375(B), an enhanced sentence is required for a â€œsecond \r\n  offender, or if, in the case of a first conviction of a violation of this section, \r\n  the offender has been convicted of any [law] â€¦ relating to narcotic drugsâ€¦â€ \r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  Since [Rainey] does not have a prior crack cocaine conviction \r\n  and marijuana is not a narcotic drug as defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-110 \r\n  (1985), he should not have been sentenced as a second offender under Â§ 44-53-375(B).\r\n\r\nRainey, 307 S.C. at 151, 414 S.E.2d at 132 (footnote \r\n  omitted).Â  The State argued Rainey was a second offender under Section 44-53-470.Â  \r\n  In affirming the order of the PCR judge, the Court concluded:\r\n\r\nBecause there is a conflict between Â§ 44-53-375(B) and the \r\n  general second offense statute, the later, more specific crack cocaine statute \r\n  must prevail.Â  The PCR judge was correct in finding that [Rainey] is not a second \r\n  offender under Â§ 44-53-375(B) and should not, therefore, have been sentenced \r\n  as one.\r\n\r\nRainey, 307 S.C. at 152, 414 S.E.2d at 132.\r\nHere, Sections 44-53-375(A) and 44-53-470 \r\n  are not in conflict.Â  See also Thomas v. State, 319 S.C. \r\n  471, 465 S.E.2d 350 (1995) (finding no conflict between Sections 44-53-370(e)(1) \r\n  (Supp. 1994) and 44-53-470 (1985) for purposes of sentence enhancement); State \r\n  v. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 583 S.E.2d 437 (Ct.

Owners Group v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 338 S.C. 92, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 863 (1999) (KPOG I).Â  Upon remand, a subsequent PSC order, \r\n  and an appeal to the circuit court, the matter was again appealed to this Court, \r\n  resulting in the opinion finding that the subsequent PSC order was supported \r\n  by the evidence.Â  Kiawah Prop. Owners Group v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, (Op. \r\n  No. 25782, S.C. Sup. Ct. Filed February 9, 2004, Shearouse Adv. Sh. No.6 p. \r\n  14) (KPOG II).\r\nUpon this backdrop, another rate dispute \r\n  began in 1999, when the Utility set out to raise its rates and charges to permit \r\n  an operating margin of 9.5%.Â  The PSC submitted an order, which was affirmed \r\n  on appeal by the circuit court, authorizing a rate increase that would generate \r\n  a 6.5% operating margin.Â  KPOG has appealed the circuit court decision, raising \r\n  the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in finding that the PSCâ€™s decision to allow the Utility \r\n  to set its operating margin at 6.5% was supported by the record?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court err in affirming the PSCâ€™s treatment of several of the \r\n  Utilityâ€™s fee assessments and other affiliated transactions?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court judge err in affirming the PSCâ€™s refusal to require the \r\n  Developer and Utility to modify their cross-collateralized loan agreement with \r\n  the bank?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court err in refusing to require the PSC to stay this proceeding \r\n  until this Court issued its opinion in KPOG II?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe PSC is a government agency of limited power \r\n  and jurisdiction, which is conferred either expressly or impliedly by the General \r\n  Assembly.Â  City of Camden v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 283 S.C. \r\n  380, 382, 323 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1984).Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-210 (Supp. \r\n  2003) grants the PSC the â€œpower and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate the \r\n  rates and services of every public utility in this Stateâ€¦.â€Â  \r\nThe PSC should establish rates that will \r\n  produce revenues for the utility â€œreasonably sufficient to assure the confidence \r\n  in the financial soundness of the utility â€¦ and should be adequate, under efficient \r\n  and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it \r\n  to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.â€Â  \r\n  Bluefield WaterWorks and Improvement Co. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of West Virginia, \r\n  262 U.S. 679, 693, 43 S. Ct. 675, 679, 67 L. Ed. 1176 (1923). \r\n The PSC is considered â€œthe â€˜expertâ€™ designated \r\n  by the legislature to make policy determinations regarding utility rates; thus, \r\n  the role of a court reviewing such decisions is very limited.â€Â  Hamm v. South \r\n  Carolina Public Service Commâ€™n, 289 S.C. 22, 344 S.E.2d 600 (1986); Patton \r\n  v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 280 S.C. 288, 312 S.E.2d 257 (1984).Â  \r\n  Therefore, the party challenging a PSC order must establish that (1) the PSC \r\n  decision is not supported by substantial evidence and (2) the decision is clearly \r\n  erroneous in light of the substantial evidence in the record.Â  Patton, \r\n  280 S.C. at 291, 312 S.E.2d at 259; Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 161, 262 S.E.2d 18 (1980).Â Â Â Â \r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in finding that the PSCâ€™s decision \r\n  to allow the Utility to set its operating margin at 6.5% was supported by the \r\n  record?\r\n\r\nThe Utility applied for a rate increase \r\n  in 1999, requesting that the PSC allow it to charge rates sufficient to sustain \r\n  a 9.5% operating margin.Â  The PSC determined that a 6.5% operating margin was \r\n  appropriate.Â  KPOG asserts that the PSCâ€™s decision to set the Utilityâ€™s operating \r\n  margin at 6.5% is unsupported in the record.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the PSC hearing, the Utilityâ€™s treasurer, \r\n  Townsend Clarkson (Clarkson), testified that the application for a rate increase \r\n  was prompted by (1) a 20.2% increase in the cost of water since the Utilityâ€™s \r\n  prior rate application; (2) the capital cost incurred to improve and maintain \r\n  45 miles of transmission lines; and (3) the fact that the Utility had operated \r\n  at a net loss since 1995.Â  In addition, PSC staff member Thomas Ellison (Ellison) \r\n  testified that the Utility had an operating margin of negative 1.02% and recommended \r\n  that PSC permit the Utility to raise rates to sustain an operating margin of \r\n  8.03%.Â  \r\nBased on this testimony, the PSC concluded \r\n  that the Utility could raise its rates and charges to generate a 6.5% operating \r\n  margin, up from the 3.55% margin that the PSC had approved in the Utilityâ€™s \r\n  prior rate application.Â  \r\nWe hold that the PSCâ€™s decision to set \r\n  the Utilityâ€™s operating margin at 6.5% -- a number much less than what the PSC \r\n  staff recommended -- was supported in the record by the testimony of Clarkson \r\n  and Ellison. [1] Â  \r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in affirming the PSCâ€™s treatment \r\n  of several of the Utilityâ€™s fee assessments and other affiliated transactions?\r\n\r\nBuilding Incentive Fees\r\nKPOG asserts that the trial court erred in affirming \r\n  the PSCâ€™s determination that the Developerâ€™s building incentive fee, charged \r\n  to owners of undeveloped property, should not be recognized by the Utility for \r\n  ratemaking purposes.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn evaluation of the building incentive fee requires (1) \r\n  an analysis of the nature of the building incentive fee as compared to the â€œavailability \r\n  feeâ€ and (2) an application of a recent opinion by this Court: Total Envtl. \r\n  Solutions, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 351 S.C 175, 568 S.E.2d \r\n  365 (2002). \r\nKPOG argues that the building incentive fee -- a $40 fee \r\n  the Developer (who owns 100% of the Utility) assesses quarterly to all property \r\n  owners of undeveloped property -- does not differ from the â€œavailability feeâ€ \r\n  -- a $40 fee that the Developer formerly charged per quarter to property \r\n  owners of undeveloped property once the water and sewer lines approached within \r\n  100 feet of their lot line until the property owner connected to the water and \r\n  sewer system.Â  \r\nHistorically, the PSC ruled that the â€œavailability feesâ€ \r\n  would be recognized as a contribution by the parent-Developer to the subsidiary-Utility \r\n  in aid of construction, which would be recorded on the Utilityâ€™s balance sheet \r\n  as an appreciation or improvement to an asset -- a recognition that only affects \r\n  the Utilityâ€™s rate base.Â  \r\nIn prior orders, the PSC found that (1) the â€œbuilding incentive \r\n  feeâ€ charged by the Developer was instituted â€œfor the same purpose as the former \r\n  availability feeâ€¦,â€ and (2) the former â€œavailability feeâ€ was â€œnow known as \r\n  the â€˜building incentiveâ€™ fee.â€Â  The PSC also determined in the prior orders \r\n  that the proceeds from the building incentive fees should be recognized as a \r\n  contribution by the Developer to the Utility in aid of construction, the same \r\n  treatment given to the â€œavailability fees.â€\r\nIn the present case, the PSC determined that, based on the \r\n  evidence presented at the PSC hearing, the $40 quarterly building incentive \r\n  fee would not be treated as a contribution by the Developer in aid of \r\n  construction.Â  At the hearing, Clarkson testified that the building incentive \r\n  fee was â€œnot collected to assure water and sewer availability but instead to \r\n  encourage building houses on vacant lots.â€ [2] Â  The PSC refused to recognize the building \r\n  incentive fees as contributions in aid of construction because KPOG failed to \r\n  establish that building incentive fees were the same as the old â€œavailability \r\n  feesâ€ and that â€œthere was no proper methodology for characterizing building \r\n  incentive fees.â€Â  While we are skeptical of the PSCâ€™s historic inconsistent \r\n  treatment of these fees, we agree that Clarksonâ€™s testimony supports the conclusion \r\n  that the building incentive fees were not assessed to help subsidize the Utilityâ€™s \r\n  sewer and water infrastructure. [3] Â  \r\n In Total Envtl. Solutions, this \r\n  Court concluded that the PSC lacks jurisdiction to regulate availability fees \r\n  when there is no evidence that the utility received or directly benefited from \r\n  the assessment.Â  351 S.C. at 180, 568 S.E.2d at 369.Â  Since KPOG provided no \r\n  evidence that the Utility directly benefited from the building incentive fee, \r\n  we find that the circuit court correctly affirmed the PSCâ€™s decision to not \r\n  recognize the fee as a contribution in aid of construction.\r\nOther Affiliated Transactions\r\nKPOG asserts that the \r\n  Developer should reimburse the Utility (1) $64,000 of the $100,000 management \r\n  fee that the PSC did not recognize for ratemaking purposes, and (2) $139,807 \r\n  that the Utility paid the Developer for fire hydrants in 1991.Â  We find that \r\n  the PSC lacks the authority to order the Developer to reimburse the Utility \r\n  for the management fee or the cost of the fire hydrants.Â  KPOG II. \r\n  [4]  Â Â \r\nKPOG also asserts that \r\n  the PSC erred in (1) recognizing the Utilityâ€™s transfer and distribution lines \r\n  and the expenses involved with their upkeep for ratemaking purposes and (2) \r\n  refusing to include tap-in fees charged by the Developer to the Utility from \r\n  1992 to 1996 as revenues to the Utility.Â  Since KPOG first broached the transfer \r\n  line issue in its petition for rehearing to the PSC, the issue is not preserved.Â  \r\n  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 456 S.E.2d 436 (Ct. App. 1995) (a \r\n  party may not raise an issue in a motion to reconsider, alter or amend a judgment \r\n  that could have been presented prior to the judgment); see also McGee v. \r\n  Bruce Hosp Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996) (a party may not raise \r\n  an issue for the first time in a motion for a new trial).Â \r\nFurther, KPOG has not preserved \r\n  the tap-in fee issue because, while it initially raised the issue before the \r\n  PSC, it did not petition the circuit court to review the PSCâ€™s decision to not \r\n  recognize the tap-in fees as revenue.Â Â  See Pringle v. Builders Transp., \r\n  298 S.C. 494, 381 S.E.2d 731 (1989) (â€œA petition for circuit court review pursuant \r\n  to the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) must direct the court's attention \r\n  to the abuse allegedly committed below, including a distinct and specific statement \r\n  of the rulings of which appellant complains.â€).Â  \r\nISSUE III\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court judge err in affirming the PSCâ€™s refusal \r\n  to require the Developer and Utility to modify their cross-collateralized loan \r\n  agreement with the bank? \r\n\r\nKPOG argues that the Utilityâ€™s \r\n  1995 modification of its loan contract with Bank of America to cross-collateralize \r\n  and cross-default the Developerâ€™s outstanding loan with the bank was unfair.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAs we noted in KPOG \r\n  II, the argument that the cross-collateralized loan agreement will harm \r\n  ratepayers in the future does not present a justiciable controversy.Â  KPOG \r\n  II, at 22-23 (citing Pee Dee Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp; \r\n  Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983)).Â  Thus, this Court \r\n  will not review this issue at present.Â Â  \r\nISSUE IV\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in refusing to require the PSC \r\n  to stay this proceeding until this Court issued its opinion in KPOG II?\r\n\r\nKPOG asserts that the PSC should have stayed the \r\n  Utilityâ€™s rate application review until this Court issued its opinion in KPOG \r\n  II.Â  While these two appeals cover similar issues, they arise from separate \r\n  controversies: two different rate applications.\r\n Further, the Utility is statutorily authorized to \r\n  file a rate application every twelve months, and the PSC must act upon the application \r\n  within six months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-240(C) and (F) (Supp. 2002).Â  The \r\n  PSC only has authority to stay issuance of its order for five days beyond the \r\n  six-month period.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-240(D).Â  Therefore, PSC did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in failing to grant KPOGâ€™s request for stay pending our decision \r\n  in KPOG II.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the forgoing \r\n  reasoning, we find that the PSCâ€™s decision to raise the Utilityâ€™s rates to sustain \r\n  a 6.5% operating margin is supported by the record.Â  We further find that the \r\n  PSCâ€™s treatment of the building incentive fees was also supported by the evidence.Â  \r\n  All of KPOGâ€™s other claims are without merit.Â  Accordingly, we AFFIRM \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the PSC order. \r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  KPOG asserts that since the PSC determined that the expert testimony \r\n    of the Utilityâ€™s accountant, who testified that 9.5% was a reasonable operating \r\n    margin, was not credible; the PSC erred in arriving at the 6.5% figure.Â  But \r\n    as the circuit court judge duly noted, the PSC does not have to arrive at \r\n    the appropriate operating margin based on any expert testimony.Â  Rather, it \r\n    arrives at the operating margin figure based on its own staffâ€™s research, \r\n    and â€œthe rejection of [the accountantâ€™s] testimony did not leave [PSC] without \r\n    an evidentiary basis for its findings.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The building incentive fee assessment did not hinge on whether the \r\n    water and sewer infrastructure was within 100 feet of the undeveloped property \r\n    ownerâ€™s property line.Â  Rather, the fee was assessed to all undeveloped \r\n    property owners.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  There are inconsistencies in how the PSC has treated these fees.Â  \r\n    It admits that the fees are one in the same, and it seems that the only difference \r\n    in the two fees is, in fact, the name, for they both are collected to encourage \r\n    development.Â  But since KPOG did not meet the evidentiary standard, we hold \r\n    that the circuit court did not err in upholding the PSCâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  KPOG II provides that under S.C.

Shealy III, of Baker, Ravenel &amp; Bender, LLP, of Columbia, for \r\n  Appellant\r\nJohn P. Ford, Jr., and Kristi F. Curtis, both of Bryan, Bahnmuller, Goldman \r\n  &amp; McElveen, LLP, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  Gary George (George) and Geneva \r\n  Covington (Covington) were involved in an automobile accident in March 1999.Â  \r\n  At trial, George sought to introduce evidence that the hospital that treated \r\n  Covington accepted as full payment an amount less than that billed to Covington.Â  \r\n  The trial judge excluded the testimony pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, finding the \r\n  information would confuse the jury.Â  George appealed and the case was transferred \r\n  from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â Â  We affirm the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nGeorge rear-ended Covington on Highway 378 while Covington was stopped for \r\n  a school bus.Â  The damage to both vehicles was minor. \r\n  [1] Â  At trial, George admitted that he was liable for the accident, therefore \r\n  the only issue was damages.Â  George argued that Covington was entitled to only \r\n  a modest damage award because there was a low-impact collision resulting in \r\n  only soft tissue injuries.Â  \r\nAt trial, George proffered testimony of Ranell Benehaley, manager of medical \r\n  records for Tuomey Health Care System.Â  Benehaley testified, in camera, \r\n  that Covington was billed $1,430.00 for services performed in May 1999, but \r\n  that Tuomey accepted $276.86 as full payment for the services.Â  Benehaley also \r\n  testified that Covington was billed $1969.00 for services performed June 1999, \r\n  but Tuomey accepted $370.61 as payment on that account, while $58.05 was still \r\n  owed.Â  The trial judge would not allow the jury to hear the testimony, ruling \r\n  that under Rule 403, SCRE, the testimony would confuse the jury. George did \r\n  not seek to enter into evidence the source of the payments to Tuomey. [2] \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in refusing \r\n  to allow George to present evidence that the amount Covingtonâ€™s medical provider \r\n  accepted in payment was less than what it charged for its services?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nGeorge argues that this \r\n  Courtâ€™s opinion in Haselden v. Davis, 353 S.C. 481, 579 S.E.2d 293 (2003), \r\n  allows a defendant to introduce evidence that a medical provider accepted as \r\n  full payment an amount less than was billed for the services.Â  We disagree and \r\n  hold the trial court properly excluded the evidence of the amount Covingtonâ€™s \r\n  medical provider accepted as payment (hereinafter â€œactual payment amountâ€).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Haselden, the \r\n  question was whether the Plaintiff could recover the amounts â€œwritten offâ€ by \r\n  healthcare providers.Â  Id.Â  A majority of this Court held that those \r\n  amounts are recoverable by a plaintiff in a personal injury suit.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  In the case at hand, George argues that since Covington has the burden of proving \r\n  reasonable and necessary medical expenses as part of her damages, George should \r\n  be able to dispute the reasonableness of those charges through introduction \r\n  of the proffered testimony. \r\nWhether the actual payment amount \r\n  may be utilized to establish the reasonableness of medical expenses was ancillary \r\n  to the main issue in Haselden because both the billed amount and the \r\n  actual payment amount were admitted into evidence.Â  In Haselden, the \r\n  Plaintiff submitted evidence that she incurred medical expenses in the amount \r\n  of $77,905.21.Â  341 S.C. 486, 501, 534 S.E.2d 295, 303 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Medicaid \r\n  paid $24,109.04 to cover the services.Â  534 S.E.2d at 303.Â  The difference between \r\n  the amounts billed and the amounts actually paid by Medicaid was $51,620.59. \r\n  Id. Defendants entered a letter as a court exhibit, which showed the \r\n  gross amount of the bills for Plaintiffâ€™s services and the corresponding Medicaid \r\n  payments.Â  The admissibility of the actual payment amount was not an appellate \r\n  issue in Haselden, but rather the issue was Plaintiffâ€™s entitlement to \r\n  recover the difference between the billed amount and the actual payment \r\n  amount.\r\nThe case at hand differs substantially \r\n  from the situation in Haselden.Â  Here, George did not object to Covingtonâ€™s \r\n  introduction of the full amount of the bill but thereafter sought to introduce \r\n  the actual payment amount.Â  Covingtonâ€™s objection to this offer was sustained.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe question for this Court is \r\n  whether a party can introduce evidence of the actual payment amount to challenge \r\n  the reasonableness of the medical expenses sought by the plaintiff.Â  We hold \r\n  that the collateral source rule is directly implicated in this case, and the \r\n  actual payment amount was properly excluded.Â  Haselden, insofar as the \r\n  actual payment amount was before the court as evidence of reasonableness, is \r\n  limited to its facts.Â  \r\nThe collateral source rule provides â€œthat compensation received by an injured \r\n  party from a source wholly independent of the wrongdoer will not reduce the \r\n  damages owed by the wrongdoer.â€ Citizens and S. Natl. Bank of South Carolina \r\n  v. Gregory, 320 S.C. 90, 92, 463 S.E.2d 317, 317 (1995).Â  A tortfeasor cannot \r\n  â€œtake advantage of a contract between an injured party and a third person, no \r\n  matter whether the source of the funds received is â€˜an insurance company, an \r\n  employer, a family member, or other source.â€™â€Â  Pustaver v. Gooden, 350 \r\n  S.C. 409, 413, 566 S.E.2d 199, 201 (Ct. App. 2002)(citations omitted).Â  In this \r\n  case, the actual payment amounts were made by a collateral source.Â  \r\nGeorge argues that because he seeks only to introduce the fact of compromised \r\n  payments as opposed to their source, that no violence has been done to \r\n  the collateral source rule.Â  While facially appealing, this argument ignores \r\n  the reality that unexplained, the compromised payments would in fact confuse \r\n  the jury.Â  Conversely, any attempts on the part of the plaintiff to explain \r\n  the compromised payments would necessarily lead to the existence of a collateral \r\n  source.Â  Inevitably, the inquiry would lead to the introduction of matters such \r\n  as contractual arrangements between health insurers and health care providers, \r\n  resulting in the very confusion which the trial judge sought to avoid in his \r\n  proper application of Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nOther jurisdictions have held \r\n  that the actual payment amount is not admissible as evidence of reasonableness \r\n  of damages because that evidence would violate the collateral source rule.Â  \r\n  For example, in Radvany v. Davis, 551 S.E.2d 347 (Va. 2001), the Supreme \r\n  Court of Virginia held that: \r\n\r\npayments made to a medical provider \r\n  by an insurance carrier on behalf of an insured and amounts accepted by medical \r\n  providers are one and the same.Â  Regardless of the label used, they are payments \r\n  made by a collateral source and are not admissible in evidence for that reason.Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, such amounts are \r\n  not evidence of whether the medical bills are â€œreasonable, i.e., not excessive \r\n  in amount, considering the prevailing cost of such services.â€Â  The amounts \r\n  accepted by [Plaintiffâ€™s] health care providers represent amounts agreed upon \r\n  pursuant to contractual negotiations undertaken in conjunction with [Plaintiffâ€™s] \r\n  health insurance policy.Â  Such negotiated amounts, presumably inuring to the \r\n  benefit of the medical providers, the insurance carrier, and [Plaintiff], do \r\n  not reflect the â€œprevailing costâ€ of those services to other patients.Â  Id. \r\n  at 348 (emphasis supplied)(internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Goble v. Frohman, a \r\n  Florida court held the collateral source rule prohibited introduction of contractual \r\n  discounts that were â€œwritten offâ€ by the medical providers.Â  848 So.2d 406 (Fla. \r\n  2d DCA 2003).Â  The court stated that â€œ[t]o challenge the reasonableness or necessity \r\n  of the medical bills, [Defendant] could have introduced evidence on the value \r\n  of or need for medical treatmentâ€¦there generally will be other evidence having \r\n  more probative value and involving less likelihood of prejudice than the victimâ€™s \r\n  receipt of insurance-type benefits.â€Â  Id. at 410.Â  See also Fye \r\n  v. Kennedy, 991 S.W.2d 754, 764 (Tenn. Ct. App 1998)(holding that payments \r\n  that are forgiven, or paid by a third party is not evidence of the reasonableness \r\n  of a charge).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge correctly applied \r\n  Rule 403 and the collateral source rule in excluding evidence of the actual \r\n  payment amount.Â  While a defendant is permitted to attack the necessity and \r\n  reasonableness of medical care and costs, he cannot do so using evidence of \r\n  payments made by a collateral source.Â  The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice John W. Kittredge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The damage to Covingtonâ€™s car was estimated at \r\n    $1,519.97.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  It is not clear from the record, but Respondentâ€™s \r\n    brief states Medicare made the payments.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25829","title":"Denene, Inc. v.

Cantwell, both of Regan \r\n  &amp; Cantwell, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appellants filed a declaratory judgment \r\n  action seeking to invalidate an ordinance requiring that all commercial establishments \r\n  within the city of Charleston, which serve alcohol for on-site consumption, \r\n  close at 2 a.m.Â  Both appellants and the City of Charleston (City) moved for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  The trial court denied appellantsâ€™ motion for summary judgment \r\n  and granted Cityâ€™s motion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n On July 18, 2000, City enacted an ordinance \r\n  requiring that:\r\n\r\nCommercial establishments which allow for the on-premises \r\n  consumption of beer, ale, porter and/or wine shall be prohibited from operating \r\n  between the hours 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. on Mondays through Saturdays. \r\n\r\nPrior to voting on the ordinance, the Charleston City Council (Council) \r\n  offered public debate on the issue.Â  A number of citizens complained about noise, \r\n  vandalism, crime, litter, lewd acts, public urination, and general quality of \r\n  life, and believed closing the bars at 2 a.m. would diminish those problems.Â  \r\n  A number of other citizens spoke against the ordinance.Â  \r\n After the ordinance was ratified, appellants, \r\n  who own several bars in Charleston, filed a declaratory judgment action challenging \r\n  the ordinance.Â  The complaint alleged that: the ordinance was preempted \r\n  [1]  by state law; the ordinance violated appellantsâ€™ equal protection rights; \r\n  the ordinance violated appellantsâ€™ right to due process; and, the ordinance \r\n  was a taking in violation of Article I, Â§ 13, of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding that the ordinance does not violate \r\n  appellantsâ€™ equal protection rights?\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding that the ordinance does not violate \r\n  appellantsâ€™ due process rights?\r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding that the ordinance is not a regulatory \r\n  taking without compensation?\r\n\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  EQUAL PROTECTION\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred \r\n  in finding that the ordinance is subject to review under the rational basis \r\n  standard.Â  Appellants also claim the ordinance is invalid because it is selectively \r\n  enforced.Â  We disagree.\r\na. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Proper Standard \r\n  of Review \r\nCourts generally analyze equal protection challenges \r\n  under one of three standards: (1) rational basis; (2) intermediate scrutiny; \r\n  or, (3) strict scrutiny.Â  16B Am. Jur. 2d Constiutional Law Â§ 812 (1998).Â  If \r\n  the classification does not implicate a suspect class or abridge a fundamental \r\n  right, the rational basis test is used.Â  City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne \r\n  Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439-40 (1985).Â  â€œWhen social or economic legislation \r\n  is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows the states wide latitude, and \r\n  the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be \r\n  rectified by the democratic processes.â€Â  Id. (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nUnder the rational basis test, the requirements \r\n  of equal protection are satisfied when: (1) the classification bears a reasonable \r\n  relation to the legislative purpose sought to be affected; (2) the members of \r\n  the class are treated alike under similar circumstances and conditions; and, \r\n  (3) the classification rests on some reasonable basis.Â  Fraternal Order of \r\n  Police v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Rev., 352 S.C. 420, 430, 574 S.E.2d 717, \r\n  722 (2002); Gary Concrete Products, Inc. v. Riley, 285 S.C. 498, 504, \r\n  331 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1985). \r\nThe record clearly indicates the ordinance \r\n  was passed to alleviate problems caused by intoxicated people in Charleston \r\n  during the proscribed hours.Â  Mayor Riley testified that the growth of bars \r\n  and restaurants serving alcohol after 2 a.m. in Charleston created an intolerable \r\n  burden on the citizens of the city.Â  Riley stated that Council passed the ordinance \r\n  because of noise and other problems late at night, and that Council felt it \r\n  was appropriate to require commercial establishments that serve alcohol to close \r\n  at a more reasonable hour.Â  Further, Mayor Riley noted that residential areas \r\n  are in close proximity to bars and nightclubs in Charleston, and that Council \r\n  was simply trying to establish a â€œreasonable zone of peace and quiet in our \r\n  town and for our citizens.â€Â  \r\nHenry Fishburne, president of the Charles Towne \r\n  Neighborhood Association and a Council member, testified that Council had numerous \r\n  complaints about late night activities, which led Council to consider the ordinance.Â  \r\n  Fishburne also went on a â€œride alongâ€ with Charleston police, and testified \r\n  he saw large numbers of people partying, littering, and urinating in the streets \r\n  and outside of bars late at night.Â  \r\nLieutenant Charles Hawkins, of the Charleston City \r\n  Police Department, testified that he observed drinking, noise, public urination, \r\n  and vandalism in the late night hours in Charleston.Â  Hawkins also testified \r\n  that the problems related to late night drinking prevented officers from responding \r\n  to more serious crimes in the area.\r\nCiting City of Myrtle Beach v. Juel P. Corp. &amp; Gay Dolphin, Inc, \r\n  344 S.C. 43, 543 S.E.2d 538 (2001), appellants argue that the ordinance should \r\n  be strictly construed because it is in derogation of their â€œcommon law right \r\n  to use private property so as to realize its highest utility.â€Â  However, appellants \r\n  stretch the language they cite in Gay Dolphin, which involved a Myrtle \r\n  Beach ordinance prohibiting abandoned and obsolete signs.Â  While the Court in \r\n  Gay Dolphin did hold that ordinances in derogation of the natural rights \r\n  of a person over their property are to be strictly construed, the case did not \r\n  involve equal protection and did not involve the health, safety, or welfare \r\n  of the general population.Â  \r\nA municipality has the power to enact regulations \r\n  for the purpose of preserving the health, safety, welfare, and comfort of dwellers \r\n  in urban centers, particularly in regard to alcohol.Â  City of Charleston \r\n  v. Esau Jenkins, 243 S.C. 205, 209, 133 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1963).Â  As this \r\n  Court stated in Main v. Thomason: \r\n\r\n[t]he government is empowered by the state and federal constitutions \r\n  with the authority to legislate for the protection of the public health, welfare, \r\n  and morals. Courts will not interfere with the enforcement of regulations designed \r\n  for the protection of health, welfare, and safety of citizens unless they are \r\n  determined to be unreasonable. The exercise of police power is subject to judicial \r\n  correction only if the action is arbitrary and has no reasonable relation to \r\n  a lawful purpose.\r\n\r\n342 S.C. 79, \r\n  86-7, 535 S.E.2d 918, 922-23 (2000) (internal citations omitted); see also \r\n  Gary v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., 311 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (11th \r\n  Cir. 2002) (ordinance that barred persons under the age of twenty-one from entering \r\n  or working at any establishment selling alcohol, but not food, for on-premises \r\n  consumption, was subject to rational basis review rather than strict scrutiny \r\n  in an equal protection challenge); Other Place of Miami, Inc. v. City of \r\n  Hialeah Gardens, 353 So.2d 861, 863 (Fla. 3rd App. Dist. 1977) \r\n  (ordinances curtailing the closing hours for the sale of alcoholic beverages \r\n  from 3:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. were a valid exercise of the cityâ€™s police powers).Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the ordinance is rationally based and reasonably related to furthering \r\n  a legitimate government purpose.Â  Council, after allowing debate and public \r\n  input, determined that the operation of bars between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. had detrimental \r\n  effects on the quality of life of residents and upon the city in general.Â  Council \r\n  legitimately sought to address those problems by enacting the ordinance.Â  Based \r\n  on the undisputed disruptions and other problems residents encountered from \r\n  patrons of bars between the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., as well as law enforcement \r\n  difficulties in controlling the problems through enforcement of existing ordinances, \r\n  we find that Councilâ€™s actions were rationally based.Â  Accordingly, we hold, \r\n  the ordinance is a valid exercise of Cityâ€™s police powers and does not affect \r\n  a fundamental right.Â  \r\n \r\n  Additionally, appellants, as the owners of bars in Charleston, are clearly not \r\n  members of a suspect class, which has been defined by the U.S. Supreme Court \r\n  as a class â€œsaddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such history of \r\n  purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness \r\n  as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.â€Â  \r\n  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold the trial court correctly applied the rational basis \r\n  test. [2] Â  \r\nb.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Selective Enforcement\r\nAppellants also contend they have received disparate \r\n  treatment because other commercial establishments that have on-premises permits, \r\n  such as hotels and hospitals, [3] \r\n   are not being forced to cease all business operations during the proscribed \r\n  hours.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe trial court found appellantsâ€™ argument that \r\n  the City was not equally enforcing the ordinance because it was not forcing \r\n  hotels or hospitals to physically close their doors was without merit.Â  The \r\n  trial court ruled that interpreting the ordinance to require hotels to cease \r\n  operating from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. would require a strained reading of the ordinance.Â  \r\n  The trial court ruled it was clear the ordinance was directed to establishments \r\n  where on-premises consumption of alcohol occurs, and in the context of hotels \r\n  or hospitals, â€œthat means the public drinking areas, i.e. the bars and restaurants.â€Â  \r\n  The trial court further found that the ordinance could not apply to the confines \r\n  of privately rented rooms in hotels or hospitals simply because those rooms \r\n  exist in a commercial setting, and that a room within a hotel or hospital is \r\n  akin to a home, apartment, or dormitory.Â  \r\nThe trial court also found that all the evidence \r\n  in the record demonstrated the ordinance was being enforced in other establishments \r\n  where on-premises consumption of alcohol is allowed because the bars and other \r\n  public drinking areas of those establishments are required to close at 2 a.m.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the trial court found there was adequate testimony in the record \r\n  from law enforcement that, if hotel room service includes the sale of alcohol \r\n  during the proscribed hours, hotels will be cited for violating the ordinance.Â  \r\n\r\nAppellants argue before this Court that \r\n  they, as bar owners, are denied equal protection in violation of the United \r\n  States and South Carolina Constitutions because the ordinance is being selectively \r\n  enforced.Â  Appellants contend that, although the ordinance applies to all commercial \r\n  establishments that sell alcohol to be consumed on the premises, there is evidence \r\n  in the record that other commercial establishments with on-premises permits, \r\n  such as hotels and hospitals, are not required to cease operating from 2 a.m. \r\n  to 6 a.m.Â  \r\nRandall McBreyer, head of vice for the city of \r\n  Charleston Police Department, did testify in deposition that he was told to \r\n  limit enforcement of the ordinance to food and beverage operations.Â  However, \r\n  while McBreyer testified that he would not require a hotel such as Charleston \r\n  Place to entirely close its doors, he testified that he would cite the hotel \r\n  and shut down any portion of the hotel that served alcohol if it operated during \r\n  the proscribed hours.Â  \r\nPaul Stacey, manager of the Charleston Place Hotel, \r\n  testified at deposition that the hotel did not sell any alcoholic beverages \r\n  in the hotel or by room service between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.Â  \r\nCity also submitted an affidavit from Joseph C. \r\n  Good, Jr., general counsel for MUSC.Â  Good averred that, while MUSC had a bar \r\n  and held a beer and wine permit for receptions, MUSC did not operate events \r\n  with alcohol between the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.Â  \r\nWe hold that it is unreasonable to interpret the \r\n  ordinance so as to require hotels and hospitals to cease operating entirely \r\n  during the proscribed hours simply because they happen to allow on-premises \r\n  consumption of alcohol.Â  The sale of alcohol within hotels or hospitals is only \r\n  ancillary to their operation as commercial establishments.Â  All the evidence \r\n  in the record indicates that hotels and hospitals do not serve alcohol during \r\n  the proscribed hours, that hotels close down the portions of their businesses \r\n  that do serve alcohol, and that City is enforcing the ordinance against hotels \r\n  and hospitals.\r\nFurther, even assuming City is not enforcing \r\n  the ordinance equally, the fact that there is some unequal treatment does not \r\n  necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional equal protection violation.Â  \r\n  In Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 456, (1962), the U.S. Supreme Court \r\n  held that, â€œthe conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not \r\n  in itself a federal constitutional violation,â€ provided the selection is not \r\n  â€œdeliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or \r\n  other arbitrary classification.â€Â  See also Waters v. Gaston \r\n  County, North Carolina, 57 F.3d 422, 427 (4th Cir. 1995); Butler \r\n  v. Cooper, 554 F.2d 645, 646 (4th Cir. 1977) (before a claim \r\n  of unlawful discrimination in the enforcement of criminal laws can be established, \r\n  the plaintiff must allege and prove deliberate selective process of enforcement \r\n  based upon race or other arbitrary classification).Â Â Â  \r\nWe hold that even if there is evidence in the record \r\n  of unequal enforcement, any such evidence only rises to the level of â€œthe exercise \r\n  of some selectivity in enforcementâ€ of the ordinance.Â  Oyler v. Boles, \r\n  368 U.S. at 456.Â  Further, as noted previously, appellants are not members of \r\n  a protected class.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court correctly found no \r\n  equal protection violation.Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  DUE PROCESS\r\nAppellants contend the ordinance violates \r\n  due process because it deprives them of a protected property right to conduct \r\n  business.Â  We disagree.\r\nNo person shall be deprived of property \r\n  without due process of law.Â  U.S. Const. amend XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, \r\n  Â§ 3.Â  In order to prove a denial of substantive due process, a party must show \r\n  that he was arbitrarily and capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest \r\n  rooted in state law.Â  Sunset Cay, LLC v. City of Folly Beach, 357 S.C. \r\n  414, 430, 593 S.E.2d 462, 470 (2004).Â  The standard for reviewing all substantive \r\n  due process challenges to state statutes or municipal ordinances, including \r\n  economic and social welfare legislation, is whether the ordinance bears a reasonable \r\n  relationship to any legitimate interest of government.Â  Id. at 430, 593 \r\n  S.E.2d at 470.Â  \r\nAppellants cite Painter v. Town of Forest Acres, \r\n  231 S.C. 56, 97 S.E.2d 71 (1957) in support of their argument that the ordinance \r\n  violates their due process rights.Â  In Painter, Forest Acres passed an \r\n  ordinance that prohibited any business located within the town from operating \r\n  between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.Â  Id. at 58, 97 S.E.2d at 71.Â  \r\n  The ordinance stated that the noise of automobile traffic, lights, and other \r\n  problems that arose in the usual course of carrying on a business where the \r\n  public is being served constituted a nuisance.Â  Id. at 58, 97 S.E.2d \r\n  at 72.Â  The business owner who challenged the suit was the owner of a drive-in \r\n  restaurant.Â  She claimed the ordinance would cost her fifty percent of her business.Â  \r\n  Id. at 59, 97 S.E.2d at 72.Â Â  \r\nThis Court held that a municipal corporation \r\n  could not â€œmake a business a nuisance merely by declaring it as such.â€Â  The \r\n  Court found that the ordinance would seriously impair, if not destroy, many \r\n  lawful businesses.Â  Further, the Court noted the ordinance seemed to be directly \r\n  aimed at destroying Painterâ€™s business.Â  Accordingly, the Court held the ordinance \r\n  was so unreasonable as to be unlawful on its face.Â  Id. at 61, 97 S.E.2d \r\n  at 73.\r\nDespite appellantsâ€™ arguments to the \r\n  contrary, Painter does not stand for the proposition that City may never \r\n  restrict the operating hours of a business within its jurisdiction.Â  No one \r\n  has an unfettered right to pursue a business detrimental to the public health, \r\n  safety, and welfare.Â  See Greenville County v. Kenwood Enterprises, \r\n  Inc., 353 S.C. 157, 170-71, 577 S.E.2d 428, 435 (2003) (county ordinance \r\n  requiring a 1,500-foot setback for sexually oriented businesses based on the \r\n  rationale of combating secondary effects of those businesses was constitutional); \r\n  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 573, 549 S.E.2d 591, 599 (2001) (statute \r\n  making it unlawful to defraud a drug test furthers the public purpose of ensuring \r\n  a drug-free workplace, which is a legitimate exercise of the Stateâ€™s police \r\n  powers in regulating public safety and welfare, and outweighs any legitimate \r\n  interest of the business); Conway v. City of Greenville, 254 S.C. 96, \r\n  101, 173 S.E.2d 648, 650 (1970) (while not unlimited, a municipality does have \r\n  the authority in the exercise of the police power to enact zoning ordinances \r\n  restricting the use of privately owned property).\r\nAs this Court held in City of Charleston \r\n  v. Esau Jenkins, a municipal corporation has the power to â€œregulate any \r\n  trade, occupation or business, the unrestrained pursuit of which might affect \r\n  injuriously the public health, morals, safety or comfort; and in the exercise \r\n  of the power particular occupations may be . . . required to be conducted within \r\n  designated limits. . . .â€Â  243 S.C. at 210-11, 133 S.E.2d at 244.Â  We agree \r\n  with the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the ordinance is a limited measure designed \r\n  to curb the deleterious effects of the appellantsâ€™ operation of their establishments \r\n  during the early morning hours.Â  The ordinance is designed to maintain peace, \r\n  quietude, safety, order, and quality of life in Charleston, while still allowing \r\n  appellants to operate their businesses twenty hours a day.Â Â Â  \r\nWe hold the trial court correctly found that the \r\n  ordinance bears a reasonable relationship to Cityâ€™s legitimate interest in preserving \r\n  the health, morals, safety, and comfort of Charleston.Â Â  \r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TAKING\r\nAppellants claim the ordinance amounts to a partial regulatory taking without \r\n  compensation. Â We disagree.\r\nPrivate property shall not be taken for a public \r\n  use without just compensation.Â  U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ \r\n  13.Â  There are two main categories of takings: (1) where state law authorizes \r\n  a permanent physical occupation of property; and, (2) where state law so regulates \r\n  property that it has lost all economic value.Â  Sea Cabins on Ocean IV Homeowners \r\n  Assâ€™n., Inc. v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 418, 430, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  595, 601 (2001); Main v. Thomason, id. at 87, 535 S.E.2d at 933 \r\n  (2000).Â  \r\nWhere a regulation places limitations on land that \r\n  fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless \r\n  may have occurred.Â  Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 617 (2001) \r\n  (citing Penn Central Transp. Co. v. City of York, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978)).Â  \r\n  In determining whether the public benefit from a regulation outweighs the private \r\n  harm, the Court will consider: (1) the economic impact of the regulation; (2) \r\n  its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations; and, (3) the \r\n  character of the governmental action.Â  Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124-25; \r\n  Rickâ€™s Amusement, Inc. v. State, 351 S.C. 352, 357, 570 S.E.2d 155, 157 \r\n  (2001); Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 S.C. 297, 305, 534 S.E.2d \r\n  270, 274 (2000).Â  \r\nThe trial court found that the ordinance had a negative \r\n  economic impact on appellants and interfered with their investment-backed opportunities.Â  \r\n  However, the trial court found that appellantsâ€™ right to do business is, and \r\n  always has been subject to the Stateâ€™s police powers, and that the ordinance \r\n  was a reasonable exercise of those police powers.Â  Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  ruled that the ordinance did not constitute a compensable taking under the United \r\n  States or the South Carolina Constitutions.\r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  While \r\n  appellants suffered losses as a result of the ordinance, they are still free \r\n  to operate twenty hours a day, except Sundays, if they so choose.Â  The ordinance \r\n  appears to be designed for the legislative purpose of maintaining peace, quietude, \r\n  safety, order, and quality of life in Charleston.Â  Quantifying peace, quietude, \r\n  safety, order, and quality of life in a community is a normative decision best \r\n  left to a legislative body.Â  As noted by City, the operation of a bar has always \r\n  been subject to the stateâ€™s police powers.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-2-80 \r\n  (the State is the sole and exclusive authority empowered to regulate the operation \r\n  of all locations authorized to sell beer, wine, or alcoholic liquors, except \r\n  as it relates to hours of operation more restrictive than those set forth in \r\n  this title); Â§ 61-4-120 (it is unlawful for a person to sell or offer for sale \r\n  wine or beer in this State between the hours of twelve oâ€™clock Saturday night \r\n  and sunrise Monday morning).Â  \r\nWe hold \r\n  the ordinance is a legitimate exercise of Cityâ€™s police power and does not amount \r\n  to a compensable taking.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment \r\n  in favor of City.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice John W.
