Holder was\r\n  convicted of homicide by child abuse for the death of her son, Bobby (Bo)\r\n  Holder, and was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.Â  Holder appeals, arguing\r\n  the trial court committed reversible error (1)&nbsp;in allowing a police\r\n  investigator to testify regarding statements made by a codefendant during\r\n  interrogation, (2)&nbsp;in admitting testimony from a coworker regarding her\r\n  behavior, (3) in admitting autopsy photographs, and (4) in admitting photographs\r\n  taken of her son one month before his death that suggested prior abuse.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nHolderâ€™s\r\n  son, Bo, was born on January 3, 2000.Â  Holder started working at a hair salon\r\n  in January 2002, and she thereafter met Mark Martucci, who worked at a carpet\r\n  store next door.Â  Holder and her son moved in with Martucci sometime in early 2002.Â \r\n  Martucci was not Boâ€™s biological father.Â Â Â  \r\nBetween 12:00 p.m.\r\n  and 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, July 17, 2002, Bo, who was two-and-a-half years\r\n  old, was brought unconscious to the emergency room at Allen-Bennett Hospital in Greenville, South Carolina by Martucci and another man, identified as John Parker.[1]Â \r\n  Bo was not breathing and had no heartbeat.Â  Martucci told hospital personnel\r\n  that Bo had fallen off an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) earlier that week and had injured\r\n  himself.Â  When Holder later arrived at the hospital, she also told hospital\r\n  personnel that Bo had been involved in an ATV accident.Â  \r\nExtensive efforts\r\n  were made to resuscitate Bo, but they were unsuccessful and he was pronounced\r\n  dead.Â  Dr. Michael Eugene Ward, a pathologist who conducted the autopsy of Bo,\r\n  testified that Boâ€™s injuries were not caused by an accident.Â  Bo had bruising\r\n  in the pattern of knuckle marks on his face, and the inside of his lip had been\r\n  split.Â  Bruising was present around his mouth and face.Â  Bo also had numerous\r\n  bruises all over his body that were in various stages of healing.Â  Dr. Ward\r\n  concluded Bo died as a result of blunt force trauma to the abdomen.Â \r\n  Specifically, Bo sustained trauma to the visceral organs of his abdomen with a\r\n  tear in the small intestine, trauma to his pancreas, and bleeding into the\r\n  abdominal cavity that caused his body to shut down.Â  \r\nHolder gave a\r\n  statement to the police initially denying any knowledge of abuse.Â  When she was\r\n  told by investigators that they had discovered there had been no ATV accident,\r\n  Holder indicated that she wanted to tell what had happened and she gave a\r\n  second statement in which she admitted having knowledge of repeated incidents\r\n  of Martucciâ€™s abuse of Bo.[2]Â  \r\nAt a joint trial, Holder\r\n  and Martucci were convicted of homicide by child abuse in the death of Bo.Â \r\n  Holder was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.Â  Martucci did not appear for\r\n  trial, so his sentence was sealed.Â  Martucci subsequently appeared to receive\r\n  his sentence and was ordered to serve life in prison.Â  See State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 669 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œA person is guilty\r\n  of homicide by child abuse if the person . . . causes the death of a child\r\n  under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death\r\n  occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2003).Â  \r\nâ€œChild abuse or\r\n  neglectâ€ is defined for purposes of the statute as â€œan act or omission by any\r\n  person which causes harm to the childâ€™s physical health or welfare.â€Â  Id. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(1).Â  â€œHarm to the childâ€™s physical health or welfareâ€ occurs when\r\n  someone â€œinflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical injury,\r\nincluding injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal punishment.â€Â  Id. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(2)(a). \r\n\r\n(A)Â  Statements by\r\n  Codefendant\r\nHolder asserts the\r\n  trial court erred in allowing Doug Kelly, an investigator with the Greenville\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Office, to relate what codefendant Martucci told him during interrogation.Â \r\n  Martucciâ€™s redacted oral statement was allowed in to the effect that he had\r\n  noticed some bruises on Bo, and â€œhe felt like she had been inflicting them.â€Â \r\n  Holder contends her Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine\r\n  witnesses was denied, citing Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123\r\n  (1968), because Martucci did not testify at trial.Â  Holder alleges the\r\n  redaction of Martucciâ€™s statement was insufficient in this case.Â  \r\nThe Confrontation\r\n  Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which was extended to the states by the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to confront\r\n  witnesses against him, and this includes the right to cross-examine witnesses.Â  Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987).\r\nIn Bruton,\r\n  the Supreme Court held that, in a joint trial, admission of a non-testifying\r\n  codefendantâ€™s statement that expressly inculpates the defendant violates the\r\n  defendantâ€™s rights under the Confrontation Clause, as the use of only a\r\n  limiting instruction is insufficient to remove any prejudice to the defendant.Â \r\n  391 U.S. at 136-37.Â  \r\n In Richardson, the Supreme Court remarked that the rule announced in Bruton is a\r\n  â€œnarrowâ€ one that applies only when the statement implicates the defendant â€œon\r\n  its faceâ€; the rule does not apply where the statement becomes incriminating\r\n  only when linked to other evidence introduced at trial, such as the defendantâ€™s\r\n  own testimony.Â  Richardson, 481 U.S. at 207-08.Â  The Supreme Court also noted Bruton can be complied with by the use of redaction:\r\n\r\n  Even\r\n    more significantly, evidence requiring linkage differs from evidence\r\n    incriminating on its face in the practical effects which application of the Bruton exception would produce.Â  If limited to facially incriminating\r\n    confessions, Bruton can be complied with by\r\n    redaction--a possibility suggested in that opinion itself. Â Id., at\r\n      134, n. 10, 88 S.Ct., at 1626, n. 10.Â  If extended to\r\n    confessions incriminating by connection, not only is that not possible, but it is\r\n    not even possible to predict the admissibility of a confession in advance of\r\n    trial. \r\n\r\nId. at 208-09.\r\n In Gray v.\r\n  Maryland, 523 U.S. 185 (1998), a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court considered Brutonâ€™s application when the redaction consists of replacement of the\r\n  defendantâ€™s name with an obvious blank space, a symbol, or a word such as\r\n  â€œdeleted.â€Â  The Court noted the Richardson decision had limited the\r\n  scope of Bruton to instances where the reference to the defendant was on\r\n  the face of the statement.Â  However, the majority in Gray held that a\r\n  statement that â€œsubstituted blanks and the word â€˜deleteâ€™ for the petitionerâ€™s\r\n  proper name[] falls within the class of statements to which Brutonâ€™s\r\n  protections apply.â€Â  Id. at 197.Â  \r\nThe majority reasoned\r\n  that one must look at the kind of inferences that are necessary to make\r\n  a connection to the defendant, not the simple fact that there are inferences,\r\n  to determine the applicability of Bruton.Â  Id. at 196.Â  Richardson involved statements that did not directly refer to the defendant, but\r\n  which became incriminating only when linked to other evidence developed at\r\n  trial.Â  Id. at 196.Â  However, the Gray Court stated â€œ[t]he\r\n  inferences at issue here [in Gray] involve statements that, despite\r\n  redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant,\r\n  and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately,\r\n  even [if the statement was] the very first item introduced at trial.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the statements are protected under Bruton because in such instances\r\n  the defendant is implicated almost as if there was a direct reference, and the\r\n  connection does not depend on other evidence introduced at trial.Â  Id. at 196-97.Â  \r\nViolations of the\r\n  Confrontation Clause are subject to a harmless error analysis.Â  State v.\r\n    Murphy, 270 S.C. 642, 644, 244 S.E.2d 36, 36-37 (1978) (observing where a\r\n  wealth of evidence exists against the appellant, it eliminates any error in the\r\n  admission of a codefendantâ€™s statement).Â  â€œA [C]onfrontation [C]lause error is\r\n  harmless if the evidence is overwhelming and the violation so insignificant by\r\n  comparison that we are persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt,\r\n  that the violation did not affect the verdict.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Vincent, 120 P.3d 120, 124&nbsp;(Wash. Ct. App. 2005).Â â€œConsiderations include the importance of the\r\n  witnessâ€™s testimony, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or\r\n  absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness\r\n  on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and\r\n  the overall strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.â€[3]Â  Id.\r\nIn the current\r\n  appeal, Holder argues the substitution of her name with the pronoun â€œsheâ€ was insufficient\r\n  to obscure her identity because the jury could readily determine that the\r\n  statement referred to her as she was the only female defendant.Â  We find the\r\n  redaction in this case is analogous to that discussed in Gray because,\r\n  despite the redaction, it was apparent that Martucci was referring to Holder, and\r\n  this inference was one that could be readily made even without reliance on the\r\n  other testimony developed at trial. Â Thus, we find the admission of the\r\n  redacted statement violated Holderâ€™s rights under the Confrontation Clause as\r\n  Martucci did not testify and was not subject to cross-examination.\r\nHowever, even though\r\n  the redacted statement was admitted in error, we hold the error was harmless beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt in the context of the entire record.Â  Holder admitted in her\r\n  own statement to the police that she observed numerous instances where Martucci\r\n  abused her child, including dunking him in the bathtub to stop him from crying\r\n  while he gasped for air; striking him on the legs, back, and face; and taping\r\n  his mouth shut, among other things.Â  In her police statement, Holder stated\r\n  Martucciâ€™s abuse of Bo began when Martucci lost his job and he began\r\n  babysitting Bo.Â  \r\nHolder also\r\n  initially told hospital personnel that Bo was injured in an ATV accident, and\r\n  then later admitted there was no accident.Â  Holder was at home with Martucci\r\n  and her son on the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday prior to her sonâ€™s death on\r\n  Wednesday, July 17, 2002, so she was present during the time frame the\r\n  pathologist testified the fatal injuries occurred.Â  According to the medical\r\n  authorities, Boâ€™s distress would have been acute and impossible to ignore, and had Bo been taken to the hospital\r\n  when the injuries occurred, he could have been saved.Â  This failure to timely\r\n  seek medical attention for Bo is evidence of extreme indifference to human\r\n  life.\r\nCoworkers and\r\n  neighbors also testified that they had seen bruising on Bo while he was in the\r\n  company of Holder and that they had voiced their concerns to her.Â  In fact,\r\n  Holder was present when a neighbor took photographs to document the injuries.Â \r\n  Holder also fabricated statements to coworkers and even to hospital personnel\r\n  on the day of her sonâ€™s death to hide the true source of Boâ€™s injuries.Â  Thus,\r\n  Holder undoubtedly was aware of and was complicit in the severe abuse of her\r\n  son, leading to his eventual death by beating at the age of two-and-a-half\r\n  years.Â  Thus, it was established beyond a reasonable doubt that Holder was\r\n  guilty of the offense of homicide by child abuse independent of the challenged\r\n  statement so the error was harmless in the context of the entire record.\r\n(B)Â  Coworkerâ€™s Testimony\r\n  Regarding Holder\r\nHolder next\r\n  contends the trial court erred in allowing a coworker, Angela Eccles, to\r\n  testify that Holder began dressing differently and talked less about her child\r\n  once her relationship began with Martucci.Â  Holder argues the testimony was\r\n  inadmissible character evidence under Rule 404(a) of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Evidence (SCRE) because it implied Holder â€œwas acting in conformity with\r\n  this bad trait of her character by putting her relationship with Martucci ahead\r\n  of her own childâ€™s best interests.â€Â  \r\nEccles testified\r\n  that she is a hair stylist at Capelliâ€™s Hair Salon in Mauldin and had worked\r\n  there for seven years.Â  Holder started working at the salon in January 2002.Â \r\n  Mark Martucci worked at a carpet store next door.Â  Martucci was one of Holderâ€™s\r\n  first clients, and Eccles was aware that the two had developed a relationship\r\n  and moved in together.Â  \r\nEccles stated that\r\n  when Holder brought her son, Bo, to the salon for a haircut in early July 2002,\r\n  she noticed that Bo â€œhad bruises along the sides of his face.â€Â  Her impression,\r\n  based on his appearance, was that somebody had squeezed his face.Â  Eccles asked\r\n  Holder about it, and Holder said her son had been pushed into a swimming pool\r\n  by a dog at the home of Martucciâ€™s sister.Â  Eccles testified that Holder â€œadded\r\n  that she wouldnâ€™t have believed it herself, except it got caught on video\r\n  because Markâ€™s sister was videotaping at the time.â€[4]Â  \r\nEccles said that\r\n  during this July visit to the salon, Holderâ€™s son seemed upset compared to the\r\n  three or four times she had previously seen him and he was crying.Â  Holder told\r\n  her son, â€œYou better behave or Iâ€™m going to take you home to Mark.â€Â  At that\r\n  point, the child fell to the floor and cried and screamed, which Eccles said concerned\r\n  her because she â€œthought it was odd.â€Â  Â  \r\nWhen asked to\r\n  generally describe Holder during the time she worked with her, Eccles stated:\r\n\r\n  When\r\n    she first started working there, she talked more about Bo and -- itâ€™s hard to\r\n    explain.Â  She was a little more soft-spoken.Â  She dressed a little more\r\n    conservatively.Â  And over a period of weeks, it started to change, especially\r\n    now looking back at the change of her dress.Â  She started dressing a little\r\n    different.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel\r\n  objected to this last response quoted above, summarily stating, â€œreasonable\r\n  objection under Rule 404, Your Honor, placing her character in evidence.â€ The\r\n  trial court overruled the objection.Â  Eccles concluded her testimony on this\r\n  particular point by stating that Holder did not talk as much about Bo and\r\n  starting talking about â€œMark, Mark, Markâ€ basically â€œall the timeâ€ once they\r\n  met.Â  She stated she did â€œknow if itâ€™s just because weâ€™re all moms, but we [the\r\n  other salon employees] all talk[ed] about our kids, kids, kids.â€Â Â Â  \r\nEccles later\r\n  testified, without objection, that Holder had stopped speaking to her parents,\r\n  although Holder said they had tried to call her.Â  Eccles stated, â€œI donâ€™t\r\n  remember if it was her or Mark that had told her she didnâ€™t need to talk to\r\n  them or if she herself just did not want to have anything to do with them\r\n  anymore.â€Â  \r\nThe State contends\r\n  the testimony was relevant to Holderâ€™s state of mind as it was required to\r\n  prove that Holder caused the death of her child while committing abuse or\r\n  neglect, and the death occurred under circumstances manifesting an extreme\r\n  indifference to human life.Â  Thus, the evidence about Holderâ€™s relationship\r\n  with Martucci, her changed appearance, and her failed relationship with her\r\n  parents[5] was relevant to Holderâ€™s state of mind.Â  \r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of testimonial\r\n  evidence falls within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court, whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse resulting in\r\n  prejudice.â€Â  State v. Brannon,&nbsp;341 S.C. 271, 277, 533 S.E.2d 345,\r\n  348&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).\r\nâ€œEvidence of a\r\n  personâ€™s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of\r\n  proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.â€Â  Rule 404(a),\r\n  SCRE.Â  An exception to this rule exists for â€œ[e]vidence of a pertinent trait of\r\n  character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same.â€Â  Id. Rule 404(a)(1).\r\nâ€œThe term\r\n  â€˜characterâ€™ refers to a generalized description of a personâ€™s disposition or a\r\n  general trait such as honesty, temperance or peacefulness.â€Â  State v. Nelson,\r\n  331 S.C. 1, 7, 501 S.E.2d 716, 719&nbsp;(1998).Â  â€œGenerally speaking, character\r\n  refers to an aspect of an individualâ€™s personality which is usually described\r\n  in evidentiary law as a â€˜propensity.â€™â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  \r\nâ€œA person is guilty\r\n  of homicide by child abuse if the person . . . causes the death of a child\r\n  under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death\r\n  occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human\r\n  life.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2003) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nFor purposes of the\r\n  homicide by child abuse statute, â€œextreme indifferenceâ€ has been defined as â€œa\r\n  mental state akin to intent characterized by a deliberate act culminating in\r\n  death.â€Â  McKnight v. State,&nbsp;378 S.C. 33, 48, 661 S.E.2d 354,\r\n  361&nbsp;(2008) (quoting State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 98, 564 S.E.2d\r\n  362, 367 (Ct. App. 2002)).\r\nWe conclude Ecclesâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding Holder is not inadmissible character evidence.Â  Rather, the\r\n  coworker was merely recounting her version of events leading up to the time\r\n  Holderâ€™s child was killed, as well as her impression of Holder during this time\r\n  frame.Â  The Stateâ€™s purpose for offering the testimony was not to show Holder\r\n  had a propensity to abuse her child in conformance with a character trait.Â \r\n  Rather, it was to show Holderâ€™s strong desire to please Martucci instead of\r\n  protecting the welfare of her child and to establish an element of the offense,\r\n  that she manifested an extreme indifference to the well-being of her son.Â  \r\nMoreover, the\r\n  impact of this brief evidence was minimal in light of the record as a whole,\r\n  and it was cumulative to other evidence along these same lines that was\r\n  admitted without objection.Â  See, e.g., State v. Brown,&nbsp;344\r\n  S.C. 70, 75, 543 S.E.2d 552, 554-55&nbsp;(2001) (holding the erroneous\r\n  admission of evidence is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it is minimal\r\n  in the context of the entire record and cumulative to other testimony admitted\r\nwithout objection). \r\n\r\n(C)Â  Autopsy Photographs\r\nHolder next argues\r\n  the trial court committed reversible error in admitting autopsy photographs,\r\n  especially those showing Boâ€™s internal injuries, into evidence.Â  \r\nâ€œThe relevancy,\r\n  materiality, and admissibility of photographs as evidence are matters left to\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court.â€Â  State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501,\r\n  508, 466 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1996).Â  â€œIf the offered photograph serves to\r\n  corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit it.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œTo constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must create â€˜an undue\r\n  tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not\r\n  necessarily, an emotional one.â€™â€Â  State v. Jackson, 364 S.C. 329, 334,\r\n  613 S.E.2d 374, 376 (2005) (quoting State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377,\r\n  382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991)). \r\nIn the current\r\n  appeal, the pathologist, Dr. Michael Eugene Ward, testified, in camera, that\r\n  the photographs would help him in â€œdemonstrating the anatomic relationships and\r\n  the disruption of those anatomic relationships.Â  There may be some lack of\r\n  knowledge of internal anatomy [among the jurors].â€Â  Dr. Ward stated he could\r\n  explain the injuries to the jury without the photographs, but he was not sure\r\n  if he could â€œexplain it to their understanding.â€Â  He also noted that this\r\n  â€œwould be the best way by not only demonstrating the anatomic relationships,\r\n  but also showing the injuries.â€Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  his testimony, Dr. Ward explained that some of Boâ€™s internal injuries showed\r\n  signs of trying to heal, so they had been inflicted more than a day before his\r\n  death.Â  Dr. Ward stated Bo also had external bruising on his abdomen that was\r\n  probably inflicted closer to the time of his death.Â  The pathologist also\r\n  indicated blunt trauma force was used and noted the extensive bruising over the\r\n  childâ€™s body.Â  Dr. Ward used the photographs to explain the evidence and the\r\n  reasons for his findings. \r\nWe\r\n  find the photographs clearly demonstrate the extent and nature of the injuries\r\n  in a way that would not be as easily understood based on the testimony alone.Â  The\r\n  photographs corroborated the pathologistâ€™s testimony about the extensive\r\n  bruising on the child, which was in various stages of healing, and showed that\r\n  even internal organs manifest signs of bruising.Â  This is particularly helpful to\r\n  jurors who are unversed in medical matters.Â  Although Holder testified she was\r\n  unaware of any marks on her son prior to his death and thought he was suffering\r\n  from simple food poisoning, it is abundantly clear from the extensive bruising\r\n  on the child, which was in various stages of healing, and the torn internal\r\n  organs, that he had been seriously injured.Â  These photographs demonstrate that\r\n  the damage to the child would have been difficult to ignore. \r\nAlthough\r\n  the photographs were graphic, the facts in this case were graphic, and there is\r\n  no suggestion that their admission had an undue tendency to suggest a decision\r\n  on an improper basis.Â  We hold the trial court properly exercised its\r\n  discretion in admitting the autopsy photographs in this case.Â  See, e.g., State v. Ward,&nbsp;374 S.C. 606, 613, 649 S.E.2d 145, 149 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (holding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing two\r\n  autopsy photographs to illustrate a graze wound on the murder victimâ€™s back as the\r\n  juryâ€™s understanding of the graze wound was necessary to rebut the defenseâ€™s\r\n  argument about the angle of the shot); State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 106-07,\r\n  564 S.E.2d 362, 371 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding the trial court properly admitted several\r\n  autopsy photographs in a case of homicide by child abuse because they were necessary\r\n  for the jury to comprehend the pathologistâ€™s testimony regarding the extent of\r\n  the babyâ€™s injuries and the nature of the abuse; the court noted that, â€œwhile\r\n  some of â€˜the photograph[s] are\r\n  graphic, the facts of the case are very graphicâ€™\r\n  and the photos helped the jury understand the pathologistâ€™s testimonyâ€ (alteration\r\n  in original)). Â \r\n(D)Â  Photographs Showing\r\n  Prior Abuse of the Victim\r\nHolder lastly argues\r\n  the trial court erred in admitting Stateâ€™s Exhibits 16 and 17, photographs\r\n  taken of her son approximately a month before his death, because they were\r\n  intended to imply her son had previously been abused.Â  Holder contends the\r\n  photographs were inadmissible evidence of prior bad acts and the State failed\r\n  to prove the prior abuse by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Holder asserts the\r\n  photographs â€œshow minor injuries at best [even] if they were intentionally\r\n  inflicted.â€Â  \r\nStateâ€™s Exhibit 16 shows\r\n  a woman kneeling next to Bo, whose back is facing the camera.Â  The woman has\r\n  pulled Boâ€™s T-shirt up to reveal faint bruising on his back.Â  In Stateâ€™s\r\n  Exhibit 17, the same woman is holding Boâ€™s right arm straight out with the\r\n  inside of the arm facing up.Â  A small, triangular mark resembling a burn is visible\r\n  just below the childâ€™s elbow.Â  Both photographs bear the date June 20, 2002.\r\nElizabeth Jane\r\n  Venesky testified that she lived next door to Martucci, Holder, and Bo, and\r\n  that she is the woman who appears in the two photographs.Â  She said the\r\n  photographs were taken by her husband, Ronald Venesky, on or about June 20,\r\n  2002, and Holder was present.Â  Venesky stated when Holder came over that day\r\n  with Bo, she noticed Bo had a bruise on his shoulder, a burn mark, and â€œa\r\n  busted lip.â€Â  Veneskyâ€™s son, who played with Bo, mentioned seeing bruises on\r\n  Bo, so Venesky decided to have some photographs taken because she thought\r\n  â€œsomething is not right [with] this.â€Â  Venesky explained, â€œAnd so thatâ€™s how we\r\n  came to take the pictures.Â  Because I thought, well, if something happens or we\r\n  see heâ€™s being abused, at least, weâ€™ll have some kind of pictures.â€Â Â Â  \r\nVenesky further testified\r\n  that, around the same time the photographs were taken, Holder and Bo spent the\r\n  night with her after Holder told her Martucci had kicked them out.Â  The next\r\n  day, Venesky arranged for her step-cousin to take care of Bo for a day after\r\n  Holder told her she needed someone to keep him and did not want to contact her\r\n  parents.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nVenesky stated\r\n  Holder thereafter called her and was angry that photographs had been taken of\r\n  her son.Â  Venesky reminded Holder that she had been present when the\r\n  photographs were made.Â  Venesky recalled that Holder stated at one point during\r\n  their conversation that â€œshe was just mad, that she smacked Bo in the mouth\r\n  when he back-talked her.â€Â  \r\nRobin Center, Veneskyâ€™s step-cousin, testified that when Holder left Bo with her, she noticed Bo\r\n  had a triangular burn mark, which looked like it was caused by the end of an\r\n  iron, as well as a swollen, lacerated lip.Â  Bo also had a large black bruise on\r\n  the back of his neck, as well as â€œpurplish-lookingâ€ bruises on the small of his\r\n  back and some additional, lighter bruising.Â  Center stated â€œthereâ€™s just so\r\n  much that I s[aw] on himâ€ and it was â€œreally shocking.â€Â  \r\nâ€œThe admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Pagan,&nbsp;369 S.C. 201, 208,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 262, 265&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\n  controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œEvidence of other\r\n  crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in\r\n  order to show action in conformity therewith.â€Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  â€œIt may,\r\n  however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common\r\n  scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.â€Â  Id.Â  Evidence of prior bad acts that are not the subject of a conviction must be\r\n  establishing by clear and convincing evidence.Â  State v. Smith, 300 S.C.\r\n  216, 218, 387 S.E.2d 245, 246-47 (1989).Â  â€œThe evidence admitted â€˜must\r\n  logically relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.â€™â€Â  State\r\n    v. Stokes,&nbsp;381 S.C. 390, ___, 673 S.E.2d 434, 441 (2009) (quoting State\r\n      v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000)).\r\nThe probative value\r\n  of the evidence must outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â \r\n  The determination of the prejudicial effect of the challenged evidence must be\r\n  based on the entire record, and the result will generally turn on the facts of\r\n  each case.Â  State v. Gillian,&nbsp;373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872,\r\n  876&nbsp;(2007).\r\nâ€œA person is guilty\r\n  of homicide by child abuse if the person . . . causes the death of a child\r\n  under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death\r\n  occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2003).Â  \r\nFor purposes of the\r\n  homicide by child abuse statute, â€œchild abuse or neglectâ€ is defined as â€œan act\r\n  or omission by any person which causes harm to the childâ€™s physical health or\r\n  welfare.â€Â  Id. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(1).Â  The statute defines â€œharmâ€ as occurring\r\n  when a person â€œinflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child\r\n  physical injury, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal\r\n  punishment.â€Â  Id. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(2)(a) (emphasis added).\r\nâ€œExtreme\r\n  indifferenceâ€ as used in the statute has been defined as â€œa mental state akin\r\n  to intent characterized by a deliberate act culminating in death.â€Â  McKnight\r\n    v. State,&nbsp;378 S.C. 33, 48, 661 S.E.2d 354, 361&nbsp;(2008) (quoting State\r\n      v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 98, 564 S.E.2d 362, 367 (Ct. App. 2002)).\r\nâ€œThe statute makes\r\n  clear that child abuse may be committed by either an act or an omission which causes harm to a childâ€™s physical health.â€ Â State v. Smith, 359\r\n  S.C. 481, 492, 597 S.E.2d 888, 894 (Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis in original).Â \r\n  â€œAdditionally, harm to a childâ€™s health occurs when a person either inflicts,\r\n    or allows to be inflicted physical injury upon a child.â€Â  Id. (emphasis in original).Â  In Smith, the court concluded there was\r\n  evidence of homicide by child abuse where, among other things, the medical\r\n  evidence indicated the injuries to the child were so severe that they were the\r\n  result of child abuse that would have been readily apparent.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe hold the trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs in this instance.Â \r\n  Under section 16-3-85, the State was required to show Holder manifested an\r\n  â€œextreme indifferenceâ€ to her childâ€™s well-being.Â  These photographs tend to\r\n  establish Holder was aware of ongoing abuse of her child, which is directly\r\n  relevant to whether her acts or omissions resulted in the death of Bo.Â  They\r\n  are thus relevant to establish elements of the offense, including â€œextreme\r\n  indifference.â€\r\nFurther, the\r\n  photographs established a pattern of continuous abuse and neglect, which made\r\n  it more probable that Bo was a victim of child abuse or neglect rather than a\r\n  mere accident.Â  The Stateâ€™s primary theory in this case was that Holder had\r\n  allowed Martucci to abuse Bo in the months prior to his death.Â  Holderâ€™s\r\n  culpability for homicide by child abuse arose from her complicity in the abuse,\r\n  which culminated in the death of Bo on July 17, 2002 from severe internal\r\n  injuries that had been inflicted in the day or days prior to his death.Â  \r\nThe injuries to Bo\r\n  at the time these photographs were taken, including the bruising on his back\r\n  and the mark on his arm, were similar to the injuries he had sustained prior to\r\n  his death, as the pathologist noted extensive bruising on Boâ€™s back and an\r\n  unusual mark on his arm, among other injuries.Â  Bo also had a lacerated mouth\r\n  at the time of his death, which is similar to the split lip the witnesses\r\n  testified they observed in June 2002.Â  See, e.g., State v. Gaines,&nbsp;380\r\n  S.C. 23, 30, 667 S.E.2d 728, 731&nbsp;(2008) (â€œWhere there is a close degree of\r\n  similarity between the crime charged and the prior bad act, both this Court and\r\n  the Court of Appeals have held prior bad acts are admissible to demonstrate a\r\n  common scheme or plan.â€).Â  \r\nThe photographs\r\n  also corroborated other evidence that was admitted on this point without\r\n  objection.Â  Venesky and Center both testified without objection about the\r\n  injuries they observed on Bo, including the bruising on his back and the burn\r\n  mark, and Holder admitted that she had hit her son in the face.Â  Thus, we find\r\n  there was clear and convincing evidence of prior abuse of Bo and conclude the\r\n  photographs were properly admitted by the trial court.\r\nIII.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the conviction and sentence of Holder are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Parker, who had been staying with Martucci and\r\n  Holder, pled guilty to aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse and\r\n  testified at the trial in this matter.Â  Parker stated he had repeatedly urged\r\n  Martucci to take Bo to the hospital on the morning of Boâ€™s death, but Martucci\r\n  had initially refused.Â  Parker also testified that he had witnessed Martucci\r\nabusing Bo on several occasions. \r\n[2]Â  At trial, Holder repudiated her police statement in\r\n  which she admitted knowledge of abuse, maintaining it had been fabricated by\r\nthe authorities.\r\n[3]Â  In Vincent, the Washington Court of Appeals\r\n  stated that, although the use of â€œthe other guyâ€ had been upheld as a proper\r\n  substitution in previous cases, the exact words used for redaction must be\r\n  evaluated in context to determine whether the reference to the defendant was\r\n  adequately obscured.Â  Thus, there could be some instances where this identical phrase\r\n  would not be sufficient, such as where the implication of the defendant is\r\n  apparent.Â  The court concluded, however, that any error in this case was\r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence of the defendantâ€™s\r\n  guilt was overwhelming and the disputed statement was merely cumulative to\r\n  other, admissible evidence.Â  Id. at 156-57. \r\n[4]Â  No videotape of this alleged event was offered at\r\n  trial.\r\n[5]Â  No objection was made to the testimony concerning\r\n  Holderâ€™s relationship with her parents.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26645","title":"American Petroleum v.

Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 12-36-2120 to provide that certain energy efficient products purchased for\r\n  noncommercial use are exempted from sales tax.Â  The second section, entitled\r\n  \"Sales tax exemption; Second Amendment Recognition Act,\" amends S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 12-36-2120 to provide that sales of handguns, rifles, and shotguns during the\r\n  \"Second Amendment Weekend\" are exempted from sales tax.Â  The third section,\r\n  entitled \"Terminal and other requirements,\" amends Article 3 of Title 12,\r\n  Chapter 28 by adding the following section:\r\n\r\n  Section 12-28-340.\r\n    (A)Â  Regardless of other products offered, a terminal,\r\n    as defined in Section 12-28-110(56), located within the State must offer a\r\n    petroleum product that has not been blended with ethanol and that is suitable\r\n    for subsequent blending with ethanol.\r\n  (B)Â  A person or entity must not take any action to\r\n    deny a distributor, as defined in Section 12-28-110(17), or retailer, as\r\n    defined in Section 12-28-110(52), who is doing business in this State and who\r\n    has been registered with the Internal Revenue Service on Form 637(M) from being\r\n    the blender of record afforded them by the acceptance by the Internal Revenue\r\n    Service of Form 637(M).\r\n  (C)Â  A distributor or retailer and a refiner must\r\n    utilize the Renewable Identification Number (RIN) trading system.Â  Nothing in\r\n    this section should be construed to imply a market value for RINs.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Act was originally introduced in the Senate and contained only the language\r\n  that ultimately became the first section, relating to sales tax exemptions for\r\n  energy efficient products.Â  The House then amended the bill to add a sales tax\r\n  holiday for firearms.[1]Â \r\n  Finally, upon return to the Senate, the section regarding fuel blending was\r\n  added, over the objection of the sponsor of the original form of the Act.Â  The\r\n  Governor vetoed the Act and returned it to the Senate.Â  Among the stated\r\n  reasons for the veto was the Governor's finding that the Act was\r\n  unconstitutional as violative of Article III, Â§ 17 of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution.Â  The House and Senate then overrode the Governor's veto.Â  \r\nPetitioners filed a\r\n  complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that section 3 of the Act is\r\n  unconstitutional as violating the one subject provision of Article III, Â§ 17 of\r\n  the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Petitioners asked this Court to entertain the\r\n  matter in its original jurisdiction and to temporarily enjoin implementation of\r\n  section 3 of the Act.Â  We granted the petition and issued the temporary\r\n  injunction as to section 3.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nArticle\r\n  III, Â§ 17 is to be liberally construed so as to uphold an Act if practicable. Sloan\r\n    v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005).Â  Doubtful or close cases\r\n  are to be resolved in favor of upholding an Act's validity. Id.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA. Act 338 violates the\r\n  one subject rule of the S.C. Constitution.\r\nArticle\r\n  III, Â§ 17 of the South Carolina Constitution is entitled \"One subject\" and\r\n  provides that \"[e]very Act or resolution having the force of law shall relate\r\n  to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\" S.C. Const. art.\r\n  III, Â§ 17.Â  The purpose of Article III, Â§ 17 is: (1) to apprise the members of\r\n  the General Assembly of the contents of an act by reading the title; (2) to prevent\r\n  legislative \"log-rolling\"; and (3) to inform the people of the State of the\r\n  matters with which the General Assembly concerns itself. S.C. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Auth. v. Citizens and S. Nat'l Bank of S.C., 300 S.C. 142, 162, 386 S.E.2d\r\n  775, 786-87 (1989).\r\nThe title of an act\r\n  \"need not be an index to every provision of the act\" in order to \"apprise\r\n  members of the General Assembly\" and \"inform the people of the State.\" Carll\r\n    v. S.C. Jobs-Economic Dev. Auth., 284 S.C. 438, 442, 327 S.E.2d 331, 334\r\n  (1985).Â  Here the title is in fact an index to each of the three provisions, so\r\n  both the General Assembly and people are on notice.\r\nWhat remains for\r\n  consideration is whether the Act constitutes legislative log-rolling, thus\r\n  invalidating the Act in part or in its entirety.Â  \"Log rolling\" is a\r\n  \"legislative practice of including several propositions in one measure . . . so\r\n  that the legislature . . . will pass all of them, even though these\r\n  propositions might not have passed if they had been submitted separately.\"\r\n  Black's Law Dictionary 849 (7th ed. 1999).Â  To prevent this practice, our\r\n  constitution requires that an act relate to only one subject. Hercules, Inc.\r\n    v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137, 262 S.E.2d 45 (1980).\r\nPetitioners contend\r\n  that section 3 of the Act violates the one subject rule.Â  Respondents do not\r\n  contend that section 3 is related, noting in brief that they \"do not seek to\r\n  defend the constitutionality of Section 3, but rather submit that Sections 1\r\n  and 2 relate to one subject in compliance with Article III, Â§ 17 . . . .\" \r\nIntervenor\r\n  South Carolina Petroleum Marketers Association (Intervenor) argues that all\r\n  three sections pertain to one subject since (1) sections 1 and 2 provide tax\r\n  exemptions while section 3 protects a tax credit and (2) all three sections provide\r\n  a direct benefit to South Carolina businesses.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  are not persuaded by Intervenor's arguments.Â  Intervenor's assertion that all\r\n  three sections deal with either tax exemptions or tax credits requires an\r\n  unduly expansive and conjectural view of section 3.Â  While sections 1 and 2\r\n  specifically set forth tax exemptions, protection of a tax credit is not\r\n  specifically mentioned in section 3.Â  Instead, section 3 requires, among other\r\n  things, that motor fuel terminals offer petroleum products that have not been\r\n  blended with ethanol and that distributors, retailers, and refiners utilize the\r\n  Renewable Identification Number Trading System.Â  The legislature may have any\r\n  number of reasons for these requirements.Â  Moreover, the statute mandates only\r\n  delivery of the unblended fuel to local \"jobbers.\"Â  There is no requirement\r\n  that the fuel actually be blended for purposes of the federal tax credit.Â \r\n  Intervenor's second point is similarly speculative.[2]\r\nIt is also\r\n  significant that the heading for section 3, found in the body of the Act, makes\r\n  no mention of taxes, though the headings for sections 1 and 2 do so\r\n  explicitly.Â  Section 1 is entitled \"Sales tax exemption,\" section 2 \"Sales tax\r\n  exemption; Second Amendment Recognition Act,\" and section 3 \"Terminal and other\r\n  requirements.\"\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated above, we find that the provisions of Act 338 do not relate to one\r\n  subject.Â  The Act is therefore violative of Article III, Â§ 17 of the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution.\r\nB. Act 338 is\r\n  unconstitutional in its entirety.\r\nHaving found a\r\n  violation of the constitution, we must consider whether any portion of the Act\r\n  is severable.Â  Both Petitioners and Respondents urge us to sever section 3 from\r\n  the Act, as the \"offending provision,\" if we find that the one subject rule is\r\n  violated.Â  However, we find that to sever only part of the unconstitutional act\r\n  would require this Court to go beyond its proper role and to intrude into the\r\n  province of the legislature.Â  We therefore are constrained to find the entire\r\n  Act violative of Article III, Â§ 17.\r\nRecent\r\n  precedent from this Court stands for the proposition that an Act which offends\r\n  Article III, Â§ 17 of the South Carolina Constitution may merely be shorn of its\r\n  \"offending provision\" where \"the constitutional portion of the legislation remains\r\n  complete in itself, wholly independent of that which is rejected, and is of\r\n  such a character that it may fairly be presumed the legislature would have\r\n  passed it independent of that which conflicts with the constitution.\" Wilkins,\r\n  362 S.C. at 439, 608 S.E.2d at 584.Â  We take this opportunity to reconsider the\r\n  remedy for violations of the one subject rule. \r\nFirst,\r\n  we find that the notion that the Court may excise an \"offending provision\" is\r\n  inherently flawed since all provisions in an act which does not address one\r\n  subject are \"offending\" provisions.Â  In the instant case, sections 1 and 2\r\n  offend the one subject provision of our constitution equally as much as section\r\n  3.\r\nSecond,\r\n  in order to sever the \"unconstitutional portion\" of an act so as to bring it\r\n  into harmony with the one subject rule, this Court must ascertain which subject\r\n  is the \"proper\" subject, that is, the one actually intended by the General\r\n  Assembly.Â  In the instant case, while this Court may find that the three\r\n  provisions of the statute do not concern the same subject, current practice\r\n  would require the Court to decide whether the proper subject is, for example,\r\n  sales tax exemptions or fuel blending in order to determine which provision(s)\r\n  to sever.Â  To examine an act passed in package form, and to then choose which\r\n  portion to excise and which to keep would require the Court to usurp the\r\n  prerogative of the General Assembly and thus act as a super-legislature. \r\nWe\r\n  therefore hold that Act 338 is unconstitutional in its entirety, though we emphasize\r\n  that our holding shall not apply to acts passed prior to or contemporaneous\r\n  with the act considered in the instant case.Â  We again recognize that we are\r\n  departing from recent precedent, including S.C. Pub. Interest Found. v.\r\n    Harrell, 378 S.C. 441, 663 S.E.2d 52 (2008).Â  We are compelled to do so out\r\n  of respect for the proper functions of the legislature and of the judiciary. See Henderson v. Evans, 268 S.C. 127, 130, 232 S.E.2d 331, 333 (1977) (\"it\r\n  is not the province of this Court to perform legislative functions.\"); State\r\n    v.

Â Wilkinson\r\n    ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 371 S.C. 365, 638\r\n  S.E.2d 109 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We reverse, and hold the claimant was an\r\n  independent contractor for workers' compensation purposes.Â  In connection with\r\n  our jurisprudence in evaluating whether a claimant is an employee or an\r\n  independent contractor for workers' compensation purposes, we overrule the test\r\n  announced in Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703\r\n  (2000).[1]\r\nScott R. Wilkinson was a long-haul truck driver for Palmetto State\r\n  Transportation Company.Â  After a period of admitted employment, Wilkinson opted\r\n  to alter his relationship with Palmetto, and the parties entered into a formal independent\r\n  contractor arrangement.Â  The detailed contract was honored by Wilkinson and\r\n  Palmetto, including the provision giving Wilkinson sole authority over \"the\r\n  means and methods of the performance of all transportation services.\"Â  In\r\n  resolving this jurisdictional question, we view the evidence as clearly\r\n  preponderating in favor of an independent contractor relationship. Â \r\nI.\r\nPalmetto\r\n  is an interstate motor\r\n  carrier.Â  Wilkinson began as an employee for\r\n  Palmetto, as a long-haul truck driver, in January of 1998. Â About a year later,\r\n  Wilkinson and Palmetto agreed to alter their employment relationship to that of\r\n  an independent contractor.Â  To this end, Wilkinson purchased a tractor and the\r\n  parties executed an \"Equipment Lease Contract.\"Â  The contract sets forth in\r\n  detail the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties.Â  \r\nOf\r\n  particular relevance in determining the nature of the parties' relationship are\r\n  the following contract features.Â  Wilkinson and Palmetto intended \"to create\r\n  the relationship of CARRIER and INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR and not an\r\n  EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE relationship.\"Â  The parties negotiated an increased rate per\r\n  mile.Â  Wilkinson was solely responsible for all expenses associated with acquiring,\r\n  financing, maintaining and insuring the tractor.Â  Wilkinson assumed further\r\n  responsibility for \"the means\r\n  and methods of the performance of all transportation services,\" including, if\r\n  necessary, hiring and supervising other drivers for the leased tractor.Â  In\r\n  this regard, the obligation for withholding and employment taxes fell to\r\n  Wilkinson.Â  Wilkinson also agreed \"to carry Workers Compensation coverage in\r\n  the limits statutory [sic] within the State of South Carolina.\"Â  Wilkinson ultimately\r\n  complied with this contract provision by purchasing an\r\n  occupational accident policy from Zurich American Insurance Company, which\r\n  provided for a lump sum of $50,000 and monthly payments of $2,000 for 100\r\n  months, in the event of death.[2] Â Termination of the contract required thirty\r\n  days' notice, and a wrongful termination entitled the non-breaching party to\r\n  recover damages.\r\nWilkinson died on May 16, 2002, in a motor vehicle accident while\r\n  driving his tractor for Palmetto.Â  The Zurich policy was paid to Wilkinson's\r\n  spouse, Lea Ann.Â  Lea Ann also filed a workers' compensation claim, contending\r\n  that her husband was Palmetto's employee.Â  Palmetto, through its workers'\r\n  compensation insurance carrier, defended on the basis Wilkinson was an\r\n  independent contractor.Â  The workers' compensation commission, circuit court\r\n  and court of appeals found that Wilkinson was an employee, and therefore his\r\n  spouse was entitled to workers' compensation benefits.Â  The basis for this\r\n  finding of compensability comes from the employee/independent contractor test\r\n  announced in Dawkins v. Jordan, which we now overrule.\r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nWe\r\n  are presented with the question whether Wilkinson was, at the time of his fatal\r\n  accident, an employee or independent contractor.Â  Because the question is\r\n  jurisdictional, the Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence. S.C. Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc.,\r\n  318 S.C. 546, 547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  settled law, the determination of whether a claimant is an employee or\r\n  independent contractor focuses on the issue of control, specifically whether\r\n  the purported employer had the right to control the claimant in the performance\r\n  of his work.Â  Ray Covington Realtors, 318 S.C. at 547, 459 S.E.2d at\r\n  303; Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 32, 180 S.E.2d 648, 649 (1971).Â  In\r\n  evaluating the right of control, the Court examines four factors which serve as\r\n  a means of analyzing the work relationship as a whole:Â  (1) direct evidence of\r\n  the right or exercise of control; (2) furnishing of equipment; (3) method of\r\n  payment; (4) right to fire. Â Ray Covington Realtors, 318 S.C. at 548,\r\n  459 S.E.2d at 303; Chavis, 256 S.C. at 32, 180 S.E.2d at 649; Tharpe\r\n    v. G.E. Moore Co., Inc., 254 S.C. 196, 200, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970); see\r\n      also Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703\r\n  (2000).\r\nIn Dawkins,\r\n  this Court took the additional step of imposing a framework for weighing the\r\n  standard factors in a manner that favored, unduly we now believe, a finding of\r\n  employment:Â  \r\n\r\n  [F]or\r\n    the most part, any single factor is not merely indicative of, but, in practice,\r\n    virtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in the opposite direction,\r\n    contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best only mildly persuasive\r\n    evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no such force at all.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 439, 534 S.E.2d at 703 (quoting Arthur Larson\r\n  &amp; Lex K Larson, 3 Larson's\r\n  Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 61.04 (2000)).Â  We overrule Dawkins'\r\n  analytical framework, for it most assuredly skews the analysis to a finding of\r\n  employment.Â  We return to our jurisprudence that evaluates the four factors\r\n  with equal force in both directions.[3] Â See Ray Covington Realtors, 318 S.C. at 547-48, 459 S.E.2d at\r\n  303; Chavis, 256 S.C. at 32, 180 S.E.2d at 649; Tharpe, 254 S.C.\r\n  at 198-200, 174 S.E.2d at 398-99.\r\nB.\r\nWe are persuaded the four factors preponderate in\r\n  favor of a finding that Wilkinson was an independent contractor.Â  In evaluating\r\n  the four factors, we are guided initially by the parties' independent contractor\r\n  agreement.Â  But more importantly, we are guided by the parties' conduct, which\r\n  mirrored the terms of the contract. See Kilgore Group, Inc. v. S.C.\r\n    Employment Sec. Comm'n, 313 S.C. 65, 68-69, 437 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1993)\r\n  (noting that \"in determining the nature of [the parties'] relationship,\" the\r\n  contract \"has considerable weight,\" but recognizing that \"language in the\r\n  contract merely declaring the relationship is that of an employer/independent\r\n  contractor is not dispositive\"). \r\nThis\r\n  Court remains sensitive to the general principle sanctioned by the Legislature\r\n  that workers' compensation laws are to be construed liberally in favor of\r\n  coverage.Â  That principle, however, does not go so far as to justify an\r\n  analytical framework that preordains the result.Â  Moreover, that principle\r\n  should not trump an unchallenged independent contractor arrangement where the\r\n  parties' conduct follows the agreement in every material respect.Â  Materiality,\r\n  in this context, is measured by the factors of right or exercise of control, method\r\n  of payment, furnishing of equipment and right to fire.Â  The policy\r\n  considerations favoring a finding of compensability are further diminished\r\n  where, as here, the independent contractor procures workers' compensation\r\n  coverage or its functional equivalent.\r\n1.Â  Direct\r\n  Evidence of the Right or Exercise of Control\r\nIt\r\n  is not uncommon in the long-haul trucking industry for carriers to utilize\r\n  drivers who own and operate their own tractors, known as owner-operators.Â \r\n  These arrangements must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that the actual\r\n  relationship between the trucking company and the purported independent\r\n  contractor truly reflects the parties' stated agreement.Â  We are sensitive to\r\n  the unequal bargaining power that may exist between the trucking company and\r\n  the driver.Â  In this regard, it naturally follows that a trucking company, with\r\n  a desire to avoid a workers' compensation claim, may be tempted to have \"its\r\n  cake and eat it, too.\"Â  The result would be an ostensible independent\r\n  contractor arrangement where the trucking company exercises almost complete\r\n  control over the method and manner of the transportation services.\r\nCognizant\r\n  of these concerns, we have reviewed the actual relationship between Wilkinson\r\n  and Palmetto.Â  Palmetto utilizes approximately eighty drivers in its business,\r\n  the vast majority of whom are employees.Â  Wilkinson started as an employee, but\r\n  desired to drive his own tractor and become an owner-operator.Â  He did so, as\r\n  reflected in the parties' contract.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the contract provided that Wilkinson \"shall determine the means\r\n  and methods of the performance of all transportation services.\"Â  We find that, true\r\n  to the contract, Wilkinson exercised the right of control as to the\r\n  transportation services.Â  The fact that Palmetto contacted Wilkinson for\r\n  potential assignments and provided the pickup location does not change the\r\n  result.Â  Wilkinson retained the right to refuse any assignment.Â  If Wilkinson\r\n  agreed to an assignment and made the pickup, he exercised complete control over\r\n  the delivery and chose his travel routes without direction from Palmetto.Â  The\r\n  nature of the relationship between Wilkinson and Palmetto is incompatible with that\r\n  of an employee-employer.Â  Concerning the right and exercise of control, this\r\n  factor favors a finding of an independent contractor relationship.\r\nBefore\r\n  moving to the next factor, we address two matters which at first glance appear\r\n  to evidence Palmetto's right of control.Â  First is the presence of a global\r\n  positioning satellite (GPS) system in each tractor.Â  The record establishes,\r\n  however, that GPS monitoring was for the benefit of Palmetto customers tracking\r\n  shipment of goods, not Palmetto's exercise of control over drivers.Â  Second is\r\n  the presence of governmental regulatory controls affecting the transportation\r\n  of goods in interstate commerce. The parties' contract required Wilkinson to\r\n  operate \"the equipment in accordance with all applicable regulations.\"Â  We\r\n  agree with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that requiring a worker to comply\r\n  with the law is not evidence of control by the putative employer.\r\n\r\n  [R]estrictions\r\n    upon a workers' [sic] manner and means of performance that spring from\r\n    government regulation (rather than company initiatives) do not necessarily\r\n    support a conclusion of employment status.Â  Indeed, employer efforts to ensure\r\n    the workers' compliance with government regulations, even when those efforts\r\n    restrict the manner and means of performance, do not weigh in favor of employee\r\n    status.Â  \"The employer cannot evade the law . . . and in requiring compliance\r\n    with the law he is not controlling the driver.Â  It is the law that controls the\r\n    driver.\"\r\n\r\nUniversal Am-Can, Ltd. v.\r\n  Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd., 762 A.2d\r\n  328, 335 (Pa. 2000) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree that the strong regulatory presence concerning motor carriers reflects\r\n  control by the government, not the motor carrier. [4]Â  \r\n2.Â  Furnishing of\r\n  Equipment\r\nWilkinson relies on\r\n  the presence of Palmetto's insignia on the outside of the tractor, together\r\n  with the display of Palmetto's\r\n  Department of Transportation motor carrier number, as proof of an employment relationship.Â  Even if Wilkinson's\r\n  reliance on the Palmetto insignia and motor carrier identification number were a\r\n  factor in his favor, it would be far from dispositive. Â Universal Am-Can,\r\n  762 A.2d at 332 (noting that \"[t]he presence of a carrier's insignia on the\r\n  outside of a rig is merely one of the many factors to be considered when\r\n  determining employee/independent contractor status and does not command a\r\n  conclusion of employee status\").Â  The placement of a motor carrier's insignia and identification\r\n  number on the tractor is required by federal regulations.Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 376.11(c)(1) (2008); 49 C.F.R. Â§ 390.21\r\n  (2008). Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  do not give controlling weight to the presence of Palmetto's insignia and\r\n  identification number on Wilkinson's tractor.Â  Again, we view the presence of\r\n  Palmetto's insignia and identification number on the tractor as governmental\r\n  control, not carrier control.Â  On balance, we find the factor of \"furnishing of\r\n  equipment\" points to an independent contractor relationship.Â  We make this\r\n  finding primarily because Wilkinson owned his own tractor and paid for all\r\n  costs associated with the tractor.[5]Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\n3.Â  Method of Payment\r\nWilkinson was paid\r\n  per mile, with an increase in the rate when he transitioned from an employee to\r\n  an independent contractor.Â  The method of payment was entirely consistent with\r\n  Wilkinson's independent contractor status.Â  Palmetto furnished \"1099\" forms to\r\n  Wilkinson, who in turn filed tax returns as a sole proprietor, specifically an\r\n  \"over the road trucke[r].\"Â  Wilkinson's tax returns include forms for his\r\n  business expenses and self-employment taxes.Â  The method of payment bears no\r\n  indicia of an employment relationship.\r\n4.Â  Right to Fire\r\nThis factor is the\r\n  most difficult to evaluate for two reasons.Â  One, unlike the other three\r\n  factors, Wilkinson and Palmetto never had a need to confront this issue.Â  Next\r\n  is the recognition that a right of termination, in some form, exists in an\r\n  independent contractor arrangement.Â  The critical inquiry is the term \"fire,\"\r\n  for it embraces the employment relationship.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  are left with only the contract terms, and each party makes a strong argument.Â \r\n  Wilkinson contends that the testimony of Palmetto's representative reflects a\r\n  belief that Wilkinson could essentially be fired at will.Â  Palmetto presented a\r\n  host of reasons it believed it could terminate its relationship with\r\n  Wilkinson.Â  Those reasons (which never materialized) included a \"consistent\"\r\n  refusal to haul loads and perceived poor work performance.\r\nPalmetto\r\n  counters that the \"right to fire\" does not exist under the parties' contract.Â \r\n  According to Palmetto, the contract defined the terms under which the parties\r\n  could terminate the relationship.Â  Under the contract, either party could\r\n  terminate the contract upon thirty days' notice.Â  The agreement further\r\n  provided that, Â \"[i]n the event either party commits a material breach of any\r\n  term of this Agreement; . . . the other party shall have the right to terminate\r\n  this Agreement immediately and hold the party committing the breach liable for\r\n  damages.\"Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find Palmetto did not have a \"right to fire\" Wilkinson.Â  The termination of the\r\n  parties' relationship was controlled by their agreement.Â  The termination\r\n  provisions, when viewed in the context of the agreement as a whole, leads to a\r\n  finding of an independent contractor arrangement.\r\nC.\r\nWe\r\n  believe it helpful to address a related area of law, specifically the existence\r\n  of federal law in the trucking industry. Although the parties raise no issue\r\n  concerning the federal law, an overview of certain federal regulations serves\r\n  to support our ultimate determination as well as inform the narrow reach of our\r\n  decision.\r\nCongress\r\n  provides in 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 14102(a) (West 2007) that the \"Secretary [of\r\n  Transportation] may require a motor carrier . . . that uses motor vehicles not\r\n  owned by it . . . toâ€”(4) have control of and be responsible for operating those\r\n  motor vehicles in compliance with requirements prescribed by the Secretary on\r\n  safety of operations and equipment, and with other applicable law as if the\r\n  motor vehicles were owned by the motor carrier.\"Â  The Secretary of\r\n  Transportation, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, has\r\n  promulgated regulations addressing a carrier's lease of equipment from an\r\n  owner-operator.\r\nFor\r\n  example, 49 C.F.R. Â§ 376.12(c)(1) (2008) states that the \"lease [of equipment\r\n  by the carrier] shall provide that the authorized carrier lessee shall have\r\n  exclusive possession, control, and use of the equipment for the duration of the\r\n  lease.Â  The lease shall further provide that the authorized carrier lessee\r\n  shall assume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment for the\r\n  duration of the lease.\"[6]Â \r\n  This regulation, and others, reflects the regulatory goal of promoting highway\r\n  safety.Â  Indiana Refrigerator Lines, Inc. v. Dalton, 516 F.2d 795, 796\r\n  (6th Cir. 1975) (discussing the federal regulatory goal of promoting highway\r\n  safety in general, specifically including preventing carriers from avoiding\r\n  safety standards by the practice of leasing equipment from non-regulated\r\n  carriers).\r\nAs a\r\n  result of a motor carrier's general duty for the safe operation of leased\r\n  equipment, our finding today of an independent contractor relationship between\r\n  Wilkinson and Palmetto is necessarily limited to the workers' compensation\r\n  context.Â  Moreover, federal law is not intended to affect a state court's\r\n  determination of the relationship between a carrier and a lessor of equipment\r\n  under workers' compensation laws. 49 C.F.R. Â§ 376.12(c)(4) (2008) (providing\r\n  that imposing ultimate responsibility on a carrier under federal law is not\r\n  \"intended to affect whether the lessor or driver provided by the lessor is an\r\n  independent contractor or an employee of the authorized carrier lessee\").Â  We\r\n  find the comment to subsection (c)(4) of the federal regulation instructive:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  While most courts have correctly interpreted the\r\n    appropriate scope of the control regulation and have held that the type of\r\n    control required by the regulation does not affect \"employment\" status, it has\r\n    been shown here that some courts and State workers' compensation and employment\r\n    agencies have relied on our current control regulation and have held the\r\n    language to be prima facie evidence of an employer-employee relationship. . . .\r\n  We conclude that adopting the proposed amendment will\r\n    reinforce our view of the neutral effect of the control regulation and place\r\n    our stated view squarely before any court or agency asked to interpret the\r\n    regulation's impact. . . .Â  By presenting a clear statement of the neutrality\r\n    of the regulation, we hope to bring a halt to erroneous assertions about the\r\n    effect and intent of the control regulation, saving both the factfinders and\r\n    the carriers time and expense. \r\n\r\nPetition to\r\nAmend Lease and Interchange of Vehicle Regulations, 8 I.C.C.2d 669, 671 (1992).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  federal regulations may, therefore, not be viewed as controlling when a state\r\n  court is charged with assessing whether the relationship between a motor\r\n  carrier and a lessor of equipment is one of employment or independent\r\n  contractor for workers' compensation purposes.Â  In the workers' compensation\r\n  setting, we properly make the determination under our common law framework.\r\nIII.\r\nWe reverse\r\n  the court of appeals and find Wilkinson was an independent contractor for\r\n  purposes of workers' compensation.Â  As such, his estate is not entitled to\r\n  benefits.Â  We overrule the approach approved in Dawkins v. Jordan, 341\r\n  S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703 (2000) that the presence of \"any single\r\n  factor is not merely indicative of, but, in practice, virtually proof of, the\r\n  employment relation.\"Â  Consistent with pre-Dawkins' case law, the common\r\n  law factorsâ€”right or exercise of control, method of payment, furnishing of\r\n  equipment and right to fireâ€”should be evaluated in an evenhanded manner in\r\n  determining whether the questioned relationship is one of employment or\r\n  independent contractor.Â  We emphasize the narrow reach of our decision today,\r\n  as we analyze the employment versus independent contractor question for\r\n  purposes of workers' compensation only.Â  Having found that Wilkinson was an\r\n  independent contractor for workers' compensation purposes, we need not reach\r\n  the remaining issues.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (recognizing that an appellate\r\n  court need not address remaining issues when resolution of one issue is\r\n  dispositive).&nbsp; \r\nREVERSED.Â Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In fairness to the court of appeals, the circuit court and workers'\r\ncompensation commission, we are in essence reversing ourselves. \r\n[2] This appeal raises no issue with respect to the amount of insurance\r\ncoverage and the limits available under our workers' compensation laws.\r\n[3] We overrule post-Dawkins appellate court decisions of this state\r\n  to the extent those decisions relied on Dawkins' claimant-friendly\r\n  approach.Â  Those cases include Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589,\r\n  564 S.E.2d 110 (2002) and Paschal v. Price, 380 S.C. 419, 670 S.E.2d 374\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We take no position with respect to the proper result in such\r\ncases under the pre-Dawkins' evenhanded and balanced approach.Â Â  \r\n[4] The federal regulatory scheme is discussed in more detail below.\r\n[5] Wilkinson assumed responsibility for all costs, including fuel, oil,\r\n  repairs, insurance, road taxes, fuel taxes, mileage taxes, and any weight\r\n  violations, with the caveat that he would be reimbursed for weight violations\r\nif he picked up a sealed trailer.Â  \r\n[6] As noted, we are presented with no issue concerning the effect of\r\n  federal law on the contract between Wilkinson and Palmetto.Â  Although the\r\n  contract assigns to Wilkinson the responsibility of \"maintaining the equipment\"\r\n  and \"operating the equipment in accordance with all applicable regulations,\"\r\n  the agreement also states that Palmetto's \"business of providing motor carrier\r\n  transportation services to the public is subject to regulation by the Federal\r\n  Government acting through the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Department\r\n  of Transportation, and by various state and local governments.\"Â  The contract\r\n  provides in the ensuing section that Wilkinson's responsibilities are \"subject\r\n  in each case only to any regulatory requirements which may be placed on\r\n[Palmetto] by various governmental agencies.\" \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26647","title":"Jones v.

Pachak, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  In this post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR) case, this Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s grant of a belated direct appeal to Virgil\r\n  Jones (Respondent) for his plea of guilty to murder, financial transaction card\r\n  theft, and two counts of financial transaction card fraud.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  November 19, 1993, Respondent pled guilty to murder, financial transaction card\r\n  theft, and two counts of financial transaction card fraud.Â  The plea judge\r\n  sentenced Respondent to life imprisonment for murder, three years imprisonment\r\n  for financial transaction card theft, and one year imprisonment for each count\r\n  of financial transaction card fraud.Â  Respondent did not appeal his guilty plea\r\n  or sentences.Â  \r\nOn October 8, 1996,\r\n  Respondent filed a PCR application in which he alleged:Â  (1) his guilty plea\r\n  was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made; and 2) his plea counsel\r\n  was ineffective in that counsel â€œmisadvisedâ€ him to plead guilty.Â  The State\r\n  moved to dismiss the PCR application on the ground it was barred by the\r\n  one-year statute of limitations as provided by the Uniform Post-Conviction\r\n  Procedure Act.[1] Â By order dated September 15, 1997, the PCR judge dismissed Respondentâ€™s\r\n  application. Â Respondent did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review this dismissal.\r\nOn July 9, 2003,\r\n  Respondent filed a second PCR application in which he alleged: Â (1) he did not\r\n  knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, (2) the\r\n  existence of newly-discovered evidence, and (3) the plea court lacked subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction for the murder charge.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State filed a Return and moved to dismiss the PCR application on the following\r\n  grounds:Â  (1) the application was barred by the statute of limitations, (2) the\r\n  application was barred by the doctrine of laches, (3) the claim of\r\n  newly-discovered evidence was not cognizable in a PCR application, and (4) the\r\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction allegation was without merit. \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge held a hearing on the Stateâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  By order dated\r\n  November 28, 2005, the judge dismissed all of Respondentâ€™s claims as barred by\r\n  the statute of limitations with the exception of his claim that he did not\r\n  knowingly waive his right to a direct appeal.Â  The judge ordered a merits\r\n  hearing on Respondentâ€™s remaining claim.\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  the State filed an amended Return and a motion to dismiss Respondentâ€™s\r\n  remaining PCR allegation on the grounds the PCR application was barred as\r\n  successive and by the doctrine of res judicata. \r\nAt\r\n  the merits hearing, Respondent testified that at the time of his plea, counsel\r\n  did not inform him of his right to appeal his guilty plea.Â  Respondent claimed\r\n  he became aware of this right after he was incarcerated for the offenses to\r\n  which he pled guilty.Â  Respondent stated he would have requested an appeal had\r\n  he been informed of this right at the time he pled guilty.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Respondent acknowledged he never asked for a direct appeal\r\n  until the PCR proceedings. \r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  plea counsel testified he tells â€œall of [his] clients that they have a right to\r\n  an appeal, if the judge does not follow the [sentencing] recommendation.â€Â  He\r\n  claimed Respondent knew he had ten days after the plea to appeal if the judge\r\n  did not accept the recommendation.Â  Had Respondent requested an appeal, counsel\r\n  stated he would have filed one.\r\nBecause\r\n  the plea judge followed the solicitorâ€™s sentencing recommendation with regard\r\n  to Respondentâ€™s guilty plea, counsel believed there was no reason to appeal the\r\n  negotiated plea. Â Therefore, plea counsel testified he would not have advised\r\n  Respondent about an appeal given that â€œadvice would have already taken place.â€Â \r\n  Additionally, counsel stated he knew he did not advise Respondent after the\r\n  plea proceeding regarding his right to appeal because he did not speak with the\r\n  Respondent after the plea.\r\nBy\r\n  order filed on September 15, 2006, the PCR judge granted Respondent a belated\r\n  direct appeal pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35\r\n  (1974). Â The judge directed Respondent to â€œDavis v. State, 288 S.C. 290,\r\n  342 S.E.2d 60 (1986) for the procedure to follow in light of the Courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling.â€ \r\nOn\r\n  September 22, 2006, the State sent its motion for reconsideration to the\r\n  Richland County Clerk of Court.Â  The State, however, did not serve the circuit\r\n  court judge with the motion until March 14, 2007.Â  The PCR judge dismissed the\r\n  Stateâ€™s motion for reconsideration on the ground the State failed to comply\r\n  with the ten-day service requirement of Rule 59(g)[2] of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making\r\n  all significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318,\r\n  331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she\r\n  is entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  â€œIn the context of a guilty plea, the court must determine\r\n  whether 1) counselâ€™s advice was within the range of competence demanded of\r\n  attorneys in criminal cases- i.e. was counselâ€™s performance deficient, and 2)\r\n  if there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the\r\n  defendant would not have pled guilty.â€ Â Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135,\r\n  138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006) (citing Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-58 (1985)).Â  \r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  In reviewing the PCR judgeâ€™s decision, an appellate court is concerned\r\n  only with whether any evidence of probative value exists to support that\r\n  decision.&nbsp; Smith, 369 S.C. at 138, 631 S.E.2d at 261.Â  This Court\r\n  will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of\r\n  probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR judge\r\n  when it is controlled by an error&nbsp;of law.&nbsp; Suber v. State, 371\r\n  S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  State contends the PCR judge erred in granting Respondent a belated direct\r\n  appeal.[3]Â \r\n  In support of this contention, the State avers:Â  (1) Respondent did not\r\n  reasonably demonstrate to plea counsel his desire to appeal, and (2) no\r\n  rational defendant would have sought an appeal given the plea judgeâ€™s sentence\r\n  did not deviate from the recommended sentence submitted by the solicitor in\r\n  exchange for Respondentâ€™s plea of guilty to murder.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œ[C]ounsel has a\r\n  constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal\r\n  when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want\r\n  to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or\r\n  (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was\r\n  interested in appealing.â€Â  Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 480 (2000).Â  \r\nâ€œEven\r\n  in cases when the defendant pleads guilty, the court must consider such factors\r\n  as whether the defendant received the sentence bargained for as part of the\r\n  plea and whether the plea expressly reserved or waived some or all appeal\r\n  rights.â€Â  Id.Â  Absent extraordinary circumstances, there is no\r\n  constitutional requirement that a defendant be informed of the right to a\r\n  direct appeal from a guilty plea.Â  Turner v. State, 380 S.C. 223, 224,\r\n  670 S.E.2d 373, 374 (2008).Â  â€œOne extraordinary circumstance which would\r\n  require counsel to advise a defendant of the right to appeal from a guilty plea\r\n  would arise when the defendant inquires about an appeal.â€Â  Weathers v. State,\r\n  319 S.C. 59, 61, 459 S.E.2d 838, 839 (1995).Â  However, â€œ[t]he bare assertion\r\n  that a defendant was not advised of appellate rights is insufficient to grant\r\n  relief.â€Â  Id. Â â€œInstead, there must be proof that extraordinary\r\n  circumstances exist such that the defendant should have been advised of the\r\n  right to appeal.â€ Â Id.\r\nFor\r\n  several reasons, we conclude the circuit court erred in finding that Respondent\r\n  was entitled to a belated direct appeal on the ground that Respondent did not\r\n  knowingly and intelligently waive his right to appeal from his plea.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  plea counsel testified and Respondent did not dispute that the plea judge\r\n  accepted the sentencing recommendation for Respondentâ€™s plea of guilty.Â \r\n  Respondent also failed to offer evidence that there were any meritorious or\r\n  viable issues for appeal.Â  Therefore, Respondent failed to establish the first\r\n  prong of Roe in that there is no evidence that a rational defendant\r\n  would have wanted to appeal from the guilty plea and sentence.\r\nSecondly,\r\n  Respondent specifically acknowledged at the PCR hearing that he did not ask\r\n  plea counsel to file a direct appeal.Â  Plea counsel confirmed that Respondent\r\n  never made this request despite informing Respondent prior to the plea of his\r\n  appellate rights.Â  Thus, other than Respondentâ€™s bare assertion that he was not\r\n  advised of his appellate rights, Respondent offered no evidence which\r\n  reasonably demonstrated an interest in appealing.Â  Without this evidence,\r\n  Respondent failed to satisfy the second prong of Roe.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nBecause\r\n  Respondent did not produce evidence of extraordinary circumstances which would\r\n  have required plea counsel to advise him of the right to a direct appeal, we\r\n  hold the PCR judge erred in finding Respondent was entitled to a belated\r\n  appellate review of his guilty plea.Â  See Turner, 380 S.C. at 225,\r\n  670 S.E.2d at 374 (reversing order of PCR judge which found the petitioner\r\n  entitled to a belated appellate review of his guilty plea where â€œpetitioner did\r\n  not allege he asked counsel to file a direct appeal, he had viable issues for\r\n  appeal, or there were other extraordinary circumstances which would require him\r\n  to be advised of his right to a direct appeal from his guilty pleaâ€).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s order.\r\nIn light of our\r\n  conclusion, we decline to address the Stateâ€™s remaining argument that the PCR\r\n  judge erred in not dismissing Respondentâ€™s second PCR application as successive.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (recognizing an appellate court need not address additional issues if the resolution of another\r\n  issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Respondent\r\n  failed to establish that extraordinary circumstances existed which required\r\n  that his plea counsel advise him of his right to a direct appeal of his guilty\r\n  plea, we hold the PCR judge erred in granting Respondent a belated direct\r\n  appeal.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that the post-conviction relief (PCR) order\r\n  should be reversed, but write separately because I believe the case should be\r\n  decided solely on the successive claim made by the State rather than on the\r\n  claim of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  Cf., Morris\r\n    v. Anderson County, 356 S.C. 459, 564 S.E.2d 649 (2002)(Court has well\r\n  established policy of declining to rule on constitutional claims where they are\r\n  unnecessary to the result).Â  Here, respondent did not raise the claim that his\r\n  plea counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to advise him of his\r\n  right to a direct appeal until his second PCR application.Â  The State argues,\r\n  persuasively in my view, that this claim was barred as successive. Graham v.\r\n    State, 378 S.C. 1, 661 S.E.2d 337 (2008).Â  I would reverse in a memorandum\r\n  opinion citing Graham. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45 (2003). \r\n[2]Â  Rule 59(g) provides, â€œA party filing a written motion under this rule shall provide a copy of\r\n  the motion to the judge within ten (10) days after the filing of the motion.â€Â \r\n  Rule 59(g), SCRCP.\r\n[3]Â \r\n  We note that Respondent did not file for review as required by the Appellate\r\n  Court Rules.Â  Thus, there is no belated direct appeal issue before the Court.Â  See Bennett v.

Â Specifically, we must determine legislative intent\r\n  concerning the â€œattorney at lawâ€ exemption in section 37-7-101(2)(b)(i).Â  We\r\n  hold that the South Carolina General Assembly intended to limit the â€œattorneys\r\n  at lawâ€ exemption to attorneys authorized to practice law in this State when\r\n  the attorney is â€œacting in the regular courseâ€ of his or her profession as an\r\n  attorney.Â  We reverse the contrary holding of the administrative law court.\r\nI.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Consumer Credit Counseling Act (Act) was enacted by the General\r\n  Assembly in 2005.Â  The Actâ€™s purpose was to bring regulation and supervision to\r\n  the world of credit counseling in South Carolina.Â  Under the Act a person may\r\n  not engage in credit counseling in South Carolina unless properly licensed.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-102 (Supp. 2008).Â  This enactment was part of a national\r\n  trend among states to protect their citizens from deceptive conduct by unscrupulous\r\n  credit counseling organizations preying on individuals unfamiliar with credit\r\n  repair.Â  Mary Spector, Taming the Beast: Payday\r\n    Loans, Regulatory Efforts, and Unintended Consequences, 57 DePaul L. Rev. 961, 985 n.174 (Summer\r\n  2008).\r\nAn\r\n  integral feature of the Act is the need for licensure of those who engage in\r\n  credit counseling.Â  The Act further defines credit counseling organizations but\r\n  excludes certain professions and businesses, thus exempting them from licensure\r\n  requirements.Â  Specifically, the Act provides:\r\n\r\n\t(2) â€œCredit\r\n  counseling organizationâ€ means a person providing or offering to provide to\r\n  consumers credit counseling services for a fee, compensation, or gain, or in\r\n  the expectation of a fee, compensation, or gain, including debt management\r\n  plans.\r\n\t(a) The business of credit counseling is\r\n  conducted in this State if the credit counseling organization, its employees,\r\n  or its agents are located in this State or if the credit counseling\r\n  organization solicits or contracts with debtors located within this State.\r\n\t(b) This term does\r\n  not include the following when acting in the regular course of their\r\n    respective businesses and professions:\r\n\t(i) attorneys at law;\r\n\t(ii) banks, fiduciaries, credit unions,\r\n  savings and loan associations, and savings banks as duly authorized and\r\n  admitted to transact business in the State of South Carolina;\r\n\t(iii) a certified public accountant\r\n  providing credit counseling advice pursuant to an accounting practice;\r\n\t(iv) title insurers and abstract companies\r\n  doing escrow business;\r\n\t(v) judicial officers or others acting\r\n  pursuant to court order;\r\n\t(vi) nonprofit faith-based organizations;\r\n\t(vii) counselors certified by the South\r\n  Carolina Housing Authority to the extent engaged in counseling pursuant to\r\n  Chapter 23, High-Cost and Consumer Home Loans. These counselors must be\r\n  certified by the Housing Authority pursuant to Section\r\n    37-23-40;\r\n\t(viii) mortgage brokers, real estate\r\n  brokers, salesmen, and property managers licensed pursuant to Title 40; and\r\n\t(ix) consumer reporting agencies as\r\n  defined by 15 U.S.C.\r\n    Section 1681(a) (f) and any person or\r\n  agency, or any affiliate or subsidiary of a consumer reporting agency, that\r\n  obtains consumer reports from the agency under a certification pursuant to 15 U.S.C.\r\n    Section 1681(e)(a) for the purpose of\r\n  reselling the report, or information contained in or derived from the report,\r\n  to a consumer, or monitoring information in the report on behalf of a consumer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  37-7-101(2) (Supp. 2008).\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature delegated to the Department of Consumer Affairs (Department)\r\n  responsibility for administering the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-106 (Supp.\r\n  2008).\r\nThe Department\r\n  learned that a law firm based in Utah was providing credit counseling services\r\n  to South Carolina citizens. Â The Department advised the Utah law firm of the\r\n  Act and the need for credit counseling organizations to obtain licensure.Â  The\r\n  Utah law firm, styling itself as Lexington Law Firm, responded to the\r\n  Department: â€œ[f]or purposes of this letter only, Lexington [Law Firm] agrees\r\n  that it is a credit counseling organization and provides consumer credit\r\n  counseling as that term is defined at [section 37-7-101] (3)(b).â€Â  However, the\r\n  Utah law firm asserted the attorney at law exemption in section\r\n  37-7-101(2)(b)(i).\r\nBefore\r\n  the Department could take action, Lexington Law Firm filed the underlying declaratory\r\n  judgment action in the administrative law court (ALC) seeking a declaration\r\n  that the Department lacks authority to issue exemptions, and moreover, a\r\n  declaration that the law firm is entitled to the Actâ€™s attorney at law\r\n  exemption.\r\nThe\r\n  Department sought discovery from Lexington Law Firm in the ALC, including\r\n  names, addresses, and bar admittances of Lexington Law Firmâ€™s attorneys.Â \r\n  Lexington Law Firm objected stating:\r\n\r\n\tObjection.Â \r\n  [Lexington Law Firm] objects to this Request on the grounds that it does not\r\n  comply with the scope of Rule 34, SCRCP, in that it does not request any\r\n  â€œdesignated documentsâ€ or â€œtangible things.â€Â  In addition, this Request is not\r\n  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.Â \r\n  Further, this Request seeks information which is not relevant to this action,\r\n  and the Request is intended to harass [Lexington Law Firm].\r\n\r\nThe Department\r\n  narrowed its request in a motion to compel production stating:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Department will revise the question to ask for state certificates, licenses or\r\n  registrations pertaining to the states in which attorneys who service/have\r\n  serviced South Carolina consumers are admitted to practice law.Â  This item is\r\n  relevant as the Petition states [Lexington Law Firm] engages in the practice of\r\n  law.\r\n\r\nLexington Law Firm echoed its\r\n  earlier response stating the request was â€œnot relevant.â€\r\nIt is apparent from\r\n  the ALCâ€™s grant of summary judgment for Lexington Law Firm that the trial court\r\n  believed the nature of the law firmâ€™s legal/credit counseling practice was\r\n  irrelevant, for its nominal status as â€œattorneys at lawâ€ automatically entitled\r\n  the law firm to avail itself of the attorney exemption.Â  The ALC rejected the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s contention that the statutory exemptions are conditioned on section\r\n  37-7-101â€™s limiting language, â€œwhen [the party seeking the exemption is] acting\r\n  in the regular course of their respective businesses and professions.â€Â  The ALC\r\n  ruled:\r\n\r\n\tDepartment\r\n  does not have authority to grant or deny exemptions under the South Carolina\r\n  Consumer Credit Counseling Act . . . and because the [L]egislature has already\r\n  provided an exemption to attorneys at law under the Act, Lexington Law [Firm]\r\n  is exempt from application of the Act and not subject to regulation by the\r\n  Department . . . .\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Departmentâ€™s appeal is before us pursuant to Rule 204(b) certification, SCACR.\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  Department contends it has the authority, in the first instance, to determine\r\n  if a credit counseling organization is exempt from the Actâ€™s licensing\r\n  requirements.Â  The Department additionally asserts that Lexington Law Firm is\r\n  not entitled to the attorney at law exemption under the Act.Â  We agree with the\r\n  Department on both counts.\r\nA.\r\nThe Departmentâ€™s Authority\r\nThe\r\n  Department has authority over licensing under the Act, and that authority\r\n  encompasses the initial determination, subject to judicial review, of whether a\r\n  credit counseling organization satisfies a statutory exemption.[1]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-106 (Supp. 2008).\r\nSection\r\n  37-7-106 empowers the Department to â€œrefuse to license an applicant or suspend\r\n  or revoke a license or refuse to renew a license issued pursuant to this\r\n  chapter if it finds, after notice and a hearing pursuant to the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act,â€ the applicant was convicted of a felony or fraud; violated a\r\n  provision of the Act; used fraud to obtain a license; participated in continuous\r\n  unfair conduct; went bankrupt; or violated a reasonable rule or regulation made\r\n  by the Department.Â  Additionally, as Lexington Law Firm conceded at oral\r\n  argument, the statute provides a two-step test to determine if a business is\r\n  exempt.Â  First, the business must qualify as one of the exempt categories and\r\n  second, the organization must be acting in the regular course of its business.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-101(2)(b).\r\nTherefore,\r\n  as the Department is charged by the Legislature with issuing licenses and is in\r\n  the best position to implement the statutory test, we hold the Department is\r\n  authorized to determine if a party is exempt from obtaining a license.Â  See\r\n    City of Rock Hill v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 302 S.C. 161,\r\n  165, 394 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1990) (â€œAs creatures of statute, regulatory bodies .\r\n  . . possess only those powers which are specifically delineated.Â  By necessity\r\n  however, a regulatory body possesses not only the powers expressly conferred on\r\n  it but also those which must be inferred or implied to effectively carry out\r\n  the duties for which it is charged.â€) (citing City of Columbia v. Bd. of\r\n    Health and Envtl. Control, 292 S.C. 199, 202, 355 S.E.2d 536, 538 (1987)).Â \r\n  Furthermore, this Court should defer to the Departmentâ€™s findings where there\r\n  is no compelling reason to reject it.Â  Faile v. S.C. Employment Sec. Commâ€™n,\r\n  267 S.C. 536, 540, 230 S.E.2d 219, 221-22 (1976) (â€œThe construction of a\r\n  statute by the agency charged with executing it is entitled to the most\r\n  respectful consideration and should not be overruled without cogent reasons.â€).\r\nB.\r\nThe Attorney at Law\r\n  Exemption\r\nLexington\r\n  Law Firm, as a matter of law, is not entitled to the â€œattorneys at lawâ€\r\n  exemption.Â  As previously discussed, section 37-7-101(2) provides:\r\n\r\n\t(2)\r\n  â€œCredit counseling organizationâ€ means a person providing or offering to\r\n  provide to consumers credit counseling services for a fee, compensation, or\r\n  gain, or in the expectation of a fee, compensation, or gain, including debt\r\n  management plans.\r\n\t(a)\r\n  The business of credit counseling is conducted in this State if the credit\r\n  counseling organization, its employees, or its agents are located in this State\r\n  or if the credit counseling organization solicits or contracts with debtors\r\n  located within this State.\r\n\t(b)\r\n  This term does not include the following when acting in the regular course\r\n    of their respective businesses and professions:\r\n\t(i) attorneys\r\n  at law;\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nNone of the\r\n  attorneys in Lexington Law Firm is authorized to practice law in South Carolina. The position of Lexington Law Firm is manifestly without merit.Â  To accept\r\n  Lexington Law Firmâ€™s view of the statute, we must accept the premise that the\r\n  Legislature has sanctioned the unauthorized practice of law.Â  The Legislature\r\n  has done no such thing.\r\nâ€œThere\r\n  is a presumption that the [L]egislature has knowledge of previous legislation\r\n  as well as of judicial decisions construing that legislation when later\r\n  statutes are enacted concerning related subjects.â€Â  State v. McKnight,\r\n  352 S.C. 635, 648, 576 S.E.2d 168, 175 (2003).Â  Thus, when enacting the Act,\r\n  the General Assembly knew of South Carolinaâ€™s laws and policies addressing the\r\n  unauthorized practice of law, including section 40-5-310 of the South Carolina Code (2001) which makes it a crime to engage in the unauthorized\r\n  practice of law.Â  We therefore hold the General Assembly would not create an\r\n  exemption condoning the unauthorized practice of law.[2]\r\nMoreover,\r\n  section 37-7-101(2)(b)â€™s conditional â€œregular course of . . . businessâ€\r\n  language is unambiguous.Â  The language indicates a clear legislative intent to limit\r\n  the exemption to a listed business (or profession) when the credit counseling\r\n  service is part of the regular course of that business.Â  If a statutorily\r\n  enumerated business provides credit counseling services not in the regular\r\n  course of its business, the exemption is unavailable.Â  McClanahan v.\r\n    Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002) (â€œAll\r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative\r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used,\r\n  and that language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the\r\n  statute.â€) (citation omitted); First Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of\r\n    Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229, 417 S.E.2d 592, 593 (1992) (â€œIn construing a\r\n  statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s\r\n  operation.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nFurther,\r\n  the statuteâ€™s plain language indicates the Legislature intended to exempt professions\r\n  and businesses that are otherwise regulated.Â  Other exemptions located in this\r\n  section are of other professions and businesses subject to other licenses (such\r\n  as certified public accountants, counselors certified by the South Carolina\r\n  Housing Authority, and real estate brokers licensed pursuant to Title 40) as\r\n  well as non-profit, faith-based organizations and judicial officers.Â \r\n  Therefore, the Legislature expressed its intent to exempt businesses otherwise\r\n  licensed in South Carolina and non-profit organizations.\r\nLexington Law Firmâ€™s\r\n  final argument is that the providing of credit counseling services does not\r\n  constitute the practice of law, and as such, its actions cannot constitute the\r\n  unauthorized practice of law.Â  The untenable dichotomy Lexington Law Firm\r\n  advances is they fall under the attorney exemption but do not commit the\r\n  unauthorized practice of law in South Carolina because they are conducting a\r\n  business. Â Lexington Law Firm cannot have it both ways.Â  As discussed, the\r\n  statutory scheme limits the listed exemptions to those professions or\r\n  businesses â€œwhen acting in the regular course of their respective businesses\r\n  and professions.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-101(2)(b) (Supp. 2008).Â  If Lexington Law\r\n  Firm is, in fact, acting in the regular course of the practice of law in South Carolina, then it is engaging in the unlawful unauthorized practice of law.Â \r\n  Conversely, if Lexington Law Firm is merely conducting a credit counseling\r\n  business, then it may not gain relief from the statutory compliance\r\n  requirements through the â€œattorneys at lawâ€ exemption.\r\nIII.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we are not barring Lexington Law Firm from providing credit counseling\r\n  services to South Carolinians, we are simply requiring Lexington Law Firm\r\n  comply with the statutes enacted by our Legislature.Â  Lexington Law Firm may\r\n  not avail itself of an exemption for which it is not statutorily entitled.\r\nWe hold Lexington\r\n  Law Firm is not exempt under section 37-7-101(2)(b) from licensure requirements\r\n  and the Department of Consumer Affairs is statutorily empowered to determine if\r\n  a business qualifies for an exemption.Â  The judgment of the ALC is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; At\r\n  oral argument, Lexington Law Firm contended the Departmentâ€™s appropriate course\r\n  of action would be to issue a cease and desist order under section 37-7-119.Â \r\n  Under normal circumstances, we would agree, but Lexington Law Firm preempted\r\n  the normal course of these actions by the filing of its declaratory judgment\r\n  action.Â  Lexington Law Firm may not now complain that the Department failed to\r\n  follow the preferred statutory course.\r\n[2]&nbsp; The authority to practice law in South\r\n  Carolina arises in three circumstances: (1) a license to practice law from this\r\n  Court; (2) authorization pro hace vice under Rule 404, SCACR; or (3) a\r\n  limited certificate of admission under Rule 405, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26649","title":"In the Matter of Thomas E.

McMaster and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle,\r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tGeorge\r\n  Hunter McMaster of Tompkins &amp; McMaster, of Columbia, and Irby E. Walker,\r\n  Jr., of Conway, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This attorney disciplinary action arises out of\r\n  multiple allegations of misconduct including misappropriation of funds.Â \r\n  Following a hearing, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct recommended Thomas E. Ruffin, Jr., be disbarred.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel joined\r\n  in the recommendation.Â  After thorough review of the record, we agree and\r\n  disbar Ruffin effective from the date of this opinion.\r\nIn\r\n  this attorney disciplinary case, Ruffin is accused of multiple acts of\r\n  misconduct including misappropriation of trust account funds and failure to pay\r\n  a client his settlement.Â  Ruffin was placed on interim suspension on July 28,\r\n  2004.Â  In the Matter of Ruffin, 360 S.C. 339, 600 S.E.2d 909 (2004).Â \r\n  Subsequently, in an unrelated matter, this Court indefinitely suspended\r\n  Ruffin.Â  In the Matter of Ruffin, 363 S.C. 347, 359-60, 610 S.E.2d 803,\r\n  809 (2005).Â  In the case at hand, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct panel found\r\n  misconduct occurred and recommended Ruffin be disbarred without retroaction,\r\n  required to pay costs, and required to make full restitution.Â  We hold\r\n  disbarment without retroaction, costs, and restitution are warranted sanctions.\r\nMatter\r\n  I\r\nRuffin conducted a\r\n  refinancing for Client A on or about April 16, 2004.Â  On April 21, 2004,\r\n  $137,896.51 was wired to Ruffinâ€™s trust account to be used to pay off the first\r\n  mortgage.Â  Ruffin failed to pay off the first mortgage, and the balance of his\r\n  trust account on April 30, 2004 was $9,109.97, far short of the amount\r\n  necessary to pay off the first mortgage.\r\nThe\r\n  title insurance company insuring the closing dispatched an auditor to review\r\n  Ruffinâ€™s trust account.Â  The auditor found the payoff never occurred and a\r\n  pattern of late payoffs using one closing to fund a previous closing.Â  For\r\n  instance, Ruffin conducted a closing for Client B on or about March 26, 2004.Â \r\n  The $114,406.27 payoff check was dated March 26, 2004, but did not clear until\r\n  April 26, 2004, after the above mentioned Client Aâ€™s funds were deposited in\r\n  Ruffinâ€™s trust account.Â  Additionally, Ruffin conducted a closing for Client C\r\n  on January 15, 2004, but the payoff check did not clear until February 24,\r\n  2004.Â  In the interim, Ruffinâ€™s trust account balance dipped to approximately\r\n  $7,000, well below the necessary amount to cover Client Câ€™s payoff.\r\nMatter II\r\nRuffin represented a\r\n  client in a personal injury claim.Â  The claim was settled for $3,500.00.Â \r\n  Ruffinâ€™s trust account showed the funds were deposited on May 6, 2004.Â  Ruffin\r\n  never issued a check to his client. Â The trust accountâ€™s balance at the end of\r\n  May 2004 was $309.97, which was again too depleted to cover Ruffinâ€™s financial\r\n  obligation.\r\nIn his answer,\r\n  Ruffin admitted he failed to pay his client.Â  Ruffin argued in his brief that\r\n  he was owed $2,500 by another party and once he placed that in his trust account\r\n  he would be able to pay his client.Â  This is a prime example of Ruffinâ€™s\r\n  misunderstanding of the sanctity of a trust account.\r\nMatter III\r\nWhen this Court\r\n  ordered Ruffinâ€™s interim suspension in 2004, the Court appointed an Attorney to\r\n  Protect Clientsâ€™ Interests.Â  In the Matter of Ruffin, 360 S.C. at 340,\r\n  600 S.E.2d at 909.Â  As part of his service, the appointed attorney reported an\r\n  item for $100.00 was returned for insufficient funds in one of Ruffinâ€™s trust\r\n  accounts in March 2004.Â  However, the insufficient funds notice stated, â€œNotice\r\n  of Returned Deposited Item.â€Â  Therefore, we find the bank notified Ruffin that\r\n  a $100 check he deposited had insufficient funds, not that he wrote a check\r\n  with insufficient funds.Â  Accordingly, no misconduct occurred in this matter.\r\nMatter\r\n  IV\r\nThe appointed\r\n  attorney also reported this matter, which involves Ruffinâ€™s representation of a\r\n  client in a personal injury case.Â  The clientâ€™s medical insurer notified the\r\n  client and Ruffin that it believed it had a right to recover its costs if the\r\n  client settled the claim.Â  The case settled for $17,500, which was deposited in\r\n  Ruffinâ€™s trust account.Â  In October 2003, the client authorized the\r\n  disbursement of $5,523.53 to the medical insurer, and Ruffin sent the client a\r\n  check for the remainder less attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Ruffin, however, never paid the\r\n  medical insurer, and his trust account had a balance of $93.50 on January 30,\r\n  2004.\r\nRuffin admitted the\r\n  client signed the disbursement authorization but denies any misappropriation.Â \r\n  Ruffin argued he determined the medical insurer was not entitled to this money,\r\n  contacted the client, and reached an agreement with the client to put the\r\n  $5,523.53 towards legal fees owed by the client.Â  Upon review of the record, we\r\n  hold Ruffin failed to fulfill his agreement with the medical insurer.Â  Further,\r\n  Ruffin provided no evidence to substantiate his assertion he and the client\r\n  reached an agreement to apply the withheld funds to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Instead,\r\n  the record only includes the disbursement agreement signed by the client\r\n  indicating a $5,523.53 payment should be issued to the medical insurer.Â  We\r\n  find unpersuasive Ruffinâ€™s effort to explain this gross misconduct.\r\nMatter V\r\nRuffin sent evidence\r\n  related to a motor vehicle accident to a retired civil engineering professor to\r\n  review.Â  Ruffin asked the professor to render an opinion related to the motor\r\n  vehicle accident.Â  The professor did so and submitted his bill of $250 to\r\n  Ruffin but was never paid for his services.Â  In his answer, Ruffin admitted he\r\n  never paid the professor because Ruffin sent the bill to his clients for\r\n  payment.Â  We find this argument meritless.Â  Ruffin contacted the professor to\r\n  review documents, and despite the professorâ€™s repeated contact with Ruffin\r\n  regarding payment, Ruffin never paid the professor.Â  Having contracted with the\r\n  professor, without the clientâ€™s knowledge or consent, Ruffinâ€™s failure to pay\r\n  the professor constitutes misconduct.\r\nMatter VI\r\nA\r\n  homeownersâ€™ association retained Ruffin to collect dues from two delinquent\r\n  homeowners.Â  The association paid Ruffin a total of $3,559.30.Â  Ruffin wrote a\r\n  letter to each of the delinquent homeowners but did not file the liens against\r\n  their property after delinquent homeowners failed to pay.Â  Ruffin admitted that\r\n  he failed to refund the fee.Â  Ruffin further agreed a portion of his payment\r\n  should be repaid.\r\nMatter VII\r\nIn his answer,\r\n  Ruffin conceded he failed to respond timely to the Notices of Full\r\n  Investigation/Supplemental Notices of Full Investigation in these cases.\r\n\r\nPanel Report\r\nThe panel found multiple\r\n  violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) contained in Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR.Â  Specifically, the panel found the following RPC violations in Matter I,\r\n  Matter II, Matter IV, and Matter VI: Rule 1.1, Competence; Rule 1.2, Scope of\r\n  Representation; Rule 1.3, Diligence; Rule 1.4, Communication; and Rule 1.15,\r\n  Safe Keeping of Property.Â  Additionally, in Matters V and VI, the panel found a\r\n  violation of Rule 4.1, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, Truthfulness in Statements to Others.\r\nAs\r\n  for Ruffinâ€™s admitted failure to cooperate, the panel found a violation of RPC Rule\r\n  8.1(b), Failure to Respond to a Lawful Demand for Information from a\r\n  Disciplinary Authority. Â Further, the panel found a violation of Rule 7(a)(3),\r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  because Ruffin failed to respond to a disciplinary authorityâ€™s lawful demand.\r\nLastly, the panel\r\n  found with regards to all matters, that Ruffin violated RPC Rule 8.4 in his\r\n  violation of Rules of Professional Conduct, inability to account for funds\r\n  entrusted to him, and perpetration of conduct prejudicial to the administration\r\n  of justice.\r\nThe panel recommended\r\n  Ruffin be disbarred effective on the date of this Courtâ€™s opinion, required to\r\n  pay costs of the proceedings, and required to make full restitution.Â  The panel\r\n  suggested Ruffin make the following restitution payments: $116,703.36 to the\r\n  title insurance company in Matter I, $1,803.24 to Ruffinâ€™s client in Matter II,\r\n  $5,523.53 to the medical insurer in Matter IV, $313.54 to the professor in\r\n  Matter V, and $2,000 to the gentleman who repaid the homeownersâ€™ association in\r\n  Matter VI.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court is not bound to accept the recommendations of the Panel or the Executive\r\n  Committee.Â  The duty of adjudging the professional conduct of members of the\r\n  Bar and taking appropriate disciplinary action rests exclusively with this\r\n  Court.â€Â  In the Matter of Hines, 275 S.C. 271, 273, 269 S.E.2d 766, 767\r\n  (1980).\r\nWe\r\n  hold no misconduct occurred in Matter III as the insufficient notice dealt with\r\n  an item deposited in Ruffinâ€™s account, not a check written on the account.Â \r\n  Regarding the remaining matters, we agree with the panel report and find\r\n  misconduct.Â  We further require restitution as set forth by the panel.\r\nDue\r\n  to the clear and convincing evidence of misconduct, Ruffinâ€™s disciplinary\r\n  history, and this Courtâ€™s precedent, we hold nonretroactive disbarment is\r\n  appropriate.Â  In the Matter of Ruffin, 363 S.C. at 359-60, 610 S.E.2d at\r\n  809 (indefinitely suspending Ruffin for matters unrelated to this case); see\r\n    also In the Matter of Wilmeth, 373 S.C. 631, 636, 647 S.E.2d 185,\r\n  188 (2007) (disbarring attorney, not retroactively, for multiple acts of\r\n  misconduct including misappropriation of funds); In the Matter of Morehouse,\r\n  330 S.C. 205, 206-07, 499 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1998) (disbarring attorney without\r\n  retroaction for wire fraud).\r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, we further require Ruffin to contact ODC immediately\r\n  regarding setting up a restitution plan.Â  Ruffin shall agree on a restitution payment\r\n  plan with ODC within sixty days of the filing of this opinion, complete\r\n  restitution prior to petition for reinstatement, pay the costs associated with\r\n  the disciplinary proceedings within ninety days of the filing of this opinion,\r\n  and take the Legal Ethics and Practice Program sponsored by ODC and the Professional Responsibility Committee of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar prior to any petition for reinstatement.Â  Failure to comply with\r\n  the restitution plan may result in the imposition of civil or criminal contempt\r\n  by this Court.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we disbar Ruffin effective upon the filing date of this\r\n  opinion.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Ruffin shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to\r\n  Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26625","title":"City of Hartsville v.

Driggers, of Driggers &amp; Moyd, of Hartsville, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  In this declaratory judgment action, South Carolina Municipal Insurance\r\n  and Risk Financing Fund (Insurer) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding the\r\n  Insurer had a continuing duty to defend the City of Hartsville (City) and\r\n  ordering it to pay the City the costs it incurred from having to defend against\r\n  a suit brought by a Hartsville landowner.Â  Pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, this\r\n  Court certified this appeal from the Court of Appeals.Â  We affirm the decision\r\n  of the circuit court.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn\r\n  1991, Phelix Byrd (Byrd) purchased a 46.358 acre tract of land that lay partly\r\n  in the City (the City tract) and partly in Darlington County (the County tract).Â \r\n  The property was part of what used to be Coker Farms, a National Historic\r\n  Landmark (NHL) as designated in 1964 by the National Park Service, a division\r\n  of the United States Department of the Interior.Â  This NHL designation,\r\n  however, was never filed in the public records of Darlington County nor was any mention of the designation placed on deeds conveying portions of the Coker\r\n  Farms properties to subsequent purchasers.Â  \r\nByrd purchased a\r\n  portion of the Coker Farms property in order to subdivide it and sell parcels\r\n  to developers for commercial purposes.Â  In 1998, Byrd approached the City about\r\n  developing a carwash on a .86 acre parcel of the property located in the City. Â Because\r\n  the City tract was zoned for agricultural use, Byrd petitioned the City to\r\n  rezone it as commercial.Â  Fearing that commercial development of any part of\r\n  the Coker Farms would lead to the revocation of the NHL designation for all of\r\n  Coker Farms, the City delayed acting on Byrdâ€™s petition.Â  \r\nAfter being assured\r\n  that rezoning Byrdâ€™s property would not affect the NHL designation, the City\r\n  rezoned the .86 acre parcel from agricultural to commercial pursuant to a City\r\n  ordinance in February of 1999.Â  By this time, however, Byrdâ€™s potential\r\n  purchaser had lost the financing necessary to develop the property and, as a\r\n  result, the sale never closed.Â  \r\nIn July 1999, the\r\n  City passed another ordinance which rezoned as commercial the balance of Byrdâ€™s\r\n  property located within the City. \r\nShortly thereafter,\r\n  Byrd entered into contracts to sell parcels of the City tract for development.Â \r\n  These sales, however, were not consummated because Darlington County, which maintained the records for both County and City property, would not approve the\r\n  deeds.Â  The County declined to approve the deeds on the ground the tax records\r\n  for Byrdâ€™s property contained â€œflags,â€ which stated â€œNâ€™tl Park Serv. Ord/No Per\r\n  or Deeds Issuedâ€ and, in turn, effectively restricted the issuance of deeds.Â  The\r\n  County had placed these flags on the tax records for all Coker Farms property\r\n  in an attempt to protect the NHL designation.Â  The flags were not removed from\r\n  Byrdâ€™s tax records until approximately three years after the City tract had\r\n  been rezoned.\r\n In 2000, Byrd sued\r\n  the City and the County, in addition to several other defendants, for damages\r\n  arising from Byrdâ€™s difficulties and delays in being able to commercially\r\n  develop his Coker Farms properties.Â  In terms of his claims against the City,\r\n  Byrd specifically pled causes of action for â€œgross negligenceâ€[1] and â€œtaking or inverse condemnation.â€Â  \r\nThe City,\r\n  represented by the Insurer,[2] moved for summary judgment on all of Byrdâ€™s claims.Â  By order dated February\r\n  22, 2002, the circuit court granted the Cityâ€™s motion with respect to Byrdâ€™s\r\n  takings and gross negligence claims.Â  The court, however, denied the motion\r\n  regarding Byrdâ€™s cause of action for inverse condemnation.Â  \r\nOn March 28, 2002,\r\n  the Insurer withdrew its defense of the City on the ground the remaining cause\r\n  of action against the City for inverse condemnation was specifically excluded\r\n  under the terms of the liability insurance policy the Insurer issued to the\r\n  City.[3] Â The City protested the Insurerâ€™s withdrawal and requested that it continue to\r\n  defend the City due to its concerns that the circuit court could permit Byrd to\r\n  amend his complaint to add claims covered by the Insurerâ€™s liability policy.Â \r\n  Despite this protest, the Insurer denied its duty to defend but indicated that\r\n  it would reconsider its position in the event Byrd was permitted to reinstate\r\n  the negligence cause of action.Â  After the Insurer withdrew its defense, the\r\n  City retained its own counsel.\r\nSubsequently, the\r\n  City filed a second motion for summary judgment with respect to Byrdâ€™s inverse\r\n  condemnation claim.Â  At the hearing on this motion, Byrd conveyed his theory\r\n  that officials with the City and the County â€œconspired to have Darlington County â€˜flagâ€™ [his] property so that it could not be sold.â€Â  \r\nBy order dated\r\n  September 11, 2002, the circuit court granted the Cityâ€™s motion concerning the inverse\r\n  condemnation cause of action, but denied the motion â€œwith respect to the claim\r\n  that the City of Hartsville has conspired with the County of Darlington in its actions.â€Â  In so holding, the court reasoned: \r\n\r\n  [A]s to\r\n    the allegation by [Byrd] that the City of Hartsville was involved with the\r\n    County in â€˜flaggingâ€™ the property, it would be inappropriate, at this time, for\r\n    Summary Judgment to be granted.Â  However, with respect to any independent acts\r\n    by the City of Hartsville Officials, the Court finds that Summary Judgment\r\n    would be appropriate as to those allegations. \r\n\r\nUltimately, on\r\n  March 20, 2003, the circuit court dismissed the City as a defendant in Byrdâ€™s\r\n  lawsuit.Â  In reaching this decision, the court concluded that â€œSouth Carolina\r\n  Code Section 15-78-60(17), as amended, grants immunity to the City of\r\n  Hartsville for actions taken by its employees, even if proved, which would have\r\n  involved an intent to harm Mr. Byrd, the Plaintiff, as it is claimed to have\r\n  conspired with County employees.â€Â  In its order denying Byrdâ€™s motion for\r\n  reconsideration, the circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n  In its\r\n    Motion for Reconsideration, [Byrd] contends that these actions by the City of\r\n    Hartsville, working along side the County of Darlington, would be independent\r\n    conduct by the City of Hartsville, constituting inverse condemnation.Â  The\r\n    Court, however, concludes that this would be evidence of a conspiracy and,\r\n    thus, is in fact, a tort and not a contract and is, thus, barred by the\r\n    aforementioned Statute.Â  As previously stated, the Court had already concluded\r\n    in its Order of September 11, 2002, which was unappealed, that there were no\r\n    independent acts or conduct by the City of Hartsville which would support an\r\n    inverse condemnation claim.\r\n\r\nByrd appealed to\r\n  the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  In Byrd v. City of Hartsville,[4] 365 S.C. 650, 620 S.E.2d 76 (2005), this Court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  orders, holding:Â  (1) the conspiracy claim was not before the Court given Byrd\r\n  did not appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s decision that the City would be immune\r\n  from liability under the Tort Claims Act even if there were a conspiracy; and\r\n  (2) summary judgment in favor of the City was proper because Byrd could not\r\n  demonstrate that the City inversely condemned his property through regulatory\r\n  delay.Â  \r\nWhile Byrdâ€™s appeal\r\n  was pending, the City filed this declaratory judgment action against the\r\n  Insurer to recover all costs incurred by the City in defending against Byrdâ€™s\r\n  lawsuit after the Insurer withdrew its defense.Â  Specifically, the City claimed\r\n  the Insurer breached its contract of insurance with the City â€œwhile covered\r\n  claims against [the City], including a tort claim for conspiracy, was still\r\n  being litigated.â€Â  Based on this alleged breach of contract, the City claimed\r\n  it was entitled to be reimbursed for the costs and expenses of having to defend\r\n  against the Byrd lawsuit since March 28, 2002, through the appeal.Â  In\r\n  response, the Insurer denied liability to the City on the ground that all\r\n  claims which remained against the City after the February 22, 2002 order,\r\n  including the conspiracy claim, were not covered by the liability policy issued\r\n  to the City. \r\nAfter a hearing,\r\n  the circuit court ruled in favor of the City by order dated May 10, 2007.Â  In\r\n  reaching this decision, the court found:Â  (1) Byrdâ€™s conspiracy claim against\r\n  the City was a tort action that was separate from the cause of action for\r\n  inverse condemnation; and (2) the conspiracy claim, a common law tort action,\r\n  was not specifically excluded by the Tort Claims Act.Â  Based on these findings,\r\n  the court concluded the Insurer was contractually bound to defend the City\r\n  against all tort claims, including the conspiracy claim.Â  As a result, the\r\n  court ordered the Insurer to reimburse the City for its defense costs in the\r\n  amount of $17,642.55. \r\nThe Insurer appeals\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Insurer argues the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  it had a continuing duty to defend the City after the cause of action for\r\n  negligent misrepresentation was dismissed.Â  The Insurer claims its duty to\r\n  defend terminated at this point because any remaining duty to defend the City\r\n  was based on the specifically-excluded inverse condemnation claim. Â The Insurer\r\n  contends the remaining civil conspiracy cause of action did not â€œtriggerâ€ a\r\n  duty to defend because the claim:Â  (1) was not specifically pled by Byrd; (2)\r\n  arose from the same alleged acts of the City as the inverse condemnation claim and\r\n  was, therefore, subject to the same exclusion in the liability policy; and (3) constitutes\r\n  an intentional tort which is barred by sovereign immunity under section 15-78-60\r\n  of the Tort Claims Act.Â  \r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory\r\n  judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the\r\n  underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400\r\n  S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  A suit to determine coverage under an insurance policy\r\n  is an action at law. Â State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. James, 337 S.C.\r\n  86, 93, 522 S.E.2d 345, 348-49 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Therefore, this Courtâ€™s\r\n  jurisdiction â€œis limited to correcting errors of law and factual findings will\r\n  not be disturbed unless unsupported by any evidence.â€ Â Id.\r\nQuestions of\r\n  coverage and the duty of a liability insurance company to defend a claim\r\n  brought against its insured are determined by the allegations of the complaint.Â  C.D.

App. 1984).Â  If the underlying complaint creates a\r\n  possibility of coverage under an insurance policy, the insurer is obligated to\r\n  defend. Â Gordon-Gallup Realtors, Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 274 S.C.\r\n  468, 265 S.E.2d 38 (1980). \r\nAn\r\n  insurerâ€™s duty to defend is\r\n  separate and distinct from its obligation to pay a judgment rendered against an\r\n  insured. Â Sloan Constr. Co. v. Cent. Natâ€™l Ins. Co. of Omaha, 269 S.C.\r\n  183, 236 S.E.2d 818 (1977).Â  However, these duties are interrelated. Â If the\r\n  facts alleged in a complaint against an insured fail to bring a claim within\r\n  policy coverage, an insurer has no duty to defend. R.A. Earnhardt Textile Mach. Div. v. S.C. Ins.\r\n    Co., 277 S.C. 88, 282 S.E.2d 856 (1981).Â  Accordingly, the allegations of\r\n  the complaint determine the insurerâ€™s duty to defend. Â Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. S.C. Ins. Co., 252 S.C. 428, 166 S.E.2d 762 (1969).Â  \r\nâ€œAlthough\r\n  the cases addressing an insurerâ€™s duty to defend generally limit this duty to whether the allegations\r\n  in a complaint are sufficient to bring the claims within the coverage of an\r\n  insurance policy, an insurerâ€™s duty to defend\r\n  is not strictly controlled by the allegations in the complaint. Instead, the duty to defend may also be determined\r\n  by facts outside of the complaint that are known by the insurer.â€Â  USAA\r\n    Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 657, 661 S.E.2d 791, 798\r\n  (2008); see BP Oil Co. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 631,\r\n  638, 496 S.E.2d 35, 39 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œAlthough the determination of an\r\n  insurerâ€™s duty to defend is based\r\n  upon the allegations in a complaint . . . in some jurisdictions, the duty to defend will be measured by\r\n  facts outside of the complaint that are known by the insurer.â€). \r\nI.\r\nAs its first\r\n  argument, the Insurer contends it had no duty to defend the City regarding\r\n  Byrdâ€™s cause of action for civil conspiracy because it was not specifically\r\n  pled and, thus, did not invoke potential liability coverage. \r\nAlthough\r\n  the Insurer conceded this issue during oral argument before this Court, we take\r\n  this opportunity to reiterate the standard for determining an insurerâ€™s duty to\r\n  defend.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the above-outlined principles, we find Byrdâ€™s failure to plead the elements\r\n  of the civil conspiracy did not negate the Insurerâ€™s duty to defend the City on\r\n  this cause of action.Â  Although a determination of an insurerâ€™s duty to defend\r\n  is dependent upon the insuredâ€™s complaint, an analysis of this duty involves\r\n  the allegations of the complaint and not the specifically identified causes of\r\n  action.Â  Moreover, an insurerâ€™s duty to defend may arise from facts outside of\r\n  the complaint that are known to the insurer.\r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, the City acknowledged that Byrd did not specifically plead civil\r\n  conspiracy in his original or amended complaints.Â  However, as evidenced by the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s orders, the allegations in these pleadings set forth Byrdâ€™s\r\n  theory that the City and the County conspired to flag his property which\r\n  prevented him from pursuing commercial development. Â Therefore, the allegations\r\n  in the pleadings, the facts known to the insurer, and the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  recognition of Byrdâ€™s conspiracy claim, created a possibility of coverage under\r\n  the Insurerâ€™s liability policy.Â  Accordingly, the Insurer was not justified in\r\n  withdrawing its defense based on Byrdâ€™s failure to specifically plead a cause\r\n  of action for civil conspiracy, particularly given the circuit courtâ€™s express\r\n  authorization of Byrdâ€™s continued pursuit of this claim.Â  See Prior\r\n    v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 305 S.C. 247,\r\n  249, 407 S.E.2d 655, 657 (Ct. App. 1991) (discussing an insurerâ€™s duty to\r\n  defend and stating â€œ[i]n examining the complaint, we must look beyond the\r\n  labels describing the acts, to the acts themselves which form the basis of the\r\n  claim against the insurerâ€).\r\nII.\r\nEven if Byrd had pled conspiracy, the Insurer avers that this claim did\r\n  not provide a basis for coverage independent from that of the inverse\r\n  condemnation cause of action.Â  Specifically, the Insurer contends that the â€œheart\r\n  of the conspiracy claim is â€˜flagging,â€™ which cannot be separated from the\r\n  inverse condemnation claim against the County.â€ Â Relying on the policy language\r\n  of the inverse condemnation exclusion, the Insurer asserts the conspiracy claim\r\n  â€œarose out ofâ€ the inverse condemnation claim.Â  Because a claim for inverse\r\n  condemnation is excluded under the liability policy, the Insurer argues it had\r\nno duty to defend the City against the civil conspiracy claim.Â  \r\nFor several reasons, we disagree with the Insurerâ€™s contention.Â  First,\r\nit is instructive to examine the elements of inverse condemnation and civil conspiracy.\r\nThe\r\n  elements of an inverse condemnation are (1) affirmative conduct of a\r\n  governmental entity, and (2) a taking.Â  Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365\r\n  S.C. 650, 657, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79-80 (2005).\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, the tort of civil conspiracy contains three elements:Â  Â (1) the\r\n  combination of two or more people, (2) for the purpose\r\n  of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes special damages.Â  Pye v. Estate\r\n    of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 566-67, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006); Kuznik v. Bees\r\n      Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 610, 538 S.E.2d 15, 31 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œIt is\r\n  well-settled in South Carolina that the tort of civil conspiracy contains three\r\n  elements: Â (1) a combination of two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of\r\n  injuring the plaintiff; (3) causing plaintiff special damage.â€).\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  action for civil conspiracy may exist even though respondents committed no\r\n  unlawful act and no unlawful means were used.â€ Â LaMotte v. Punch Line of\r\n    Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 70, 370 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1988).Â  â€œSpecifically,\r\n  it is not necessary for a plaintiff asserting a civil conspiracy cause of\r\n  action to allege an unlawful act in order to state a cause of action, although\r\n  a civil conspiracy may be furthered by an unlawful act.â€ Id. Â â€œThus,\r\n  lawful acts may become actionable as a civil conspiracy when the object is\r\n    to ruin or damage the business of another.â€ Id. (citations omitted)\r\n  (emphasis added). Â \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  gravamen of the tort of civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the\r\n  plaintiff from an overt act done pursuant to the combination, not the agreement\r\n  or combination per se.â€Â  Pye, 369 S.C. at 567-68, 633 S.E.2d at 511.Â \r\n  â€œBecause the quiddity of a civil conspiracy claim is the damage resulting to\r\n  the plaintiff, the damages alleged must go beyond the damages alleged in other\r\n    causes of action.â€Â  Id. at 568, 633 S.E.2d at 511 (emphasis added).\r\nÂ As\r\n  evidenced by the above-outlined principles, the elements and damages for the\r\n  two causes of action are distinctly different. \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note the â€œobjectâ€ of the alleged civil conspiracy is not entirely clear from\r\n  the pleadings.Â  Conceivably, such a conspiracy could have been intended to prevent\r\n  Byrd from commercially developing the City tract but also from developing any\r\n  other potentially acquired properties in the City or the County.Â  Had the City\r\n  and the County actually conspired, such a conspiracy could have had further\r\n  reaching implications than just adversely affecting Byrdâ€™s City tract in an\r\n  effort to preserve the NHL designation.Â  Thus, the â€œobjectâ€ of the civil\r\n  conspiracy was not necessarily a â€œtakingâ€ or â€œinverse condemnationâ€ of Byrdâ€™s\r\n  property.\r\nIn\r\n  terms of the elements of the causes of actions, a claim for civil conspiracy\r\n  would have required Byrd to establish the existence of an overt act committed\r\n  by a combination of individuals for the purpose of injuring Byrd.Â  These\r\n  elements were not present in Byrdâ€™s claim for inverse condemnation.Â  Moreover,\r\n  in order to prevail on his civil conspiracy claim, Byrd did not have to prove\r\n  that a â€œtakingâ€ occurred.\r\nSecondly,\r\n  it is significant that the circuit court permitted Byrd to pursue his\r\n  conspiracy claim after the court simultaneously dismissed the inverse\r\n  condemnation cause of action.Â  Clearly, this decision evidenced the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s belief that Byrdâ€™s claim of civil conspiracy was a tort action that\r\n  existed separate and independent from the inverse condemnation claim.Â  Although\r\n  the conspiracy claim was ultimately dismissed by the circuit court under the\r\n  Tort Claims Act, we find the Insurer had a continuing duty to defend as long as\r\n  there was a possibility of liability coverage for this tort claim.Â  Â \r\nMoreover, a review of the applicable exclusion in the liability policy\r\n  does not support the Insurerâ€™s argument.Â  The Insurer relies on the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n  Inverse condemnation, condemnation, temporary taking,\r\n    permanent taking, or any claim arising out of or in any\r\n      way connected with the operation of the principles of eminent domain;\r\n    adverse possession or dedication by adverse use. (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nEven\r\n  though the facts of both causes of action were â€œintertwined,â€ Byrdâ€™s claim for\r\n  civil conspiracy was not inextricably connected or necessarily â€œarose out ofâ€\r\n  the inverse condemnation cause of action.Â  As evidenced by the discussion\r\n  regarding the elements of each cause of action, a civil conspiracy claim does\r\n  not necessarily involve a â€œtakingâ€ or â€œthe operation of the principles of\r\neminent domain.â€[5]Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  any policy exclusion should be construed narrowly and in favor of the City.Â  Because\r\n  the Insurerâ€™s liability policy does not specifically exclude a cause of action\r\n  for conspiracy, we find the Insurer was obligated to defend the City regarding\r\n  this remaining cause of action.Â  See Town of Duncan v. State Budget\r\n    &amp; Control Bd., Div. of Ins. Servs., 326 S.C. 6, 16, 482 S.E.2d 768, 774\r\n  (1997) (recognizing that an insurer is not justified in refusing to defend\r\n  entire lawsuit containing several causes of action where some causes of action\r\n  are covered under the policy and some are not); seeÂ­ also McPherson\r\n    v. Mich. Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 316, 319, 426 S.E.2d 770, 771 (1993) (stating\r\n  â€œrules of construction require clauses of exclusion to be narrowly interpreted,\r\n  and clauses of inclusion to be broadly construedâ€); Standard Fire Ins. Co.\r\n    v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460,\r\n  461 (1990) (stating terms in an insurance policy should be liberally construed\r\n  in favor of the insured). \r\nIII.\r\nNext,\r\n  the Insurer asserts the circuit court erred in finding that the Tort Claims Act[6] required it to provide coverage for the conspiracy claim and, in turn,\r\n  established a duty to defend the City against this cause of action.Â  In support\r\n  of this assertion, the Insurer relies on the provision of the Tort Claims Act\r\n  which grants sovereign immunity to a political entity for the intentional acts\r\n  of its employees.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(17) (2005) (stating a\r\n  â€œgovernmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:Â  employee conduct\r\n  outside the scope of his official duties or which constitutes . . . intent to\r\n  harmâ€).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  view of this provision, the Insurer argues that â€œclaims based on intentional\r\n  harm such as conspiracy are barred by sovereign immunity under section\r\n  15-78-60(17).â€ Â Therefore, the Insurer contends that â€œif there is no liability\r\n  under the Tort Claims Act, [the City] has no grounds for arguing that coverage\r\n  must be provided.â€Â  Based on this reasoning, the Insurer avers it had no duty\r\n  to defend the conspiracy claim.Â  \r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides that â€œ[t]he State, an agency, a political\r\n  subdivision, and a governmental entity\r\n  are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a\r\n  private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon\r\n  liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages, contained\r\nherein.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005). \r\nâ€œThe burden of establishing a\r\n  limitation upon liability or an exception to the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act\r\n  is upon the governmental entity asserting it as an affirmative defense.â€Â  Plyer\r\n    v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 651, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195-96 (2007).Â  â€œProvisions\r\n  establishing limitations upon and exemptions from liability of a governmental\r\nentity must be liberally construed in favor of limiting liability.â€Â  Id.\r\nNotably, it appears\r\n  the Insurer confuses its duty to defend with its obligation to pay for a\r\n  covered claim.Â  As we interpret its argument, the Insurer believes that if the\r\n  City is immune under the Tort Claims Act for civil conspiracy claims then there\r\n  is no liability coverage and, in turn, no duty to defend.\r\nThis argument, however,\r\n  ignores the fact that sovereign immunity is an affirmative defense which must\r\n  be raised by the party asserting it as a bar to liability. Â Logically, then the\r\n  Insurer had a duty to assert this defense on behalf of the City.Â  Thus, the\r\n  fact that the circuit court ultimately dismissed Byrdâ€™s conspiracy claim under\r\n  the Tort Claims Act is of no consequence to a determination of whether the\r\n  Insurer had a duty to defend the City on this claim.Â  See Town of\r\n    Duncan, 326 S.C. at 16 n.14, 482 S.E.2d at 774 n.14 (â€œAn insurerâ€™s duty to\r\n  defend depends on an initial or apparent potential liability to satisfy a\r\n  judgment against the insured.â€).\r\nIV.\r\nFinally,\r\n  even if it had a duty to defend the City against the conspiracy claim, the\r\n  Insurer contends the circuit court erred in finding the duty continued after\r\n  the circuit court dismissed the claim and Byrd failed to appeal the dismissal. \r\nBecause\r\n  we hold the Insurer had a continuing duty to defend the City even after the\r\n  negligent misrepresentation claim was dismissed, we agree with the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s assessment of costs against the Insurer.Â  See Unisun Ins. Co.\r\n    v. Hertz Rental Corp., 312 S.C. 549, 554, 436 S.E.2d 182, 186 (Ct. App.\r\n  1993) (â€œAn insurer that breaches its duty to defend and indemnify the insured may\r\n  be held liable for the expenses the insured incurs in providing for his own\r\n  defense.â€). Â \r\nAs\r\n  acknowledged by the Insurer, the liability policy provided for the Insurer â€œto\r\n  indemnify [the City] all costs and expenses incurred in the investigation,\r\n  adjustment, settlement, defense and appeal of any claim or suit for\r\n  which coverage is afforded by this Section III (General Liability) of this\r\n  Contract.â€ (emphasis added). Â Therefore, the Insurer was responsible for the\r\n  costs and expenses incurred by the City through the appeal of Byrdâ€™s lawsuit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the Insurer had a\r\n  continuing duty to defend the City even after the negligent misrepresentation\r\n  claim was dismissed given the civil conspiracy claim subjected the City to tort\r\n  liability.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the order of the circuit court finding the\r\n  Insurer had a continuing duty to defend and ordering the Insurer to pay the\r\ncosts and expenses incurred by the City through the appeal of Byrdâ€™s lawsuit.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\nWALLER, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In their briefs, the parties refer to this cause of\r\n  action as one for negligent misrepresentation.Â  However, a review of the\r\n  pleadings indicates that Byrd titled this cause of action as â€œgross\r\nnegligence.â€Â  \r\n[2]Â  The City procured tort liability insurance from the\r\n  Insurer in compliance with section 15-78-140 of the South Carolina Code, which\r\nprovides in pertinent part:\r\n(b)\r\n  The political subdivisions of this State, in regard to tort and automobile\r\n  liability, property and casualty insurance shall procure insurance to cover\r\n  these risks for which immunity has been waived by (1) the purchase of liability\r\n  insurance pursuant to Â§ 1-11-140; or (2) the purchase of liability insurance\r\n  from a private carrier; or (3) self-insurance; or (4) establishing pooled\r\n  self-insurance liability funds, by intergovernmental agreement, which may not\r\n  be construed as transacting the business of insurance or otherwise subject to\r\nstate laws regulating insurance. \r\nS.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 15-78-140(b) (2005).\r\n[3]Â  The following provision is listed under the\r\nexclusions section of the liability policy:\r\n\r\n  Inverse\r\n    Condemnation\r\n  Inverse\r\n    condemnation, condemnation, temporary taking, permanent taking, or any claim\r\n    arising out of or in any way connected with the operation of the principles of\r\n    eminent domain; adverse possession or dedication by adverse use. \r\n\r\n[4]Â  Because the County settled with Byrd, it was not a\r\nparty to the appeal.\r\n[5]Â  In support of its argument that the civil conspiracy\r\n  claim â€œarose out ofâ€ the inverse condemnation cause of action, the Insurer\r\n  primarily relies on South Carolina Municipal Insurance and Risk Fund v. City\r\n    of Myrtle Beach, 368 S.C. 240, 628 S.E.2d 276 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We find\r\nthis case is distinguishable from the instant case.\r\nIn City of Myrtle Beach, the City was subjected to a class action lawsuit challenging a city\r\n  ordinance which held landlords secondarily liable for their tenantsâ€™ water\r\n  bills.Â  After judgment was granted to the class, the City sought\r\n  indemnification from its insurer.Â  Id. at 241, 628 S.E.2d at 277.Â  In\r\n  turn, the insurer filed a declaratory judgment requesting declarations that its\r\n  liability policy with the City did not cover any of the claims or damages\r\n  asserted by the class.Â  In support of its action, the insurer relied on a\r\n  policy provision which specifically excluded inverse condemnation actions.Â \r\n  Because the policy excluded coverage for inverse condemnation actions, the\r\n  insurer contended the class membersâ€™ claim of a taking in violation of equal\r\n  protection and due process was also excluded from coverage.Â  Id. at 242,\r\n  628 S.E.2d at 277.Â  After converting the motion into cross-motions for summary\r\njudgment, the trial court ruled in favor of the City.Â  The insurer appealed.Â  Id. at 243, 628 S.E.2d at 277. \r\nAddressing only the\r\n  insurerâ€™s contention that its policy expressly excluded coverage for claims\r\n  based on a taking, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court.Â  Id. at 244, 628 S.E.2d at 278.Â  In so ruling, the court specifically noted that the\r\n  focus of the appeal was on the coverage provided by the liability policy and\r\n  not the insurerâ€™s duty to defend.Â  On the merits, the court found that the\r\n  insurer should not have been required to indemnify the City for its loss because\r\n  â€œthe violation of the class membersâ€™ rights to due process and equal protection\r\n  would not have occurred but for the wrongful exercise by the City of its\r\n  eminent domain power,â€ which in turn fell within the inverse condemnation\r\npolicy exclusion.Â  Id. at 245, 628 S.E.2d at 278-79.\r\nWe believe the City\r\n  of Myrtle Beach is distinguishable from the instant case given it involved\r\n  the insurerâ€™s duty to indemnify and not the initial duty to defend.Â \r\n  Furthermore, unlike Byrdâ€™s claim of civil conspiracy, the class membersâ€™ claim\r\n  of a taking, which included allegations of due process and equal protection\r\n  violations, necessarily arose out of the Cityâ€™s exercise of its eminent domain\r\npower.\r\n[6]Â  S.C.

S.\r\n          Leevy Johnson of Johnson, Toal &amp; Battiste, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, Joseph L. Smalls, Jr., stipulated to misconduct primarily involving his\r\n  trust accounts.Â  The Commission on Lawyer Conduct panel recommended retroactive\r\n  disbarment, restitution, and assessment of costs.Â  We find retroactive disbarment,\r\n  restitution, and costs warranted.\r\nI.\r\nSmalls\r\n  ran the Smalls Law Firm, in Columbia, which consisted of a general practice\r\n  with a high volume of real estate closings.Â  Smalls solely possessed check\r\n  signing authority and maintained control over the firmâ€™s bank accounts related\r\n  to this case.\r\nSmalls\r\n  stipulated this case arose out of a complaint to Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  (ODC) because a check for $72,379.67 issued by Smalls for a real estate closing\r\n  was not honored in 2002.Â  The complaint launched a full ODC investigation into\r\n  Smallsâ€™ multiple law firm bank accounts.Â  As a result of its investigation, ODC\r\n  petitioned for interim suspension, which this Court granted on May 16, 2002.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Smalls conceded he failed to identify client file names or numbers as required\r\n  by Rule 417, SCACR on â€œscoresâ€ of deposits between 2000 and 2002 into his trust\r\n  accounts.Â  Smalls further admitted he routinely transferred funds between law\r\n  firm accounts to â€œcureâ€ account shortages.Â  This misconduct resulted in\r\n  multiple insufficient funds penalties and fees.Â  One of Smallsâ€™ trust accounts\r\n  was assessed penalties for approximately seventy-five insufficient funds checks\r\n  from 2000 to 2002.Â  Another trust account was assessed approximately 11\r\n  insufficient funds fees during the same time period.\r\nA\r\n  bank, where Smalls maintained a trust account and a general operating account,\r\n  force-closed the accounts in 2002.Â  Upon force-closure, the trust account had a\r\n  balance of negative $413.57, and the bank returned approximately thirty-five\r\n  checks in the last seven business days totaling approximately $75,000 due to\r\n  insufficient funds.Â  The general operating account had a balance of negative $44.69.\r\nThe Lawyersâ€™\r\n  Fund for Client Protection received claims totaling $235,528.82, and the Fund\r\n  paid out a total of $114,239.04 to forty-seven people.Â  The Fund received\r\n  $33,541.71 from the appointed Trustee resulting in a net deficit of $80,697.33.\r\nIn addition to the above\r\n  misconduct, Smalls represented a client in a workersâ€™ compensation case, which\r\n  settled for $7,000 in November 2001.Â  The funds were not disbursed to the\r\n  client prior to Smallsâ€™ interim suspension on May 16, 2002.Â  Next, a\r\n  chiropractor treated one of Smallsâ€™ clients.Â  The client assigned part of her\r\n  settlement to the chiropractor, and the client settled in April 2002.Â  The\r\n  chiropractor was not paid.Â  Lastly, a court reporter submitted an invoice for a\r\n  deposition transcript on or about March 14, 2002 for $342.20.Â  Smalls stipulated\r\n  this invoice was not paid as he was out of the office due to illness and then\r\n  suspended.\r\nUpon review of the\r\n  stipulation of facts and hearing testimony, the panel recommended retroactive\r\n  disbarment, payment of costs, and restitution.Â  Smalls challenged the panelâ€™s\r\n  report and recommendation.\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  panel found clear and convincing evidence of violations of Rules 1.15, 8.4(a),\r\n  8.4(b), 8.4(d), and 8.4(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The panel further found a\r\n  violation of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  The panel recommended disbarring Smalls\r\n  retroactively, assessing costs against Smalls, and requiring Smalls to make\r\n  full restitution to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund and to victims.Â  We agree and find\r\n  retroactive disbarment, imposition of costs, and restitution warranted.\r\nRule\r\n  1.15 requires the safekeeping of a clientâ€™s property.Â  The evidence indicated\r\n  Smalls failed to maintain the records of his trust accounts and failed to\r\n  maintain the integrity of his trust accounts.Â  Accordingly, we agree that Rule\r\n  1.15 was violated.Â  Next, we hold subsections (a), (b), (d), and (e) of Rule\r\n  8.4 were violated through Smalls mishandling of clientsâ€™ funds.Â \r\n  Lastly, we hold the financial recordkeeping requirements of Rule 417 were ignored.\r\nWe\r\n  acknowledge it is unclear whether Smalls used the unaccounted for money for his\r\n  personal benefit.Â  What is clear, however, is that Smalls drastically failed to\r\n  keep clientsâ€™ property safe and mishandled money, moving funds from one account\r\n  to another to cover shortages.Â  Accordingly, we find that disbarment is an\r\n  appropriate sanction under these circumstances.Â  Based on precedent and Smallsâ€™\r\n  interim suspension since May 16, 2002, we find imposing a sanction of\r\n  retroactive disbarment adequately protects the public.Â  See In the Matter of\r\n    Yarborough, 380 S.C. 104, 106, 668 S.E.2d 802, 803 (2008) (disbarring\r\n  retroactively given the duration of Yarboroughâ€™s indefinite suspension,\r\n  Yarboroughâ€™s disciplinary history, and the Courtâ€™s finding the purpose of\r\n  disciplinary proceedings, which is to protect the public and the integrity of\r\n  the legal system, was satisfied by retroactive disbarment); In the Matter of\r\n    Evans, 376 S.C. 483, 484-85, 657 S.E.2d 752, 752-53 (2008) (accepting\r\n  agreement to disbar retroactively due to Evansâ€™ failure to manage staff and\r\n  reconcile her records); In the Matter of Kennedy, 367 S.C. 355, 361, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 341, 345 (2006) (disbarring Kennedy retroactively for failing to follow\r\n  recordkeeping and money handling requirements, periodically using trust money\r\n  to pay Kennedyâ€™s expenses, and additional misconduct such as mail fraud).\r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR we further require Smalls to contact ODC\r\n  within fifteen days of the filing of this opinion regarding setting up a restitution\r\n  plan for the Lawyersâ€™ Fund and other victims, to agree on a payment plan with\r\n  ODC within sixty days of the filing of this opinion, to make payment of the costs\r\n  associated with the disciplinary proceedings within ninety days of the filing\r\n  of this opinion, and to take the Legal Ethics and\r\n  Practice Program administered by ODC prior to any petition for\r\n  reinstatement.Â  Failure to comply with the restitution plan may result in the\r\n  imposition of civil or criminal contempt by this Court.\r\nIII.\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we retroactively disbar Smalls to the date of his\r\n  interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Smalls\r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied\r\n  with Rule 30, Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of\r\n  Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nWALLER, ACTING\r\n  CHIEF

Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this\r\n  attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule\r\n  21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to a definite suspension from the practice of law of up to and\r\n  including one (1) year.Â  We accept the agreement and impose a one (1) year\r\n  suspension from the practice of law.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement,\r\n  are as follows.\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent admits closing a real estate\r\n  purchase transaction for Complainant A, a co-purchaser of the property, without\r\n  a recordable power of attorney for the other co-purchaser of the property.Â  In\r\n  addition, he admits he allowed Complainant A to sign documents for herself and\r\n  as absent co-purchaser after she indicated she had authority to sign for the\r\n  absent co-purchaser even though he did not seek verification of Complainant Aâ€™s\r\n  authority to sign for the co-purchaser.Â  \r\nRespondent admits that the insurance\r\n  payments on the settlement statement were not accurate and did not reflect the\r\n  actual disbursement.Â  Further, respondent admits he failed to insure the title\r\n  insurance on the transaction was in fact issued and that the closing\r\n  instructions were followed.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he failed to\r\n  supervise the paralegal who was handling the transaction and that his lack of\r\n  supervision resulted in mistakes on the settlement statement and mistakes in\r\n  post-closing requirements.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he falsely witnessed\r\n  a signature on a mortgage that was signed by another person.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRegarding this real estate transaction,\r\n  respondent admits he failed to insure that funds were properly credited to his\r\n  trust account prior to disbursement, that he failed to properly maintain client\r\n  ledgers, that he failed to timely reconcile his trust account, and failed to\r\n  follow Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\n Respondent admits he failed to refund\r\n  the Complainantsâ€™ fee after he agreed to issue the refund.Â  Respondent states\r\n  he agreed to the refund as an accommodation to the Complainants after they\r\n  declined to pursue their case.Â  Respondent maintains, however, that he had\r\n  performed enough work on the Complainantsâ€™ behalf to entitle him to the fee.Â \r\n  ODC does not dispute this assertion.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent\r\n  representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge or collect\r\n  unreasonable fee); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall not\r\n  disburse funds from an account containing funds of more than one client or\r\n  third person unless the funds to be disbursed have been deposited in the\r\n  account and are collected funds); Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall insure firm has in\r\n  effect measures giving reasonable assurance that non-lawyerâ€™s conduct Â employed\r\n  by lawyer is compatible with professional obligations of lawyer); and Rule 8.4 (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct). Â Further, respondent admits he did not\r\n  comply with the financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR. Â In\r\n  addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute grounds for discipline\r\n  under the following provision of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1)\r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the\r\n  practice of law for one (1) year.Â  Within fifteen days of the filing of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied with\r\n  the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26651","title":"Bradley v.

No. 2002-UP-544 (S.C. Ct. App filed August 29, 2002).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the Stateâ€™s theory was that although petitioner did not actively\r\n  participate in the murder/robbery, he accompanied the active participants to\r\n  the scene with knowledge that they intended to commit the robbery.Â  The State\r\n  sought to convict petitioner of the murder which occurred in the course of the\r\n  robbery under a â€œhand of one/hand of allâ€ accomplice liability theory.Â  See State v. Curry, 370 S.C. 674, 636 S.E.2d 649 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The\r\n  Stateâ€™s case relied heavily on petitionerâ€™s incriminating statement, and the\r\n  thrust of the defense was to attack the voluntariness of that statement.\r\nThe jury was charged on its duty to determine whether\r\n  petitioner made the statement, and whether the statement was given freely and\r\n  voluntarily.Â  After two hours of deliberation, the jury sent this note:\r\n\r\n  Can we\r\n    use the defendentâ€™s [sic] statement for one charge and not the other if we\r\n    think he was deceived prior to giving his statement?\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, the\r\n  court gave the following written response, without objection:\r\n\r\n  Yes -\r\n    if you find the statement was freely and voluntarily made as to one charge but\r\n    not the other.Â  \r\n  No - if\r\n    you find it was not freely and voluntarily made as to both charges.\r\n\r\nThe note was\r\n  received at 3:25 pm.Â  Some discussion ensued before the written note and answer\r\n  were sent back to the jury.Â  At 3:29 pm, the jury returned to the courtroom\r\n  with its verdict, finding petitioner guilty of armed robbery but acquitting him\r\n  of the murder charge.Â  Immediately after the jury was excused, trial counsel\r\n  asked for a new trial on the ground that the answer given was incorrect in that\r\n  a statement is either voluntary or involuntary in toto.Â  The motion was\r\n  denied. \r\nAt the PCR hearing,\r\n  petitioner contended trial counsel was ineffective in agreeing to the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s answer to the juryâ€™s inquiry.Â  Trial counsel testified that he was in\r\n  error in failing to object to the answer.Â  The PCR judge denied relief,\r\n  holding:\r\n\r\n  [Trial\r\n    judgeâ€™s] response to the jury question was a correct statement of South Carolina law concerning the voluntariness of a statement.Â  Counsel cannot be\r\n    ineffective for failing to raise an issue that is without merit.\r\n\r\nWe granted\r\n  certiorari to review this ruling.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the PCR judge err in failing to find petitionerâ€™s trial\r\n      counsel ineffective?\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn\r\n  order to obtain relief on a claim of ineffective assistance, the applicant must\r\n  demonstrate both that counselâ€™s performance fell below professional norms, and\r\n  that the applicant suffered prejudice as a result of counselâ€™s deficient\r\n  performance.Â  Prejudice is defined as a reasonable probability that had trial\r\n  counsel not been deficient, the result at trial would have been different.Â  E.g., Miller v. State, 379 S.C. 108, 665 S.E.2d 596 (2008).Â  Where a PCR\r\n  judgeâ€™s ruling is controlled by an error of law, this Court will reverse.Â  Council\r\n    v. State, 380 S.C. 159, 670 S.E.2d 356 (2008).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court erred in instructing the jury that a statement could be voluntary\r\n  as to one offense but involuntary as to another.Â  Further, the PCR judge\r\n  committed an error of law in holding this charge was a proper statement of law.Â \r\n  We find no evidence to support the PCR finding that counsel was not deficient\r\n  in agreeing to allow this answer to be given to the jury.Â  The nature of the\r\n  juryâ€™s inquiry, and its immediate return of a split verdict upon receiving the\r\n  answer, convinces us that the jury agreed there was an element of\r\n  involuntariness in petitionerâ€™s statement.Â  Under these circumstances,\r\n  petitioner has demonstrated the requisite prejudice, that is, a reasonable\r\n  probability that had the jury been instructed that a statement is either\r\n  voluntary or involuntary, it would have found petitionerâ€™s statement\r\n  involuntary and acquitted him of the armed robbery charge as well as the murder\r\n  charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  order denying petitioner PCR is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Frank Rogers Ellerbe, III","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2009-05-14-01","description":"This is an order placing a lawyer on interim suspension.","date":"2009-05-18","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Frank Rogers Ellerbe, III, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRespondent was arrested and charged with five (5) counts of  failing to file a state income tax return and failing to pay taxes in violation  of S.C.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Petitioners Raphael\r\n  Hernandez, Honorio Guerrero, and Alfredo Avila-Arjona were convicted of trafficking marijuana and sentenced\r\n  to twenty-five years imprisonment.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed Petitionersâ€™ convictions and sentences.Â  State\r\n    v. Hernandez, Op. No. 2007-UP-183 (S.C.\r\n  \r\n     \r\n  Ct. App. filed April 18, 2007).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthat decision and now reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAt a border crossing in Laredo, Texas, federal officials\r\n  stopped and searched an eighteen-wheeler tractor-trailer (â€œtractor-trailerâ€)\r\n  entering the United States from Mexico.Â  The officials discovered approximately 900 pounds of marijuana concealed\r\n  in a shipment of wooden furniture destined for Tienda DeLeon in Trenton, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Agents found the marijuana\r\n  compressed into bricks and hidden inside twenty-three wooden chimneys.Â  The officials seized the shipment, replaced\r\n  the driver with an undercover agent, and continued transporting it to\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South Carolina for a\r\n  controlled delivery.Â  \r\nWhen the tractor-trailer arrived at Tienda DeLeon,\r\n  Fredy DeLeon,[1] the\r\n  owner of the store, along with two other individuals who arrived at Tienda\r\n  DeLoen in a Ford Thunderbird unloaded several pieces of furniture.Â  The three men then directed the undercover\r\n  agents to transport the rest of the shipment to Billyâ€™s Super Store, also\r\n  located in Trenton. \r\nThe undercover agents drove the tractor-trailer to Billyâ€™s\r\n  Super Store as directed and parked it next to the loading bay.Â  After approximately twenty-five minutes, the\r\n  agents witnessed the same Thunderbird they saw at Tienda DeLeon drive past\r\n  Billyâ€™s Super Store and reappear a few minutes later along with a Ryder moving\r\n  truck (â€œthe Ryder truckâ€) driven by Petitioner Guerrero and with Petitioners Avila-Arjona\r\n  and Hernandez as passengers.Â  The\r\n  Thunderbird pulled beside the tractor-trailer, and the Ryder truck parked in\r\n  front of the tractor-trailer.Â  The\r\n  passenger of the Thunderbird exited the car and attempted to enter the cab of\r\n  the tractor-trailer, but the undercover agent indicated that he was not allowed\r\n  inside the tractor-trailer.Â  The\r\n  Thunderbird passenger then directed the undercover agents to follow him, while\r\n  the driver of the Thunderbird spoke with Petitioners who were still in the\r\n  Ryder truck.Â  The three vehicles formed a\r\n  caravan, with the Thunderbird leading, followed by the Ryder truck, and the\r\n  tractor-trailer in the rear.Â  \r\nThe caravan drove down a dirt road for a while.Â  Subsequently, the Ryder truck and the\r\n  tractor-trailer became stuck in the mud.Â  The undercover agents decided to call off the operation and promptly\r\n  arrested Petitioners.Â  The Thunderbird\r\n  drove away and the men were never apprehended.Â  The agents searched the Ryder truck and found the cargo portion of the\r\n  truck empty.Â  However, the agents\r\n  discovered a receipt indicating that Petitioner Guerrero rented the Ryder truck\r\n  the day before and a receipt from a motel for the night before the controlled\r\n  delivery took place.Â  \r\nPetitioners were indicted for trafficking\r\n  marijuana.Â  At trial, Petitioners moved\r\n  for a directed verdict claiming that the State had only proved mere presence at\r\n  the scene and had failed to prove the element of knowledge.Â  The trial court denied Petitionersâ€™ motion,\r\n  and the court of appeals affirmed, holding that there was substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence to send the case to the jury.Â  \r\nThis Court granted Petitionersâ€™ request for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and Petitioners present\r\n  the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the court of appeals err in affirming the trial\r\n    courtâ€™s denial of Petitionersâ€™ directed verdict motion because the State only\r\n    proved mere presence?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the\r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not\r\n  its weight. Â State v. Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict\r\n  when the state fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id. Â When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict,\r\n  an appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the\r\n  light most favorable to the State.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id. Â If there is any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, the Court must find the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.Â \r\n      \r\n     \r\n      Id.\r\n  at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioners argue the court of\r\n  appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of their motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  We agree. \r\nIn relevant part, South Carolinaâ€™s definition of trafficking\r\n  marijuana includes: â€œAny person . . . who is\r\n  knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly attempts to\r\n  become in actual or constructive possessionâ€ of ten pounds or more of\r\n  marijuana.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  In drug cases, the\r\n  element of knowledge is seldom established through direct evidence, but may be\r\n  proven circumstantially.Â  State v. Attardo, 263\r\n  S.C. 546, 550, 211 S.E.2d 868, 869 (1975).Â  Knowledge can be proven\r\n  by the evidence of acts, declarations, or conduct of the accused from which the\r\n  inference may be drawn that the accused knew of the existence of the prohibited\r\n  substances.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State presented two receipts indicating\r\n  that Petitioners traveled to Trenton for the night and rented the Ryder\r\n  truck.Â  The undercover agent testified\r\n  that Petitioners conversed with the driver of the Thunderbird before they\r\ncaravanned down the rural dirt road.Â  Additionally, the undercover\r\n  agent testified that in his experience, drug transactions this large are\r\n  typically handled within an â€œinner circleâ€ and all of the parties involved are\r\naware of what transpires.Â  \r\n\r\n In our view, this evidence does not\r\n  constitute substantial circumstantial evidence of knowledge.Â  The State failed to present evidence\r\n  connecting Petitioners to the tractor-trailer or to Fredy DeLeon or evidence\r\n  that Petitioners had knowledge of the contents of the tractor-trailer.Â  The State claims that it is â€œnonsensicalâ€ to\r\n  find that the Thunderbird occupants did not know Petitioners prior to this\r\n  transaction.Â  However, the State failed\r\n  to present any evidence such as acts, declarations, or specific conduct to\r\n  support this inference, and thus, we find that the conclusion that Petitioners\r\n  knew the Thunderbird occupants and therefore had knowledge of the drugs in the\r\n  tractor trailer is mere speculation.Â  Additionally, the State points to the testimony of the federal agents to\r\n  support the inference that Petitioners had knowledge of the drugs.Â  We find, however, that while these\r\n  testimonies may support such an inference, this evidence alone does not\r\n  constitute substantial circumstantial evidence that Petitioners had knowledge.Â  See State\r\n    v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001) (reversing the\r\n  defendantâ€™s conviction where the State did not present substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence and where the evidence merely raised a suspicion of\r\n  guilt).Â  \r\nAlthough Petitionersâ€™ actions may have\r\n  been suspicious, mere suspicion is insufficient to support the verdict.[2]Â  State v. Arnold, 361\r\n  S.C. 386, 605 S.E.2d 529 (2004)\r\n  (holding that the trial court must grant a directed verdict when the evidence\r\n  merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty).Â  Accordingly, we reverse Petitionersâ€™\r\n  convictions and sentences. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we reverse the\r\n  court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and James A. Spruill,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Fredy DeLeon was tried and convicted with\r\nPetitioners but is not a party in this appeal.Â  \r\n[2] The traditional circumstantial evidence charge\r\n  provides that when the State relies on circumstantial evidence to prove its\r\n  case, the jury may not convict the defendant unless:\r\n\r\n  Every circumstance relied upon by the State be proven\r\n    beyond a reasonable doubt; and . . . all of the circumstances so proven be\r\n    consistent with each other and taken together, point conclusively to the guilt\r\n    of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.\r\n\r\nState v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989).Â  Although in State\r\n  v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 475 (2004) the Court abandoned this charge and held that it may confuse a\r\n  jury by leading it to believe that the standard for measuring\r\n  circumstantial evidence is different from that for measuring direct evidence,\r\nit nonetheless illustrates the lack of evidence against Petitioners.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26655","title":"Ferguson v.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(a).Â  We granted certiorari.\r\nISSUE\r\nIs the one-year\r\n  statute of limitations set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(a) tolled by a\r\n  PCR applicantâ€™s mental incapacity?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-45(a) provides:\r\n\r\n  (A) An\r\n    application for relief filed pursuant to this chapter must be filed within one\r\n    year after the entry of a judgment of conviction or within one year after the\r\n    sending of the remittitur to the lower court from an appeal or the filing of\r\n    the final decision upon an appeal, whichever is later.\r\n\r\nPeloquin v. State, 321 S.C. 468, 469 S.E.2d 606 (1996).\r\nThe PCR court held\r\n  the one-year statute of limitations was not tolled by an applicantâ€™s mental\r\n  incompetency, citing our opinion in Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 782 (2004).Â  In Council, we addressed whether PCR proceedings of\r\n  a mentally incompetent applicant should be indefinitely stayed until\r\n  such time as the applicant regained competency.Â  We held collateral review of the\r\n  trial proceedings should not be delayed due to the applicantâ€™s incompetency.Â \r\n  359 S.C. at 129, 597 S.E.2d at 787.Â  The basis for our holding was that the\r\n  issues on PCR were not â€œextraordinarily fact intensiveâ€ and did not require\r\n  Councilâ€™s assistance.Â  Accordingly, Councilâ€™s incompetent state did not prevent\r\n  the PCR court from proceeding on those issues.Â  We went on to note, however, that\r\n  â€œif, at a future date, the petitioner regains his competency and discovers that\r\n  at his original PCR hearing, his incompetency prevented his ability to assist\r\n  his counsel on a fact-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he may\r\n  then raise that claim in a subsequent proceeding.â€Â  Id.[3]Â  \r\nThe State and Ferguson fervently dispute the import of the Courtâ€™s holding in Council.[4]Â \r\n  In light of the language a PCR applicantâ€™s mental incompetency does not delay\r\n  collateral proceedings, the State interprets Council to mean that the\r\n  statute of limitations is not tolled during incompetency.Â  Ferguson, on the\r\n  other hand, contends the holding in Council that a mentally\r\n  incompetent applicant who later regains competence will have an opportunity to raise fact-based issues at a later date, is an implicit holding that the\r\n  statute of limitations is tolled.Â Â Â  \r\nUnlike Council,\r\n  the issue here is not whether PCR proceedings should be stayed by virtue\r\n  of Fergusonâ€™s alleged incompetency but, rather, whether or not the time in\r\n  which to file an application for PCR is tolled.Â  \r\nThere is a split of\r\n  authority as to whether the statute of limitations to file a PCR action is\r\n  tolled by mental incompetency.Â  It has been held that while an ongoing mental\r\n  incompetence may warrant equitable tolling, â€œa claim of mental incompetence\r\n  does not constitute a per se reason to toll a statute of limitations. .\r\n  . . Rather, the critical inquiry remains whether the circumstances preventing a\r\n  petitioner from making a timely filing were both beyond the petitioner's\r\n  control and unavoidable despite due diligence.â€Â  Com. v. Carneal, ___\r\n  S.W.3d ___ (Ky. 2008), internal citations omitted; Nara v. Frank,\r\n  264 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir.2001), overruled on other grounds by Carey\r\n    v. Saffold, 536 U .S. 214 (2002) (mental incompetence may warrant equitable\r\n  tolling where alleged mental incompetence has affected petitionerâ€™s ability to\r\n  timely file); State v. Nix, 40 S.W.3d 459 (Tenn. 2001) (due process\r\n  requires tolling of PCR statute of limitations only if petitioner is unable to\r\n  manage his affairs or understand his legal rights and liabilities); Seals v.\r\n    Tennessee, 23 S.W.3d 272, 277 (Tenn. 2000) (due process considerations may\r\n  toll statute of limitations if mentally incompetent petitioner was denied the\r\n  opportunity to bring a claim in a â€œmeaningful time and mannerâ€).Â  But see Allen v. State, ___ So.2d___ (Miss. App. 2008), citing House\r\n    v. State, 754 So2d 1147 (Miss. 1999) (holding there is no authority to toll\r\n  statute of limitations based on mental incompetence).Â  \r\nAlthough we have\r\n  not specifically addressed tolling the statute of limitations in the context of\r\n  mentally incompetent PCR applicants,[5] case law warrants a holding that, in circumstances in which an applicant\r\n  demonstrates the failure to timely file for PCR was due to mental incompetency,\r\n  the statute should be tolled.Â Â  \r\nIn Odom v. State,\r\n  337 S.C. 256, 523 S.E.2d 753 (1999), we held the one year statute of\r\n  limitations of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A), does not apply to Austin v.\r\n    State[6] appeals.Â  In Austin, counsel failed to file a timely appeal following\r\n  the denial of the petitionerâ€™s PCR application. He filed a subsequent PCR\r\n  application claiming ineffective assistance of counsel during his first\r\n  application for PCR. Â We remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine\r\n  whether petitioner requested and was denied the right to appeal.Â  We held Austin appeals need not be filed within the one year statute of limitations because\r\n  they are belated appeals intended to correct unjust procedural defects.Â  â€œUnder\r\n  the PCR rules, an applicant is entitled to a full adjudication on the merits of\r\n  the original petition, or â€œone bite at the apple.â€Â  Odom, 337\r\n  S.C. at 261, 523 S.E.2d at 755, citing Aice v. State, 305 S.C.\r\n  448, 452, 409 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1991) (emphasis added).\r\nThe rule of Odom and Austin was extended in Wilson v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 559\r\n  S.E.2d 581 (2002).Â  In Wilson, we held every defendant has a right to\r\n  file a direct appeal and one PCR application.Â  There, since counsel had been\r\n  ineffective in failing to file an appeal, and the statute of limitations in\r\n  which to file for PCR had expired, we held â€œpolicy would be frustrated if the\r\n  one year statute of limitations for PCR claims applied where the applicant was\r\n  denied his direct appeal due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and then was\r\n  denied his right to a PCR application because of the one year statute of\r\n  limitations.â€Â  Id. at 218, 559 S.E.2d at 583.Â  \r\nThe same policy\r\n  considerations are applicable here.Â  If Ferguson was prevented from filing for\r\n  PCR by reason of his mental incompetency, then he has not, and will not,\r\n  receive his one full bite at the apple.Â  Accordingly, we find the proper remedy\r\n  is to remand to the PCR court for a hearing as to whether Fergusonâ€™s mental\r\n  incapacity prevented such an application in the one year following his 1996\r\n  guilty plea.Â  If the PCR court finds mental incompetence prevented his filing a\r\n  PCR application, the court should determine the duration of the incompetence,\r\n  and whether the application was filed within one year of Ferguson regaining\r\n  competency.Â  PCR should proceed only if Fergusonâ€™s application was timely filed\r\n  within one year of the date that he regained competence.Â  \r\nREMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We reinstated the appeal and granted\r\n  certiorari.\r\n[2]Â  Ferguson was 18 years old at the time of his 1996 plea.Â  He has a history of mental\r\n  illness, bi-polar disorder, and has an IQ of 76.Â  \r\n[3]Â  We recently held a mentally incompetent capital\r\n  defendant could not waive his right to pursue PCR.Â  Hughes v. State, 367\r\n  S.C. 389, 626 S.E.2d 805 (2006).\r\n[4]Â  Initially, the State contends there is no\r\n  evidence of incompetence subsequent to Fergusonâ€™s 1996 plea.Â  However, that\r\n  matter was not addressed at PCR and no hearing held on that claim inasmuch as\r\n  the court held the statute of limitations barred his action.Â  \r\n[5] Â In Norris v. State, 335 S.C. 30, 515\r\n  S.E.2d 523 (1999), we found it unnecessary to address whether mental\r\n  incompetency tolled the statute of limitations for PCR applications.\r\n[6] Â 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26656","title":"Blackburn v.

Andrews, of Charleston, for Amicus Curiae City of Charleston.\r\n        Jeffrey\r\n          A. Lehrer, of Ford &amp; Harrison, of Spartanburg, for Amicus Curiae City of Spartanburg.\r\n        Shahin\r\n          Vafai and Linda Pearce Edwards, both of Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae Municipal Association of South Carolina.\r\n        W.\r\n          A. Nickles, III, of Gergel Nickles &amp; Solomon, of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae City of Columbia.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  In this declaratory judgment action, appellant Daufuskie Island\r\n  Fire District directly appeals from the Master-in-Equityâ€™s decision that under\r\n  the emergency leave portion of the South Carolina military leave statute,\r\n  â€œthirty daysâ€ means thirty work days, as opposed to thirty calendar days.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS[1]\r\nAppellant is a Special Purpose Tax District within Beaufort County which provides fire protection services to the residents of Daufuskie Island.Â  Appellant employed respondent, James C. Blackburn, as a firefighter from\r\n  July 2002 until his resignation in December 2005.Â  Respondentâ€™s normal work\r\n  schedule as a firefighter consisted of 24-hours on duty, followed by 48-hours\r\n  off duty (â€œ24/48â€).Â  Respondentâ€™s 24-hour working period would begin at 8:15\r\n  a.m. on one calendar day, and conclude at 8:15 a.m. the following day.Â \r\n  Generally, respondent worked ten 24-hour shifts per month.\r\nRespondent was compensated every two weeks, for a total of 26\r\n  times per year.Â  The 24/48 schedule meant that respondent would work 120 hours\r\n  for two pay periods in a row, and then 96 hours for the next consecutive pay\r\n  period.Â  Nonetheless, appellantâ€™s pay practices provided for uniform payments\r\n  every two weeks equivalent to pay for 112 hours, i.e., the average hours worked\r\n  over the course of three pay periods.[2]Â  \r\nIn addition to being a firefighter, respondent is a sergeant in\r\n  the United States Air Force Reserve.Â  While employed by appellant, respondent\r\n  had a number of work absences due to his military duties.Â  Some of these\r\n  military absences were for annual training, i.e., regular military leave, but\r\n  others were for tours of active duty, considered emergency leave.\r\nRespondent\r\n  filed a declaratory action seeking a determination that under the South Carolina military leave statute, he was entitled to be paid for 30 work days of\r\n  emergency military leave.Â  The parties filed cross-motions for summary\r\n  judgment, and the Master found in respondentâ€™s favor.Â  Specifically, the Master\r\n  ruled that under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-7-90, respondent was entitled to 30 work days\r\n  of emergency leave, and the measure of respondentâ€™s work day was â€œhis usual 24-hour\r\n  shift.â€[3]\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Master err in ruling that the â€œthirty additional daysâ€ of\r\n    emergency leave provided under S.C. Code Ann Â§ 8-7-90 refers to 30 work days as\r\n    opposed to 30 calendar days?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the Master erred in interpreting the emergency\r\n  leave provision of section 8-7-90.Â  Appellant contends that for this portion of\r\n  the statute, the phrase â€œthirty additional daysâ€ means thirty calendar days.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the legislature.Â  E.g., Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79,\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581&nbsp;(2000).Â  Moreover, â€œ[w]ords must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s\r\n  operation.â€Â  Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 499, 640 S.E.2d 457,\r\n  459&nbsp;(2007). \r\nThe\r\n  statute regarding public employeesâ€™ payment for military leave has evolved over\r\n  the years.Â  Prior to a 1990 amendment, section 8-7-90 read as follows:\r\n\r\n  All\r\n    officers and employees of this State or a political subdivision of this State\r\n    who are either enlisted or commissioned members of the South Carolina National\r\n    Guard, the United States Naval Reserve, the Officers Reserve Corps, or the\r\n    Enlisted Reserve Corps, the Reserve Corps of the Marines, the Coast Guard\r\n    Reserve and the United States Air Force Reserve shall be entitled to leave of\r\n    absence from their respective duties without loss of pay, time, or efficiency\r\n    rating for a period not exceeding fifteen days in any one year during\r\n    which they may be engaged in training or other such duties ordered by the\r\n    Governor, the War Department, the Treasury Department, the Navy Department, or\r\n    the Air Force Department.Â  In the event any such person is called upon to\r\n      serve during an emergency he shall be entitled to such leave of absence for not\r\n      exceeding thirty additional days. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-7-90\r\n  (1986) (emphasis added). \r\nThe\r\n  current version, which reflects the 1990 amendment, provides as follows: \r\n\r\n  All\r\n    officers and employees of this State or a political subdivision of this State\r\n    who are either enlisted or commissioned members of the South Carolina National\r\n    Guard, the United States Army Reserve, the United States Air Force Reserve, the\r\n    United States Naval Reserve, the United States Marine Corps Reserve, or the\r\n    United States Coast Guard Reserve are entitled to leaves of absence from their\r\n    respective duties without loss of pay, time, or efficiency rating for one or\r\n      more periods not exceeding an aggregate of fifteen regularly scheduled work\r\n        days in any one year during which they may engage in training or any other\r\n    duties ordered by the Governor, the Department of Defense, the Department of\r\n    the Army, the Department of the Air Force, the Department of the Navy, the\r\n    Department of the Treasury, or any other department or agency of the government\r\n    of the United States having authority to issue lawful orders requiring military\r\n    service.Â  Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays may not be included in the\r\n      fifteen-day aggregate unless the particular Saturday, Sunday, or holiday to be\r\n      included is a regularly scheduled work day for the officer or employee\r\n      involved.Â  In the event any such person is called upon to serve during an\r\n      emergency he is entitled to such leave of absence for not exceeding thirty additional\r\n      days. \r\n  As used in this section, â€˜in any one yearâ€™\r\n    means either a calendar year or, in the case of members required to perform\r\n    active duty for training or other duties within or on a fiscal year basis, the\r\n    fiscal year of the National Guard or reserve component issuing the orders. \r\n  The provisions of this section must be\r\n    construed liberally to encourage and\r\n    allow full participation in all aspects of the National Guard and reserve\r\n    programs of the armed forces of the United States and to allow state officers\r\n    and employees who are enlisted or commissioned members of the National Guard or\r\n    reserve components to excel in military and emergency preparedness and service\r\n    by taking full advantage of all career-enhancing assignments and training\r\n    opportunities.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-7-90 (Supp.\r\n  2008) (emphasis added).[4]\r\nThus, before 1990,\r\n  the language of the statute simply stated that employees were entitled to a\r\n  leave of absence â€œfor a period not exceeding fifteen days in any one\r\n  year.â€ Â Â§ 8-7-90 (1986) (emphasis added).Â  Significantly, the 1990 amendment\r\n  made the following changes:Â  (1) modified the above phrase to â€œfor one or more periods not exceeding an aggregate of fifteen regularly scheduled work days;â€ (2) added the sentence specifying\r\n  that weekends and holidays are not to be included in the 15-day\r\n  aggregate (unless these days are â€œregularly scheduled workâ€ days); and (3)\r\n  added express language that the statute is to be construed liberally to\r\n  encourage and allow full participation in all aspects of the military\r\n  reserves.Â  The 1990 amendment did not fundamentally change the sentence\r\n  concerning â€œemergencyâ€ leave.\r\nAppellant maintains\r\n  that because the Legislature only changed â€œdaysâ€ to â€œwork daysâ€ in the\r\n  sentences expressly relating to the aggregate 15-day â€œregularâ€ training period,\r\n  the word â€œdaysâ€ in the emergency leave sentence does not mean work days, but\r\n  instead means calendar days.Â  In our opinion, however, a plain, unforced\r\n  reading of the statute actually points to the opposite conclusion.Â  See Sloan\r\n    v. Hardee, supra.\r\nThe\r\n  first sentence of the statute speaks of an employeeâ€™s entitlement to military\r\n  â€œleaves of absences.â€Â  While that sentence goes on to discuss â€œregularâ€ leaves\r\n  of absences, the final sentence of the first paragraph refers to emergency\r\n  leave, and then states that an employee is â€œentitled to such leave of\r\n  absence for not exceeding thirty additional days.â€Â  Â§ 8-7-90 (Supp.\r\n  2008) (emphasis added). The phrase, â€œsuch leave,â€ plainly means the type of\r\n  leave the statute has already discussed earlier in the same paragraph;\r\n  namely, a military leave of absence based upon regularly scheduled work days.[5]Â  \r\nAppellant also contends\r\n  that the majority of state jurisdictions facing this issue have found that the\r\n  word â€œdaysâ€ in the military leave statute refers to â€œcalendar days.â€Â  As\r\n  pointed out by the Master, however, these authorities weigh in favor of\r\n  respondentâ€™s position because those state statutes use the unmodified â€œdays,â€\r\n  whereas South Carolinaâ€™s statute speaks in terms of â€œwork days.â€Â  See, e.g., Koppin v. Strode, 761 N.E.2d 455&nbsp;(Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (rejecting\r\n  firefightersâ€™ argument that a day should be based on a 24-hour shift, and\r\n  instead interpreting 15 days in the military leave statute as 15 eight-hour\r\n  days); Painters and Allied Trades Local Union 246 v. City of Des Moines,\r\n  451 N.W.2d 825, 826&nbsp;(Iowa 1990) (holding that statute which allows municipal\r\n  employees a leave of absence for military service â€œwithout loss of pay during\r\n  the first thirty days of such leave of absenceâ€ meant calendar days, not\r\n  working days); Glass v. City of Lynn, 729 N.E.2d 1136 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n  2000) (rejecting police officerâ€™s claim that statute entitling paid military\r\n  leave for 17 â€œdaysâ€ did not allow compensation for seventeen work days); Smith v. School Dist. No. 1, 578 P.2d 820 (Or. Ct. App. 1978) (holding that\r\n  the state statute entitling public employees to paid military leave for â€œa\r\n  period not exceeding 15 daysâ€ meant no more than 15 consecutive calendar days).\r\n In contrast, those\r\n  jurisdictions where the statute expressly defines military leave by work days\r\n  have interpreted firefightersâ€™ claims just as the Master did in this case.Â  For\r\n  example, Nebraskaâ€™s statute expressly allows for paid military leave for up to\r\n  15 â€œworkdaysâ€ in any one calendar year.Â  In Hall v. City of Omaha, 663\r\n  N.W.2d 97 (Neb. 2003), the Nebraska Supreme Court found that a firefighterâ€™s\r\n  workday is equivalent to his 24-hour shift.Â  The court explained its reasoning\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  In order\r\n    to best promote military service and to afford the greatest percentage of\r\n    employees paid military leave without loss of pay, we define the term\r\n    â€œworkday,â€ for purposes of military leave, to mean any 24-hour period in which\r\n    work is done. Any other construction would penalize an employee for working a\r\n    shift which overlaps the midnight hour and thus may discourage military\r\n    service. To construe the term â€œworkday,â€ as the district court did in this\r\n    case, to mean the 24-hour period from midnight to midnight thwarts the clear\r\n    intent of the Legislature. The court's interpretation penalizes the\r\n    firefighters, not for working 24-hour shifts, but, rather, for having the shift\r\n    extend over the midnight hour. \r\n\r\nId. at 101.Â  The Minnesota Court of Appeals has also\r\n  interpreted its military leave statute as compensating firefighters for 24-hour\r\n  shifts.Â  See Howe v. City of St. Cloud, 515 N.W.2d 77 (Minn. Ct.\r\n  App. 1994) (holding that where the state statute entitles public employees to\r\n  15 days of paid military leave, a day should be defined as a 24-hour day\r\n  because the firefightersâ€™ shifts missed while on military leave were each 24\r\n  hours long).\r\nGiven the\r\n  Legislatureâ€™s mandate that Â§ 8-7-90 be construed liberally, we believe that the\r\n  term â€œdaysâ€ as used in the emergency leave provision means â€œwork days,â€ and\r\n  therefore, we affirm the Masterâ€™s holding below.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,Â \r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties entered into a stipulation of facts.\r\n[2] Respondent was paid by the hour.\r\n[3] The Master also found that for regular military\r\n  leave, respondent was entitled to payment for 15 work days.Â  The only issue on\r\n  appeal, however, is with respect to the emergency leave provision under Â§\r\n8-7-90.\r\n[4] Due to a 2008 amendment, a new version of the statute\r\n  will take effect July 1, 2009.Â  The new version provides for yet another 30\r\n  days of military leave if the employee is serving active duty in a combat\r\n    zone.Â  The 2008 amendment adds the following paragraph, to be located after\r\n  the first paragraph of the statute:\r\n\r\n  A state employee in a full time position\r\n    who serves on active duty in a combat zone and who has exhausted all available\r\n    leave for military purposes is entitled to receive up to thirty additional days\r\n    of military leave in any one year. \r\n\r\nÂ§ 8-7-90 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  \r\n[5] The Masterâ€™s well-reasoned order aptly explained this\r\npoint as follows:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    only sensible meaning of â€œadditionalâ€ here is more of the same kind.Â  The unit\r\n    of leave is the employeeâ€™s regularly scheduled work day, the same for regular\r\n    training leave as for active duty leave.Â  If the general assembly had meant to\r\n    change the unit of measurement for emergency leave, surely it would have said\r\n    so. \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
