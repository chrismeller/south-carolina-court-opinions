(1) \r\n  Faile v. S.C. Dep't of Juvenile Justice, Op. No. 99-UP-1811 (S.C. Ct. \r\n  App. filed June 9, 1999). We affirm in result and remand.\r\n\r\n    FACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nOn April 15, 1993, Fredrico R. (&quot;Fredrico&quot;), \r\n  age 12, violently assaulted Brandon Chase Faile, the nine-year old son of Dexter \r\n  and Lesa Faile (&quot;Respondents&quot;). Fredrico was a juvenile delinquent \r\n  on probation at the time of the attack, with nine prior referrals to DJJ on \r\n  his record.\r\nIn February 1992, Fredrico was charged in the Family \r\n  Court of Chester County with grand larceny of a bicycle. After pleading guilty, \r\n  Fredrico was committed by Judge Barrineau to the DJJ Reception and Evaluation \r\n  Center (&quot;R&amp;E&quot;) for the purpose of evaluation and recommendation \r\n  for disposition.\r\nR&amp;E expressed concern over Fredrico's aggressive \r\n  behavior, recognizing he was impulsive and explosive at times. After receiving \r\n  the R&amp;E's recommendation, Judge Barrineau, in April 1992, ordered continued \r\n  probation for one year, a suspended commitment to DJJ, 25 community service \r\n  hours, placement in a therapeutic foster home, and counseling sessions for Fredrico's \r\n  parents.\r\nFredrico was placed in a new foster home in January \r\n  1993. However, on April 7, 1993, he was expelled from that home for stealing \r\n  a knife and gun from a school police officer. He used the gun to threaten his \r\n  foster mother. Max Dorsey (&quot;Dorsey&quot;), Fredrico's DJJ probation counselor, \r\n  removed him from the foster home and placed him in the Greenville Group Home \r\n  for the night of April 7, 1993. Dorsey placed Fredrico with his biological mother \r\n  on April 8, 1993, claiming that no alternative placement was available for Fredrico.\r\nFive days after placing Fredrico \r\n  with his biological mother, Dorsey filed a Rule to Show Cause with the Family \r\n  Court to have Fredrico brought before the judge to show why his probation should \r\n  not be revoked. Judge Barrineau signed the Rule and scheduled a hearing for \r\n  April 21, 1993. Dorsey told the judge Fredrico had been expelled from his foster \r\n  home where he was temporarily staying with his family, and Dorsey intended to \r\n  recommend Fredrico be committed to DJJ. Dorsey failed to inform the judge the \r\n  placement violated the earlier court order. Judge Barrineau did not indicate \r\n  he knew the placement violated his earlier order. Dorsey did not request a modification \r\n  of the earlier order. On April 15, 1993, before the hearing \r\n  was held, Fredrico assaulted Brandon Faile.\r\nRespondents instituted this action against DJJ, \r\n  alleging DJJ was grossly negligent in placing Fredrico in his family home, and \r\n  claiming damages of $64,000.00. DJJ moved for summary judgment. The trial court \r\n  granted DJJ's motion on the ground that DJJ was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(1) (Supp. 2001). Respondents appealed.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, \r\n  holding a question of fact remained whether the trial judge ratified Dorsey's \r\n  administrative act (placing Fredrico at home), thereby converting it into a \r\n  judicial act entitling DJJ to quasi-judicial immunity.\r\nDJJ petitioned for certiorari, asserting the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment. The \r\n  following issues are before us on certiorari:\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in failing to recognize \r\n    that DJJ was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity under the South Carolina \r\n    Tort Claims Act because Dorsey's placement of Fredrico in his family home \r\n    was a judicial act?\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in refusing to \r\n    consider DJJ's additional sustaining grounds?\r\n  Is the trial court's decision to grant summary \r\n    judgment supported by the following additional sustaining grounds:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    DJJ is not the proper party to the lawsuit;\r\n    DJJ is entitled to discretionary immunity \r\n      under the Tort Claims Act;\r\n    DJJ is entitled to immunity under the juvenile \r\n      release exception to the Tort Claims Act; or\r\n    DJJ did not owe a duty of care to Respondents' \r\n      child.\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nI. Quasi-Judicial Immunity\r\nA. Judicial Act Requirement\r\nDJJ argues Dorsey's placement of Fredrico in his \r\n  family home was a judicial act for which he was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, \r\n  and therefore the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's grant \r\n  of summary judgment to DJJ. We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law. Bishop v. South Carolina Dep't of Mental \r\n  Health, 331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998). In determining whether a genuine \r\n  question of fact exists, the court must view the evidence and all inferences \r\n  which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party. Id. The governmental entity claiming an exception \r\n  to the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act has the burden of establishing \r\n  any limitation on liability. Strange v. S. C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. \r\n  Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994). Provisions establishing limitations \r\n  on liability must be liberally construed in the State's favor. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-20(f) (Supp. 2001).\r\nThe issue of whether juvenile probation officers \r\n  are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity under the Tort Claims Act is one of \r\n  first impression in South Carolina. Section 15-78-60(1) provides: &quot;the \r\n  governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from: legislative, judicial, \r\n  or quasi-judicial action or inaction.&quot; In addition to the judicial immunity \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act, common law judicial immunity was expressly preserved \r\n  in South Carolina under the Tort Claims Act. O'Laughlin v. Windham, 330 \r\n  S.C. 379, 498 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied 1999 Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 10 at p. iv.\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes three exceptions to judicial \r\n  or quasi-judicial immunity. Judges and other officials are not entitled to judicial \r\n  immunity if: (1) they did not have jurisdiction to act; (2) the act did not \r\n  serve a judicial function; or (3) the suit is for prospective, injunctive relief \r\n  only. Id. at 385, 498 S.E.2d at 692. The second exception, which emphasizes \r\n  the importance of the act, as opposed to the actor, is relevant here. Under \r\n  the second exception, even judges are not insulated by judicial immunity when \r\n  they act in an administrative capacity. Id. (citing Forrester v. White, \r\n  484 U.S. 219, 108 S. Ct. 538, 98 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1988)). In determining whether \r\n  an act is judicial, the Court looks to the nature and function of the act. Id.; \r\n  Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 112 S. Ct. 286, 116 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1991); \r\n  Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 98 S. Ct. 1099, 55 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1978). \r\n  (2) Therefore, we must determine whether probation officer Dorsey's \r\n  placement of Fredrico had the nature and function of a judicial act, thereby \r\n  entitling him, and thus DJJ, to quasi-judicial immunity.\r\nMuch of the analysis of judicial immunity has been \r\n  made in the federal arena. Several federal circuits have granted probation officers \r\n  quasi-judicial immunity, but only when carrying out certain functions the courts \r\n  have deemed to be judicial. The Tenth Circuit has held that federal probation \r\n  officers are absolutely immune when the action challenged is &quot;intimately \r\n  associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.&quot; Tripati \r\n  v. United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., 784 F.2d 345 (10th \r\n  Cir. 1986) (finding probation officer immune for damages resulting from reporting \r\n  plaintiff's conviction to immigration authorities). The Tenth Circuit has made \r\n  clear the immunity arises from protected functions, not from protected individuals. \r\n  Mee v. Ortega, 967 F.2d 423 (10th Cir. 1992); Forrester, supra. \r\n  The key element is whether the officer was engaged in adjudicatory duties when \r\n  the challenged act occurred. Harper v. Jeffries, 808 F.2d 281 (3d Cir. \r\n  1986).\r\nOther federal circuit courts have granted probation \r\n  officers absolute immunity in preparing pre-sentencing reports, and in other \r\n  situations when they act &quot;as an arm of the court.&quot; Gant v. United \r\n  States Probation Office, 994 F. Supp. 729, 733 (S.D. W. Va. 1998) (citations \r\n  omitted). Many of these courts, however, find no absolute immunity for the same \r\n  type of officer when the officer is acting in his executive capacity. Gant, \r\n  supra; Ray v. Pickett, 734 F.2d 370 (8th Cir. 1984); Ortega, \r\n  supra; see also Harper v. Jeffries, 808 F.2d 281 \r\n  (3d Cir. 1986) (denying absolute immunity of probation officer for charging \r\n  appellant and presenting evidence against him at a parole hearing, because those \r\n  were his duties as a parole officer).\r\nIf the individual is acting pursuant to a direct \r\n  court order, courts are more likely to grant quasi-judicial immunity for that \r\n  action. In Babcock v. Tyler, 884 F.2d 497 (9th Cir. 1989), a father sued \r\n  the state for the actions of two social workers who placed his daughters in \r\n  a home where they were sexually abused. The social workers placed the girls \r\n  temporarily in the abusive home in April 1982. Id. at 449. The juvenile \r\n  court confirmed the placement by order in May 1982. The sexual abuse did not \r\n  occur until sometime after May. Id. Plaintiffs argued the social workers \r\n  were not entitled to immunity for the temporary placement of the girls before \r\n  the court order was issued. The court discounted this argument as irrelevant, \r\n  however, on the grounds the abuse did not occur until after \r\n  the court had confirmed the placement. Id.\r\nRespondents argue the court's confirmation of the \r\n  placement was essential to the court's finding of judicial immunity in Babcock. \r\n  Conversely, DJJ cites Babcock as holding that placement is a judicial \r\n  act even if not made pursuant to a direct court order. DJJ's argument, however, \r\n  overlooks that the judge formally confirmed the placement before \r\n  the injury took place. In the present case, Judge Barrineau's mere knowledge \r\n  that Fredrico was placed in his family's home, in the absence of any further \r\n  act by him, does not amount to confirmation or ratification of Dorsey's act.\r\nViewing the facts and all inferences that can be \r\n  drawn in the light most favorable to Respondents, as the non-moving party, the \r\n  trial court erred in granting summary judgment to DJJ on this ground. We agree \r\n  with our Court of Appeals' conclusion that the placement of juveniles by a probation \r\n  counselor is an administrative function. We find persuasive the precedent discussed \r\n  above from other jurisdictions which supports this analysis. Just as police \r\n  officers are not granted absolute immunity when they apply for arrest warrants, \r\n  probation officers generally are not immune in performing their enforcement \r\n  duties. See Gant, supra; Acevedo v. Pima County Adult \r\n  Prob. Dep't, 690 P.2d 38 (Ariz. 1984)(holding that supervision of probationers \r\n  is an administrative task, unconnected with the performance of a judicial function). \r\n  Dorsey's placement of Fredrico was administrative. The Family Court's mere knowledge \r\n  that Dorsey placed Fredrico with his family, without more, is insufficient to \r\n  convert that placement into a judicial act.\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, we conclude DJJ is not \r\n  entitled to quasi-judicial immunity.\r\nB. Agent of the Court\r\nDJJ argues a juvenile probation officer acts as \r\n  an agent and representative of the Family Court, and, therefore, Dorsey's placement \r\n  of Fredrico was a quasi-judicial act entitling him to immunity under the Tort \r\n  Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(1). We disagree.\r\nDJJ cites Fleming v. Asbill, 326 S.C. 49, \r\n  483 S.E.2d 751 (1997), for the proposition that &quot;non-judicial officers \r\n  are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for carrying out a function assigned \r\n  by the court.&quot; In Fleming, we granted absolute judicial immunity \r\n  to a court-appointed guardian ad litem based on common law theories. Id. \r\n  This Court did not apply the Tort Claims Act in Fleming because we found \r\n  the guardian ad litem was not an employee of the state as defined by section \r\n  15-78-30(c) of the Act. We held, however, that common law judicial immunity \r\n  protected the guardian from liability in the performance of her official duties, \r\n  despite a line of cases holding guardians ad litem liable for negligence. Id.; \r\n  see McIver v. Thompson, 117 S.C. 175, 108 S.E. 411 (1921). We \r\n  distinguished those cases based on the dramatically different role of court-appointed \r\n  guardians ad litem in child custody suits today. Fleming, supra.\r\nIn Fleming, this Court based the grant of \r\n  immunity for court-appointed guardians on the necessity for guardians to be \r\n  able to act without fear of lawsuits as well as the inequity of holding guardians \r\n  liable for negligence. DJJ argues that the guardians were awarded immunity merely \r\n  for being representatives of the court. Although we indicated the guardians \r\n  were representatives of the court, it was not the decisive factor in our decision \r\n  to grant guardians immunity. A primary role of the guardian is to be an advocate \r\n  within the courtroom. However, guardians are not &quot;acting on 'behalf' of \r\n  the court; [they] do not affect legal relationships between the court and third \r\n  parties.&quot; Fleming, 326 S.C. at 53. Their job is to represent their \r\n  ward's interest before the court, unlike probation officers whose duties extend \r\n  far beyond the courtroom.\r\nAdditionally, the role of a court-appointed guardian \r\n  is distinguishable from the role of a DJJ probation officer because the guardian's \r\n  participation ends when the court renders its decision. The DJJ officer's role \r\n  does not. Instead, the officer is essentially charged with executing the court's \r\n  orders. While the officer may be entitled to judicial immunity when executing \r\n  those orders, the present case involves an officer who, at least for summary \r\n  judgment purposes, deviated from the explicit terms of the order.\r\nFor these reasons, we decline to hold that DJJ \r\n  is entitled to summary judgment for judicial immunity as an agent of the Family \r\n  Court.\r\nII. Additional Grounds\r\nAdditional grounds are raised to support the trial \r\n  court's granting of summary judgment. Though we are not required to do so we \r\n  address each in the interest of judicial economy. Our conclusions are based \r\n  upon the facts before us and the parties are not precluded from further development \r\n  of the issues we address.\r\nA. Proper Party\r\nDJJ contends the Family Court, not DJJ, is the \r\n  proper party to this litigation. DJJ argues Dorsey was not acting on its behalf, \r\n  but on behalf of the family court since the court retained authority over Fredrico. \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act requires a plaintiff to sue \r\n  &quot;only the agency . . . for which the employee was acting.&quot; S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§15-78-70(c) (Supp. 2001). An agency is defined as the state entity &quot;which \r\n  employs the employee whose act or omission gives rise to a claim.&quot; S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(a) (Supp. 2001). There is no disagreement Dorsey's actions \r\n  gave rise to this claim. The question is whether Dorsey was acting on behalf \r\n  of the family court or DJJ.\r\nAs discussed above, this Court in Fleming, \r\n  supra, determined whether a guardian ad litem was an employee under the \r\n  Tort Claims Act. The Court held that while the guardian is appointed as a court \r\n  representative to assist the court, it is &quot;not acting on 'behalf' of the \r\n  court.&quot; Id. at 53, 483 S.E.2d at 753. &quot;The relationship between \r\n  the Court and a guardian ad litem is not an agency relationship&quot; nor an \r\n  &quot;employee-employer relationship.&quot; Id. Like a guardian ad litem, \r\n  the juvenile probation officer is characterized as an &quot;agent of the court.&quot; \r\n  (3) Like the guardian, the probation officer is not acting on behalf \r\n  of the family court, but is there to assist the court. The probation officer \r\n  is responsible for conducting investigations, providing relevant information \r\n  to the court, and taking charge of a child if ordered by the court. See \r\n  id.\r\nA probation officer is an employee of DJJ, not \r\n  the family court. This Court in Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 32, 180 \r\n  S.E.2d 648, 649 (1971), there are four factors used to determine whether a person \r\n  is an employee of a particular entity. The factors are: (1) who has the right \r\n  to control the person; (2) who pays the person; (3) who furnishes the person \r\n  with equipment; and (4) who has the right to fire the person. While a court \r\n  may direct a probation officer to assist in aiding the court in its adjudication \r\n  of a case, DJJ also has the right to control the actions of probation officers \r\n  who are its employees. (4) DJJ does not deny \r\n  it pays Dorsey, furnishes him with the equipment needed to perform his job, \r\n  and has the ability to discharge him. DJJ argues, however, that since probation \r\n  officers are agents of the court, they are controlled by it. While the family \r\n  court has a right to direct a probation officer to perform certain tasks, this \r\n  fact alone is not dispositive of whether Dorsey is an employee of the court. \r\n  See Simmons v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 428, 409 S.E.2d 381 (1991). \r\n  More important is the Fleming rule that the court &quot;agent&quot; is \r\n  assisting the court, but is not acting as a true agent on its behalf.\r\nIt is also important to look at the plain meaning\r\nof sections 15-78-70(c) and 15-78-30(a). In attempting to harmonize the two\r\nsections, we determine a plain reading to be that &quot;only the entity\r\nemploying the employee whose act gives rise to the claim may be sued.&quot;\r\nDJJ's argument would lead to a cramped interpretation of the statute. If\r\nfollowed by this Court, DJJ's interpretation would immunize all officials whose\r\nduties bring them under some direction of a court.\r\nWe conclude, based on the facts before us, DJJ is\r\nthe properly named defendant.\r\nB. Discretionary Immunity\r\nDJJ argues its motion for summary judgment can be\r\nsustained on the ground it is entitled to discretionary immunity under the Tort\r\nClaims Act. We disagree.\r\nA governmental entity is not liable for losses \r\n  resulting from an exercise of discretion by its employees. Section 15-78-60 \r\n  (5) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act exempts governmental entities from \r\n  liability for losses resulting from &quot;the exercise of discretion or judgment \r\n  by the governmental entity or employee or the performance or failure to perform \r\n  any act or service which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental \r\n  entity or employee.&quot; Discretionary immunity is an affirmative defense requiring \r\n  DJJ to prove Dorsey evaluated competing alternatives and made a &quot;judgment&quot; \r\n  call based on applicable professional standards. Foster v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 306 S.C. 519, 413 S.E.2d 31 (1992).\r\nIn determining whether Dorsey's action was discretionary, \r\n  it is helpful to compare the two classifications for the duties of public officials. \r\n  The duties of public officials are generally classified as either ministerial \r\n  or discretionary. Jensen v. Anderson County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 304 \r\n  S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (1991) &quot;The duty is ministerial when it is absolute, \r\n  certain, and imperative, involving merely execution of a specific duty arising \r\n  from fixed and designated facts.&quot; Id. at 203, 403 S.E.2d at 619. The duty \r\n  is discretionary if the governmental entity proves it actually weighed competing \r\n  considerations, faced with alternatives, and made a conscious decision based \r\n  upon those considerations. Id. (citing Niver v. Dep't Highways \r\n  &amp; Pub. Transp., 302 S.C. 461, 395 S.E.2d 728 (Ct. App. 1990)).\r\nIn Jensen, this Court affirmed the Court \r\n  of Appeals' finding that insufficient evidence was submitted to determine whether \r\n  the Department of Social Services (&quot;DSS&quot;) made a discretionary decision. \r\n  Id. In the case, a teacher reported a potential child abuse case to DSS. A DSS \r\n  social worker interviewed the child, and noted the presence of bruises and the \r\n  child's fear of the mother's boyfriend. However, the social worker failed to \r\n  follow up on the interview and eventually closed the file. One month later, \r\n  the child's brother was beaten to death in the home. The Court held that DSS \r\n  had a duty to conduct a thorough investigation before deciding to close the \r\n  file. The Court concluded that conducting the investigation was ministerial \r\n  but closing the file was discretionary because it required applying facts discovered \r\n  through investigation to reach a decision. Id. Despite the fact that closing \r\n  the file is discretionary, the Court held that there was insufficient evidence \r\n  to grant discretionary immunity, because the decision was due to failure to \r\n  complete the investigation, an administrative function, rather than a weighing \r\n  of competing considerations. Id.\r\nIn the present case, DJJ claims Dorsey's decision \r\n  to place Fredrico in his home after he was expelled from his foster home was \r\n  a discretionary decision. Respondents claim Dorsey placed Fredrico in his family \r\n  home because he thought no one else would take him. However, Respondents argue \r\n  there was alternative placement available in the Greenville Group Home, which \r\n  had agreed earlier to take Fredrico in an emergency. Therefore, Respondents \r\n  claim if Dorsey had weighed competing alternatives, he would have placed Fredrico \r\n  in the Greenville Group home. Based on our holding in Jensen and the \r\n  evidence before us, DJJ is not entitled to discretionary immunity.\r\nIn addition, even if we held Dorsey exercised discretion, \r\n  the performance of discretionary duties does not give rise to immunity if the \r\n  public official acted in a grossly negligent manner. See Jackson v. \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Corr., 301 S.C.125, 390 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 1989) \r\n  aff'd, 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d 377 (1990). &quot;Gross negligence is the intentional, \r\n  conscious failure to do something which is incumbent upon one to do or the doing \r\n  of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.&quot; Richardson v. Hambright, \r\n  296 S.C. 504, 506, 374 S.E.2d 296, 298 (1988). It is the failure to exercise \r\n  even the slightest care. Hollins v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 310 \r\n  S.C. 486, 427 S.E.2d 654 (1993). This Court has also defined it as a relative \r\n  term that &quot;means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.&quot; \r\n  Hicks v. McCandlish, 221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1952).\r\nGross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question \r\n  of law and fact. See Clyburn v. Sumter County School District # 17, \r\n  317 S.C. 50, 451 S.E.2d 885 (1994). When the evidence supports but one reasonable \r\n  inference, it is solely a question of law for the court, otherwise it is an \r\n  issue best resolved by the jury. Id. In most cases, gross negligence \r\n  is a factually controlled concept whose determination best rests with the jury.\r\nIn Jackson, supra, a jury found the \r\n  Department of Corrections grossly negligent for placing a prisoner with strong \r\n  violent tendencies into a minimum security prison, where he killed a fellow \r\n  inmate. The Court of Appeals found the Department of Corrections transferred \r\n  the inmate even though they knew he had multiple disciplinary violations, including \r\n  the killing of a fellow inmate. The Court of Appeals held the jury could view \r\n  the transfer as gross negligence since it demonstrated a &quot;conscious indifference \r\n  to the threat posed to the safety of other inmates.&quot; Jackson, 301 \r\n  S.C. at 125, 390 S.E.2d at 468.\r\nIn the instant case, Dorsey placed Fredrico into \r\n  a home where DJJ workers noted there was no proper supervision. Furthermore, \r\n  Dorsey knew of Fredrico's violent tendencies. He even wrote before the incident \r\n  that he &quot;wouldn't give (Fredrico) two weeks with his mother before he would \r\n  get into big trouble.&quot;\r\nBased on the facts before us, DJJ is not entitled \r\n  to discretionary immunity as a matter of law. At a minimum, Faile has presented \r\n  enough evidence to overcome DJJ's summary judgment motion on the matter.\r\nC. Juvenile Release Exception\r\nDJJ argues it is entitled to summary judgment because \r\n  it is granted immunity under the juvenile release exception to the Tort Claims \r\n  Act. We disagree.\r\nUnder Section 15-78-60(21), a governmental entity \r\n  is not liable for &quot;the decision to or implementation of release, discharge, \r\n  parole, or furlough of any person in the custody of any governmental entity, \r\n  including but not limited to a prisoner, inmate, juvenile, patient, or client, \r\n  or the escape of these persons.&quot; DJJ argues that the present case falls \r\n  squarely within this exception based on Respondents' allegations that Fredrico \r\n  was in the DJJ's custody and was negligently released from that custody.\r\nDespite the Respondents' factual allegations, however, \r\n  it does not appear Fredrico was released from his relationship with the DJJ, \r\n  whether it was a custodial relationship or not. Neither Respondents nor DJJ \r\n  present any case law on this exemption. However, on its face, the exemption \r\n  appears to apply to a narrower set of circumstances than those presented in \r\n  this case. The language of the exemption indicates the custodial entity must \r\n  make a conscious, if not formal, decision to terminate the relationship before \r\n  this immunity is triggered. DJJ did not do so in this case. Dorsey placed Fredrico \r\n  in his home temporarily and appears to have had the authority to remove him \r\n  at any time. Without further evidence, we conclude the juvenile release exemption \r\n  does not protect the DJJ from liability.\r\nFurthermore, although Â§ 15-78-60(21) does not contain \r\n  a gross negligence exception, this Court has recognized that &quot;when a governmental \r\n  entity asserts various exceptions to the waiver of immunity . . . [the court] \r\n  must read exceptions that do not contain the gross negligence standard in light \r\n  of exceptions that do contain the standard.&quot; Steinke v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 395, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  142, 153 (1999). Therefore, even if Dorsey's actions fell within the release \r\n  exception, a jury could find his actions were grossly negligent.\r\nD. Duty of Care\r\nDJJ argues the trial court's grant of summary judgment \r\n  is supported because DJJ owed no legal duty of care to the Respondents' son \r\n  when he was assaulted by Fredrico. We disagree.\r\nIn a negligence action, the court must determine, \r\n  as a matter of law, whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. \r\n  Steinke, supra. &quot;If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence \r\n  action is entitled to a directed verdict.&quot; Steinke, 336 S.C. at 387, 520 \r\n  S.E.2d at 148.\r\nUnder South Carolina law, there is no general duty \r\n  to control the conduct of another or to warn a third person or potential victim \r\n  of danger. Rogers v. South Carolina Dep't of Parole &amp; Cmty Corr., \r\n  320 S.C. 253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995); Rayfield v. South Carolina Dep't of \r\n  Corr., 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied, \r\n  298 S.C. 204, 379 S.E.2d 133 (1998); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 314 (1965) \r\n  . We recognize five exceptions to this rule: 1) where the defendant has a special \r\n  relationship to the victim; (5) 2) where the \r\n  defendant has a special relationship to the injurer; (6) \r\n  3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a duty; (7) \r\n  4) where the defendant negligently or intentionally creates the risk; \r\n  (8) and 5) where a statute imposes a duty on the defendant. \r\n  (9) See generally, Hubbard &amp; Felix, The South \r\n  Carolina Law of Torts 57-72 (1990).\r\nThe present case, based upon the facts before us,\r\nfalls within the second category. The Restatement provides no duty exists\r\n&quot;to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing\r\nphysical harm to another unless ... a special relation exists between the actor\r\nand the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third\r\nperson's conduct.&quot; Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 315 (a) (1965). Section\r\n319 provides: &quot;One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or\r\nshould know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is\r\nunder a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent\r\nhim from doing such harm.&quot; Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 319 (1965).\r\nOur courts have customarily applied Â§ 315 and Â§ \r\n  319 in conjunction with duty to warn cases. See Bishop, supra; \r\n  Rogers, supra; Rayfield, supra. We have held a defendant \r\n  has a duty to exercise reasonable care by issuing warnings after the third party \r\n  has made specific threats to a specific individual. The rationale behind this \r\n  line of cases is an individual does not have a duty to protect the public from \r\n  speculative harm from a dangerous individual within his control. However, where \r\n  the custodian knows of a specific, credible threat from a person in their care \r\n  the injury is no longer speculative in nature.\r\nThe application of Â§ 319 is not limited to duty \r\n  to warn cases. The use of the Â§ 319 custodial duty of care in such cases is \r\n  a slight misnomer. Duty to warn cases normally involve a defendant who has legally \r\n  released a third party from direct custodial control or who releases the third \r\n  party after medical evaluation. See Bishop, supra (defendant \r\n  discharged third party mental patient from its care); Rogers, supra \r\n  (defendant released third party to furlough program); Rayfield, supra \r\n  (defendant released third party on parole). More importantly, those cases deal \r\n  with claims of a defendant's duty to warn. Plaintiffs in none \r\n  of these cases asserted a breach by the defendant of a common law duty to control \r\n  a dangerous person in their custody. See Bishop, supra \r\n  (plaintiff claimed defendant failed to warn victim of third party's release \r\n  from a mental hospital); Rogers, supra (plaintiff argued defendant \r\n  failed to warn victim of a dangerous third party's furlough); Rayfield, \r\n  supra (plaintiff asserted defendant was liable for breaching its statutory \r\n  duties in paroling third party).\r\nIn the present case, Respondents do not assert \r\n  DJJ had a duty to warn potential victims. Instead, Respondents assert a breach \r\n  of the duty to supervise and control a dangerous juvenile by the custodial entity. \r\n  Therefore, Respondents argue DJJ had a specific Â§ 319 duty to control a dangerous \r\n  person legally placed in its direct custodial care. While this Court has never \r\n  explicitly recognized such a duty, at least two appellate decisions mention \r\n  a similar duty in dicta. See Jackson, supra; Rayfield, \r\n  supra.\r\nIn Jackson we addressed the issue of discretionary \r\n  immunity and the standard for gross negligence. The Court of Appeal's decision, \r\n  which we affirmed, seems to presume, without argument, that the Department of \r\n  Corrections had a duty to control a knowingly violent inmate in its custody \r\n  from harming another inmate. See, Jackson, 301 S.C. at 126, 390 \r\n  S.E.2d at 468 (&quot;if the Department was grossly negligent in its duty to \r\n  control... [the attacker] and this negligence proximately caused [victim's] \r\n  death, its immunity from liability under the Act is waived.&quot; ).\r\nRayfield addressed many issues including \r\n  plaintiff's assertion that the Department of Corrections had a special relationship \r\n  with the third party which gave rise to a duty to prevent the third party from \r\n  injuring the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals quotes Â§ 319 to support the assertion. \r\n  See Rayfield, 297 S.C. at 109, 374 S.E.2d at 918. However, in \r\n  denying a duty existed, the court wrote:\r\n\r\n  We do not question this rule of law [Â§319].\r\n  When applied to the facts of this case, however, it affords no basis for the\r\n  Rayfields' cause of action. The mere knowledge that Lucas was drug addicted\r\n  and potentially violent did not create a special relationship. A special\r\n  relationship arose, if at all, from the custody the Department of Corrections\r\n  exercised over Lucas. While the Department had charge of Lucas, it arguably\r\n  owed a duty of care to others to prevent foreseeable harm Lucas might do them.\r\n  But once the Department's custody of Lucas ended, it no longer had charge of\r\n  him, and the special relationship based on custody ended.\r\n\r\nId., 297 S.C. at 109-10, 374 S.E.2d at 918.\r\nThough not controlling, the Court of Appeals\r\nclearly presumed a Â§ 319 duty is a recognizable duty where a defendant has\r\ncustodial care of a dangerous third party.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit, in a case factually similar \r\n  to the case sub judice, found an independent duty to control a dangerous \r\n  individual under Â§ 319. Semler v. Psychiatric Institute of Washington, D.C., \r\n  538 F.2d 121 (4th Cir. 1976), cert. denied sub nom., \r\n  Folliard v. Semler, 429 U.S. 827, 97 S.Ct. 83, 50 L.Ed.2d 90 (1976) . \r\n  Semler involved Steven Gilreath (&quot;Gilreath&quot;), a mental patient found \r\n  guilty of murder. A state court judge suspended Gilreath's sentence on the condition \r\n  he be confined to receive treatment at the Psychiatric Institute of Washington \r\n  (&quot;Institute&quot;).\r\nGilreath's probation officer requested weekend\r\npasses over the next few months, based on a doctor's recommendation. The judge\r\ngranted the weekend passes. Eventually, the judge modified the order to give the\r\nprobation officer discretion to issue Gilreath weekend passes. As Gilreath\r\nproceeded with treatment, his doctor and probation officer agreed to transfer\r\nhim from twenty-four hour supervision to day care status at the Institute. The\r\njudge approved the transfer.\r\nBased on a doctor's recommendation, the probation\r\nofficer gave Gilreath a three-day pass to investigate the possibility of moving\r\nto Ohio. Later, the probation officer gave Gilreath a fourteen-day pass to\r\nreturn to Ohio to prepare his transfer. The probation officer did not submit\r\neither pass for judicial approval.\r\nAnticipating Gilreath's transfer to Ohio, the\r\nInstitute, contrary to the court order, discharged him. Although the Institute\r\nnotified the probation officer, the court remained uninformed. When Ohio\r\nrejected Gilreath's parole transfer, the probation officer ordered his return to\r\nVirginia. The Institute re-admitted Gilreath to its program, but only on an\r\nout-patient basis, requiring him to meet in a group setting two nights a week.\r\nThe change in status was contrary to the latest court order.\r\nAdditionally, Gilreath no longer lived with his\r\nparents as he had when he was in day care status, but instead lived alone,\r\nunsupervised. The probation officer never informed the judge of the new\r\narrangement. Two months after returning to Virginia, Gilreath murdered another\r\nindividual.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit, in upholding a civil verdict \r\n  against the Institute and the probation officer, held each owed a duty to the \r\n  victim. The court noted the judge ordered Gilreath &quot;to receive treatment \r\n  at and remain confined in the Psychiatric Institute until released by the Court.&quot; \r\n  Id., 538 F.2d at 124. The Institute and probation officer argued the \r\n  order's purpose was to rehabilitate Gilreath, therefore it created a duty only \r\n  to him and not to any third party victims. The court held the order's purpose \r\n  was twofold: to provide care for Gilreath and to protect the public from Gilreath. \r\n  The Fourth Circuit noted the trial court was particularly concerned that Gilreath, \r\n  who had a known history of attacking young girls, presented a foreseeable risk \r\n  to the public.\r\nReleasing Gilreath from the day care program violated \r\n  the judgment of the court which determined confinement was in the best interest \r\n  of the community. &quot;The special relationship created by the probation order, \r\n  therefore, imposed a duty on [the Institute and probation officer] to protect \r\n  the public from the reasonably foreseeable risk of harm at Gilreath's hands \r\n  [which] the state judge had already recognized.&quot; Id., 538 F.2d at \r\n  125.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit, construing Â§ 319 of Restatement \r\n  (Second) of Torts (1965), ruled the order itself provided the boundaries of \r\n  the custodian's duty. Id. The Institute and the probation officer were obligated \r\n  by the court order to retain custody over Gilreath until the court released \r\n  him. &quot;No lesser measure of care would suffice...they could not substitute \r\n  their judgment for the court's with respect to the propriety of releasing him \r\n  from confinement.&quot; Id.\r\nIn the present case, Judge Barrineau's April 1992\r\norder placed Fredrico on probation for one year. The order suspended commitment\r\nto DJJ if Fredrico was placed in a therapeutic foster home. Fredrico's parents\r\nwere ordered to undergo counseling. After his expulsion from the foster home,\r\nthe probation counselor placed him in a group home for a night, then with his\r\nbiological mother.\r\nDorsey placed Fredrico into a home without proper\r\nsupervision. Dorsey was aware of Fredrico's violent tendencies. More\r\nimportantly, Dorsey returned Fredrico to his mother's home in direct\r\ncontradiction to the court order.\r\nWhile Semler does not equate the Â§ 319 duty with \r\n  the &quot;custodial entity's duty to obey court orders,&quot; we find Â§ 319 \r\n  to be, as decided by the Fourth Circuit, &quot;close to the point.&quot; Id. \r\n  This Court is reluctant to impose the duty to control unless there is an established \r\n  authority relationship and a substantial risk of serious harm. See Hubbard \r\n  &amp; Felix, supra, at 64-65. Here, DJJ had custody of a known dangerous \r\n  individual. It had an independent duty to control and supervise Fredrico to \r\n  prevent him from harming others as long as it retained custody of him by court \r\n  order.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM IN\r\nRESULT and REMAND this case to the Circuit Court for\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When a plaintiff claims an\r\nemployee of a state agency acted negligently in the performance of his job, the\r\nSouth Carolina Tort Claims Act requires a plaintiff to sue the agency for which\r\nan employee works, rather than suing the employee directly. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n15-78-70(c) (Supp. 2001). Whether the DJJ was the proper defendant-agency is\r\ndiscussed in part III of this opinion.\r\n2. The United States Supreme \r\n  Court extends absolute immunity to protect some quasi-judicial actors, such \r\n  as prosecutors and witnesses, who perform judicial functions. Briscoe v. \r\n  LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 103 S. Ct. 1108, 75 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983); Imbler \r\n  v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 96 S. Ct. 984, 47 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1976). However, \r\n  determining whether an individual is entitled to absolute immunity requires \r\n  the court to consider the function performed by the individual, rather than \r\n  the individual's position. Forrester, supra (denying absolute \r\n  immunity for parole officer's detainment of parolee, but recognizing functions, \r\n  such as testifying at a parole hearing, for which a parole officer is entitled \r\n  to absolute immunity). \r\n3. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-2155 (1976), repealed by 1996 Act 383. The principle of the probation \r\n  officer as being an agent of the court is now codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-8335 \r\n  (C) (Supp. 2001). \r\n4. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-2155 (1976), repealed by 1996 Act 383. After the events \r\n  giving rise to this suit, the General Assembly passed legislation explicitly \r\n  giving the director of DJJ the power to direct a juvenile probation officer \r\n  in the performance of duties. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6840 (Supp. 2001).\r\n 5. See, \r\n  e.g., Ballou v. Sigma Nu Gen. Fraternity, 291 S.C. 140, 352 S.E.2d \r\n  488 (Ct. App. 1986) (duty of Fraternity to protect an intoxicated person based \r\n  on its relationship with the victim); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 315 (b) \r\n  (1965) (&quot;There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as \r\n  to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless ... a special relation \r\n  exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.&quot;).\r\n 6. See \r\n  Rogers, supra. When a party is in a position to monitor, supervise, \r\n  and control a person's conduct, a special relationship between the defendant \r\n  and the dangerous person may trigger a common law duty to warn potential victims \r\n  of the danger posed by the individual. This special duty is limited to situations \r\n  where the person under the defendant's control has made a &quot;specific threat \r\n  directed at a specific individual.&quot; Id. at 256, 464 S.E.2d at 332.\r\n 7. See, \r\n  e.g., Caldwell v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 293 S.C. 229, 359 S.E.2d \r\n  518 (Ct. App. 1987); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 323-24A (1965).\r\n 8. See, \r\n  e.g., Montgomery v.

We find it is not \r\n  and reverse the denial of PCR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner Odom pled guilty to second degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor. At the plea hearing, the Solicitor alerted the \r\n  trial judge that the indictment had not been true billed. The trial judge then \r\n  questioned petitioner as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT: This case involving criminal sexual \r\n  conduct has not been before the grand jury. It takes twelve of eighteen people \r\n  to get it into court. You've indicated you want to give up that right and go \r\n  ahead and plead guilty. Is that what you'd like to do?\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nPetitioner subsequently sought PCR on the ground \r\n  the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction because there was no \r\n  written waiver of presentment. The PCR judge denied relief. He found petitioner \r\n  had orally waived presentment and this oral waiver was adequate. \r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an indictment, there must be \r\n  a valid waiver of presentment for the trial court to have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  of the offense. State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 415 S.E.2d 816 (1992).\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-130 (1985) provides \r\n  that \"the clerk shall have the defendant sign a waiver of the presentment \r\n  by the grand jury and his plea of guilty.\" Similarly, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-140 \r\n  (1985) provides that \"upon signing the waiver of presentment\" the defendant \r\n  may plead guilty. We have held compliance with these sections is mandatory and, \r\n  further, that they require a written waiver. Phillips v. State, 281 S.C. \r\n  41, 314 S.E.2d 313 (1984); State v. Martin, 278 S.C. 256, 294 S.E.2d \r\n  345 (1982); Summerall v. State, 278 S.C. 255, 294 S.E.2d 344 (1982); \r\n  see also State v. Clarkson, 337 S.C. 518, 523 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999), rev'd on other grounds, 347 S.C. 115, 553 S.E.2d 450 (2001).\r\n\r\nIn light of the statutory language requiring the \r\n  defendant to sign a waiver of presentment, we find an oral waiver is not sufficient. \r\n  The trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction to accept petitioner's plea. \r\n  Accordingly, the denial of PCR is reversed and petitioner's plea is hereby vacated.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n1.

Harvey is a Jehovah's Witness; his claims stem from Harvey's receipt of unwanted blood transfusions\r\ntwo days after elective carotid artery surgery.  The trial court granted  directed verdicts for respondents on all four causes of\r\naction.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 1996, diagnostic testing revealed a blockage in Harvey's carotid artery.  Dr. Strickland recommended a\r\ncarotid endarterectomy.  On November 4, 1996, in anticipation of surgery, Harvey signed written forms entitled \"Refusal of\r\nTreatment/Release from Liability\" and \"Consent to Operation.\"  The documents indicate that he refused to have blood or\r\nblood products given to him, and that he fully understood the attendant risks.  They state that \"in all probability, my refusal\r\nfor such treatment, medical intervention, and/or procedure (may)(will) seriously imperil my health or life.\"  The release\r\nrelieves the attending physician, Lexington Medical Center, and its agents and employees from any and all claims of\r\nwhatsoever kind or nature.  Hospital forms list Harvey's mother, Julia, as his emergency contact.  On January 14, 1997, the\r\nday before his surgery, Harvey signed another consent to operation form indicating that he did \"not give permission to the\r\ndoctor to use blood or blood products if necessary.\"  However, Dr. Strickland testified that although he knew Harvey was a\r\nJehovah's Witness, Harvey had told him he would consider a blood transfusion  \r\n\r\nHarvey's surgery was performed January 15, 1997.  Although the surgery initially appeared to have gone well, Harvey\r\ndeveloped a blood clot and had a stroke while in the recovery room.  Because Harvey was unconscious, hospital personnel\r\nlocated his mother in the waiting room and obtained her permission to perform a CT scan and an arteriogram.  A second\r\nsurgery was performed and more blood clots were removed along the side of the carotid artery.  Harvey was moved to the\r\nintensive care unit (ICU).  He was intubated that evening by the on-call emergency room physician after the ICU nurse\r\ndiscovered Harvey was having trouble breathing, and his blood pressure was 200/110.  The next day, Harvey began\r\nbleeding from the surgical site at his neck; he had lost approximately 30% of his blood volume, and his heart rate was\r\nextremely high.  Dr. Strickland was concerned that if they could not get the heart rate down, Harvey would have a heart\r\nattack and die.  When his hemoglobin level reached 8, Dr. Strickland recommended a blood transfusion to Harvey's\r\nmother, Julia, who initially declined due to her son's faith as a Jehovah's Witness.  Ultimately, Julia consented to giving\r\nHarvey two units of packed red blood cells.  Harvey recovered fully from the procedures.  \r\n\r\nHarvey instituted this suit in July 1998 alleging medical malpractice, medical battery, breach of express contract, and lack\r\nof informed consent. (1)  The trial court directed a verdict for Dr. Strickland on the breach of contract claim at the close of\r\nHarvey's case; the court directed a verdict for Dr. Strickland on the lack of informed consent claim at the close of the\r\ndefense's presentation of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe medical malpractice and medical battery claims were submitted to the jury.  After four hours of deliberations, the jury\r\nsent out a note indicating it could not agree.  The jury was excused for the day, but brought back the next morning for\r\nfurther deliberations after an  Allen  charge.  After the jury was sent out in the morning, counsel for Harvey requested if there\r\nwas some way, in the event of a mistrial, for the court to get \"all these thorny issues\" before an appellate court without re-trying the case.  During this discussion, the jury again returned, indicating it could not agree.  The court then granted Dr.\r\nStrickland a directed verdict on the malpractice and battery claims and dismissed the jury. (2)  Harvey appeals.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Did the trial court err in granting a directed verdict on Harvey's claims?\r\n\r\n2.  Did the trial court err in denying Harvey's motion to amend his complaint?\r\n\r\n3.  Did the trial court improperly exclude testimony of a hospital liaison worker?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DIRECTED VERDICT\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvey contends the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his claims.  We agree.\r\n\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences which\r\nreasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and to deny the motion\r\nwhere either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.\r\n  Strange v. South Carolina Dep't of\r\nHighways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).  When considering directed verdict motions,\r\nneither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony\r\nor evidence.  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997).  \"In\r\nessence, we must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts\r\nas liberally construed in his favor.\"  Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).  \"If the evidence is\r\nsusceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.\"  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong,\r\n331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998). \r\n\r\na.  Informed consent\r\n\r\n\r\n      Citing Hook v. Rothstein, 281 S.C. 541, 316 S.E.2d 690 (Ct. App.), cert denied 283 S.C. 64, 320 S.E.2d 35 (1984), Dr.\r\nStrickland contends the subsequent unplanned emergency required he seek the consent of Harvey's mother for further\r\ntreatments.  Accordingly, as he sought and obtained Harvey's mother's consent to the blood transfusion, he contends he\r\ncannot be held liable as a matter of law.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Hook, the Court of Appeals first recognized that the doctrine of informed consent applies to physicians in South\r\nCarolina.  Under that doctrine, a physician has a duty to disclose to a patient the diagnosis, risks, benefits, alternatives, etc.,\r\nof any procedures the doctor proposes to perform.  Hook, however, indicates such information is to be given to \"a patient of\r\nsound mind, in the absence of an emergency which warrants immediate medical treatment.\"  281 S.C. at 547-48, 316\r\nS.E.2d at 694-95.  Accordingly, as Harvey was unconscious, and an emergency situation presented, Dr. Strickland asserts\r\nhe was obligated to seek his mother's consent to the blood transfusion.  We disagree.   \r\n\r\nThe right to be free of unwanted medical treatment has long been recognized in this country.  More than one-hundred years\r\nago, in Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891), the United States Supreme Court  perceived that \"no\r\nright is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the\r\npossession and control of his own person.\"   In Schloendorff v. New York Hosp., 105 N.E. 92, 93 (N.Y. 1914), Justice\r\nCardozo stated, \"every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his\r\nown body. . . .\"  More recently, it has been noted that \"the individual's right to make decisions vitally affecting his private\r\nlife according to his own conscience . . . is difficult to overstate . . . because it is, without exaggeration, the very bedrock on\r\nwhich this country was founded.\"  Wons v. Public Health Trust, 500 So. 2d 679, 687 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987), aff'd 541\r\nSo. 2d 96 (Fla. 1989).  The right to control the integrity of one's own body spawned the doctrine of informed consent.  In re\r\nDuran, 769 A.2d 497 (Pa. 2001).  Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court has held that a competent adult patient has\r\nthe right to decline any and all forms of medical intervention, including lifesaving or life-prolonging treatment.  Cruzan v.\r\nDirector, Missouri Dep't of Mental Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990).  \r\n\r\nOur General Assembly has recognized this right to be free of unwanted medical intrusion in the South Carolina Adult\r\nHealth Care Consent Act (Consent Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-10 et seq. (Supp. 2001).  Section 44-66-60 of the Consent\r\nAct states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) Unless the patient, while able to consent, has stated a contrary intent to the attending physician or other health care\r\nprofessional responsible for the care of the patient, this chapter does not authorize the provision of health care to a patient\r\nwho is unable to consent if the attending physician or other health care professional responsible for the care of the patient\r\nhas actual knowledge that the health care is contrary to the religious beliefs of the patient.\r\n\r\n(B) This chapter does not authorize the provision of health care to a patient who is unable to consent if the attending\r\nphysician or other health care professional responsible for the care of the patient has actual knowledge that the health\r\ncare is contrary to the patient's unambiguous and uncontradicted instructions expressed at a time when the patient\r\nwas able to consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Clearly, these sections reveal a legislative intent that a patient's wishes against medical treatment or\r\nintervention, when made known to a physician prior to surgery, must be followed by the attending physician.\r\n\r\nHere, Harvey signed numerous forms indicating he was a Jehovah's Witness and did not wish to receive blood.  In\r\nparticular, on the date of his initial appointment with Dr. Strickland, Harvey signed a \"Refusal of Treatment/Release from\r\nLiability\" form which specifically which states:\r\n\r\n\r\nI, Charles Harvey, refuse to have blood or any blood products given to me                                                                                \r\n              .  \r\n\r\nThe risks attendant to my refusal have been fully explained to me and I fully understand that my chances for gaining normal\r\nhealth are seriously reduced, and that in all probability, my refusal for such treatment, medical intervention, and/or\r\nprocedure (may) (will) seriously imperil my health or life.\r\n\r\nWith the understanding, I hereby release the attending physician, the Lexington Medical Center and its employees and their\r\nrespective agents, heirs, executors, administrators and assigns from any and all claims of whatsoever kind of any nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven this evidence demonstrating Harvey's desire not to receive blood, we find Dr. Strickland's argument that he was\r\nunder an obligation to seek Julia Harvey's consent unavailing.  \r\n\r\nHowever, in light of Dr. Strickland's testimony to the effect that he knew Harvey was a Jehovah's Witness, and that\r\nalthough Harvey never said \"yes\" to a blood transfusion, Harvey had told him he would consider a blood transfusion, we\r\nfind the informed consent issue was a matter for the jury.  Accordingly, we hold the trial court erred in granting a directed\r\nverdict on Harvey's informed consent cause of action. \r\n\r\nB.  Breach of Contract\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvey next asserts the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to Dr. Strickland on his breach of contract claim.  We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nHere, the documents Harvey relies upon to create an express contract are 1) a \"Doctor's Survey Reply\" signed by Dr.\r\nStrickland which indicates he is willing in principle to offer medical treatment without the use of blood or blood products,\r\n2) a Refusal of Treatment form, signed by Harvey on 11/04/96, indicating he did not wish to receive blood, 3) a Consent to\r\nOperation form for an \"arch and four vessel arteriogram\" signed by Harvey on 11/04/96, indicating he did not give\r\npermission to the doctor to use blood or blood products, 4) a Consent to Operation form for a Carotid Endarterectomy\r\nsigned by Harvey on 1/14/97, indicating he did not give permission to the doctor to use blood products, and 5) a Refusal of\r\nTransfusion, indicating Harvey is a Jehovah's Witness and refuses blood transfusion and absolves the hospital of liability. \r\nHarvey also testified that it was his understanding that \"he [Dr. Strickland] could do the operation without- bloodless\r\ntransfusions, so when I asked him about it, he said that that wouldn't be necessary.  It wouldn't be necessary for the blood\r\ntransfusion, so there was no more said.\"\r\n\r\nWe have previously recognized that an action may be maintained for breach of an express pre-treatment warranty to effect a\r\nparticular result.  Banks v. Medical University of South Carolina, 314 S.C. 376, 444 S.E.2d 519 (1994); Burns v.\r\nWannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 315 S.E.2d 179 (Ct. App. 1984), aff'd as modified 288 S.C. 398, 343 S.E.2d 27 (1985).\r\n\r\nViewing the above evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to Harvey, we find it was for the jury to determine\r\nwhether an express contract was created.  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 333 S.C. 71,\r\n508 S.E.2d 565 (1998) (when Court reviews grant of directed verdict, evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom\r\nmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-prevailing party. If the evidence is susceptible of more than one\r\nreasonable inference, case should be submitted to the jury).  Accordingly, the trial court's grant of a directed verdict is\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nc.  Medical Malpractice/Medical Battery\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes a medical malpractice cause of action  stemming from a lack of informed consent.\r\n  Hook v.\r\nRothstein, supra.  Similarly, we have recognized that there may be a viable cause of action for medical battery as the result\r\nof failing to obtain proper consent.   Banks v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, supra.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court erred in granting Dr. Strickland a directed verdict as to these causes of action.  Harvey presented\r\nexpert testimony that his hemoglobin level was not critical at the time of the transfusion, and that there was not really an\r\nemergency situation.  The expert also opined that Harvey did not really need a transfusion, and that alternative bloodless\r\nprocedures were available.   Given this testimony, we find the issues of medical battery and medical malpractice were for\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\n2.  MOTION TO AMEND\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvey asserts the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to allow him to amend his complaint to conform to the\r\nevidence while the jury was deliberating.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nHarvey's complaint alleged only that Dr. Strickland was negligent and/or breached obligations to him in giving him blood\r\nproducts without his consent and contrary to his wishes.  The trial centered around these allegations. (3)  During the jury's\r\ndeliberations, Harvey moved to amend his complaint to include allegations of medical negligence stemming from the\r\n\"closed off airway\" incident; he wanted to allege that it was a breach of the standard of care to let his airway be closed off\r\nrequiring him to be intubated.  Harvey asserted that Dr. Strickland had testified that the intubation was not a breach of the\r\nstandard of care, such that the issue had been tried by consent. \r\n\r\nThe circuit court is to freely grant leave to amend when justice requires and there is no prejudice to any other party.  Rule\r\n15, SCRCP; Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 313 S.C. 98, 431 S.E.2d 587 (1993).  A motion to amend is addressed to the\r\nsound discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.\r\n  Id. \r\nAmendments to conform to the proof should be liberally allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result.\r\n  Soil\r\n&amp; Material Eng'rs, Inc. v. Folly Assoc., 293 S.C. 498, 361 S.E.2d 779 (Ct. App. 1987).  This decision is within the trial\r\ncourt's discretion.  Id.  \r\n\r\nGiven that the jury was in the process of deliberating at the time counsel moved to amend, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe trial court's refusal of the amendment.   Accord Dunbar v. Carlson, 341 S.C. 261, 533 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 2000)(court\r\nwill not find implied consent to try an issue if all of the parties did not recognize it as an issue during trial, even though\r\nthere is evidence in the record--introduced as relevant to some other issue--which would support the amendment).  \r\n\r\n3.  EXCLUSION OF LIAISON'S TESTIMONY  \r\n\r\n\r\nHarvey also asserts reversible error in the trial court's exclusion of portions of the testimony of Richard Culler, a hospital\r\nliaison committee worker.  The liaison committee worked with patients and doctors to attempt to prevent Jehovah's\r\nWitness patients from receiving unwanted blood transfusions.  The trial court sustained Dr. Strickland's objection to any\r\ntestimony by Culler as to what specific resources were available at the Lexington Medical Center to someone who did not\r\nwant to receive blood.  However, Culler was able to testify that there were resources available at the hospital to assist in the\r\ntreatment of patients without use of blood products.  \r\n\r\nGiven that Culler was able to testify as to resources generally available, we find no reversible error in the limitation of his\r\ntestimony.  Gamble v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996)(admission or exclusion of\r\nevidence is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal).\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find any evidence as to the availability and appropriateness of \"cell saver\" technology, about which Culler\r\nproposed to testify, would have required expert testimony.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing the proffered\r\ntestimony as Culler was not qualified as an expert.  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 60-61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211\r\n(1998)(qualification of witness as an expert and the admissibility of his or her testimony are matters left to the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion and prejudice\r\nto the opposing party).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court's grant of a directed verdict is reversed.  We affirm the trial court's rulings limiting the testimony of the\r\nliaison, and denying Harvey's motion to amend his complaint.   The matter is reversed and remanded for a new trial. (4)\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1.   Lexington Medical Center was initially named as a defendant but was voluntarily dismissed in March 1999.  \r\n2.   We agree with Harvey's contention that rather than granting a directed verdict, the proper procedure in cases of jury\r\ndeadlock is to grant a mistrial.  However, as Harvey's request to the trial court contributed to the error, we do not reverse\r\non this basis.\r\n3.   In fact, at one point, the trial court specifically stated, \"There are no allegations of any kind of negligence or anything\r\nelse or any other treatment, right?\" to which counsel for Harvey responded affirmatively. \r\n4.   Dr. Strickland asserts, as an additional sustaining ground, directed verdicts were appropriate as Harvey suffered no\r\nlegally cognizable injury.  We disagree.  We find the matter of damages was for the jury's determination.\r\n  See Stevens v.\r\nAllen, 342 S.C. 47, 536 S.E.2d 663 (2000) (recognizing that every violation of a legal right imports damage and authorizes\r\nthe maintenance of an action and the recovery of at least nominal damages, regardless of whether any actual damage has\r\nbeen sustained).   See&nbsp;also Boan v. Blackwell, 343 S.C. 498, 541 S.E.2d 242 (2001) (analyzing damages for \"loss of\r\nenjoyment of life\" and \"pain and suffering\"); Gathers v. Harris Teeter, 282 S.C. 220, 317 S.E.2d 748 (Ct. App.\r\n1984)(physical injury is not an element of a battery); Tisdale v. Pruitt, 302 S.C. 238, 394 S.E.2d 857 (Ct. App.\r\n1990)(evidence that patient was denied right to make an informed consent to procedure, suffered pain from the procedure\r\nand suffered emotional injury were sufficient to present jury issue on whether damages were sustained and proximately\r\ncaused by doctor's wrongful conduct).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25492","title":"Richardson v.

Gibbs, Jr., of Charleston, for respondent Henry Richardson; R. Allen Young, of Mount Pleasant, and John B. Williams, of Moncks Corner, for\r\nrespondent Town of Mt. Pleasant.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  The circuit court judge found that a municipal police officer is a constable within the meaning of the South Carolina Constitution's\r\ndual office holding provisions. (1)  Therefore, he held that Respondent Henry Richardson (Respondent) is entitled to continue serving as a police officer for the\r\nTown of Mt. Pleasant despite his subsequent election to the Berkeley County Council.  Further, the circuit court concluded that to hold otherwise would violate\r\nRespondent's federal equal protection rights. (2)  The Attorney General appealed.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution generally prohibits an individual from holding two offices of honor or profit at the same time.  There are several exceptions to\r\nthis general prohibition.  Respondent has stipulated that county councilman and police officer are both positions of honor or profit and that, unless one office falls\r\nwithin a dual office holding exemption, he cannot hold both offices simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI.  Dual Office Holding\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dual office holding provisions are in derogation of the common law which prohibited a person from holding two offices only if they were \"incompatible.\" \r\nState v. Buttz, 9 S.C. 156 (1887).  Incompatibility meant either that the offices involved \"such a multiplicity of business\" that one person could not adequately\r\nperform both, or that they were \"subordinate and interfering with each other, [inducing] a presumption that they cannot be executed with impartiality and\r\nhonesty.\"  Id.; Ex parte Ware Furniture, 49 S.C. 20, 27 S.E. 9 (1897) (McIver, J., dissenting).  In some situations, public policy prevented a person from holding\r\nmore than one office at a time.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe 1895 Constitution extended the dual office holding proscription to all persons holding positions of \"honor or profit,\" exempting from the prohibition only\r\nnotaries public and militia officers.  Art. II, Â§2.  An exemption for delegates to constitutional conventions was added, but the provisions remained otherwise\r\nunchanged until 1988, when the Constitution was amended to exempt from the prohibition the offices of \"constable\" and \"member of a lawfully and regularly\r\norganized fire department.\"  The record does not suggest any persuasive reason why these two offices were added in 1988.\r\n\r\n    In this case, we are asked to determine the meaning of the term \"constable\" as used in the state constitution's dual office holding provisions. When this Court is\r\ncalled upon to interpret our Constitution, we are guided by the \"ordinary and popular meaning of the words used . . . .\"  Abbeville County School Dist. v. State,\r\n335 S.C. 58, 67, 515 S.E.2d 535, 539-40 (1999)(internal citation omitted).  A word used in the Constitution should be given its \"plain and ordinary\" meaning. \r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment, 333 S.C. 96, 508 S.E.2d 575 (1998).  In Johnson, this Court noted that the term \"lottery\" as used in our statutes and\r\nConstitution had no \"technical, legal meaning,\" and should therefore be construed in the \"popular sense.\"\r\n\r\nThe precise question posed here is whether the office of constable as used in the dual office holding provisions of the constitution encompasses the office of\r\nmunicipal police officer.  While the word \"lottery\" has a popular, but not a technical or legal meaning, in this case we are construing a term of art, that is, the\r\nmeaning of the term constable as it relates to \"an office of honor or profit.\"  We therefore look not just at the popular definition of the word, but also at the legal\r\ndefinition of the office. \r\n\r\n'Constable' is defined as \"a peace officer with less authority and smaller jurisdiction than a sheriff,  empowered to serve writs and warrants and to make arrests; in\r\nmedieval monarchies, an officer of high rank, usually serving as a military commander in the ruler's absence; the governor of a royal castle,\"  The American\r\nHeritage Dictionary p.314 (2d ed. 1991); or as \"a high officer of a medieval royal or noble household; the warden or governor of a royal household or a fortified\r\ntown; a public officer usually of a town or township responsible for keeping the peace and for minor judicial duties.\" Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary p.243\r\n(1974).  The use of the term 'constable' as a synonym for 'police officer' is primarily a British usage. Id.; The American Heritage Dictionary, supra. \r\n\r\nIn legal usage, a constable was originally defined as  \"an officer who regulated matters of chivalry, tournaments, and feats of arms.\"  Anderson, A Dictionary of\r\nLaw (1891) p. 236.  Blackstone defined a constable as \"an officer appointed to preserve the peace, and to execute the processes of a justice of the peace.\"  Id. \r\nBlack's Law Dictionary defines constable as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[a]n officer of a municipal corporation (usually elected) whose duties are similar to those of the sheriff, though his powers are less and his jurisdiction smaller.  He\r\nis to preserve the public peace, execute the process of magistrate's courts, and of some other tribunals, serve writs, attend the sessions of the criminal courts, have\r\nthe custody of juries, and discharge other functions sometimes assigned to him by the local law or by statute.  Powers and duties of constables have generally been\r\nreplaced by sheriffs. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Black's Law Dictionary p. 281 (5th Ed. 1979).\r\n\r\nUnder current South Carolina law, (3) the office which most nearly meets\r\nBlack's and Blackstone's definitions of constable is that of \"magistrate's constable.\"  See generally South Carolina Code Annotated, Title 22, Chapter 9. \r\nMagistrate's constables have county-wide authority, (4) are authorized to serve (5) and execute process and make returns, (6) and to levy executions and serve\r\nattachments. (7)  Constables must attend circuit court when required by the sheriff, (8) and while there are deemed \"officers of the court\" bound to \"perform the\r\nappropriate duties and services assigned them by the sheriff and the presiding judge.\" (9) \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina statutes create additional constable's offices, which are generally filled by the governor's appointment or commission. (10) Under S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§23-1-60 (1976), the governor \"may . . . appoint such additional deputies, constables, security guards, and detectives as he may deem necessary to assist in the\r\ndetection of crime and the enforcement of any criminal laws . . . .\"  See also  S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-3-220 (Supp. 2001) (providing for the governor's appointment of\r\na \"chief constable\" ).  State constables appointed by the governor have state-wide jurisdiction.  See Power v. McNair, 255 S.C. 150, 177 S.E.2d 551 (1970).  \r\n\r\nSome law enforcement officers are required or authorized to obtain state constable commissions.  Generally, the jurisdiction of these law enforcement officers is\r\ncircumscribed by statute.  See, e.g., S. C. Code Ann. Â§59-116-20 (1990) (college and university police officers must obtain state constable commissions but their\r\njurisdiction pursuant to such appointment \"is limited to the campus grounds and streets and roads through and contiguous to them\"); compare, e.g., S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§Â§50-3-310 and - 340 (Supp. 2001) (commissioned  Dep't of Natural Resources (DNR) officers \"when acting in their official capacity, have statewide\r\nauthority for the enforcement of all laws relating to wildlife, marine, and natural resources\"); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§51-3-147 (1976) (commissioned Parks,\r\nRecreation and Tourism (PRT) officials have enforcement powers of any state constable).\r\n\r\nThe governor is also empowered to appoint special state constables whose jurisdiction is \"limited to the lands and premises acquired by the United States\r\ngovernment . . . in Aiken, Allendale, and Barnwell counties.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§23-7-40 (Supp. 2001).  These \"Savannah River\" constables possess \"all of the\r\nrights and powers prescribed by law for magistrates' constables and deputy sheriffs and powers usually exercised by marshals and policemen of towns and cities.\" \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§23-7-50 (Supp. 2001); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§58-13-910 (Supp. 2001) (governor authorized to \"certify\" special officers or constables for the\r\nprotection of common carriers). \r\n\r\n    As explained above, the General Assembly has created and defined several different types of constable's offices.  The legislature has also enacted a statute\r\nproviding for the employment by municipalities of police officers.  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§5-7-110 (Supp. 2001) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nAny municipality may appoint or elect as many police officers, regular or special, as may be necessary for the proper law enforcement in such municipality and fix\r\ntheir salaries and prescribe their duties.\r\n\r\nPolice officers shall be vested with all the powers and duties conferred by law upon constables, in addition to the special duties imposed upon them by\r\nthe municipality. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nThus, unlike campus police officers, DNR officers, and PRT officials, municipal police officers need not obtain commissions from the governor to exercise the\r\npower and duties of a state constable. (11)  Similarly, the General Assembly, in order to benefit municipal courts, has delegated to municipal police officers many of\r\nthe responsibilities, and \"the same powers and duties as are provided for magistrates' constables.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-25-55 (Supp. 2001).  No such express\r\ndelegation of the powers of state constables and magistrate's constables to municipal police officers would be necessary, however, if those officers were already\r\npossessed of this authority by virtue of their employment.  The General Assembly has distinguished between the office of constable and that of municipal police\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the statutory provisions separately providing for the creation of the offices of  'constable' and 'municipal police officer,' this Court has long\r\nrecognized that the offices are distinct.  In 1881, the Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\nMunicipal corporations as now established by law are of comparatively modern origin.  They are agencies to assist in the conduct of local civil government, and\r\nwhat the state constitutionally empowers them to do may be considered as done by the state . . . .  Mr. Dillon, in his excellent work on Municipal Corporations,\r\nobserves that 'the office of a police officer is not known to the common law; it is created by statute, and the officer has and can exercise only such powers\r\nas he is authorized to do by the legislature . . . .  When police officers are by statute invested with all the powers of constables, or conservators of the\r\npeace [they possess the same arrest powers] . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Bowen, 17 S.C. 58, 61 (emphasis supplied); see also City Council v. Payne, 11 S.C.L. (2 Nott &amp; McC.) 475 (1820) (Charleston ordinance gave its city\r\nguard the arrest powers of constables).  We find nothing in our past or current law which has equated the offices, nor do we find that the offices share a \"popular\"\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nAt the time the General Assembly enacted the legislation providing for the referendum to add the constable exception to the dual office holding provisions, the\r\noffice of  'constable' had fixed meanings under South Carolina law.  A constable is a person who holds a state commission, is employed in such capacity by a\r\nmagistrate, or otherwise meets one of the statutory definitions.  A municipal police officer is a person employed by a municipality pursuant to Â§5-7-110.  The\r\noffice of 'constable' does not subsume the office of 'municipal police officer.' \r\n\r\n    Respondent, in his capacity as a municipal police officer, is not a constable exempt from the constitutional provisions forbidding dual office holding.\r\n\r\nWe reverse the circuit court's holding permitting Respondent to hold both offices.\r\n\r\n    II.  Equal Protection\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held there was no rational basis for exempting constables, but not municipal police officers, from the dual office holding proscription because the\r\nduties of each are substantially identical and the statutes do not distinguish between the positions.   The court therefore concluded that to prohibit Respondent\r\nfrom holding both his office in Mt. Pleasant and his office in Berkeley County would violate his federal equal protection rights.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nAs explained above, the factual predicate upon which the circuit court's decision rests is incorrect:  the duties and jurisdiction of constables vary widely from\r\nthose of municipal police officers, and the statutes distinguish between the offices. Further, the circuit court fundamentally misidentified the 'class' affected by the\r\ndual office holding proscriptions.   That class consists of all persons holding an \"office of honor or profit.\"  All members of the class, including Respondent, are\r\nsubject to the same limitation, that is, they may hold only one such office at any time, subject to the same exemptions.  There is no \"irrational classification\" and\r\nthe dual office holding provisions of the state constitution do not run afoul of the federal equal protection clause. (12)\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has stipulated that county councilman and municipal police officer are positions of honor or profit.  Since neither office is exempt from the state\r\nconstitution's dual office holding prohibitions, the circuit court order permitting Respondent to retain both offices is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  I respectfully dissent.  In my opinion, the exemption to the prohibition against dual office holding for constables and firefighters\r\nencompasses municipal police officers.  As the majority points out, the legislature enacted a statute providing for the employment of police officers by\r\nmunicipalities.  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-110 (Supp. 2001) provides, in part, \"police officers shall be vested with all the powers and duties conferred\r\nupon constables, in addition to the special duties imposed upon them by the municipality . . . .\"  (Emphasis added).  In my view, by vesting municipal police\r\nofficers with all of the powers and duties of constables, the legislature exempted municipal police officers from the prohibition against dual office holding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. See S.C. Const. art. VI, Â§3 and art. XVII, Â§1A (Supp. 2001); see also art. III, Â§24 (restrictions on members of the General Assembly) and art. V, Â§16 (restrictions\r\non certain judicial officers) (Supp. 2001).\r\n2. U.S. Const. amend. XIV.\r\n3. The office of constable has long existed in South Carolina; there are references to the office in Locke's \"The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina\" adopted in\r\n1670. \r\n4. S.C. Code Ann. Â§22-9-50 (1976).\r\n5. S.C. Code Ann. Â§22-9-90 (1976).\r\n6. S.C. Code Ann. Â§22-9-80 (1976).\r\n7. S.C. Code Ann. Â§22-9-100 and -110 (1976).\r\n8. S.C. Code Ann. Â§22-9-70 (1976).\r\n9. Id.\r\n\r\n10. But see  S.C. Code Ann. Â§59-119-340 (1976)(authorizing the board of trustees of Clemson University, acting as the governing body of the municipal\r\ncorporation of \"Clemson University,\" to \"appoint one or more special constables who shall exercise all the power of a State constable or of a municipal policeman\r\nto enforce obedience to the ordinances of the board and to the laws of the State\") .\r\n11. Despite this delegation of state constable authority, municipal police officers generally have no jurisdiction beyond the municipality's territorial limits.  See\r\nState v. Harris, 299 S.C. 157, 382 S.E.2d 925 (1989).\r\n12. We point out that were there, in fact, an equal protection violation in the constable exception, the remedy would not be to expand the exempted class to include\r\nRespondent as was suggested by the circuit court, but rather to strike the exemption in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25493","title":"Bower v.

National General denied the claim based on the fact that\r\nBower's father had rejected its offer to purchase UIM coverage.\r\n\r\nBower filed this action alleging that National General failed \r\n  to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage. Therefore, Bower sought to have \r\n  the policy reformed to include UIM coverage up to the limits of the insurance \r\n  policy. (1) On cross-motions for summary judgment, \r\n  the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of National General. The Court \r\n  of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to the trial court to enter \r\n  summary judgment in favor of Bower and to reform the contract up to the liability \r\n  limits. Bower, supra.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that National General's offer of UIM coverage was not\r\nmeaningful because the offer did not inform Bower's father of the right to select optional\r\ncoverages which were not listed on the form.  The form stated in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour automobile insurance policy does not automatically provide any underinsured motorist\r\ncoverage.  You have, however, a right to buy underinsured motorist coverage in limits up to\r\nthe limits of liability coverage you will carry under your automobile insurance policy.  The\r\nlimits of underinsured motorist coverage, together with the additional premiums you\r\nwill be charged, are shown upon this Form. \r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIn the future, if you wish to increase or to decrease your limits of additional uninsured or\r\nunderinsured coverage, you must then contact your insurance company. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  On the other side of the form, under a separate heading entitled OFFER\r\nUNDERINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE, the form listed four bodily injury limits with\r\nthe applicable premium and four property damage limits with the applicable premium. (2)  The\r\nform then continued as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you wish to purchase Underinsured Motorists Coverage?\r\n\r\nYes ____ No ____\r\n\r\nIf your answer is \"no\" you must then sign here. ______________________\r\n\r\nIf your answer is \"yes\" then specify the limits which you desire.  These limits cannot exceed\r\nyour automobile insurance liability limits.\r\n\r\n  select Under insured Motorists Bodily Injury limits of: \r\n    ________ / ________\r\n\r\n  select Under insured Motorists Property Damage limits of: \r\n    _____________\r\n\r\n\r\nBower's father checked the \"No\" box declining UIM coverage and signed the form.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals stated that the language on National \r\n  General's form could be \"fairly construed as an offer to purchase only \r\n  those coverage amounts identified on the form. . . .\" Bower, 342 S.C. \r\n  at 319, 536 S.E.2d at 695 (emphasis in original). Because Bower's father was \r\n  not informed he could choose any amount of UIM coverage, the Court of Appeals \r\n  held National General failed to make a meaningful offer.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid National General make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nNational General argues that the Court of Appeals erred in finding it did not make a\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM coverage.  Specifically, National General contends that the Court of\r\nAppeals failed to apply, or misapplied, the applicable precedents on this issue.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina law, automobile insurance carriers \r\n  must offer \"at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up \r\n  to the limits of the insured liability coverage. . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 \r\n  (Supp. 2000). In Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 311 S.E.2d \r\n  723 (1984), we stated that \"underinsured motorist coverage in any amount \r\n  up to the insured's liability coverage must be offered to a policyholder.\" Id. \r\n  at 154, 311 S.E.2d at 726 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe insurer bears the burden of establishing it made a meaningful \r\n  offer of UIM coverage. Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d \r\n  758 (1996). \"[A] noncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer at all.\" \r\n  Hanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57, 389 S.E.2d \r\n  657, 659 (1990). If an insurer fails to make a meaningful offer, the policy \r\n  will be reformed by operation of law to include UIM coverage up to the insured's \r\n  liability limits. E.g., id.; Butler, supra.\r\n\r\nIn State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (1987), we adopted the following four-prong test \r\n  by which to determine whether an insurer made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the insurer's notification process must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in\r\nwriting;  \r\n\r\n(2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional\r\ncoverage in general terms; \r\n\r\n(3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage;  and \r\n\r\n(4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556.\r\n\r\nThe issue in the instant case involves the fourth prong \r\n  of the Wannamaker test. Bower argued to the Court of Appeals that National General's \r\n  offer did not inform him of the right to select optional coverages which were \r\n  not listed on its form, and therefore, its offer was not meaningful \r\n  under Wannamaker. The Court of Appeals agreed. National General's primary \r\n  argument to this Court is that the instant case is indistinguishable from Norwood \r\n  v. Allstate Insurance Co., 327 S.C. 503, 489 S.E.2d 661 (Ct. App. 1997) \r\n  where the Court of Appeals found the offer of UIM coverage meaningful.\r\n\r\nIn Norwood, Allstate's form listed three choices \r\n  of UIM coverage up to Norwood's 25,000/50,000/25,000 liability limits. \r\n  (3) Allstate's form indicated Norwood could purchase UIM coverage \r\n  \"up to\" her liability limits. According to the Court of Appeals' opinion, the \r\n  offer form also \"instruct[ed] Norwood how to either increase or decrease her \r\n  limits of UIM coverage.\" Id. at 506, 489 S.E.2d at 663. Based on these \r\n  considerations, the Court of Appeals concluded that Norwood \"had the ability \r\n  . . . to select varying amounts of UIM coverage up to the liability limits of \r\n  her policy.\" Id.\r\n\r\nNational General contends that Norwood established \r\n  a three-part test for the fourth prong of the Wannamaker test. According \r\n  to National General, if a form offers at least three choices of UIM coverage, \r\n  specifies that the applicant can purchase UIM coverage \"up to\" the liability \r\n  limits, and instructs the applicant how to increase or decrease UIM coverage, \r\n  then the offer is meaningful as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nWe disagree that any such \"test\" was created by the Court \r\n  of Appeals. However, National General is correct in that the Norwood \r\n  court held Allstate's offer meaningful based primarily on these three factual \r\n  considerations, and that the same facts are present in the instant case. We \r\n  nonetheless agree with the Court of Appeals that Norwood is distinguishable \r\n  from this case.\r\n\r\nNational General's form contained the following language \r\n  that the form in Norwood did not:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe limits of underinsured motorist coverage, together with the additional premiums you will\r\nbe charged, are shown upon this Form.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). The Court of Appeals found this language \r\n  indicated to the insured that the only options available were the UIM coverages \r\n  listed on the form. Specifically, the Court of Appeals found that this language \r\n  was similar to that used by the insurer in Wilkes v. Freeman, 334 S.C. \r\n  206, 512 S.E.2d 530 (Ct. App. 1999). In Wilkes, the insurer's UIM explanation \r\n  form stated that:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the limits of underinsured motor vehicle coverage we sell, together with the additional\r\npremiums you will be charged, are shown on this form. \r\n\r\n\r\n334 S.C. at 210, 512 S.E.2d at 532 (emphasis added). The \r\n  Court of Appeals held that despite the fact that the offer form showed three \r\n  limits equal to or less than Wilkes's liability coverage, the form failed to \r\n  provide any indication that the applicant may request other coverage amounts. \r\n  Id. Significantly, the Court of Appeals stated that \"merely listing several \r\n  available options without providing a clear description on how the applicant \r\n  may request other limits is insufficient to discharge the insurer's duty under \r\n  section 38-77-160.\" Id. at 211-12, 512 S.E.2d at 533.\r\n\r\nWe agree that Wilkes is factually analogous to the \r\n  instant case. While the language on National General's form did not state outright \r\n  that \"all\" available limits are listed, as the form in Wilkes did, a \r\n  common-sense reading of this language would lead a reasonable person to that \r\n  conclusion. In other words, because of this language, National General's form \r\n  fails to inform an insured that \"underinsured motorist coverage in any \r\n  amount up to the insured's liability coverage\" is what is actually \r\n  being offered. Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. at 154, 311 S.E.2d \r\n  at 726 (emphasis added). (4)\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold that National General's offer cannot \r\n  be considered meaningful since it did not inform Bower that any \r\n  limits up to the liability limits could be purchased. As the Court of Appeals \r\n  observed: \"Had National General intended the listed coverages to be mere \r\n  examples of available coverages or the most common coverages chosen, \r\n  it certainly could have said so.\" Bower, 342 S.C. at 319, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 695 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIndeed, we note that the South Carolina Department of Insurance (DOI) has issued a sample\r\noffer form which clearly communicates this idea.  The form includes the following language:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour automobile insurance policy does not automatically provide any underinsured motorist\r\ncoverage.  You have, however, a right to buy underinsured motorist coverage in limits up to\r\nthe limits of liability coverage you will carry under you automobile insurance policy.  Some of\r\nthe more commonly sold limits of underinsured motorist coverage, together with the\r\nadditional premiums you will be charged, are shown upon this Form.  If there are other\r\nlimits in which you are interested, but which are not shown upon this Form, then fill in\r\nthose limits.  If your insurance company is allowed to market those limits within this State,\r\nyour insurance agent will fill in the amount of increased premium.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  This language would effectively communicate to an insured that there are\r\navailable limits of UIM coverage other than those limits listed on the form.  We strongly\r\nencourage insurers to include such language on their offer forms.  While the DOI's exact\r\nlanguage need not be provided, we believe that this or similar language certainly would make\r\nthe offer of UIM coverage in any amount up to the liability limits truly meaningful to the\r\ninsured. (5)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the Court of Appeals correctly reversed summary judgment for National General and\r\nordered that judgment be entered for Bower and the policy be reformed up to the liability\r\nlimits.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nMOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion\r\nin which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent.  In my opinion, National General made a\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM to Bower.  Therefore, I would reverse the Court of Appeals decision\r\nand decline to reform Bower's policy up to the liability limits.\r\n\r\nIn Wannamaker, this Court expressly adopted the four-part test developed by the Supreme\r\nCourt of Minnesota discussed by the majority.  The fourth prong of that test at issue here\r\nmandates that \"the insured must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional\r\npremium.\"  Wannamaker, 291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556 (citing Hastings v. United\r\nPacific Ins. Co., 318 N.W.2d 849 (Minn. 1982).  In the present case, National General's\r\npolicy stated, \"[y]ou have . . . a right to buy underinsured motorist coverage in limits up to the\r\nlimits of liability coverage you will carry under your automobile insurance policy.\"  In\r\naddition, the policy listed at least 4 choices of coverage for underinsured coverage, 3 of which\r\nwent up to the limits of Bower's coverage.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the policy provided a blank space for the insured \"to specify the limits you desire.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this language is very similar to the offer of UIM approved in Norwood, the majority\r\ndistinguishes Bower's policy from the Norwood policy based on the statement in Bower's\r\npolicy that \"[t]he limits of [UIM] coverage, together with the additional premiums you will be\r\ncharged, are shown upon this Form.\"  (Emphasis added).  I concede the language would be\r\nclearer if, instead, the policy stated explicitly that the insured could purchase UIM coverage in\r\nany amount up to the insured's limits, including amounts not shown on the form.  However,\r\nwe have not mandated that insurers are required to use the exact language recommended by\r\nthe Department of Insurance and quoted by the majority in order to make an offer of UIM\r\nmeaningful.  I disagree that the language in the policy at issue would lead a reasonable person\r\nto believe that coverage could only be purchased in the amounts shown, and would find it\r\nrepresents a meaningful offer of UIM under Wannamaker.\r\n\r\nThe majority correctly points out that the insurer bears the burden of establishing it made a\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM.  At issue in this case is whether the insured was told optional\r\ncoverages were available for an additional premium.  Wannamaker.  As discussed in the\r\nmajority opinion, National General listed up to nine combinations of available UIM coverage\r\non its form, and left a blank space for the insured \"to specify the limits you desire\" on the\r\nform.  I simply do not agree with the majority that this offer was not meaningful under the\r\nobjective, reasonable person standard set out in Wannamaker. (6)\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, National General did make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Bower, but\r\nBower chose not to purchase UIM and knowingly rejected National General's meaningful\r\noffer for it.  Therefore, reforming his policy to provide it would result in a windfall for Bower. \r\nAccordingly, I would deny coverage and REVERSE.\r\n\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n1. The policy's liability limits were: $100,000/$300,000/$50,000.\r\n2. The bodily injury limits offered were: 25,000/50,000; 50,000/100,000; 100,000/300,000;\r\nand 250,000/500,000.  The property damage limits offered were: 10,000; 25,000; 50,000; and\r\n100,000.  Given Bower's policy limits of 100,000/300,000/50,000, the form listed three\r\nchoices each of bodily injury and property damage UIM coverage which were equal to or less\r\nthan Bower's limits.\r\n3. The parties have made the Allstate \r\n  form from the Norwood case a part of the record in this case. Allstate's \r\n  form listed a total of six options for limits up to 250,000/500,000/50,000, \r\n  three of which went up to Norwood's limits. In this case, National General's \r\n  form listed four limits, three of which went up to Bower's liability limits. \r\n  Therefore, just as in Norwood, there were three available \r\n  limits from which Bower could choose UIM coverage. However, because National \r\n  General separated the bodily injury limits from the property damage limits and \r\n  there were three choices for each, technically there were up to nine combinations \r\n  for UIM coverage listed upon the form. \r\n4. The dissent suggests that had Bower \r\n  been \"interested\" in purchasing UIM coverage, he simply could have filled in \r\n  any amount desired in the blank spaces provided by the National General offer \r\n  form. The dissent, however, appears to shift the inquiry to the insured's subjective \r\n  intent regarding UIM coverage, when the appropriate inquiry rests on the offer \r\n  made by the insurer. See Butler, supra (the insurer bears \r\n  the burden of establishing it made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage); Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556 (\"the burden is on the insurer to effectively \r\n  transmit the offer to the insured\") (emphasis added). Moreover, we held in Wannamaker \r\n  that the statute governing the offer of UIM coverage \"mandates the insured to \r\n  be provided with adequate information, and in such a manner, as to allow \r\n  the insured to make an intelligent decision of whether to accept or \r\n  reject the coverage.\" Id. (emphasis added). Here, National General's \r\n  offer of UIM coverage was made in such a manner as to convey that the only available \r\n  limits were the ones shown upon the offer form. The offer therefore failed to \r\n  provide Bower with the information needed \"to make an intelligent decision of \r\n  whether to accept or reject the coverage.\" Id. While we agree with the \r\n  dissent that an insured must \"exercise common sense,\" we certainly cannot expect \r\n  an insured to act intelligently when, as a matter of law, an offer has not been \r\n  meaningfully conveyed. See Hanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., \r\n  301 S.C. at 57, 389 S.E.2d at 659 (\"a noncomplying offer has the legal effect \r\n  of no offer at all\"). \r\n5. Both this Court and the Court of Appeals \r\n  have, in previous cases, quoted with approval this language from the DOI's form. \r\n  See Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996); \r\n  Rabb v. Catawba Ins. Co., 339 S.C. 228, 528 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2000); \r\n  Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 462 S.E.2d 291 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995), aff'd, Op. No. 96-MO-00222 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 9, 1996). \r\n6. The language is not analogous to the policy language in Wilkes v. Freeman, as the majority\r\nargues it is.  The Wilkes policy stated, \"All of the limits of underinsured motorist coverage we\r\nsell, together with the additional premiums you will be charged, are shown on this form.\" \r\nWilkes, 334 S.C. at 208, 512 S.E.2d at 531. (Emphasis added).  Bower's policy did not state\r\n\"all\" the limits of UIM \"we sell\" are listed on this form, and it provided a blank space for\r\nBower \"to specify the limits you desire.\"  The statement in Wilkes is much more definitive\r\nthan the one in Bower's policy, especially considering the blank space provided for Bower to\r\nspecify the coverage he desired.  If Bower was interested in purchasing different coverage\r\namounts of UIM, he could have written in the amount desired in the blank space provided in\r\nhis policy.  Although the insurer bears the burden of establishing it made a meaningful offer, I\r\ndo not believe making a meaningful offer obviates the need for the insured to exercise\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25494","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense,\r\nof Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\nAssistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S.\r\nCreighton Waters, all of Columbia,  and Solicitor C. Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  Appellant, Bobby Wayne Stone, was convicted of murder, first-degree burglary, and possession of a weapon during a violent crime.  He was sentenced to\r\ndeath for murder, and consecutively sentenced to thirty years for burglary, and five years for\r\npossession of a weapon.  We affirm the convictions, but reverse Stone's death sentence and\r\nremand for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly before 7:00p.m. on February 26, 1996, Ruth Griffith heard gunshots in her backyard. \r\nShe called her next door neighbor, Landrow Taylor, who came over; the two called 911.  As\r\nthey waited in the living room, Griffith and Taylor heard someone come onto the screened\r\nporch on the side of the house and start banging on the door to the house.  A wooden board\r\nwhich had  been nailed over a broken window pane on the lower right-hand corner of the door\r\nbroke out.  Sumter police officer, Sergeant Charles Kubala arrived at 7:07p.m.; he was\r\nmotioned to the side of the house by Taylor.  As Taylor and Griffith waited inside the house,\r\nthey heard someone shout \"Halt\" or \"Hold It\" followed immediately by three or four gunshots. \r\nA second police officer arrived to find Kubala had been shot in the right ear and neck.  Kubala\r\ndied at the scene.   \r\n\r\nAfter four hours of searching the wooded area behind Griffith's home, Stone was found lying\r\nbeneath two fallen trees, with a .22 caliber pistol under him.  A shotgun had been left on the\r\nscreened porch.  Stone confessed to the shooting, but claimed he had drank about twelve beers\r\nin the six hours prior to the shooting.  He told police that when he heard a man's voice yelling\r\nat him from outside the screened porch, he turned and the gun went off, so he ran. (1)  The jury\r\nconvicted Stone of murder, first degree burglary, and possession of a firearm during\r\ncommission of a violent crime. \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Did the court err in failing to direct a verdict on the charge of first-degree burglary?\r\n\r\n2.  Did the court err in excusing a juror during sentencing?\r\n\r\n3.  Did the court err in refusing to charge the statutory mitigating circumstances of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) &amp; (7)(Supp. 2001)?\r\n\r\n4.  Did the court err in failing to instruct the jury that Stone would be ineligible for parole if\r\nsentenced to life imprisonment?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  DIRECTED VERDICT- FIRST DEGREE BURGLARY\r\n\r\n\r\nStone asserts he was entitled to a directed verdict on the charge of burglary as there was no\r\nevidence he entered Ruth Griffith's \"dwelling.\"  We disagree.\r\n\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(Supp. 2001), a person is guilty of burglary in the first\r\ndegree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in\r\nthe dwelling, and the entering is accompanied by an aggravating circumstance.  For purposes\r\nof burglary, a \"dwelling house\" is defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-10 (1985) as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the crimes of burglary and arson and to all criminal offenses which are\r\nconstituted or aggravated by being committed in a dwelling house, any house, outhouse,\r\napartment, building, erection, shed or box in which there sleeps a proprietor, tenant,\r\nwatchman, clerk, laborer or person who lodges there with a view to the protection of property\r\nshall be deemed a dwelling house, and of such a dwelling house or of any other dwelling\r\nhouse all houses, outhouses, buildings, sheds and erections which are within two hundred\r\nyards of it and are appurtenant to it or to the same establishment of which it is an\r\nappurtenance shall be deemed parcels.\r\n\r\n\r\nA \"dwelling\" also means the living quarters of a building which is used or normally used for\r\nsleeping, living, or lodging by a person.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310 (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\nWe find Griffith's screened porch meets the statutory definition of a dwelling.  The porch is\r\nattached to the left side of Griffith's house.  It has three concrete block  stairs going up to it,\r\nand appears from photographs to be very small, approximately four feet on each side, with\r\nwood panels which extend two-thirds of the way up on two sides, and a screened door on the\r\nthird side.  The porch leads into and out of the laundry room and is used primarily to store\r\nwood and paint cans.  Griffith uses the porch for ingress and egress to her clothesline outside. \r\nWe find the screened porch is appurtenant, and is used for the protection of Griffith's property\r\n(paint and wood) so as to come within the definition of a dwelling. \r\n\r\nWe have not previously addressed, under the current burglary \r\n  statute, whether a fully enclosed screened porch is a dwelling within the meaning \r\n  of section 16-11-10. In the 1913 case of State v. Puckett, 95 S.C. 114, \r\n  78 S.E. 737 (1913), we addressed whether the defendant could be convicted of \r\n  burglary for entering an unenclosed piazza, which had a two and one-half foot \r\n  balustrade, and was open on the top 6-7 feet, with a picket gate on each end \r\n  to keep out chickens and dogs. Under the facts of the case, the Court held the \r\n  evidence did not show the piazza was such a part of the dwelling house as was \r\n  contemplated by law to make it an offense to enter in the nighttime against \r\n  the security of the dwelling house. (2) However, \r\n  at the time Puckett was decided, common law required a breaking in order \r\n  to establish the offense of burglary. The offense of burglary no longer requires \r\n  such a breaking. Further, unlike Puckett, the porch here was completely \r\n  enclosed and was utilized for the protection of Griffith's property. We find \r\n  these factors sufficient to demonstrate the porch was part of Griffith's dwelling. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, numerous courts in other jurisdictions have \r\n  held screened porches qualify as part of a dwelling for purposes of burglary \r\n  statutes. See State v. Bordley, 2000 WL 706788 (Del. Super. 2000); \r\n  State v. Jenkins 741 S.W.2d 767, 768-770 (Mo.Ct.App.1987) (upholding \r\n  burglary conviction for entry into enclosed screen porch despite unsuccessful \r\n  attempt to open inner door to home); Davis v. State, 938 P.2d 1076 (Alaska \r\n  1997); People v. Wise, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 416- 18 (1994); Johnson \r\n  v. Commonwealth, 875 S.W.2d 105, 106-07 (Ky.App.1994); People v. McIntyre, \r\n  578 N.E.2d 314 (Ill. 1991) (screened porch attached to house was part of \"living \r\n  quarters\" and thus was a \"dwelling\"); State v. Lawrence, 572 So.2d 276, \r\n  278-79 (La.App.1990)(particular back porch was part of the residence; porch \r\n  was fully enclosed screened porch underneath the main roof); State v. Watts, \r\n  76 N.C.App. 656, 334 S.E.2d 68, 70 (1985); People v. Lewoc, 475 N.Y.S.2d \r\n  933, 934 (1984)(fully enclosed porch, with windows and walls of wooden construction \r\n  running length of the house); State v. Gatewood, 221 P.2d 392 (Kan. 1950)( \r\n  porch which was screened in and connected to kitchen by door and window). Similarly, \r\n  other courts have held appurtenant structures to a home, even if not directly \r\n  accessible from the home, are nonetheless part of the \"dwelling\" as contemplated \r\n  by burglary statutes. See State v. Maykoski, 583 N.W.2d 587 (Minn. \r\n  1998) (basement); People v. Ingram, 40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d \r\n  256 (5th Dist.1995) (garage attached to house, even though not connected by \r\n  an inside doorway to the inhabited part of house); People v. Moreno, \r\n  158 Cal. App. 3d 109, 204 Cal. Rptr. 17 (1984)(\"given that garage was under \r\n  the same roof, functionally interconnected with, and immediately contiguous \r\n  to other portions of the house, simple logic would suffer were we to leap over \r\n  this interrelationship to a conclusion that a garage is not part of a dwelling \r\n  because no inside entrance connects the two\"). \r\n\r\nWe find the screened porch is part of the \"dwelling.\"  Accordingly, Stone was not entitled to a\r\ndirected verdict.\r\n\r\n2.  REMOVAL OF JUROR DURING SENTENCING\r\n\r\n\r\nStone next asserts the trial court abused its discretion in removing  Juror Clydie Thompson\r\nduring sentencing.  We agree.\r\n\r\nAt sentencing, the state called Stone's aunt, Bernice Perry, as a witness.  When Perry was\r\nplaced on the witness stand, Juror Thompson indicated to the court that she knew Ms. Perry. \r\nAlthough Perry had been announced as a witness at the start of voir dire, Thompson did not\r\nknow her name.  Thompson had lived down the street from Perry five or six years earlier, and\r\nthey were casual acquaintances only.  Thompson indicated her acquaintance would not affect\r\nher ability to be fair and impartial.  \r\n\r\nThe solicitor objected to Thompson's continued participation contending it would be difficult\r\nfor her to impose a death sentence on a former acquaintance's nephew.  The court removed\r\nJuror Thompson and replaced her with the second alternate juror.  We find this was error.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 587-88, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  282, 284 (2001), we recently stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  When a juror conceals information inquired into during \r\n    voir dire, a new trial is required only when the court finds the juror intentionally \r\n    concealed the information, and that the information concealed would have supported \r\n    a challenge for cause or would have been a material factor in the use of the \r\n    party's peremptory challenges. Thompson v. O'Rourke, \r\n    288 S.C. 13, 15, 339 S.E.2d 505, 506 (1986). Where a juror, without justification, \r\n    fails to disclose a relationship, it may be inferred, nothing to the contrary \r\n    appearing, that the juror is not impartial. On the other hand, where the failure \r\n    to disclose is innocent, no such inference may be drawn. State v. Savage, \r\n    306 S.C. 5, 409 S.E.2d 809 (Ct.App.1991). \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the present case does not involve a new trial, \r\n  Woods is instructive. It is patent here that Juror Thompson's failure \r\n  to disclose her acquaintance with Perry was innocent. Moreover, we find her \r\n  scant acquaintance would neither have supported a challenge for cause nor would \r\n  it have been a material factor in the state's exercise of its peremptory challenges. \r\n  Thompson clearly indicated her former acquaintance with a witness whose name \r\n  she did not even know, would not have affected her in any way. Accordingly, \r\n  we hold the trial court abused its discretion in removing her. \r\n\r\n3.  CHARGE ON STATUTORY MITIGATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nStone next asserts reversible error in the trial court's refusal to charge, at sentencing, the\r\nstatutory mitigating factors set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) and (7) (Supp.\r\n2001), to wit, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to\r\nconform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired, and the age or\r\nmentality of the defendant at the time of the crime.  He claims the charges were mandated due\r\nto evidence that he was intoxicated at the time of the crime.  We agree. \r\n\r\nIn State v. Pierce, 289 S.C. 430, 435, 346 S.E.2d \r\n  707, 711 (1986), overruled on other grounds, State v. Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. 405, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), we held that \"the trial judge was required \r\n  by law to instruct the jury on statutory mitigating circumstances 2, 6, and \r\n  7, given the evidence showing Pierce was using drugs and extremely intoxicated \r\n  during the commission of the crime. The failure to instruct is not harmless \r\n  error.\" (Emphasis supplied). Thereafter, in State v. Plemmons, \r\n  296 S.C. 76, 78, 370 S.E.2d 871, 872 (1988), we held the specific statutory \r\n  mitigating circumstances of subsections (2), (6), and (7) need not be submitted \r\n  to the jury if the trial court gives a specific charge on the \r\n  defendant's voluntary intoxication as mitigating circumstance. \r\n  (3)  \r\n\r\nWe have specifically rejected the contention that a charge \r\n  on one mitigator is sufficient to cover the others. State v. Young, 305 \r\n  S.C. 380, 409 S.E.2d 352 (1991) (where there is evidence the defendant was intoxicated \r\n  at the time of the crime, the trial judge is required to submit \r\n  the statutory mitigating circumstances in Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6) and (7)); \r\n  (4)  State v. Plemmons, supra. We adhere to these precedents \r\n  and hold the trial court erred in refusing to charge these statutory mitigating \r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\nFurther, we find the error was exacerbated by the trial \r\n  court's supplemental instructions to the jury. After the jury had been charged \r\n  at sentencing, the court specifically called them back for the purpose of reminding \r\n  them of its earlier instruction, during guilt phase, that \"voluntary intoxication \r\n  is not a defense to criminal act or actions.\" We find reasonable jurors would \r\n  clearly have understood this instruction as preventing them from considering \r\n  evidence of Stone's intoxication in mitigation. To the extent the charge prohibited \r\n  the jury from considering the mitigating circumstance of Stone's intoxication, \r\n  it violated the Eighth Amendment. See  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. \r\n  808, 822, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), citing Eddings v. \r\n  Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982)(Eighth Amendment \r\n  prohibits state from limiting sentencer's consideration of \"any relevant mitigating \r\n  evidence\" which could cause the jury to decline to impose the death penalty). \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court's refusal to instruct on the statutory mitigating \r\n  circumstances of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(6)&amp;(7) and its instruction \r\n  concerning voluntary intoxication require reversal. \r\n\r\n4. PAROLE INELIGIBILITY CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sentencing, during its closing argument, the state argued that Stone is \"going to be a\r\nproblem in the future- a problem in the future in the prison system.\"  The solicitor went on to\r\nargue that \"throughout his life, he has been a problem.  He has not been willing to obey the\r\nlaws of society.\"  In talking about Stone's 1987 burglary convictions, the solicitor stated,\r\n\"This guy who wants you to give him mercy this time.  He got thirty years.  Then you see\r\nwhat happened after that and how he manipulated the system and [eventually got paroled]. . .\r\nand when he is paroled he signs and acknowledges . . . [he] may not possess any weapon\r\nwhatsoever. . . a condition of parole. . . Was he able to abide by that rule?  This guy that wants\r\nyou to show him mercy now?. . . . He is not going to follow the rules. He hasn't done it in the\r\npast.  He's not going to do it in the future.\"  The solicitor went on to argue \"You make sure\r\nthat no correctional officer- or somebody else if he were to escape or something- nobody else\r\nis up here like this Kubala family. . .\"  Finally, the solicitor argued, \"I'm asking you to carry\r\nout . . . a criminal justice system that works and deters criminals, deters Bobby Wayne Stone\r\nfrom ever doing anything like this again to any correctional officer or anyone else.\" \r\n\r\nAfter the court charged the jury, defense counsel requested an instruction concerning \"life\r\nimprisonment, life in prison without parole.\"  The court then called the jury back in and\r\ninstructed that \"[u]nder our law life imprisonment means that a person will be- will serve the\r\nbalance of his life in prison, okay?\"  Stone asserts the trial court erred in failing to instruct the\r\njury that if sentenced to life imprisonment, he would be ineligible for parole.  We agree.\r\n\r\nUnder the recent precedents of Kelly v. South Carolina, \r\n  534 U.S. 246, 122 S.Ct. 726, 151 L.Ed. 2d 670 (2002) and Shafer v. South \r\n  Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263, 149 L.Ed.2d 178 (2001), Stone was \r\n  entitled to an instruction that if sentenced to life imprisonment, he would \r\n  be ineligible for parole. In Kelly, the United States Supreme Court held \r\n  that where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only \r\n  sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without \r\n  parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury of his parole \r\n  ineligibility, either by jury instruction or in arguments by counsel. The Kelly \r\n  court specifically noted that arguments by counsel in Shafer to the effect \r\n  that the defendant \"would die in prison\" or would \"spend his natural life there\" \r\n  as well as the trial judge's instructions that \"life imprisonment means until \r\n  the death of the defendant\" were insufficient to convey a clear understanding \r\n  to Shafer's parole ineligibility. 122 S.Ct. at 733-34. The Court also noted \r\n  that the fact that the jury did not request further instructions concerning \r\n  parole ineligibility was irrelevant. 122 S.Ct. at 733. Finally, the Kelly \r\n  court noted that \"evidence of future dangerousness in prison can raise a strong \r\n  implication of 'generalized . . . future dangerousness'. . . . A jury hearing \r\n  evidence of a defendant's demonstrated propensity for violence reasonably will \r\n  conclude that he presents a risk of violent behavior, whether locked up or free, \r\n  and whether free as a fugitive or as a parolee.\" 122 S.Ct. at 731.\r\n\r\nHere, it is patent the state argued Stone's future dangerousness \r\n  to the jury, both in the context of his danger in prison and the possibility \r\n  he could escape in the future. Moreover, notwithstanding counsel and the court \r\n  told the jury Stone would spend the rest of his life in prison, these statements \r\n  do not clearly convey to the jury the fact that Stone would be ineligible for \r\n  parole as required by Kelly. Accordingly, the trial court's failure to \r\n  instruct that Stone would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life imprisonment \r\n  requires reversal.\r\n\r\nStone's remaining issue is affirmed pursuant to SCACR, Rule \r\n  220(b) and the following authorities: Stone's issue 3- State v. Von Dohlen, \r\n  322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996) (admission of expert testimony is within \r\n  discretion of trial court). (5)\r\n\r\nStone's convictions are affirmed, as are his sentences for burglary and possession of a\r\nweapon.  The matter is remanded for a new sentencing proceeding on his murder conviction.  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1.   Stone claimed he had gone to visit Griffith as he had dated Griffith's niece a few years\r\nearlier and had previously been to her home.\r\n2.  The Puckett Court noted that \r\n  on the night in question it was damp and raining and the defendant was found \r\n  on the piazza \"under suspicious circumstances.\" The Court found that \"there \r\n  is no evidence that he stole anything or made any overt act to commit a felony.\" \r\n  78 S.E. at 737. Accordingly, Puckett could have been decided on the basis \r\n  of a lack of intent to commit a crime. Whether the piazza was part of the \"dwelling\" \r\n  was unnecessary to resolution of the case. \r\n3.   Here, there was no such charge.  To the contrary, the jury was specifically charged that\r\nvoluntary intoxication was not a defense.\r\n4.  In Young, the trial judge \r\n  had charged the jury on the mitigators in subsections 6 &amp; 7, but had not \r\n  charged subsection 2. We held this was error. \r\n5.   In conjunction with his first issue, Stone asserted that, if he was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict on the burglary charge, then the trial court's charge to the jury that it could not convict\r\nhim of involuntary manslaughter if it found him guilty of burglary was error.  In light of our\r\nholding that Stone was not entitled to a directed verdict on the burglary charge, this claim is\r\nmoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25495","title":"McClanahan v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\n\r\nAppellant (1) filed a declaratory judgment action against respondents\r\nchallenging the procedures by which the Richland County Comprehensive Land Use\r\nPlan (the Plan) was adopted. Appellant's complaint alleged the following causes\r\nof action: (1) violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-520 (B) (Supp. 2001); (2) \r\n(2) violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-120 (1986); (3)(3) violation of due process; (4) unlawful taking in\r\nviolation of S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 3 (&quot;no person shall be deprived of\r\nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law&quot;); and (5) request\r\nfor award of costs and attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss appellant's complaint. Judge\r\nWilliam P. Keesley dismissed the procurement cause of action, which was\r\ncontained within appellant's third cause of action (alleging a due process\r\nviolation). Appellant did not appeal that dismissal.\r\n\r\nThereafter, respondents filed a motion for partial summary\r\njudgment on appellant's third cause of action. Appellant filed a memorandum in\r\nopposition to respondents' motion and filed a motion for summary judgment on his\r\nfirst and second causes of action. Respondents then filed a motion for summary\r\njudgment on the first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action. Respondents'\r\nmotions for summary judgment were granted.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe compliance deadline for counties to adopt a comprehensive \r\n  land use plan under the Comprehensive Planning Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6-29-310, \r\n  et seq. (Supp. 2001), was set for May 3, 1999. Accordingly, the Richland \r\n  County Council adopted a schedule for adoption of the Plan.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1999, the Richland County Planning Commission \r\n  (4) received input on the Plan from the public, including input \r\n  from Kay McClanahan (wife of appellant). Thereafter, the Commission voted by \r\n  a 4-3 vote to recommend approval of the Plan, with the exception of the Vision \r\n  portion,  (5) \r\n  to the Richland County Council.\r\n  \r\n  On April 5, 1999, the Commission voted by a 4-2 vote to send the &quot;Land \r\n  Development Regulations forward with the recommendation of approval and to defer \r\n  action on the Vision Plan until it is determined how to incorporate it.&quot; \r\n  Subsequently, during the same Commission meeting, a second vote was taken and \r\n  the motion carried 5-0 &quot;to submit and read the . . . Plan as a resolution.&quot; \r\nOn April 6th, after receiving public input from \r\n  Kay McClanahan and others, the Council gave first reading to the Plan. On April \r\n  13th, the Council held its duly noticed public hearing on the Plan. \r\n  A draft of the plan had been made available for public inspection on April 2nd.\r\n\r\nOn April 26th, the Council called a special meeting. \r\n  Prior to the second reading of the Plan, the proposed amendments to the Plan \r\n  were reviewed. The public, including Kay McClanahan, addressed the Council regarding \r\n  the Plan. The Council then approved the Plan for second reading and incorporated \r\n  the amendments to the Plan.\r\n\r\nOn May 3rd, the Commission, whose meeting commenced \r\n  at 2:30 p.m., recommended the Plan, this time including the Vision portion of \r\n  the Plan, to the Council by a 5-4 vote.\r\n\r\nThe Council met at 7:00 p.m. on the same date. Three proposed \r\n  amendments to the Plan were made available to the public for review at the meeting. \r\n  The public then addressed the Council regarding the Plan. Thereafter, the Council \r\n  unanimously passed the resolution adopting the Plan and incorporating the amendments.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn \r\n  from the facts are undisputed. Garvin v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 343 S.C. 625, 541 \r\n  S.E.2d 831 (2001) (citation omitted). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, \r\n  the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom should be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id.\r\n\r\nISSUES \r\n  (6)  \r\n\r\n  I. Whether the failure to follow statutory procedure in \r\n    approving the Plan renders the Plan void?\r\n  II. Whether the trial court misapplied the law with\r\n  respect to appellant's due process claim?\r\n  III. Whether the trial court failed to allow the\r\n  completion of necessary discovery prior to the summary judgment hearing on the\r\n  due process claim?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the Council's first and second readings \r\n  of the Plan are invalid because the Planning Commission failed to recommend \r\n  the Plan prior to those readings. Appellant states that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-510(E) \r\n  (Supp. 2001) requires that the Commission must recommend the Plan to the Council. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the \r\n  one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended \r\n  purpose of the statute. South Carolina Life and Accident and Health Ins. \r\n  Guar. Ass'n v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 344 S.C. 436, 545 S.E.2d 270 (2001).\r\n\r\nSection 6-29-510(E) states, &quot;All planning elements \r\n  must be an expression of the planning commission recommendations to the appropriate \r\n  governing bodies . . .,&quot; and section 6-29-510(D) states that a plan &quot;must \r\n  include . . . the . . . planning elements.&quot; Because the Plan must \r\n  include the enumerated planning elements and the planning elements must \r\n  be an expression of the Commission's recommendations to the Council, the Council \r\n  cannot approve the plan until the Commission has recommended the plan. Cf. \r\n  South Carolina Police Officers Retirement Sys. v. City of Spartanburg, \r\n  301 S.C. 188, 391 S.E.2d 239 (1990) (&quot;must&quot; is considered mandatory \r\n  under principles of statutory construction). However, this fact does not assist \r\n  appellant because the Commission voted to recommend the Plan to the Council, \r\n  which included the necessary planning elements, one day prior \r\n   (7) to the Council's first reading of the Plan. \r\n  (8)  \r\nWhile the Commission deferred the adoption of the Vision \r\n  plan as the County's adopted vision to guide future growth and development, \r\n  this does not undermine the Commission's recommendation of the Plan to the Council. \r\n  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-510(E) (Supp. 2001), &quot;[a]ll planning elements \r\n  must be an expression of the planning commission recommendations to the appropriate \r\n  governing bodies . . .&quot; The Vision, while not an enumerated planning element, \r\n  (9) is a planning element. \r\nEven though the Vision is an element of the Plan, we find \r\n  the Plan was properly recommended by the Commission on April 5th \r\n  because the Commission has the ability to recommend the plan as a whole or to \r\n  recommend the elements of the Plan in separate instances. See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-530 (Supp. 2001) (&quot;The local planning commission may recommend \r\n  to the appropriate governing body and the body may adopt the plan as a whole \r\n  by a single ordinance or elements of the plan by successive ordinances. . . \r\n  .&quot;).\r\n\r\nBecause the Commission voted to recommend the Plan to the\r\nCouncil prior to the Council giving first reading to the Plan, the trial court\r\nproperly granted respondents' summary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court misapplied the law\r\nregarding his due process claim. He alleges the following facts evidence the\r\nCouncil's failure to provide due process to Richland County citizens: (1)\r\ncertain members of the Council were affected by improper conflicts of interests;\r\n(2) the Council failed to follow procurement procedure so that it could hire\r\nclearly biased &quot;consultants&quot; to prepare the Plan; and (3) the Council\r\nfailed to follow state-mandated procedures in the passage of the Plan. Appellant\r\nstates the trial court mistook the due process claim to be discrete claims of\r\nviolations of ethics rules and the County procurement statute.\r\n\r\nContrary to appellant's assertions, the trial court in fact \r\n  ruled on his due process claim. The court found the adoption process had not \r\n  deprived appellant of his property. The court, noting the Plan is only a guideline \r\n  and that there had not been an impairment of appellant's rights, concluded appellant's \r\n  concerns were not ripe for adjudication.\r\n\r\nAs noted, because the trial court in fact ruled on appellant's \r\n  due process claim, his argument that the trial court misunderstood his due process \r\n  claim is without merit. In any event, even if the trial court misunderstood \r\n  appellant's due process claim, summary judgment on the claim is proper. S.C. \r\n  Const. art. I, Â§ 3, provides that no person shall be deprived of property without \r\n  due process of law. Appellant has not been deprived of due process of law because \r\n  he was not deprived of his property due to the adoption of the Plan, nor due \r\n  to the manner of the Plan's adoption. Appellant's claim in this regard is not \r\n  justiciable because it is not ripe for review. Waters v. South Carolina Land \r\n  Resources Conservation Comm'n, 321 S.C. 219, 467 S.E.2d 913 (1996) (&quot;A \r\n  justiciable controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe \r\n  and appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a contingent, \r\n  hypothetical or abstract dispute.&quot;).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment \r\n  on the due process claim.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by hearing the\r\nmotion for summary judgment on his due process claim without allowing him to\r\ncomplete necessary discovery.\r\n\r\nGiven our conclusion that appellant's due process claim \r\n  is without merit because he has not been deprived of his property, further discovery \r\n  in the form of depositions would not have aided the trial court in its decision \r\n  whether to grant summary judgment on appellant's due process claim. Cf. \r\n  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999) (citation \r\n  omitted) (summary judgment must not be granted until opposing party has had \r\n  full and fair opportunity to complete discovery).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court properly granted summary judgment\r\non appellant's claims.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n1. We refer to appellant in the\r\nsingular because class certification has not been sought or granted pursuant to\r\nRule 23, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nS.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-520 (B) provides: &quot;Recommendation of the plan or any element, \r\n  amendment, extension, or addition must be by resolution of the planning commission, \r\n  carried by the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the entire membership. \r\n  . . .&quot;\r\n3.\r\nS.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 4-9-120 provides: &quot;The council shall take legislative action by \r\n  ordinance which may be introduced by any member. With the exception of emergency \r\n  ordinances, all ordinances shall be read at three public meetings of council \r\n  on three separate days with an interval of not less than seven days between \r\n  the second and third readings. . . .&quot;\r\n4.\r\nThe Richland \r\n  County Planning Commission, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-320 (Supp. 2001) \r\n  (county council of each county may create a county planning commission), was \r\n  created by the Richland County Council. The Commission consists of nine members.\r\n5.\r\nThe Vision \r\n  is an additional part of the Plan that is Richland County's vision to guide \r\n  future growth. \r\n6. At oral argument, appellant withdrew \r\n  the issue regarding whether the Planning Commission lacked authority to pass \r\n  the Plan after two unsuccessful votes.\r\n\r\n7. Appellant raises the issue that the \r\n  trial court's order granting summary judgment was based upon a fact which was \r\n  controverted by respondents' pleading. The fact at issue is whether the Planning \r\n  Commission approved the Comprehensive Plan by a majority of the entire membership \r\n  at its April 5th meeting. Appellant's contention is without merit \r\n  given the clear fact in the Record that the Commission resolved to recommend \r\n  the Plan to the Council on April 5, 1999.\r\n\r\nAppellant further argues that even if a majority vote to \r\n  recommend the Plan was reached on April 5th, respondents are precluded \r\n  by judicial estoppel from alleging that fact. See Hayne Fed. Credit \r\n  Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 489 S.E.2d 472 (1997) (judicial estoppel \r\n  precludes party from adopting position in conflict with one earlier taken in \r\n  same or related litigation). Respondents are not judicially estopped from stating \r\n  a fact that is clear from the record before the trial \r\n  court.\r\n\r\n8. Appellant further appears to argue \r\n  that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 629-520(B) (Supp. 2001) was violated. Section 6-29-520(B) \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recommendation of the plan or any element, amendment, extension, \r\n    or addition must be by resolution of the planning commission, carried by the \r\n    affirmative votes of at least a majority of the entire membership. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant appears to be arguing that this statute mandates \r\n  that the Commission must recommend the Plan prior to the Council giving the \r\n  Plan first reading. However, this statute is for the purpose of stating that \r\n  the Plan can be recommended only if the resolution to recommend is carried by \r\n  the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the members of the Commission. \r\n  This statute is not concerned with whether the Council can give first reading \r\n  to a plan without the Commission's recommendation.\r\n\r\n9.\r\nS.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-510(D) (Supp. 2001) provides: \r\n\r\n  A local comprehensive plan must include, but not be limited \r\n    to, the following planning elements:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (1)\r\n      a population element . . .;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)\r\n      an economic development element . . .;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (3)\r\n      a natural resources element . . .;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (4)\r\n      a cultural resources element . . .;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (5)\r\n      a community facilities element . . .;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (6)\r\n      a housing element . . .;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (7)\r\n      and a land use element . . .\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25496","title":"Sabb v.

After\r\nfinding the exclusivity provision does not involve subject matter jurisdiction,\r\nwe affirm the trial court on the issues raised by appellant.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\n\r\nRespondent (hereinafter referred to as Sabb) brought suit\r\nagainst appellant asserting claims of negligent supervision of an employee and\r\nnegligent retention of an employee, as well as other claims.\r\nUpon the trialâ€™s conclusion, the jury returned a verdict\r\nfor Sabb in the amount of $200,000 in actual damages. Appellant (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as University) appealed to the Court of Appeals.\r\nWe certified the case, upon request by the Court of\r\nAppeals, to determine the question of whether the exclusivity provision of the\r\nWorkersâ€™ Compensation Act involves subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Whether the exclusivity provision1\r\n  of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is procedural or whether it involves\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction?\r\n  II. Whether the trial court should have granted\r\n  appellantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict and/or a judgment notwithstanding\r\n  the verdict?\r\n  III. Whether the trial court erred by allowing evidence\r\n  regarding a co-employee of Sabb?\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE I\r\nBecause Sabbâ€™s claims, as employee of\r\nUniversity, arose out of and in the course of her employment, the Workersâ€™\r\nCompensation Act (the Act) provides the exclusive remedy for her. See Dickert\r\nv. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 218, 428 S.E.2d 700 (1993) (the Act\r\nprovides exclusive remedy for employees who sustain work-related injury; claim\r\nof negligence for failure to exercise reasonable care in selection, retention,\r\nand supervision of co-employee is covered by the Act); Stokes v. First Natâ€™l\r\nBank, 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991) (mental injury arising from\r\nnon-physical stress is within the Act); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-310 (Supp. 2000)\r\n(&quot;Every employer and employee . . . shall be presumed to have accepted the\r\nprovisions of [the Act] respectively to pay and accept compensation for personal\r\ninjury . . . arising out of and in the course of the employment and shall be\r\nbound thereby.&quot;).\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to\r\nhear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\nquestion belong. Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598\r\n(1994). Sabbâ€™s tort action is clearly a part of the general class of cases\r\nwhich the court of common pleas has the jurisdiction to hear. Accordingly, the\r\ntrial court in this case had subject matter jurisdiction under the Gold Kist\r\ndefinition.2\r\n\r\nHowever, we acknowledge, while the trial court has subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction over tort claims, certain cases may be taken from the trial\r\ncourtâ€™s original jurisdiction by the General Assembly. We find the General\r\nAssembly has vested the Commission with exclusive original jurisdiction over the\r\ntypes of claims made by Sabb, such that the circuit court was divested of its\r\noriginal jurisdiction over Sabbâ€™s claims.3 \r\nTherefore, the Commission had exclusive original\r\njurisdiction to hear Sabbâ€™s claims. However, because University failed to\r\nraise the exclusivity provision as a defense to Sabbâ€™s tort action on appeal,\r\nthat challenge is waived. We reiterate the exclusivity provision does not\r\ninvolve subject matter jurisdiction. We now address Universityâ€™s issues on\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITYâ€™S APPEAL\r\nFACTS\r\nSabb, after working for University for\r\nfive years, joined Universityâ€™s campus police department in 1984. In 1989, she\r\nbecame a certified training officer and Paul White became chief of the\r\ndepartment.\r\nWithin three weeks of White becoming chief, Sabbâ€™s\r\ntraining duties were terminated and given to another officer who was not a\r\ncertified training officer. Sabb filed several grievances against Chief White.\r\nFor instance, when Sabb requested light duty due to an arthritic hip, Chief\r\nWhite informed her she would be required to take annual or sick leave. Sabb\r\nfiled a grievance with University, but later withdrew the grievance when the\r\nVice-President Provost had the policy rescinded in writing. Chief White then\r\nplaced Sabb on light duty working the midnight shift as a dispatcher.\r\nIn 1991, Sabb signed a petition circulated by officers\r\nwithin the department concerning problems with Chief White. Due to the petition,\r\nUniversity appointed a committee to investigate. The Committee found: (1) over\r\nhalf of the police personnel signed a statement requesting the chiefâ€™s\r\nremoval; (2) as to the chiefâ€™s revelation that he had no idea a problem\r\nexisted, the Committee found the small size of the department made it difficult\r\nfor anyone to work in such a hostile environment without being aware of the\r\ntensions that existed; (3) the chief had an apparent inability to assess\r\nproblems when they arose and take corrective action to prevent escalation of the\r\nproblems; and (4) the supervising staff had engaged in gross unprofessional\r\nbehavior by expressing happiness at the chiefâ€™s predicament.\r\nThe Committee recommended that Chief White participate in\r\na mandatory management and leadership improvement plan for 120 days; and that\r\nhis failure to participate in the plan would constitute grounds for removal from\r\nthe department. It was also recommended that the supervisory staff undergo\r\nextensive training pertaining to personnel procedures, interpersonal skills\r\ndevelopment, and shared departmental decision making. The Committee recommended\r\nboth Chief White and his supervisory staff, of which Sabb was a member, attend\r\nworkshops to learn about institutional policies and procedures pertaining to\r\ndiscipline.\r\nSabb testified Chief White did not accomplish the above\r\nrequirements, that University did not ensure compliance with the report, and\r\nthat conditions did not improve within the department. Further, as a result of\r\nthe petition, Sabb testified Chief White became openly hostile towards her.\r\nIn 1994, University held a meeting in which it was\r\nannounced University would be investigating the department. Following the\r\nmeeting, Sabb testified Chief White had his own meeting where he singled Sabb\r\nout and told her, as chief, he reserved the right to make any decisions he\r\nwanted. A week later, Chief White was removed from the police department for a\r\nreason unrelated to the investigation, and Lieutenant Wilson became the chief.\r\nOnce Chief Wilson assumed his position, he made Sabb the\r\nActing Lieutenant of Operations which placed her in charge of the entire\r\noperations of the department. However, when Chief White returned as chief less\r\nthan a year later, he removed Sabb as Acting Lieutenant of Operations.\r\nSubsequently, Sabb attempted to discipline Sergeant Pamela\r\nGissentanna. Chief White refused to sign the discipline form; however, Chief\r\nWilson (who remained chief along with Chief White for a period of time following\r\nChief Whiteâ€™s return) signed the form recommending suspension. Sabb testified\r\nthat Gissentanna was never suspended. As a result, Sabb filed grievances with\r\nUniversity regarding this matter and on the ground Chief White had removed her\r\nas Acting Lieutenant of Operations. The complaints were found to be non-grievable.\r\nIn another matter, while Sabb was on sick leave, Chief\r\nWhite eliminated her training duties and gave her the midnight shift as a patrol\r\nofficer during a meeting she could not attend. Sabb stated that by becoming a\r\npatrol officer she was resuming the duties with which she commenced her police\r\nwork over fifteen years earlier. University did not respond to her grievance\r\nregarding this matter.\r\nSabb filed another grievance on the basis she was denied a\r\npromotional opportunity when Chief White placed a co-employee in the position of\r\nLieutenant of Operations without advertising the position per University\r\nrequirements. University responded, in a letter to Sabb, that the position had\r\nnot yet been established and the co-employee was temporarily assigned the\r\nOperations responsibilities. University informed Sabb that when the Lieutenant\r\nof Operations position was established, University job posting guidelines would\r\nbe followed. As a result, University denied her grievance request because she\r\nhad not been denied a promotional opportunity. In the presentation of her case,\r\nSabb introduced a newspaper article that was published two days after the\r\nUniversityâ€™s denial of her grievance request. This article announced that the\r\nco-employee &quot;was named lieutenant of operations.&quot; Sabb testified, to\r\nher knowledge, the position was never posted as an opening and there were no\r\ninterviews for the position.\r\nSabb testified, as a result of Chief Whiteâ€™s actions,\r\nshe had an escalated blood pressure, interference with her sleep, and panic\r\nattacks. She called Universityâ€™s President and related her health problems.\r\nShe also told University she feared for her life because Chief White had\r\nattempted to fight her.\r\nAfter consulting with her physician, Dr. Ester Hare, Sabb\r\nrequested a transfer to another department. At the time she requested the\r\ntransfer, she was on bed rest and heavy medication.\r\nFollowing her transfer, Sabb informed University she\r\nwished to keep her police credentials because she intended to return to the\r\npolice department. However, her police certification was returned when her\r\nchange in status form was sent to the Criminal Justice Academy because the form\r\nstated she had resigned from the department for personal reasons. Sabb testified\r\nthe return of her credentials devastated her. Upon attempting to have the\r\ncredentials returned, Sabb was told she would have to repeat Academy training.\r\nDr. Hare testified when Sabb first came to see her, Sabb\r\nwas nervous, tearful, and had an escalated blood pressure. She testified she\r\nprescribed medicines for Sabbâ€™s anxiety and depression. As a result of\r\nconversations with Sabb, Dr. Hare wrote a letter to University, stating she was\r\ntreating Sabb for hypertension and work-related anxiety because Sabb was afraid\r\nof her boss. In the letter, she recommended Sabb be placed in another position.\r\nSince Sabb left the police department, Dr. Hare testified Sabb has not been\r\nplaced on medication.\r\nSeveral of Sabbâ€™s co-workers testified on Sabbâ€™s\r\nbehalf. Ella Reed testified Chief White told her as long as he was there, Sabb\r\nwould never get a raise or promotion because she was not fit to be a police\r\nofficer. Ronald Hook, another co-worker, testified he reported problems with the\r\nchiefâ€™s personnel practices to University. Hook testified he had filed a\r\ngrievance with University, partially due to Chief Whiteâ€™s treatment of him,\r\nsuch as cornering him and making harsh remarks to him.4\r\n\r\nFollowing the conclusion of Sabbâ€™s case, University\r\nmoved for a directed verdict on the negligence claims on the basis there was no\r\nshowing of any facts that created a duty on the part of the University and there\r\nwas no showing a duty had been breached by University. University also moved for\r\na directed verdict on the ground University had discretionary immunity under\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(5) (Supp. 1998). The trial court denied the motion.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in Sabbâ€™s favor. University\r\nmoved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), which was denied.\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nUniversity argues the trial court erred by denying\r\nits motion for a directed verdict and/or a JNOV for three reasons: (1) because\r\nthe &quot;discretion&quot; exception contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(5)\r\n(Supp. 2000) barred respondentâ€™s claims; (2) because respondent failed to\r\nprove University owed her a duty; and (3) because respondent failed to prove\r\nUniversity breached a duty owed her.\r\nIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial\r\ncourt is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be\r\ndrawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions. Steinke\r\nv. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373,\r\n520 S.E.2d 142 (1999). The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence\r\nyields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt. Id. This\r\nCourt will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support the\r\nruling below. Id. Further, a trial courtâ€™s decision granting or denying\r\na new trial will not be disturbed unless the decision is wholly unsupported by\r\nthe evidence or the courtâ€™s conclusions of law have been controlled by an\r\nerror of law. Id.\r\n\r\nDirected verdict and JNOV motions on basis of\r\ndiscretionary immunity\r\n\r\nThe Tort Claims Act waives immunity for torts committed by\r\nthe State, its political subdivisions, and governmental employees acting within\r\nthe scope of their official duties. Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000). There are several exceptions to this waiver\r\nof immunity, including what is known as discretionary immunity. Id.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(5) (Supp. 2000) provides that a\r\ngovernmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n\r\n  the exercise of discretion or judgment by the\r\n  governmental entity or employee or the performance or failure to perform any\r\n  act or service which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental\r\n  entity or employee.\r\n\r\nMere room for discretion on the part of the entity is not\r\nsufficient to invoke the discretionary immunity provision. Summer v.\r\nCarpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997). Discretionary immunity is\r\ncontingent on proof the government entity, faced with alternatives, actually\r\nweighed competing considerations and made a conscious choice using accepted\r\nprofessional standards. Wooten ex rel. Wooten v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\nTransp., 333 S.C. 464, 511 S.E.2d 355 (1999). The governmental entity bears\r\nthe burden of establishing discretionary immunity as an affirmative defense. Summer\r\nv. Carpenter, supra.\r\nThe burden was on University to show that it not only\r\nactually weighed competing considerations and alternatives regarding the\r\nsupervision of Chief White but that, in doing so, it utilized accepted\r\nprofessional standards appropriate to resolve this issue. However, there is no\r\nevidence University did so. The testimony of Universityâ€™s President and\r\nUniversityâ€™s Human Resources Director belie any notion that University weighed\r\ncompeting considerations and alternatives when deciding not to discipline or\r\nremove Chief White.\r\nWhile it is true University made attempts to change the\r\nhostile environment in the department by requiring Chief White and others to\r\nundergo training sessions, there is no evidence University weighed competing\r\nconsiderations when making these decisions. Further, there is no testimony\r\nUniversity utilized accepted professional standards appropriate to resolve the\r\nissue of Chief Whiteâ€™s hostility towards and actions regarding his employees.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court properly denied the motions for directed verdict\r\nand JNOV. See Summer v. Carpenter, supra (mere room for\r\ndiscretion on part of governmental entity is not sufficient to invoke\r\ndiscretionary immunity provision; governmental entity bears burden of\r\nestablishing discretionary immunity as affirmative defense). &nbsp;See also\r\nPike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., supra (to allow\r\ngovernmental entity to shield itself with only a showing of &quot;some\r\nevidence&quot; would eviscerate standard entity must meet to establish\r\ndiscretionary immunity enunciated by the Court; certainly a governmental entity\r\nshould not be entitled to discretionary immunity as a matter of law merely by\r\ncreating an issue of fact).\r\n\r\nDirected verdict and JNOV motions based on lack of duty or\r\nbreach of alleged duty\r\n\r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show the (1)\r\ndefendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) defendant breached the duty\r\nby a negligent act or omission, (3) defendant's breach was the actual and\r\nproximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury\r\nor damages. Steinke, supra. If there is no duty, then the\r\ndefendant in a negligence action is entitled to a directed verdict. Id.\r\nA duty arose on Universityâ€™s part once University was\r\nplaced on notice of Chief Whiteâ€™s behavior and actions. After University\r\nreceived the grievances of Sabb and other employees, University had a duty to\r\naddress the employeesâ€™s concerns with due care.\r\nA jury issue also existed as to whether University had\r\nbreached that duty. University was on notice of Chief Whiteâ€™s activities\r\nthrough conversations Sabb and other employees had with University officials,\r\nthe petition circulated by members of the police department, the grievances of\r\nSabb and other employees, and through the Committeeâ€™s report detailing the\r\nfindings of their investigation into Chief Whiteâ€™s actions. Despite these\r\nnumerous complaints and notifications of Chief Whiteâ€™s actions and behavior,\r\nUniversity allowed him to continue serving as chief of the department without\r\nany real effort to rectify the hostile conditions within the department.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Sabb,\r\nthe trial court properly denied the directed verdict and JNOV motions because\r\nevidence existed to show University had possibly breached a duty owed to Sabb. See\r\nSteinke, supra (trial courtâ€™s decision denying directed verdict\r\nand JNOV motions will not be disturbed unless there is no evidence to support\r\nruling or unless trial courtâ€™s conclusions of law have been controlled by\r\nerror of law).\r\n\r\nISSUE III\r\n\r\nUniversity argues the trial court should have excluded all\r\nof the evidence regarding Sergeant Pamela Gissentanna, under Rule 403, SCRE,\r\nbecause the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its\r\nprejudicial effect.\r\nThis issue is not preserved for our review because\r\nUniversity did not make an objection to the evidence during trial5\r\nAt trial, Universityâ€™s objection to an exhibit which contained a reference to\r\nsexual harassment was overruled. When Sabbâ€™s counsel asked Sabbâ€™s\r\nco-employee, Hook, if he had observed any favoritism by Chief White towards\r\nGissentanna, University did not object. and because University did not object to\r\nall the evidence regarding Gissentanna but now wishes to do so on appeal.\r\nSee State v. Griffin, 339 S.C. 74, 528 S.E.2d 668 (2000) (motion in\r\nlimine is not final and losing party must renew its objection at trial\r\nwhen evidence is presented to preserve issue for review); Holy Loch Distribs.,\r\nInc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000) (to preserve issue for\r\nappellate review, issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court);\r\nTaylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996) (party may not\r\nargue one ground for an objection at trial and another ground on appeal).6\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES,\r\nJ., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I agree\r\nwith the majority that the Workers Compensation Act (&quot;the Act&quot;) does\r\nnot divest the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction in this matter. I\r\nwould, however, grant the Universityâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on Sabbâ€™s\r\nnegligent supervision and retention claims,7 and\r\ntherefore, I respectfully dissent.\r\nI question whether an employee should ever be allowed to\r\nsue her employer on a theory of negligent retention or supervision for the acts\r\nof a supervisory employee.8 See Patriarca\r\nv. Center For Living and Working, Inc., 1999 WL 791888 (Mass. Super. 1999).\r\nAssuming such an action could be brought, I would follow the approach taken by a\r\nnumber of courts and require that the actions of the negligently supervised or\r\nnegligently retained supervisor be significantly more egregious than Whiteâ€™s\r\nin order to be actionable in tort. See e.g. Hayes v. Patton-Tully\r\nTransp. Co., 844 F.Supp. 1221 (W.D. Tenn. 1993) (negligent supervision claim\r\nwill lie only where supported by viable claim of tortious conduct by offending\r\nemployee); Mulhern v. City of Scottsdale, 799 P.2d 15 (Az. Ct. App. 1990)\r\n(in order for employer to be liable for negligent hiring, retention, or\r\nsupervision, the employee must have committed an actionable tort); Schoff v.\r\nCombined Ins. Co. of America, 604 N.W.2d 43 (Iowa 1999) (the torts of\r\nnegligent hiring, supervision, or training must include as an element an\r\nunderlying tort or wrongful act committed by the employee); Hogan v. Forsyth\r\nCountry Club Co., 340 S.E.2d 116 (N.C. Ct. App. 1986) (before employer can\r\nbe held liable for negligently hiring or retaining an employee, plaintiff must\r\nprove that the offending employee committed a tortious act resulting in injury\r\nto plaintiff); Gonzales v. Willis, 995 S.W.2d 729 (Tex. Ct. App. 1999)\r\n(plaintiff-employeeâ€™s negligent hiring, retention, and supervision claims\r\nagainst employer failed where plaintiff-employee failed to show actions of\r\noffending employee amounted to an actionable tort); Haverly v. Kaytec, Inc.,\r\n738 A.2d 86 (Vt. 1999) (the tort of negligent supervision must include as an\r\nelement an underlying tort or wrongful act committed by the employee).\r\nThe evidence presented by Sabb at trial established the\r\nfollowing: (1) White reassigned Sabbâ€™s job duties, that is, he relieved Sabb\r\nof her training and supervisory duties, and scheduled her to work the night\r\nshift; (2) when Sabb reported that she was physically unable to perform her\r\nnormal job assignments, White &quot;threatened&quot; to make Sabb submit leave\r\n(after Sabb complained to the University, White did not carry through with the\r\n&quot;threat,&quot; but instead reassigned Sabb to light duty); (3) White\r\nsingled-out Sabb at a staff meeting and verbally reiterated his authority as\r\nhead of the police department; and (4) White refused to approve Sabbâ€™s request\r\nto discipline an employee supervised by Sabb. None of this conduct rises to the\r\nlevel of a tort.9\r\n\r\nTo allow recovery based on the theory advanced in this\r\ncase has grave consequences for the employer-employee relationship. The\r\nworkplace is often stress-laden. Employees frequently disagree with the\r\npersonnel decisions of their supervisors. Often employees complain to management\r\nabout job assignments and the treatment they receive from supervisors. Allowing\r\nan employee to recover from the employer based on the facts of this case leaves\r\nemployers with two options in the future: (1) fire the supervisor when a\r\nsubordinate employee complains, or (2) retain the supervisor, and become liable\r\nfor money damages if the complaining employee prevails on a negligent retention\r\nand supervision claim.10 While Whiteâ€™s conduct\r\nbespeaks an undesirable management style, the University should not be liable to\r\nthis unhappy plaintiff as a result.\r\nIn my opinion, the University was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict on Sabbâ€™s claims of negligent supervision and negligent retention.\r\nSabb has wholly failed to show that Whiteâ€™s actions towards her constituted a\r\ntort.\r\n1. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985) (the\r\nexclusivity provision), provides:\r\n\r\n  The rights and remedies granted by [the Act] to an\r\n  employee when he and his employer have accepted the provisions of [the Act],\r\n  respectively, to pay and accept compensation on account of personal injury or\r\n  death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such\r\n  employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin as\r\n  against his employer, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury,\r\n  loss of service or death.\r\n\r\n2. To the extent the following cases could\r\nbe read to provide the circuit court is without subject matter jurisdiction to\r\nhear Sabbâ€™s claims, they are overruled: Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319\r\nS.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995); Dockins v. Ingles Markets, Inc., 306\r\nS.C. 287, 411 S.E.2d 437 (1991); McSwain v. Shei, 304 S.C. 25, 402 S.E.2d\r\n890 (1991); Bridges v. Wyandotte Worsted Co., 243 S.C. 1, 132 S.E.2d 18\r\n(1963).\r\n3. The phrase\r\n&quot;shall exclude all other rights and remedies&quot; in the exclusivity\r\nprovision demonstrates plain and unambiguous legislative intent to vest the\r\nWorkersâ€™ Compensation Commission with exclusive original jurisdiction over an\r\nemployeeâ€™s claims, such as Sabbâ€™s claims.\r\nFurther support for this conclusion comes from S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 15-78-60 (14) (Supp. 2000) of the Tort Claims Act, which provides that\r\nthe governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from any claim\r\ncovered by the Act.\r\nFrom these statutes, it is apparent the General Assembly\r\nintends for employees to seek a remedy from employers for their work-related\r\ninjury only through the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission and not through the\r\ntrial courts. Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s original jurisdiction over this\r\ntype of tort claim was divested by the General Assemblyâ€™s enactment of these\r\nstatutes, which, in turn, means the trial court lacked original jurisdiction to\r\nhear Sabbâ€™s claims.\r\n4. Two other co-workers, Richard Johnson\r\nand Herman Singletary, testified they had filed grievances with University and\r\nhad each filed a lawsuit against University.\r\n5. Prior to\r\ntrial, University made a motion in limine requesting the trial court\r\nexclude from Sabbâ€™s presentation at trial any testimony concerning\r\n&quot;sexual harassment by way of a third party,&quot; which was alleged in Sabbâ€™s\r\ngrievances to University. University stated in its motion that Sabb actually\r\nmeant that Chief White favored Gissentanna, and that the use of the words\r\n&quot;sexual harassment&quot; was unduly prejudicial to University.\r\nAt trial, Universityâ€™s objection to an exhibit which\r\ncontained a reference to sexual harassment was overruled. When Sabbâ€™s counsel\r\nasked Sabbâ€™s co-employee, Hook, if he had observed any favoritism by Chief\r\nWhite towards Gissentanna, University did not object.\r\n6. In any event, the evidence attempting\r\nto demonstrate an improper relationship between Chief White and Officer\r\nGissentanna was properly admitted because it was relevant for the purpose of\r\nshowing Chief White may have engaged in favoritism when making decisions\r\nregarding his subordinates. See Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\nTransp., supra (admission and rejection of testimony is largely\r\nwithin the trial court's sound discretion, the exercise of which will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion).\r\n7. Although Sabbâ€™s complaint also\r\nasserted causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress,\r\nviolation of Whistle Blower Act , assault, civil conspiracy, and negligent\r\nhiring, the only theories submitted to the jury were her claims of negligent\r\nretention and negligent supervision.\r\n8. Of course, but for the Universityâ€™s\r\nfailure to interpose the exclusivity provisions of the Act, this case would not\r\nhave been before the Circuit Court in the first instance. In my view, this\r\nfailure to assert the exclusivity provisions of the Act may have been strategic,\r\nowing to an assessment that the case would probably be dismissed.\r\n9. The only possible theory I can perceive\r\nfrom Sabbâ€™s complaints is a claim for outrage or intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress. There is insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support\r\nrecovery for outrage. See Shipman v. Glenn, 314 S.C. 327, 443\r\nS.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 1994) (&quot;callous and offensive conduct&quot; of\r\nsupervisor insufficient to support employeeâ€™s recovery for intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress; conduct must be so extreme and outrageous as\r\nto exceed bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly\r\nintolerable in a civilized community; plaintiff not proceeding on theory of\r\nnegligent retention or supervision).\r\n10. There exists, of course, a third\r\noption: take action against the complained-of employee short of job termination.\r\nThe University pursued that option here, but that course of action did not\r\nrelieve it of liability to Sabb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25497","title":"In the Matter of Gilchrist","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25497","description":"Disciplinary opinion conferring a definite suspension of eighteen months from the practice of law.","date":"2002-07-15","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Dennis C.\r\nGilchrist, Respondent.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25497\r\nSubmitted June 18, 2002 - Filed July 15, 2002\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B.

Giese, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel\r\nhave entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n413, SCACR. (1)  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\nimposition of a definite suspension ranging from six months to eighteen months.  We accept\r\nthe Agreement and impose a definite suspension of eighteen months from the practice of law. \r\nThe facts as admitted in the Agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nRespondent pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Â§ 844(a).  He\r\nwas sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.  After\r\nthe United States Government filed a motion for a reduction of sentence, respondent was re-sentenced to five years probation and six months of home confinement.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\nConduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule\r\n8.4(b) (committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty,\r\ntrustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving moral\r\nturpitude); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (conviction\r\nof a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to\r\npollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute\r\nor conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of\r\noffice taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that his actions in the aforementioned matters were in\r\nviolation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement.  We therefore suspend respondent from the practice of law for eighteen months. \r\nThis suspension is not retroactive to the date of respondent's interim suspension.  Pursuant to\r\nRule 33(f)(10), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, respondent must have completed probation prior to\r\npetitioning for reinstatement to the practice of law.

Contractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc., 342 S.C. 443, 537 S.E.2d\r\n285 (Ct. App. 2000).  The Court of Appeals held the materialman was not entitled to a\r\nmechanic's lien since the owner of the property did not give proper consent, as is required by\r\nthe Mechanic's Lien Statute,   S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 et. seq. (1991). We affirm, as\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nBG Holding f/k/a Colite Industries, Inc. (\"BG Holding\") is a one-third owner of about thirty\r\nacres of real estate in West Columbia, South Carolina.  A warehouse facility is located on the\r\nproperty.  In September 1996, Powder Coaters, Inc. (\"Powder Coaters\") agreed to lease a\r\nportion of the warehouse to operate its business.  Powder Coaters was engaged in the business\r\nof electrostatically painting machinery parts and equipment and then placing them in an oven\r\nto cure.  A signed lease was executed between Powder Coaters and BG Holding.  Prior to\r\nsigning the lease, Powder Coaters negotiated the terms with Mark Taylor, (\"Taylor\") who was\r\nthe property manager for the warehouse facility and an agent of BG Holding.\r\n\r\nThe warehouse facility did not have a sufficient power supply to support Powder Coaters'\r\nmachinery.  Therefore, Powder Coaters contracted with F&amp;D Electrical (\"F&amp;D\") to perform\r\nelectrical work which included installing two eight foot strip light fixtures and a two hundred\r\namp load center.  Powder Coaters never paid F&amp;D for the services.  Powder Coaters was also\r\nunable to pay rent to BG Holding and was evicted in February 1997.  Powder Coaters is no\r\nlonger a viable company.\r\n\r\nIn January 1997, F&amp;D filed a Notice and Certificate of Mechanic's Lien and Affidavit of\r\nMechanic's Lien.  In February 1997, F&amp;D filed this action against BG Holding foreclosing on\r\nits mechanic's lien pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 et. seq. (1991).  F&amp;D also asserted a\r\ncause of action against Powder Coaters for breach of contract and quantum meruit.  BG\r\nHolding counterclaimed against F&amp;D for slander of title.  Powder Coaters did not answer, and\r\na default judgment was entered against them.\r\n\r\nA jury trial was held on September 2nd and 3rd, 1998.  At the close of F&amp;D's evidence, and at\r\nthe close of all evidence, BG Holding made motions for directed verdicts, which were denied. \r\nThe jury returned a verdict for F&amp;D in the amount of $8,264.00.  The court also awarded\r\nF&amp;D attorneys' fees and cost in the amount of $8,264.00, for a total award of $16,528.00.\r\n\r\nBG Holding appealed.  The Court of Appeals, in a two to one decision, reversed the trial\r\ncourt, holding a directed verdict should have been granted to BG Holding on the grounds BG\r\nHolding did not consent to the electrical upgrade, as is required by the Mechanic's Lien\r\nStatute.  This Court granted F&amp;D's petition for certiorari, and the issue before this Court is:\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in denying BG Holding's motion for directed verdict because the record\r\nwas devoid of any evidence of owner's consent to materialman's performance of work on its\r\nproperty as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10? (1)\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nF&amp;D argues the majority of the Court of Appeals erred in holding the facts of the case failed\r\nto establish that BG Holding consented to the work performed by F&amp;D, as is required the\r\nMechanic's Lien Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10.  We agree.\r\n\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence and all\r\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Swinton Creek\r\nNursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 479, 514 S.E.2d 126 (1999).  Where the evidence\r\nyields only one inference, a directed verdict for the moving party is proper. Id. \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's Mechanic's Lien Statute provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nA person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished\r\nand actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building . . . by virtue of an\r\nagreement with, or by consent of, the owner of the building or structure, or a person having\r\nauthority from, or rightfully acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or\r\nmaterials shall have a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of\r\nthe building or structure . . . to secure the payment of the debt due.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (emphasis added).  Both parties in this case concede there was no\r\nexpress \"agreement\" between F&amp;D and BG Holding.  Therefore, the issue in this appeal turns\r\non the meaning of the word \"consent\" in the statute, as applied in the landlord-tenant context. \r\nThis is a novel issue in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis Court must decide who must give the consent, who must receive consent, and what type\r\nof consent (general, specific, oral, written) must be given in order to satisfy the statute. \r\nFinally, the Court must decide whether the evidence in this case shows BG Holding gave the\r\nrequisite consent.\r\n\r\nA.  Who Must Receive the Consent.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' opinion in this case contemplates the consent must be between the\r\nmaterialman (lien claimant) and the landlord (owner).  \"It is only logical . . . that consent\r\nunder section 29-5-10 must . . . be between the owner and the entity seeking the lien. . .\" \r\nF&amp;D Elec., 342 S.C. at 449, 537 S.E.2d at 288.  As stated previously, applying the\r\nMechanic's Lien Statute in the landlord-tenant context presents a novel issue.  We find the\r\nconsent required by the statute does not have to be between the landlord/owner and the\r\nmaterialman, as the Court of Appeals' opinion indicates.  A determination that the required\r\nconsent must come from the owner to the materialman means the materialman can only\r\nsucceed if he can prove an agreement with the owner.  Such an interpretation would render\r\nmeaningless the language of the statute that  provides: \". . .by virtue of an agreement with, or\r\nby consent of the owner . . . .\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is sufficient for the landlord/owner or his agent to give consent to his tenant.  The\r\nlandlord/owner should be able to delegate to his tenant the responsibility for making the\r\nrequested improvements.  The landlord/owner may not want to have direct involvement with\r\nthe materialman or sub-contractors, but instead may wish to allow the tenant to handle any\r\nimprovements or upgrades himself.  In addition, the landlord/owner may be located far away\r\nand may own many properties, making it impractical for him to have direct involvement with\r\nthe materialman. We find the landlord/owner or his agent is free to enter into a lease or\r\nagreement with a tenant which allows the tenant to direct the modifications to the property\r\nwhich have been specifically consented to by the landlord/owner or his agent.\r\n\r\nWe hold a landlord/owner or his agent can give his consent to the lessee/tenant, as well as\r\ndirectly to the lien claimant, to make modifications to the leased premises.\r\n\r\nB.  What kind of consent is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis Court has already clearly held the consent required by section 29-5-10 is \"something\r\nmore than a mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence.  It implies an\r\nagreement to that which, but for the consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting\r\nhas a right to forbid.\"  Geddes v. Bowden, 19 S.C. 1, 7 (1883); Trico Surveying, Inc. v. Godley\r\nAuction Co., 314 S.C. 542, 545, 431 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1993); C &amp; B Co. v. Collins, 269 S.C.\r\n688, 690, 239 S.E.2d 725, 726 (1977); Guignard Brick Works v. Gantt, 251 S.C. 29, 32, 159\r\nS.E.2d 850, 851 (1968); Metz v. Critcher, 86 S.C. 348, 350, 68 S.E. 627, 628 (1910). \r\nHowever, our Mechanics Lien Statute has never been applied in the landlord-tenant context\r\nwhere a third party is involved.\r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions have addressed this issue.  The Court of Appeals cited St. Catherine's\r\nChurch Corp. of Riverside v. Technical Planning Assocs., 520 A.2d 1298 (Conn. Ct. App.\r\n1987) in support of its holding.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut\r\ncourt's reasoning is persuasive, especially since Connecticut has a similar mechanics lien\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nConn. General Statutes Â§ 49-33(a) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for . . . services rendered . . . in the\r\nimprovement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, and the\r\nclaim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent of the owner . . . or of some person\r\nhaving authority from or rightfully acting for the owner . . . then the plot of land, is subject to\r\nthe payment of the claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut courts have stated \"the consent required from the owner or one acting under\r\nthe owner's authority is more than the mere granting of permission for work to be conducted\r\non one's property; or the mere knowledge that work was being performed on one's land.\"  St.\r\nCatherine's Church, 520 A.2d at 1300 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \r\nFurthermore, although the Connecticut courts have stated the statute does not require an\r\nexpress contract, the courts have required \"consent that indicates an agreement that the owner\r\nof . . . the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nAlthough the other jurisdictions which have addressed this issue do not have mechanic's lien\r\nstatutes as similar to South Carolina's statute as Connecticut's, we find their reasoning\r\npersuasive.\r\n\r\nGeorgia and North Carolina courts have applied their mechanic's lien statutes in the landlord-tenant context in a way similar to Connecticut.  The Georgia Court of Appeals has stated, \"A\r\ncontract for improvements between a lessee and a materialman does not subject the interest of\r\nthe lessor to a lien unless a contractual relationship exists between the lessor and the\r\nmaterialman as well. . . .  Mere knowledge by the lessor of the improvements does not give\r\nrise to the lien.\"  Nunley Contracting Co., Inc. v. Four Taylors, Inc., 384 S.E.2d 216, 217 (Ga.\r\nApp. 1989) (internal citations and quotations omitted).   Although Georgia requires a\r\n\"contractual relationship,\" an express agreement is not required.   Accurate Construction Co.,\r\nInc. v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., 269 S.E.2d 494, 495 (Ga. App. 1980) (indicating the consent may\r\nbe express or implied).\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina has used similar language when discussing mechanic's liens in the landlord-tenant context.  \"Mere knowledge that work is being done or material furnished on one's\r\nproperty does not enable the person furnishing the labor or material to obtain a lien.\"  Brown\r\nv. Ward, 20 S.E.2d 324, 326 (N.C. 1942).  The Court went on to state, \"Unless the lessors\r\nwere originally liable by reason of a contract of some sort, [they] cannot be made so because\r\nof their having resumed possession of the premises, with its improvements, upon surrender of\r\ntheir tenant.\" Id.  (internal quotations and citations omitted).  We find the following language\r\nfrom the North Carolina Court to be especially enlightening in the instant case,\r\n\r\n\r\n[Materialman] did the work under contract with [Lessee] with the understanding that it was to\r\nbe charged to him.  If they were unwilling to do the work and furnish the material upon his\r\ncredit and intended to look to the security provided by statute, ordinary prudence required that\r\nthey exercise that degree of diligence which would enable them to ascertain the status of the\r\ntitle to the land upon which the building was to be erected and to obtain the approval or\r\nprocurement of the owners.  Their loss must be attributed to their failure to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 326-327.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning of North Carolina, Connecticut, and Georgia is persuasive.  F&amp;D's brief\r\nappears to argue that mere knowledge by the landowner that the work needed to be done,\r\ncoupled with the landlord's general \"permission\" to perform the work, is enough to establish\r\nconsent under the statute.  Under this interpretation, a landlord who knew a tenant needed to\r\nimprove, upgrade, or add to the leased premises would be liable to any contractor and/or\r\nsubcontractor who performed work on his land.  Under F&amp;D's interpretation the landlord\r\nwould not be required to know the scope, cost, etc. of the work, but would only need to give\r\nthe tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements.\r\n\r\nClearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can\r\nbe established.  Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific. \r\nThe landlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease\r\nprovided in the instant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant). \r\nThe consent needs to be more than \"mere knowledge\" that the tenant will perform work on the\r\nproperty.  There must be some kind of express or implied agreement that the landlord may be\r\nheld liable for the work or material.  The landlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project\r\nor work to his tenant, but there must be an express or implied agreement about the specific\r\nwork to be done.  A general provision in a lease which allows tenant to make repairs or\r\nimprovements is not enough.\r\n\r\nC. Evidence of Consent in this Case\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, there is some evidence of consent.  However, it does not rise to the level\r\nrequired under the statute.\r\n\r\nEvidence There Was No Consent\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The record is clear that no contract, express or implied, existed between BG Holding and\r\nF&amp;G.  BG Holding had no knowledge F&amp;G would be performing the work.\r\n\r\n2. F&amp;G's supervisor, David Weatherington and Ray Dutton, the owner of F&amp;D, both testified\r\nthey never had a conversation with anyone from BG Holding.   In fact, until Powder Coaters\r\nfailed to pay under the contract,  F&amp;D did not know BG Holding was the owner of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n3. Mark Taylor, BG Holding's agent, testified he never authorized any work by F&amp;D, nor did\r\nhe see any work being performed by them on the site.\r\n\r\n4. The lease specifically provided that all work on the property was to be approved in writing\r\nby BG Holding.\r\n\r\n5. David Weatherington of F&amp;D testified he was looking to Powder Coaters, not BG Holding,\r\nfor payment.\r\n\r\n6. Powder Coaters acknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding to pay for the\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\n7. The lease states, \"[i]f the Lessee should make any [alterations, modification, additions, or\r\ninstallations], the Lessee hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and save harmless the Lessor\r\nfrom any liability...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence BG Holding \"Consented\" to the Work.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Bruce Houston, owner of Powder Coaters testified that during the lease negotiations, he\r\ninformed Mark Taylor, BG Holding's property manager and agent, that electrical and gas\r\nupgrading would be necessary for Powder Coaters to perform their work.\r\n\r\n2. Houston testified Mark Taylor was present at the warehouse while F&amp;D performed their\r\nwork. [However, Taylor testified he did not see F&amp;D performing any work on the premises].\r\n\r\n3. Houston testified he would not have entered into the lease if he was not authorized to\r\nupgrade the electrical since the existing power source was insufficient to run the machinery\r\nneeded for Powder Coaters to operate.\r\n\r\n4. Houston testified Mark Taylor, BG Holding's agent, showed him the power source for the\r\nbuilding so Taylor could understand the extent of the work that was going to be required.\r\n\r\n5. Houston testified Paragraph 5 of the addendum to the lease was specifically negotiated.  He\r\ntestified the following language granted him the authority to perform the electrical upfit, so\r\nthat he was not required to submit the plans to BG Holding as required by a provision in the\r\nlease: \"Lessor shall allow Lessee to put Office Trailer in Building.  All Utilities necessary to\r\nhandle Lessee's equipment shall be paid for by the Lessee including, but not limited to\r\nelectricity, water, sewer, and gas.\" (emphasis added). (2)\r\n\r\n6. Powder Coaters no longer occupies the property, and BG Holding possibly benefits from\r\nthe work done.\r\n\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to F&amp;D, whether BG Holding gave their\r\nconsent is a close question.  However, we agree with the Court of Appeals, that F&amp;D has not\r\npresented enough evidence to show: (1) BG Holding gave anything more than general consent\r\nto make improvements (as the lease could be interpreted to allow); or (2) BG Holding had\r\nanything more that \"mere knowledge\" that the work was to be done.  Powder Coaters asserted\r\nthe lease's addendum evidenced BG Holding's consent to perform the modifications;\r\nhowever, there is no evidence BG Holding expressly or implicitly agreed that it might be\r\nliable for the work.  In fact, the lease between Powder Coaters and BG Holding expressly\r\nprovided Powder Coaters was responsible for any alterations made to the property.  Even\r\nPowder Coaters acknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding.  In addition, the\r\naddendum provisions are specific with respect to the partition and a rollup door.  Therefore, it\r\nis impossible to see how the very general provision requiring Powder Coaters to pay for water,\r\nsewer, and gas can be interpreted to authorize Powder Coaters to perform an electrical\r\nupgrade.  Furthermore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the mere presence of BG\r\nHolding's agent at the work site is not enough to establish consent.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold consent, as required by the Mechanic's Lien Statute, is something more than mere\r\nknowledge work will be or could be done on the property.  The landlord/owner must do more\r\nthan grant the tenant general permission to make repairs or improvements to the leased\r\npremises.  The landlord/owner or his agent must give either his tenant or the materialman\r\nexpress or implied consent acknowledging he may be held liable for the work.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' opinion is AFFIRM AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Both parties' briefs present three issues on appeal.  However, they all concern whether or\r\nnot the trial court correctly denied BG Holding's motions for directed verdicts which were\r\nbased on their assertion that F&amp;D presented no evidence of consent, as is required by the\r\nmechanic's lien statute.  Therefore, we have combined all three issues into one general issue.\r\n2. We note that BG Holding denies this interpretation, but insists it just requires the Lessee to\r\npay for all utility bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25499","title":"Hill v.

Taggart of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense,\r\nof Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Douglas J. Hill (\"Hill\") filed a petition for post-conviction relief\r\n(\"PCR\") from his conviction for assault and battery with intent to kill (\"ABIK\").  The PCR\r\ncourt granted his petition for relief, and the State appeals.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nHill was indicted for ABIK on November 28, 1995, for attacking his pregnant girlfriend,\r\nSheila Ann Gilliam (\"victim\").   The victim was stabbed 12 to 14 times in different places all\r\nover her body.  The treating surgeon testified at trial that the victim lost between 1,000 and\r\n2,000 cubic centimeters of blood from the lacerations, and that her condition was life-threatening when he first examined her at the hospital.  The victim was in surgery for several\r\nhours to have all of the wounds irrigated and repaired.\r\n\r\nThe victim testified an altercation began after she told Hill their relationship was over. \r\nAccording to her testimony, Hill told her, \"[w]ell, since we [sic] through then I might as well\r\nkill you.\"  Several witnesses to the attack also testified at trial.  One pair of witnesses reported\r\nseeing Hill and the victim in a heated verbal argument outside of a convenience store in\r\nFountain Inn, South Carolina that turned physical when Hill began hitting the victim in the\r\nface and elsewhere on her body.  The same witness testified that the victim eventually fell\r\ndown, and Hill sat on top of her to pin her to the ground and then began stabbing her with a\r\nsmall knife.\r\n\r\nThe attack continued until another witness, after calling the police, intervened, first, by yelling\r\nat the attacker to put the knife down and, then, when he did not comply, by kicking him in the\r\nhead, apparently knocking him unconscious.  A police officer testified that Hill was lying\r\nunconscious in the parking lot of the convenience store when he arrived at the scene.   Hill\r\ntestified that he did not remember fighting with the victim or stabbing her, but  remembered \r\nsomeone hitting him in the head and waking up later in the hospital.\r\n\r\nHill was tried and convicted of ABIK and sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility\r\nof parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(a)(1), based on a prior rape conviction and a\r\nprior conviction for aggravated assault and battery. (1)  Hill appealed his conviction and the\r\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence. State v. Hill, Op. No. 98-UP-009 (Ct.\r\nApp. filed January 8, 1998).  Hill filed an application for PCR and an evidentiary hearing was\r\nheld on December 14, 1999.  At the hearing, Hill amended his PCR application to include an\r\nallegation of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel's failure to object to\r\nthe jury charge given by the trial judge on assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature\r\n(\"ABHAN\"), a lesser included offense of ABIK.  The PCR court found the ABHAN jury\r\ninstruction was erroneous and that Hill's counsel was ineffective for failing to object to it. The\r\nPCR court granted Hill's petition for relief on that basis.\r\n\r\nThe State appeals the following issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did Hill's trial counsel render ineffective assistance by \r\n    failing to object to the ABHAN jury instruction and, if so, was Hill prejudiced \r\n    by his counsel's ineffective assistance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR court erred by holding Hill's trial \r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial judge's ABHAN jury \r\n  instruction. We disagree.\r\n\r\nFor a petitioner to be granted PCR as a result of ineffective \r\n  assistance of counsel, he must show (1) counsel's representation fell below \r\n  an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) he was prejudiced by that ineffective \r\n  assistance, meaning, but for counsel's errors there is a reasonable probability \r\n  the result at trial would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, \r\n  466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). This Court will uphold \r\n  the findings of the PCR court if they are supported by any evidence. Cherry \r\n  v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\n\r\nA. Objective Standard of Reasonableness\r\n\r\nAt trial, the trial judge charged the jury on ABHAN as a \r\n  lesser included offense of ABIK, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ladies and Gentlemen, assault and battery of a high and \r\n    aggravated nature is attended by aggravating circumstances such as the use \r\n    of a deadly weapon, the infliction of serious bodily harm or a great disparity \r\n    between the ages or physical condition of the parties involved. Now I told \r\n    you earlier, this is a degree higher than simple assault. It usually occurs \r\n    by the use of some weapon. An assault and battery, however, might be so aggravated \r\n    where no weapon is used as to amount to aggravated assault and battery. If \r\n    a person seriously or violently injures another without malice or \r\n    legal excuse but in sudden heat and [sic] passion with sufficient legal provocation \r\n    that would constitute assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature \r\n    . . ..\r\n\r\n\r\nHill argues this charge erroneously instructed the jury \r\n  that the absence of malice (or, conversely, the presence of sufficient provocation) \r\n  was an element of ABHAN. We agree the charge was erroneous. \r\n\r\nFour months before Hill's trial, the Court of Appeals held \r\n  that absence of malice was not an element of ABHAN, and found a charge including \r\n  absence of malice as an element of ABHAN to be erroneous. State v. Pilgrim, \r\n  320 S.C. 409, 465 S.E.2d 108 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"Pilgrim I\"). After Hill's trial \r\n  and ABIK conviction, this Court granted certiorari to review Pilgrim I. \r\n  This Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, stating explicitly that absence of \r\n  malice is not an element of ABHAN. State v. Pilgrim, 326 S.C. 24, 482 \r\n  S.E.2d 562 (1997) (\"Pilgrim II\"). (2) In Pilgrim \r\n  II, this Court explained, \"In this case, under the trial judge's instruction, \r\n  the jury could not have returned with an ABHAN conviction because there was \r\n  no evidence of provocation, or stated another way there was no evidence of absence \r\n  of malice. Absence of malice is not an element of ABHAN.\" Id. at 27, \r\n  482 S.E.2d at 563.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that an ABHAN charge, like the one \r\n  given in this case, including absence of malice or legal provocation as an element \r\n  would be erroneous if given after this Court's decision in Pilgrim II. \r\n  The State argues, however, that the Court of Appeals' Pilgrim I decision \r\n  was not final because it was still subject to further appeal to this Court at \r\n  the time of Hill's trial. The State claims Hill's trial counsel would not have \r\n  been on notice that the charge given was erroneous until this Court published \r\n  its Pilgrim II decision, almost a year after Hill's conviction. For \r\n  support, the State cites the proposition that no attorney is required to anticipate \r\n  or discover changes in the law or facts which did not exist at the time of trial. \r\n  See Thornes v. State, 310 S.C. 306, 426 S.E.2d 764 (1993) (finding \r\n  counsel not ineffective for encouraging defendant to plead guilty although counsel \r\n  never interviewed the victim (because he had her written statement against defendant), \r\n  even though victim changed her mind by the time of the PCR hearing and testified \r\n  for defendant); Robinson v. State, 308 S.C. 74, 417 S.E.2d 88 (1992) \r\n  (finding counsel not ineffective for failing to use a defense that would not \r\n  receive acceptance until several years after the trial).\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, the cases cited by the State are inapplicable \r\n  in this situation. Hill was not required to anticipate any change in \r\n  the law in order to object to the ABHAN charge given at trial; the Court of \r\n  Appeals' Pilgrim I decision was published and readily available to \r\n  trial counsel before Hill's trial began. Rule 226(c), SCACR, states that a Court \r\n  of Appeals' decision is not final until the petition for rehearing has been \r\n  acted upon by the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals denied the petition \r\n  for rehearing of Pilgrim I on December 21, 1995, and Hill's trial did \r\n  not begin until March 19, 1996. The Pilgrim I decision was final almost \r\n  three months before Hill's trial and was binding on the trial court at the time \r\n  of Hill's trial. Accordingly, the failure of Hill's counsel to object to the \r\n  erroneous ABHAN jury instruction constituted representation below an objective \r\n  standard of reasonableness.\r\n\r\nB. Prejudice\r\n\r\nTo warrant reversal and granting of a new trial under Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, however, Hill must also show he was prejudiced by counsel's \r\n  faulty representation. Hill argues that he was prejudiced by the erroneous charge \r\n  because the definition of ABHAN was central to the jury's verdict, as Hill's \r\n  trial strategy was based on the hope that the jury would find him guilty of \r\n  ABHAN instead of the greater offense, ABIK. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, Hill was not prejudiced by the erroneous \r\n  ABHAN charge. In light of the overwhelming evidence presented, including (1) \r\n  the eyewitness accounts naming Hill as the sole aggressor, (2) the victim's \r\n  testimony, (3) the number and severity of the victim's injuries, and (4) the \r\n  victim's physical state (she was seven months pregnant), we find the erroneous \r\n  ABHAN charge constituted harmless error. \"When guilt has been conclusively proven \r\n  by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached, \r\n  the Court should not set aside a conviction because of insubstantial errors \r\n  not affecting the result.\" State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  581, 584 (1989).\r\n\r\nABHAN is an unlawful act of violent injury to the person \r\n  of another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation. State v. Fennell, \r\n  340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000). ABIK is an unlawful act of a violent nature \r\n  to the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied. \r\n  (3)  \r\nId.  Although the absence of malice is not an element \r\n  of ABHAN, the presence of malice is a required element of ABIK. Malice is defined \r\n  as a \"formed purpose and design to do a wrongful act under the circumstances \r\n  that exclude any legal right to do it.\" Fennell, 340 S.C. at 278, 531 \r\n  S.E2d at 518. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the victim testified that Hill told her he \r\n  was going to kill her. All eyewitnesses testified that Hill pinned the victim \r\n  on the ground and repeatedly stabbed her despite her profuse bleeding, her cries \r\n  for help, her attempts to get away from him, and the presence of numerous witnesses. \r\n  Hill ceased attacking her only when he was knocked unconscious by an eyewitness. \r\n  There is no evidence to indicate Hill intended anything but to kill the victim, \r\n  or that he had any legal excuse to do so. In light of the evidence presented, \r\n  there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have convicted Hill of \r\n  ABHAN, a lesser included offense of ABIK (for which Hill was indicted), even \r\n  if the judge had given the correct ABHAN charge. Hill's guilt of ABIK was so \r\n  conclusively proven at trial that there is no reasonable probability that the \r\n  trial judge's faulty ABHAN instruction would have affected the result. As such, \r\n  counsel's failure to object to the erroneous instruction does not warrant a \r\n  new trial. See State v. Bailey. \r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Hill has not met his burden of \r\n  proving prejudice, as required by Strickland v. Washington. Accordingly, \r\n  the PCR court erred by granting Hill's application for PCR. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the \r\n  PCR court's order granting Hill a new trial. \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 1995) \r\n  provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n  any person who has three convictions under the laws of this \r\n    State, any other state, or the United States, for a violent crime as defined \r\n    in Â§ 16-1-60 except a crime for which a sentence of death has been imposed \r\n    shall, upon the third conviction in this State for such crime, be sentenced \r\n    to life imprisonment without parole. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis statute was amended in 1995, but the amendment applied \r\n  prospectively to crimes committed on or after the amendment's effective date \r\n  of January 1, 1996, and so does not apply in this case. 1995 Act No. 83, by \r\n  Â§ 62.  \r\n2. In Pilgrim, the trial court \r\n  charged the jury on ABIK and ABHAN by analogizing those offenses to murder and \r\n  voluntary manslaughter respectively. The defendant objected that defining ABHAN \r\n  as voluntary manslaughter when the victim does not die, \"adds the element of \r\n  sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation (i.e., absence of malice).\" \r\n  Pilgrim II, at 27, 482 S.E.2d at 563. The Pilgrim trial court \r\n  gave the following charge, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Voluntary manslaughter is defined as the killing of a \r\n    human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation \r\n    as would be calculated to sway the reason of an ordinary person causing \r\n    him to become enraged and act upon an impulse rather than cool reflection, \r\n    thus eliminating the element of actual malice.  Now, before the defendant \r\n    could be found guilty of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, \r\n    the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that if the person assaulted \r\n    died as a result of the injury sustained the defendant would have been guilty \r\n    of manslaughter as I defined it for you. \r\n\r\n\r\nPilgrim I, 320 S.C. at 414, 465 S.E.2d at 111 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995).

Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 526 S.E.2d 732\r\n(Ct. App. 2000).  Rose argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's grant of\r\nsummary judgment on the cause of action for libel. \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis case arose from the investigation of a December 19, 1991, traffic accident.  In the early\r\nmorning hours of December 19, a car struck a van carrying four troopers and their wives home\r\nfrom a holiday party.  Several of the troopers and their wives were injured.  An investigation\r\nwas ordered.  However, the investigation was handled very poorly, a possible cover-up\r\nensued, and the incident resulted in a public relations debacle for the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Public Safety (\"SCDPS\"). (1)  A second investigation was conducted by Internal\r\nAffairs, SLED, solicitor Ralph Wilson, and special prosecutors Donnie Myers and Dick\r\nHarpootlian.  The troopers in the van and some others involved in the cover-up were\r\nindicted, (2) and SCDPS was sued by the other driver involved in the accident.  The other\r\ndriver, who was a civilian, was charged with felony DUI, but the charges were later dropped.  \r\n\r\nIn July 1993, Rose became director of SCDPS.  Rose ordered a third investigation of the\r\nalleged cover-up and appointed Robert Ivey (\"Ivey\") and John Murphy (\"Murphy') to head the\r\ninquiry.  Ivey and Murphy interviewed 100-125 people over the approximate five month\r\ninvestigation.  During the investigation, the investigators determined that Respondent, Lt.\r\nJames Fleming (\"Fleming\") had been contacted by one of the troopers involved in the\r\naccident, Jerry Cobb (\"Cobb\").  Cobb radioed Fleming, who was his supervisor, and asked\r\nhim to meet him in Georgetown.  According to Fleming, the meeting began with a discussion\r\nof golf and social matters.  In addition, Cobb expressed his anger that Trooper Cottingham,\r\nwho was also involved in the accident, was going to receive most of the insurance money and\r\nthat the people in Georgetown had collected money for the Cottinghams but not for Cobb and\r\nhis wife.  Cobb indicated he and his attorney were going to get his original statement\r\nconcerning the accident back from SLED because it was false.  Furthermore, Fleming testified\r\nCobb complained that \"all his supervisors in every place he had been were always bringing\r\nhim to Florence over things he had done wrong and he was tired of it\" and \"the s--- was about\r\nto hit the fan.\"  According to Fleming's testimony, his conversation with Cobb took place on a\r\nSaturday, and on Monday, Fleming relayed the conversation to his supervisor, James Caulder\r\n(&quot;Caulder&quot;).  \r\n\r\nThe main debate concerns whether Cobb told Fleming: (1) that the van was speeding at the\r\ntime of the accident; and (2) that he had lied about the speed to the initial investigating\r\nofficers. This was considered vital because if Fleming had passed this information on to\r\nCaulder, the investigation could have been concluded more quickly.  Ivey testified that in his\r\ninterview, Fleming indicated Cobb had told him the van was speeding at the time of the\r\naccident.  The interview report form indicates Fleming recalled Cobb talking about the speed\r\nof the van.  Fleming testified he could not recall Cobb mentioning a specific speed, but that he\r\ncould have mentioned the van was speeding.  However, Fleming stated he absolutely relayed\r\nthe entire conversation to his supervisor Caulder the next work day.  (3)\r\n\r\nAt the close of the investigation, Ivey and Murphy issued a report to Rose.  They\r\nrecommended Fleming receive a five-day suspension for failing to carry out his duties as a\r\nlieutenant by not reporting the entire contents of his conversation with Cobb to his supervisor. \r\nHowever, this discipline was reduced to a written reprimand. (4)\r\n\r\nAfter the investigation was concluded, Rose and the SCDPS issued a press release.  Many\r\narticles were published by various newspapers around the state based on this release.  It is this\r\nrelease Fleming alleges is defamatory.  The release provides, in relevant part:  \"Lt. James\r\nFleming learned key details about the accident from . . . Jerry Cobb within a few months of\r\nthe accident, including the approximate speed of the van.  Fleming did not report this\r\ninformation to his superiors.\" \r\n\r\nOn January 22, 1996, Fleming filed a cause of action against Rose and Caulder for libel,\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, and due process violations.  Rose and Caulder\r\nmoved for summary judgment.  On September 11, 1998, the circuit judge granted summary\r\njudgment and dismissed the action, ruling that Fleming was a public official and the\r\npublication had been limited to fair comment without actual malice.  Fleming and Caulder\r\nappealed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment to Caulder but \r\nreversed the grant to Rose, holding there was evidence in the record from which the jury could\r\ninfer Rose acted with actual malice.    Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 526 S.E.2d 732 (2000). \r\nRose petitioned this Court for certiorari.  The sole issue now before this Court is:\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Rose,\r\nand holding the record contained sufficient evidence to send the question of whether Rose\r\nacted with actual malice to the jury?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nRose argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's grant of summary\r\njudgment as to the cause of action for libel.  We agree.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard\r\napplied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  Peterson v. West Am. Ins. Co., 336\r\nS.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999).  Summary judgment is appropriate when\r\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter\r\nof law.  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty.  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).\r\n\r\nIn order to prove defamation, the complaining party must show: (1) a false and defamatory\r\nstatement was made; (2) the unprivileged statement was published to a third party; (3) the\r\npublisher was at fault; and (4) either the statement was actionable irrespective of harm or the\r\npublication of the statement caused special harm. (5)  Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers,\r\n332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (1998) (Toal, J. concurring in result in a separate opinion)\r\n(Holtzscheiter II).  The publication of a statement is defamatory if it tends to harm the\r\nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third\r\npersons from associating or dealing with him. Id.\r\n\r\nA.  Fault of the Publisher\r\n\r\nFleming, at all times at issue in this case, was a lieutenant serving as a highway patrol officer\r\nin the SCDPS.  Therefore, he is a \"public figure\" for the purposes of defamation law.  State v.\r\nBridgers, 329 S.C. 11, 16, 495 S.E.2d 196, 198 (1997) (\"Highway Patrol officers are 'public\r\nofficials.' \").  When a public figure seeks to recover damages for a defamatory falsehood\r\nrelating to his official conduct, the \"fault\" he must prove is that the statement was made with\r\n\"actual malice.\"  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-280, 84 S. Ct. 710, 726,\r\n11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 706 (1964); Elder v. Gaffney Ledger, 341 S.C. 108, 533 S.E.2d 899 (2000). \r\nActual malice means the publisher of the statement had knowledge the statement was false or\r\nacted with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was false.  Id.  In addition, the public\r\nfigure must demonstrate actual malice by \"clear and convincing proof.\"  Sunshine Sportswear\r\n&amp; Electronics, Inc. v. WSOC Television, Inc., 738 F. Supp. 1499, 1506 (D.S.C. 1989) (citing\r\nNew York Times v. Sulllivan); Miller v. City of W. Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 228, 471 S.E.2d\r\n683, 685 (1996) (\"To recover on a claim for defamation, the constitutional actual malice\r\nstandard requires a public figure to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the\r\ndefamatory falsehood was made with [actual malice]\"); Botchie v. O'Dowd, 315 S.C. 126,\r\n432 S.E.2d 458 (1993).  (6)\r\n\r\nRecently, in Elder v. Gaffney Ledger, this Court discussed the constitutional actual malice\r\nstandard. (7)\r\n\r\n\r\n  The constitutional actual malice standard requires a public \r\n    official to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defamatory falsehood \r\n    was made with the knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for \r\n    its truth. A \"reckless disregard for the truth, however, requires more than \r\n    a departure from reasonable prudent conduct.\" There must be sufficient evidence \r\n    to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious \r\n    doubt as to the truth of his publication. There must be evidence the defendant \r\n    had a \"high degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nElder, 341 S.C. at 114, 533 S.E.2d at 902 (emphasis added by the Court) (citations omitted). \r\nFleming has not provided clear and convincing proof that Rose \"in fact entertained serious\r\ndoubt as to the truth of the publication\" or that Rose had a \"high degree of awareness\" that the\r\npress release was false.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found there was evidence in the record to indicate Rose acted with\r\nreckless disregard of the falsity of the press release.  The opinion focused on two factors or\r\n\"groups\" of evidence to support their conclusion: (1) the testimony of Louis Fontana and\r\nAlton Morris who stated the normal policy was not to release the names of police officers\r\ninvolved in disciplinary proceedings; and (2) the fact that the investigation did not involve\r\nFleming's direct supervisor, Caulder, and Caulder was not asked about whether Fleming\r\npassed on the information he received during his conversation with Cobb.  Fleming, supra.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first factor, the Court of Appeals should \r\n  not have given such great weight to the fact that the names were not normally \r\n  released. In Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. \r\n  657, 109 S. Ct. 2678, 105 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1989), the United States Supreme Court \r\n  held that a court could consider evidence that a newspaper departed from professional \r\n  standards when deciding if the newspaper acted with actual malice. However, \r\n  the Court clarified the statement by saying, \". . . courts must be careful not \r\n  to place too much reliance on such factors. . . .\" Id. at 668, 109 \r\n  S. Ct. at 2686. Furthermore, Harte-Hanks involved the  media\r\npublishers' \r\n  investigation and their failure to follow accepted media industry standards \r\n  for investigating information provided by informants. The instant case involves \r\n  a police investigation, and there is no evidence that the investigation conducted \r\n  by Murphy and Ivey did not conform with police investigatory standards. Finally, \r\n  although the names of officers involved in disciplinary action were normally \r\n  not released, we cannot hold this constituted a violation of a \"professional \r\n  standard.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the second factor relied on by the Court of Appeals, we find the conclusion is not\r\nsupported by the record.  Caulder stated in his deposition that he was interviewed by Ivey.  He\r\nstated that although he could not recall Ivey questioning him about the information Fleming\r\nconveyed to him about his conversation with Cobb, he could not say for certain Ivey had not\r\nasked him about the meeting.  Ivey testified he interviewed Caulder, and Ivey's report to Rose\r\ncontained a portion of the interview.  Ivey stated Caulder told him Fleming reported Cobb was\r\nangry about the insurance money distributed after the accident and upset about the amount of\r\ncommunity support another couple injured in the accident had received.  Ivey also testified\r\nCaulder told him Fleming had not reported that Cobb had lied about the speed of the van.  \r\n\r\nWe find the facts relied on by the Court of Appeals' do not amount to \"clear and convincing\"\r\nproof that Rose acted with actual malice.  The evidence shows Rose relied on the results and\r\nconclusions of an investigation conducted by two highly respected investigators.  Rose\r\ntestified he had no reason to doubt the investigation was not thorough, solid, correct, and\r\ntruthful.  Others involved in the press release testified \"there was obviously a strong feeling\r\nthat the information was correct.\"  The evidence shows Rose relied completely on the\r\ninvestigation by Ivey and Murphy and had full faith in the veracity of their report.  There is no\r\nevidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, that Rose had knowledge that the\r\nstatement setting forth the findings of the investigation with regard to Fleming was false, if it\r\nwas indeed false, or that he had serious doubts as to the truth of the report.  Moreover, actual\r\nmalice cannot be shown from Rose's failure to perform his own investigation because there\r\nwere no obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of Ivey's report and no evidence that Rose was\r\npurposefully avoiding the truth.\r\n\r\nB.  Falsity and Publication\r\n\r\nBecause Fleming cannot show by clear and convincing proof that Rose acted with actual\r\nmalice, there is no need for this Court to address the other elements of defamation. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the above evidence, we hold the Court of Appeals erred in finding there was \"clear\r\nand convincing\" evidence in the record to support Fleming's claim that Rose acted with actual\r\nmalice.  Therefore, we REVERSE the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to Rose,\r\nand reinstate the trial court's grant of summary judgment.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. From the record, it appears the main problem with the investigation involved the speed of\r\nthe troopers' vehicle.  Immediately after the accident, the driver of the van stated that although\r\nhe was traveling at 70 miles per hour prior to the accident, at the time of the accident, he was\r\ndriving 45 mph (the speed limit at the scene was 45).  Apparently, the other troopers in the\r\nvan confirmed the story at first.  The initial accident report indicates the troopers' van was\r\ntraveling 45 mph.  However, the skid marks left at the scene, which were not examined until\r\nmuch later, indicated the van was traveling about 67 mph. Furthermore, at least one occupant\r\nof the van later changed his story to indicate the van was traveling around 70 mph. There was\r\nalso some question as to whether the troopers had open containers of alcohol in the van. \r\n2. These indictments were later dismissed.\r\n3. Fleming has been adamant throughout that he never lied or misled Caulder or anyone else. \r\nHe offered to take a lie detector test or truth serum, neither of which were ever administered.\r\n4. Fleming repeatedly tried to contest the reprimand, but under SCDPS' policies, a written\r\nreprimand is not grievable. \r\n5. As discussed below, Fleming was a public figure.  Since the statement was a written\r\ndefamation (libel) and concerned a public figure, Fleming is not required to show special\r\nharm or damages.  Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497\r\n(1998).\r\n6. Fleming, in his brief to this Court, argues that at the summary judgment stage of the\r\nproceedings, it is only necessary for the non-moving party to submit a \"scintilla of evidence\r\nwarranting a determination by a jury.\" (citing Hill v. York County Sheriff's Dep't, 313 S.C.\r\n303, 437 S.E.2d 179 (Ct. App. 1993) for support).  In light of the federal and state cases on\r\ncauses of action for libel brought by a public figure requiring \"clear and convincing proof,\"\r\nwe disagree with Fleming's characterization that he needs only to produce a scintilla of\r\nevidence that Rose acted with actual malice in order to defeat Rose's motion for summary\r\njudgment.\r\n7. This case was decided after the Court of Appeals issued its opinion in the instant case. \r\nHowever, it did not announce a new standard of proof.  See Miller v.

Norton (\"Mr. Norton\") a new trial after the jury returned a\r\nverdict for Norfolk.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nMr. Norton brought this action pursuant to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (1) (\"FELA\")\r\nseeking to recover damages for alleged injury to his knee caused by Norfolk's negligence. \r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Norfolk, finding no negligence on the part of Norfolk.  After\r\nthe verdict, Mr. Norton moved for a new trial based on  South Carolina's thirteenth juror\r\ndoctrine. (2)  The trial court granted Mr. Norton's Motion for New Trial.\r\n\r\nFELA is a federal statute which provides the framework for handling the injury claims of\r\nfederal railroad workers.  State courts have concurrent jurisdiction to hear FELA claims.  45\r\nU.S.C. Â§ 56.  A FELA action brought in state court is controlled by federal substantive law\r\nand state procedural law. However, a form of practice may not defeat a federal right.  Brown\r\nv. Western Ry. of Ala., 338 U.S. 294, 70 S. Ct. 105, 94 L. Ed. 100 (1949).  It is firmly\r\nestablished that questions of sufficiency of evidence for the jury in cases arising under FELA\r\nin state courts are to be determined by federal rules.  Brady v. Southern Ry. Co., 320 U.S. 476,\r\n64 S. Ct. 232, 88 L. Ed. 239 (1943).\r\n\r\nA motion for a new trial involves analysis of the sufficiency of evidence, to be determined by\r\nfederal, not state, rules in FELA actions.  In his motion for a new trial, Mr. Norton urged the\r\ntrial judge to apply the state-law standard for granting a new trial, the thirteenth juror doctrine. \r\nThe parties now recognize the Motion for New Trial was governed by federal law, and that the\r\ntrial judge was obligated to apply the federal standard in considering the new trial motion. (3) \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of a new trial on grounds that the state and federal\r\nnew trial standards are not distinguishable, and that the new trial motion was properly granted\r\nunder both the state-law thirteenth juror doctrine and the federal standard.\r\n\r\nNorfolk raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that there is \"no    significant difference\" between\r\nthe state-law thirteenth juror    doctrine and the federal standard for a new trial, thereby   \r\nimplying that the state and federal standards for a new trial are    interchangeable?\r\n\r\nII. Did the trial court apply the state-law thirteenth juror    doctrine or the appropriate federal\r\nstandard in granting Mr.    Norton's Motion for New Trial?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nI.  State and Federal Standards\r\n\r\nMr. Norton argues that the Court of Appeals correctly held that the  state-law thirteenth juror\r\ndoctrine and the federal standard governing the grant of a new trial are substantially similar. \r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's thirteenth juror doctrine is well established as the standard for granting a\r\nnew trial in state law actions.  See Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 387 S.E.2d 265 (1990);\r\nSorin Equipment Co., Inc. v. The Firm, Inc., 323 S.C. 359, 474 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nSimilarly, the federal standard  for granting a new trial has been set forth clearly by the Fourth\r\nCircuit.  Connor v. Schraeder-Bridgeport Int'l, Inc., 227 F.3d 179 (4th Cir. 2000); Atlas Food\r\nSystems and Services, Inc. v. Crane Nat'l Vendors, Inc., 99 F.3d 587 (4th Cir. 1996). \r\nAlthough the state and federal standards use some similar language, we do not believe the\r\nstandards, compared on the whole, are \"substantially similar,\" or similar enough to be used\r\ninterchangeably. (4) \r\n\r\nThis Court has reviewed the thirteenth juror doctrine on several occasions and has refused to\r\nabolish it or to require trial judges to provide reasons for their decisions.  Folkens, 300 S.C.\r\n251, 387 S.E.2d 265.  South Carolina's thirteenth juror doctrine is so named because it entitles\r\nthe trial judge to sit, in essence, as the thirteenth juror when he finds \"the evidence does not\r\njustify the verdict,\" and then to grant a new trial based solely \"upon the facts.\"  Id. at 254, 387\r\nS.E.2d at 267 (citing South Carolina State Highway Dep't v. Townsend, 265 S.C. 253, 217\r\nS.E.2d 778 (1975)).  As the \"thirteenth juror,\" the trial judge can hang the jury by refusing to\r\nagree to the jury's otherwise unanimous verdict.  Id.  As this Court explained in Folkens,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect is the same as if the jury failed to reach a verdict . . . . When a jury fails to reach a\r\nverdict, a new trial is ordered.  Neither judge nor the jury is required to give reasons for this\r\noutcome.  Similarly, because the result of the 'thirteenth juror' vote by the judge is a new trial\r\nrather than an adjustment to the verdict, no purpose would be served by requiring the trial\r\njudge to make factual findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. \r\n\r\nUpon review, a trial judge's order granting or denying a new trial will be upheld unless the\r\norder is \"wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the conclusion reached was controlled by an\r\nerror of law.\"  Folkens, 300 S.C. at 254-55, 387 S.E.2d at 267 (citing South Carolina State\r\nHighway Dep't v. Clarkson, 267 S.C. 121, 226 S.E.2d 696 (1976)).  This Court's \"review is\r\nlimited to consideration of whether evidence exists to support the trial court's order.\"  Id. at\r\n255, 387 S.E.2d at 267.  As long as there is conflicting evidence, this Court has held the trial\r\njudge's grant of a new trial will not be disturbed.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe federal standard, on the other hand, is more narrowly tailored.  Upon a Rule 59,\r\nFRCP,\r\nmotion,\r\n\r\n\r\na new trial is warranted when (1) the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence; (2)\r\nthe verdict is based upon evidence which is false; or (3) the verdict will result in a miscarriage\r\nof justice.  In considering a new trial motion, the district court may weigh the evidence and\r\nconsider the credibility of the witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConnor, 227 F.3d at 200 (emphasis added) (citing Atlas, 99 F.3d 587, 594 (4th Cir. 1996);\r\nWyatt v. Interstate &amp; Ocean Transport Co., 623 F.2d 888, 891 (4th Cir. 1980)).  The Fourth\r\nCircuit permits the trial judge to grant a new trial in these three situations \"even though there\r\nmay be substantial evidence which would prevent direction of a verdict.\"  Atlas, 99 F.3d at\r\n594.\r\n\r\nUnder the federal standard, appellate courts review a district court's grant or denial of a new\r\ntrial for abuse of discretion only.  Connor; Atlas.  Absent a clear abuse of discretion, the trial\r\njudge's decision will not be disturbed, as the trial court is in a position to view the evidence\r\n\"from a perspective that  an appellate court can never match.\"  Bristol Steel &amp; Iron Works,\r\nInc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 41 F.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).  Despite\r\nthis broad deference, the Fourth Circuit has held that a material legal error, by definition,\r\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.  Connor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the thirteenth juror standard and the federal new trial standard could be applied in\r\nsome cases to the same result, we believe the thirteenth juror standard empowers a South\r\nCarolina trial judge to grant a new trial on a lesser showing than the federal standard.  The\r\nFourth Circuit consistently requires the verdict to be against the \"clear weight of the\r\nevidence.\"  Connor; Atlas.  In contrast, the thirteenth juror doctrine has been interpreted\r\nconsistently by this Court, albeit in varying language, as requiring something less.\r\n\r\nFor instance, this Court has held, \"there can be no doubt that a trial judge has the discretionary\r\npower to grant a new trial absolute or Nisi in a law case upon his disapproval of the verdict on\r\nfactual grounds, and in this role he has been recognized and designated as the thirteenth\r\njuror.\"  South Carolina State Highway Dep't v. Townsend, 265 S.C. 253, 258, 217 S.E.2d\r\n778, 781 (1975)  (emphasis added) (citing Worrell v. South Carolina Power Co., 186 S.C.\r\n306, 195 S.E.2d 638 (1938)).  In Worrell, this Court went so far as to describe the trial judge,\r\nwhen acting as thirteenth juror, as \"possessing the veto power to the Nth degree,\" and held \"it\r\nmust be presumed . . . [that the trial judge] recognizes and appreciates his responsibility, and\r\nexercises the discretion vested in him with fairness and impartiality.\"  Worrell, 186 S.C. at\r\n313-14, 195 S.E.2d at 641 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAlthough application of the two standards could conceivably lead to the same result, we find\r\nthat the thirteenth juror standard is broader and would permit granting of new trials where the\r\nfederal standard would not.  Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals to the extent that it\r\nheld the two standards to be substantially similar. (5)\r\n\r\nII.  Standard Applied in this Case\r\n\r\nIn this case, the parties now recognize that the federal standard for granting a new trial should\r\napply because the action was brought under the federal FELA statute.  See Brady v. Southern\r\nRy. Co.  At trial, however, Mr. Norton based his motion for a new trial on the state-law\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine and urged the trial judge to apply that standard in granting a new trial. \r\nAccording to the Court of Appeals' decision, Norfolk argued that the federal standard should\r\napply and the trial judge should deny the Motion for New Trial under that standard. \r\nUnfortunately, however, neither Norfolk's Motion in Opposition nor the transcript of the\r\nargument of the Motion for New Trial were made part of the record on appeal.  The trial court\r\ngranted the Motion for New Trial, but did not indicate explicitly which standard he was\r\napplying in granting the motion.  The trial court ruled as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finds as a matter of fact that the verdict returned herein is contrary to the fair\r\npreponderance of the evidence presented at trial.  The verdict indicates the jury failed to\r\nproperly consider and follow the instructions of the court in its deliberations.  Accordingly,\r\nthe Court concludes that the exercise of judicial discretion and the awarding of a new trial for\r\nthe plaintiff is appropriate and should be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Norton's Memorandum in Support of the Motion for New Trial, he argued,\r\n\r\n\r\n[t]he verdict returned herein is contrary to the preponderance of the evidence and is not\r\nsupported by the factual testimony of the parties at trial.  The verdict indicates the jury failed\r\nto properly consider and follow the instructions of the court in its deliberations.  Accordingly,\r\nthe exercise of judicial discretion and the awarding of a new trial to the plaintiff is\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words used in trial judge's order granting the Motion and in Mr. Norton's Memorandum\r\nare nearly identical.  Both state that the verdict is contradictory to the \"preponderance of the\r\nevidence\" (not that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence).  Further, in support\r\nof his argument, Mr. Norton cited Folkens and other South Carolina cases enunciating the\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine.  Mr. Norton did discuss the applicability of federal law to substantive\r\nmatters, such as negligence, in this case, but appears to have considered the granting of a new\r\ntrial a purely procedural matter, governed by state law, as he did not cite to any cases\r\nillustrating the federal standard for a new trial.  Mr. Norton's Motion for New Trial\r\nspecifically requests a new trial \"according to the doctrine of the thirteenth juror,\" and he\r\nnever used the \"against the clear weight of the evidence\" language employed by the federal\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n  Considering the record before the Court, we believe the trial judge  applied the state-law\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine, not the federal standard.  All parties now agree the appropriate\r\nstandard for a new trial in this FELA action is the federal standard, but Mr. Norton argues the\r\ngrant of a new trial should be upheld because the standards are substantially similar.  As we\r\nconcluded that the state and federal standards are not substantially similar, the grant of a new\r\ntrial cannot be upheld on that ground.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge should have applied the federal \"against the clear weight of the evidence\"\r\nstandard.  Instead, he granted Mr. Norton a new trial based on the state-law thirteenth juror\r\ndoctrine.  By doing so, he committed an error of law, which, by definition, constitutes an\r\nabuse of discretion under the federal standard.  See Connor.  We reverse the Court of Appeals\r\non the ground that the trial judge abused his discretion under the applicable federal standard.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we analyze the Motion for New Trial on the merits under the federal standard\r\n(as the trial judge should have done), we reach the same result.  Although some conflicting\r\nevidence was presented in this case, it is more than evident that the jury's verdict was not\r\n\"against the clear weight of the evidence.\" (6)  Admittedly, there may have been sufficient\r\nevidence of negligence to uphold the grant of a new trial under the thirteenth juror\r\n\"preponderance\" standard, (7) but, the federal against clear weight standard requires something\r\nmore than a preponderance to grant a new trial.  The record here simply does not reveal\r\nanything more than a very small amount of evidence that Norfolk was negligent. \r\n\r\nIn our opinion, this case illustrates the difference between the state and federal new trial\r\nstandards, as it is one of the cases where a new trial could be granted under the state-law\r\nthirteenth juror doctrine, but not under the federal standard.  Mr. Norton is not entitled to a\r\nnew trial under the applicable federal standard, and the circuit court's grant of a new trial is\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the Court of Appeals and reinstate the jury's\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1.   45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 et seq.\r\n2.   Mr. Norton's Motion for New Trial and Memorandum in Support are part of the record,\r\nand contain his argument for application of the thirteenth juror standard.  Norfolk's Motion in\r\nOpposition to the Motion for New Trial is not in the record on appeal, but is referred to in the\r\nCourt of Appeals' decision.  Norton v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company, 341 S.C. 165,\r\n533 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n3.   In its opinion, the Court of Appeals noted that the parties stipulated at oral argument that\r\nfederal law governed the issues presented.  Norton.\r\n\r\n4.   Rule 59 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (\"SCRCP\") and Rule 59 of the\r\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"FRCP\") set the general standard for new trials.  Both the\r\nSCRCP and the FRCP rely on prior precedent for granting new trials from the state and\r\nfederal jurisdictions respectively.  Under the SCRCP, a \"new trial may be granted . . . (1) in an\r\naction in which there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new trials have\r\nheretofore been granted, in the courts of the State.\"  The FRCP contains identical language\r\nexcept it relies on the precedent set \"in the courts of the United States\" rather than the courts\r\nof \"the State.\"   \r\n5.  In support of its decision that the \r\n  federal and state standards for new trials are similar, the Court of Appeals \r\n  found that a relaxed standard of negligence applies in FELA actions. Norton. \r\n  The Court of Appeals cited an opinion from the Second Circuit in support of \r\n  this proposition. Ulfik v. Metro-North Commuter R. R., 77 F.3d 54 (2d \r\n  Cir. 1996). Norfolk points out, however, that the Fourth Circuit has not adopted \r\n  this proposition and, to the contrary, has held \"the Supreme Court has cautioned \r\n  that the FELA . . . is not to be interpreted as a workers' compensation statute \r\n  and that the unmodified negligence principles are to be applied as \r\n  informed by common law.\" Hernandez v. Trawler Miss Vertie Mae, Inc., \r\n  187 F.3d 432, 436-37 (4th Cir. 1999) (emphasis added) (citing Consolidated \r\n  Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 114 S.Ct. 396, 129 L. Ed 2d. 427 \r\n  (1994). Considering this precedent, the Court of Appeals created a relaxed standard \r\n  of negligence in federal law where there is not one, at least not in the Fourth \r\n  Circuit. \r\n6.   Mr. Norton alleges he twisted his knee on the job by stepping into an empty cardboard box\r\non the floor that was partially hidden from view by the bottom shelf of a bookcase.  He did not\r\nreport any injury until he twisted his knee again two weeks later.  Mr. Norton had surgery to\r\ncorrect a torn miniscus and can no longer perform his job at Norfolk.  At trial, the only\r\nevidence of Norfolk's negligence presented was the existence of an informal  practice by the\r\nemployees of keeping empty boxes around the workplace to be used to carry various things\r\n(nuts and bolts, etc.) from the shop out to the tracks to perform repairs.  To the contrary, other\r\nevidence established that Norfolk's formal policy required the employees to keep the\r\nworkspace clean.  There was a very visible sign in the shop where Mr. Norton was injured\r\nstating it was the responsibility of the employees to keep the workplace clean and tidy.  \r\n7.   See Folkens (upholding a trial judge's grant of a new trial when there is conflicting\r\nevidence unless there is an error of law).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25502","title":"R &amp; G Construction v.

(1)  For reasons set forth below we vacate, reverse and remand the case for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh was sentenced to prison in 1996 for Assault with \r\n  Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual Conduct in the Third Degree of a comatose patient \r\n  in his care. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. See State v. Luckabaugh, \r\n  327 S.C. 495, 489 S.E.2d 657 (Ct. App. 1997). Subsequent to his scheduled release \r\n  he came under review as a sexually violent predator. \r\n\r\nJudge Daniel E. Martin, Sr., convened a commitment hearing after Luckabaugh's scheduled\r\nrelease.  Two experts testified for the State:  Doctor Brad Clayton (\"Dr. Clayton\") and Doctor\r\nDonna Schwartz-Watts (\"Dr. Schwartz-Watts\").  Dr. Randolph Waid (\"Dr. Waid\") testified\r\nfor Luckabaugh.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts and Dr. Clayton conducted a clinical evaluation of Luckabaugh.  Both\r\nconcluded Luckabaugh suffers from sexual sadism, a major mental abnormality, characterized\r\nby \"preoccupation with and intrusive problems with thoughts, feelings, fantasies, urges, and\r\nbehaviors that focus around behavior or thoughts of behavior, about causing harm to others,\r\nhumiliating, [and] torturing [them].\"  Sadism is treatable but not curable. \r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts' report suggests Luckabaugh's disease dates to 1967 when he began\r\nstruggling with obsessive thoughts of torturing others. (2)  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified\r\nLuckabaugh wrote numerous, graphic stories involving themes of kidnaping, torture and\r\nmurder. (3)  She found the themes consistent with sadism, particularly his obsession with\r\nhaving sex with unconscious individuals.  Further, the results of Luckabaugh's penile\r\nplethysmography (4) indicated he was aroused by images of coercive sexual acts.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts opined Luckabaugh was a high risk to re-offend and needed extensive\r\ninpatient treatment.  Additionally, she stated  her belief that Luckabaugh was the most\r\ndangerous person she had evaluated under the Act.  \r\n\r\nDr. Waid, testifying for Luckabaugh, stated his diagnosis was essentially the same as Dr.\r\nSchwartz-Watts'.  Specifically, Dr. Waid believed Luckabaugh was a sexual sadist, with at\r\nleast a moderate risk for \"re-event,\" and in need of aggressive therapy.  Dr. Waid differed with\r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts' opinion by concluding Luckabaugh could obtain outpatient treatment. \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh, testifying at the hearing, refused to accept the diagnosis of sexual sadism.  He\r\nadmitted attempting to publish his writings but stated he did not because:  \"at some point they\r\ngot too violent and gross, even for me.\"  However, he felt he would not re-offend after\r\ngrowing spiritually in prison and building a mentor relationship with church members. \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Did the lower court err in concluding the State failed to meet   its burden proving\r\nLuckabaugh was a sexually violent predator?\r\n\r\nII. Did the lower court err in concluding the Sexually Violent    Predator Act violated the ex\r\npost facto provision of the South   Carolina Constitution?\r\n\r\nIII. Is the Sexually Violent Predator Act unconstitutional on other   grounds raised by\r\nLuckabaugh?\r\n\r\n  \r\nA. Does the Sexually Violent Predator Act violate the     substantive due process clause of the\r\nUnited States and    South Carolina Constitutions?\r\n\r\nB. Does the Sexually Violent Predator Act violate the     procedural due process clause of the\r\nUnited States and    South Carolina Constitutions?\r\n\r\nC. Does the Sexually Violent Predator Act violate the     equal protection clause of the United\r\nStates and South    Carolina Constitutions?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBurden of Proof\r\n\r\nInitially, the State argues the effect of the order below is to grant a directed verdict.  We\r\ndisagree.  The record establishes the court below issued its order as a hearing court conducting\r\nan action at law, sitting without a jury pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100\r\n(Supp. 2000).  \r\n\r\nThe State next contends the lower court erred because it \r\n  failed to substantially comply with Rule 52(a), SCRCP. When reviewing an action \r\n  at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, this Court will not disturb \r\n  the judge's findings of fact \"unless found to be without evidence which reasonably \r\n  supports the judge's findings.\" Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). The South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure require \"[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with \r\n  an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately \r\n  its conclusions of law thereon.\" Rule 52(a), SCRCP. The rule is directorial \r\n  in nature so \"where a trial court substantially complies with Rule 52(a) \r\n  and adequately states the basis for the result it reaches, the appellate \r\n  court should not vacate the trial court's judgment for lack of an explicit or \r\n  specific factual finding.\" Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  122, 123 (1991)(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe court below, in deciding that Luckabaugh was not a sexually violent predator, wrote: \r\n\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the evidence I find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nthe Defendant meets the definition of a 'sexually violent predator'...[e]ven if Defendant\r\nsuffers from the personality disorder known as sexual sadism, the State failed to show this\r\ncondition makes it likely that the Defendant will engage in future acts of sexual violence if not\r\nconfined in a secure facility for longer term control, care and treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe order did not find any facts to support its legal conclusion that the State failed to carry its\r\nburden of proof.\r\n\r\nThis Court has had the opportunity to review the adequacy \r\n  of similar orders, particularly in family court and administrative law decisions. \r\n  See, e.g., State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, \r\n  338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000); Kiawah Property Owners Group v. Public \r\n  Serv. Com'n of South Carolina, 338 S.C. 92, 525 S.E.2d 863 (1999) (administrative \r\n  law decision); Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 405 S.E.2d 821 (1991) \r\n  (family court order).\r\n\r\nAppellants in State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, \r\n  supra, argued the magistrate's order and returns were invalid under Rule \r\n  52(a), SCRCP. The relevant part of the return stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  After carefully reviewing these machines, I find them \r\n    to be slot machines. These machines register varying amounts of winnings depending \r\n    upon which combination of various symbols are displayed after a coin is inserted \r\n    and a button is pushed. They require no skill to play. I have considered the \r\n    Court's reasoning in State v. Four Video Slot Machines, 317 S.C. 397, \r\n    453 S.E.2d 896 (1995) and State v. One Coin-Operated Video Game Machine, \r\n    321 S.C. 176, 467 S.E.2d 443 (1996), as well as the 1993 amendments to Title \r\n    1-2 of the South Carolina Code concerning video games. I find and conclude \r\n    that the defendant machines are in violation of [South Carolina law].\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 198, 525 S.E.2d at 884. \r\n\r\nWe found the magistrate's order \"clearly set out what statute \r\n  was violated and how the machines violated it.\" Id. Therefore, we found \r\n  the order substantially complied with Rule 52(a), SCRCP. \r\n\r\nTrial courts, sitting without juries in an action at law, write their findings specially and\r\nseparately:  \r\n\r\n\r\nto allow a reviewing court to determine from the record whether the judgment--and the legal\r\nconclusions which underlie it--represent a correct application of the law.   The requirement for\r\nappropriately detailed findings is thus not a mere formality or a rule of empty ritual;  it is\r\ndesigned instead to dispose of the issues raised by the pleadings and to allow the appellate\r\ncourts to perform their proper function in the judicial system.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCoble v. Coble, 300 N.C. 708, 712, 268 S.E.2d 185, \r\n  189 (N.C. 1980) (internal citations omitted) (applying North Carolina's equivalent \r\n  of our Rule 52(a), SCRCP); see also United States v. Birnbach, \r\n  400 F.2d 378 (8th Cir. 1968). Compliance with the rule also allows the trial \r\n  judge to satisfy the interest of judicial economy by dealing fully and properly \r\n  with all issues before the court. See In re Las Colinas, Inc., \r\n  426 F.2d 1005 (1st Cir. 1970)(construing Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 52 on which our \r\n  rule is based).\r\n\r\nWe do not require a lower court to set out findings on all \r\n  the myriad factual questions arising in a particular case. See Golf \r\n  City, Inc. v. Wilson Sporting Goods, Co., Inc., 555 F.2d 426 (5th Cir. 1977). \r\n  But the findings must be sufficient to allow this Court, sitting in its appellate \r\n  capacity, to ensure the law is faithfully executed below. The absence of factual \r\n  findings makes our task of reviewing the court order impossible because \"the \r\n  reasons underlying the decision [are] left to speculation.\" Kiawah Property \r\n  Owners Group v. Public Serv. Com'n of South Carolina, 338 S.C. at 96, 525 \r\n  S.E.2d at 866 (quoting Able Communications, Inc. v. S.C. Public Serv. Comm'n, \r\n  290 S.C. 409, 411, 351 S.E.2d 151, 152 (1986)). To leave the chore of sorting \r\n  through the record to review contradictory testimony taxes the judicial system \r\n  and is unfair to the litigants as well as the lower court to whose factual determinations \r\n  we give deference. See Welsh Co. of California v. Strolee of California, \r\n  Inc., 290 F.2d 509 (9th Cir. 1961).\r\n\r\nThe order now before us fails to substantially comply with Rule 52(a), SCRCP, thus failing to\r\naccomplish these purposes.  Our review of the record cannot save the order from its\r\ndeficiencies due to the contradictory testimony presented below.  All three medical experts\r\nagreed Luckabaugh suffers from sexual sadism, that he is a risk to re-offend, and that he needs\r\naggressive medical treatment.  Luckabaugh disagreed with this diagnosis.  Dr. Waid,\r\nLuckabaugh's medical expert, differed with the State in whether Luckabaugh could\r\nsuccessfully complete treatment on an outpatient basis.\r\n\r\nThe testimony leads us to speculate if the court below reached \r\n  its conclusion because it believed Luckabaugh's self-diagnosis over the diagnosis \r\n  of three medical experts. If the State failed to prove a dangerous mental condition, \r\n  the lower court order would be correct in its ultimate conclusion. See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)(b) (Supp. 2000)(sexual violent predator is someone who, \r\n  in part, \"suffers from a mental abnormality...that makes the person likely to \r\n  engage in acts of sexual violence....\"). Alternatively, the court below may \r\n  have concluded Dr. Waid's opinion was more credible than Dr. Schwartz-Watts' \r\n  opinion on whether Luckabaugh needed in-patient treatment. The order's ultimate \r\n  conclusion would be correct if the State failed to prove Luckabaugh's mental \r\n  condition required his confinement. See id. \r\n\r\nThe order below provides no findings of fact to support its ultimate legal conclusion.  Without\r\nfindings of fact, we are forced to wade through the record and speculate how the lower court\r\nviewed the ultimate facts when confronted with contradictory evidence.\r\n\r\nAs such, we vacate the order in this case and remand it to the circuit court for a new hearing. (5) \r\nAt the conclusion, the judge shall issue an order that substantially complies with Rule 52(a),\r\nSCRCP.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEx Post Facto Violation\r\n\r\nThe court below, aside from finding the State failed to meet its burden, also found the Act\r\nunconstitutional.  Specifically, the trial court found the Act violated the ex post facto clause of\r\nthe South Carolina Constitution.  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 4.\r\n\r\nThis Court is reluctant to find a statute unconstitutional. \r\n  Every presumption is made in favor of a statute's constitutionality. Gold \r\n  v. South Carolina Bd. of Chiropractic Exam'rs, 271 S.C. 74, 245 S.E.2d 117 \r\n  (1978). A \"legislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless its \r\n  repugnance to the constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Joytime \r\n  Distribs. and Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d \r\n  647, 650 (1999). Luckabaugh bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional. \r\n  See Home Health Serv., Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 312 \r\n  S.C. 324, 440 S.E.2d 375 (1994).\r\n\r\nFor a law to fall within ex post facto prohibitions \r\n  it must first retroactively apply to events occurring before its enactment. \r\n  State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 433 S.E.2d 864 (1993). Second, the law \r\n  must disadvantage the offender affected by it. See  id.; see \r\n  also Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 531 S.E.2d 507 (2000)(an \r\n  ex post facto law occurs when a change in the law retroactively alters \r\n  the definition of a crime or increases the punishment for a crime). A statute \r\n  must be criminal or penal in purpose or nature to offend the ex post facto \r\n  clause. State v. Huiett, 302 S.C. 169, 394 S.E.2d 486 (1990)(citing Flemming \r\n  v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960)).\r\n\r\nThe Act meets the first prong by applying retroactively to events occurring before its\r\nenactment.  In particular, the Act applies to Luckabaugh whose offense triggering the Act was\r\ncommitted prior to its enactment.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second prong, this Court recently held the \r\n  Act is a civil, non-punitive scheme. See In re Matthews, 345 S.C. \r\n  638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001) (Act does not violate Double Jeopardy clause of the \r\n  Federal or South Carolina constitutions because it does not constitute punishment). \r\n  As we noted in Matthews, South Carolina's Act is modeled on Kansas' Sexually \r\n  Violent Predator Act, which the United States Supreme Court determined did not \r\n  violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. \r\n  See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d \r\n  501 (1997). In a separate case, In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of \r\n  McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001), we concluded: \"a side by \r\n  side comparison of our SVP Act and the Kansas Act does not reveal any substantial \r\n  differences.\" Id. at 91, 551 S.E.2d at 238. Appellant has the burden \r\n  of overcoming this presumption by \"the clearest proof that the statutory scheme \r\n  is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the [Legislature's] \r\n  intention\" that the Act is civil.  In re Matthews, supra, (citing \r\n  Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001)).\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh provides three reasons supporting his assertion that the Act is penal in purpose or\r\nnature.  They are:  1) the nature of the confinement due to the inter-agency agreement between\r\nthe Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\") and the South Carolina Department of Corrections\r\n(\"SCDC\"); 2) individuals committed under the act are not entitled to rights of other patients in\r\nthe care of the DMH; and 3) the Act requires a previous criminal conviction.\r\n\r\nA. Inter-agency Agreement\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh contends the presence of an inter-agency agreement between the DMH and\r\nSCDC for the housing of those committed under the Act evidences its penal purpose and\r\nnature.  Luckabaugh differentiates the Act from the Kansas statute by noting individuals\r\ncommitted under the Kansas statute experience the same conditions as many involuntarily\r\ncommitted patients in the state mental hospital.  The South Carolina Act allows for an inter-agency agreement between the DMH and SCDC which \"authorizes the transfer of control,\r\ncare and treatment [between the two agencies] without any limitation on time or conditions of\r\nconfinement, other than precatory segregation.\"\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh believes such treatment evidences the Act's penal purpose or nature.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe DMH and SCDC have entered into an inter-agency agreement which provides the Edisto\r\nUnit of the Broad River Correctional Institution will be used to house sexually violent\r\npredators.  Under the agreement, DMH retains all control, care and treatment aspects inside\r\nthe Edisto Unit, including internal guards, routine maintenance and sanitation.  DMH arranges\r\nfor medical care of committed persons.  SCDC provides outside security, meals, laundry\r\nservices and chaplain services.  In sum, while the SCDC provides a secured environment to\r\nhouse the sexually violent predators, the DMH provides the care and treatment.\r\n\r\nWe addressed this issue in In re Matthews, supra. \r\n  Matthews argued the Act unconstitutionally subjected him to conditions placed \r\n  on state prisoners, hindering his receipt of treatment. We rejected his contention, \r\n  ruling:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions of confinement are not prescribed by the Act, but result from administrative\r\ndecisions.  Therefore, the conditions of confinement cannot be used to determine legislative\r\nintent.... Furthermore, the Act expressly provides, \"The involuntary detention or commitment\r\nof a person pursuant to this chapter shall conform to constitutional requirements for care and\r\ntreatment.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-170.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 650-51, 550 S.E.2d at 317.\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court dealt with a similar argument \r\n  in Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 106 S.Ct. 2988, 92 L.Ed.2d 296 (1986). \r\n  In Allen, individuals committed under an Illinois law for sexually dangerous \r\n  persons were placed in a psychiatric center housed within a maximum-security \r\n  prison. The Department of Corrections operated the prison. See id. \r\n  at 372, 106 S.Ct. at 2993, 92 L.Ed.2d at 306. Additionally, the psychiatric \r\n  center provided mental health treatment to inmates who were not committed under \r\n  the sexually dangerous persons law. See id. However, the Supreme \r\n  Court held the law did not violate the United States Constitution because those \r\n  facts did \"not transform the State's intent to treat into an intent to punish.\" \r\n  Id. at 373, 106 S.Ct. at 2994, 92 L.Ed.2d at 307. We agree with the Court's \r\n  rationale.\r\n\r\nAllowing two state entities to make administrative decisions, \r\n  providing protection to the public at-large from sexually violent predators \r\n  who remain under the treatment and control of the DMH, is not sufficient evidence \r\n  to overcome Luckabaugh's heavy burden of proof. Luckabaugh, like Matthews before \r\n  him, has failed to prove the living conditions provided for by the inter-agency \r\n  agreement is so punitive in effect as to negate the Legislature's intent to \r\n  create a civil statute. See In re Matthews, supra, (citing \r\n  Seling v. Young, supra).\r\n\r\nB. Treated Differently Than Other Involuntarily Committed Persons\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh contends the Act is punitive because it treats persons involuntarily committed\r\nunder the Act differently from other involuntarily committed mental patients.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature created a variety of rights for mental patients \r\n  undergoing treatment in the Department of Mental Health. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§Â§ 44-22-10, et  seq. (1976). However, the Legislature specifically \r\n  exempted sexually violent predators from those rights. See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-22-10(11) (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of first impressions in South Carolina, \r\n  but not unique in terms of litigation over sexually violent predator acts across \r\n  the nation. An individual committed under Iowa's sexually violent predator act \r\n  asserted a similar argument in attacking the constitutionality of the statute \r\n  on ex post facto grounds. See In re the Detention of Garren, \r\n  620 N.W.2d 275, 281 (Iowa 2000).\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Supreme Court held Garren \"failed to elucidate \r\n  any supportive reasoning as to why, if such privileges are not accorded under \r\n  [Iowa's Sexually Violent Predator Act], this fact indicates the punitive nature \r\n  of the statute.\"  Id. The court noted: \"The Constitution does not require \r\n  [a state] to write all of its civil commitment rules in a single statute or \r\n  forbid it to write two separate statutes each covering somewhat different classes \r\n  of committable individuals.\" Id. (quoting Hendricks, 521 U.S. \r\n  at 377, 117 S.Ct. at 2089, 138 L.Ed.2d at 524 (Breyer, J., dissenting)).\r\n\r\nA statute creating two types of civil commitment is not \r\n  per se punitive in violation of the ex post facto clause. \r\n  Luckabaugh fails to provide any evidence that the creation of two types of civil \r\n  commitment is so punitive in effect as to negate the Legislature's intent to \r\n  create a civil statute. See In re Matthews, supra, (citing \r\n  Seling v. Young, supra).\r\n\r\nC. Previous Conviction Requirement\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh's third attempt at presenting evidence of the \r\n  Act's penal nature is its requirement of a \"criminal conviction\" which differentiates \r\n  the Act from the Hendricks Act. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe addressed the prior conviction requirement in In the \r\n  Care and Treatment of Matthews, supra. In our treatment of the issue \r\n  we noted the use of the word \"conviction\" was misleading. To the extent our \r\n  Act differs from the Hendricks statute it is \"a distinction without a \r\n  difference\" since the use of the word \"conviction\" included \"persons charged \r\n  but found incompetent to stand trial, those found not guilty by reason of insanity, \r\n  and those found guilty but mentally ill.\"  Id. at 649-50, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  at 316; see S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-30(6)(c)-(e) (Supp. 2000). \r\n\r\n\r\nOur conclusion is bolstered by the United States Supreme \r\n  Court decision in Hendricks which noted the act \"permits involuntary \r\n  confinement based upon a determination that the person currently \r\n  both suffers from a 'mental abnormality' . . . and is likely to pose a future \r\n  danger to the public . . . [t]o the extent that past behavior is taken into \r\n  account, it is used . . . solely for evidentiary purposes.\" Hendricks, \r\n  521 U.S. at 370-71, 117 S.Ct. At 2086, 138 L.Ed.2 at 520-21 (emphasis in original). \r\n  The conviction requirement is used only for evidentiary purposes to show the \r\n  existence of a past mental abnormality and dangerousness that is likely to recur \r\n  if left untreated. \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh fails to show the prior conviction requirement violates the ex post facto\r\nprohibition where it serves as evidence of past dangerous conduct or the presence of a mental\r\nabnormality.  Accordingly, Luckabaugh's argument is without merit.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAdditional Grounds\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh raises additional constitutional grounds to support the judgment below.  He\r\nraised each argument below and both parties have fully briefed each issue.  In light of the time\r\nconcerns involved and the consequences of a commitment hearing under the Act, we address\r\neach issue in the interest of judicial economy.\r\n\r\nA. Substantive Due Process\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh claims the Act unconstitutionally violates his \r\n  substantive due process rights under the United States and South Carolina Constitutions. \r\n  (6) \"The substantive due process guarantee ensures that legislation \r\n  which deprives a person of a life, liberty, or property right have, at a minimum, \r\n  a rational basis, and not be arbitrary or overly vague.\" 19 S.C. Juris. Constitutional \r\n  Law Â§ 71 (1993). The guarantee allows a court to examine the constitutionality \r\n  of the underlying statute as opposed to merely the process by which it is applied \r\n  to each individual. See id. The purpose of the substantive due \r\n  process clause is to prohibit government from engaging in arbitrary or wrongful \r\n  acts \"regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\" \r\n  Zinerman v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 983, 108 L.Ed.2d \r\n  100, 113 (1990) (quoting Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 \r\n  S.Ct. 662, 665, 88 L.Ed.2d 662, 668 (1986)).\r\n\r\nWhen an act is challenged under the due process clause, \r\n  this \"Court only requires the act to be reasonably designed to accomplish its \r\n  purposes, unless some fundamental right or suspect class is implicated.\" State \r\n  v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 125-26, 484 S.E.2d 869, 872 (1997). Legislation \r\n  restricting or impairing a fundamental right \"is subject to 'strict scrutiny' \r\n  in determining its constitutionality.\" Hamilton v. Board of Trustees, \r\n  282 S.C. 519, 523, 319 S.E.2d 717, 720 (Ct. App. 1984). Legislation that does \r\n  not infringe on fundamental rights is subject only to a rational basis test. \r\n  19 S.C. Juris. Constitutional Law Â§ 74 (1993). Under either type of \r\n  analysis, the one who attacks the law bears the burden of showing it is unconstitutional. \r\n  See State v. Hornsby, supra. \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh urges us to apply the strict scrutiny test in our analysis.  In deciding which test to\r\nutilize it is necessary that we first ask whether the Act impairs a fundamental right.\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh asserts the Act impairs his fundamental right \r\n  to liberty, free from bodily restraint by the government. A person's interest \r\n  in freedom from bodily restraint is \"at the core of the liberty protected by \r\n  the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental actions.\" Foucha v. Louisiana, \r\n  504 U.S. 71, 80, 112 S.Ct. 1780, 1785, 118 L.Ed.2d 437, 448 (1992). \r\n\r\nBecause the statute impacts a fundamental right, we apply \r\n  strict scrutiny analysis. (7) To survive strict \r\n  scrutiny the Act must meet a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored \r\n  to effectuate that interest. See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \r\n  U.S. 702, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997). Luckabaugh concedes the Act \r\n  serves a compelling state interest. The only question is whether the Legislature \r\n  has narrowly tailored the Act to serve that interest while not unduly burdening \r\n  Luckabaugh's rights.\r\n\r\nCourts recognize that liberty interest from bodily restraint \r\n  is not absolute. See Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 356, 117 S.Ct. at \r\n  2079, 138 L.Ed.2d at 512; see also Garren, 620 N.W.2d at \r\n  284-85 (discussing constitutionality of Iowa sexually violent predator law on \r\n  substantive due process grounds). The United States Supreme Court has recognized:\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its\r\njurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all\r\ncircumstances, wholly free from restraint.  There are manifold restraints to which every person\r\nis necessarily subject for the common good.  On any other basis organized society could not\r\nexist with safety to its members.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 26, 25 S.Ct. \r\n  358, 361, 49 L.Ed. 643, 649-50 (1905).\r\n\r\nThe balance between liberty and security is particularly \r\n  difficult when detaining a subclass of individuals who are likely to cause future \r\n  harm to the public. While sexually violent predator laws are relatively new, \r\n  (8) their purpose is similar to other involuntary commitment statutes \r\n  which the United States Supreme Court has consistently upheld as long as they \r\n  are applied to individuals with mental health problems making them unable to \r\n  control behavior which poses a danger to public safety. See Foucha, \r\n  supra; Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 426-27, 99 S.Ct. 1804, \r\n  1809-10, 60 L.Ed.2d 323, 331 (1979). Therefore, it cannot be said \"the involuntary \r\n  civil confinement of a limited subclass of dangerous persons is contrary to \r\n  our understanding of ordered liberty.\" Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 357, 117 \r\n  S.Ct. at 2080, 138 L.Ed.2d at 512.\r\n\r\nThe Act is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state \r\n  interest if aimed at involuntarily committing individuals for mental health \r\n  care after a finding of dangerousness coupled with \"some additional factor, \r\n  such as a 'mental illness' or 'mental abnormality.'\"  Id. at 358, 117 \r\n  S.Ct. at 2080, 138 L.Ed.2d at 512-13. \r\n\r\nUnder that standard, the United States Supreme Court upheld \r\n  the constitutionality of the Kansas sexual predator act from a substantive due \r\n  process challenge. See id. We have previously held the Kansas \r\n  statute is virtually indistinguishable from South Carolina's Act. See \r\n  In the Care and Treatment of Matthews, supra. In particular, the \r\n  Act, like the Kansas statute, requires a finding of dangerousness evidenced \r\n  by \"past sexually violent behavior and a present mental condition that creates \r\n  a likelihood of such conduct in the future if the person is not incapacitated.\" \r\n  Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 357, 117 S.Ct. at 2080, 138 L.Ed.2d at 512. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a)-(b) (Supp. 2000). \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh asserts the Act is unconstitutional based on \r\n  the holding of the United States Supreme Court in Kansas v. Crane, __ \r\n  U.S. __, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.Ed.2d 856 (2002). Crane held substantive due process \r\n  requires a court to make a lack of control determination before involuntarily \r\n  committing someone under these types of statutes.\r\n\r\nThe Crane Court failed to provide an exact threshold \r\n  between where control ends and where a lack of control begins. The term carries \r\n  with it no \"particularly narrow or technical meaning.\" Id. at __, 122 \r\n  S.Ct. at 870, 151 L.Ed.2d at 862. Instead of a bright-line test, the Court held \r\n  \"it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling \r\n  behavior.\" Id. at __, 122 S.Ct. at 870, 151 L.Ed.2d at 862. \r\n\r\nCrane does not mandate a court must separately and \r\n  specially make a lack of control determination, only that a court must determine \r\n  the individual lacks control while looking at the totality of the evidence. \r\n  See id. at __, 122 S.Ct. at 870, 151 L.Ed.2d at 862 (\"We do not \r\n  agree with the State, however, insofar as it seeks to claim that the Constitution \r\n  permits commitment...without any lack-of-control determination.\"). To read Crane \r\n  as requiring a special finding would be to suggest the United States Supreme \r\n  Court mandated at least sixteen states to hold new commitment hearings for over \r\n  1,200 individuals committed under their state's sexually violent predator acts. \r\n  See Amicus Curiae Brief in Kansas v. Crane, supra, \r\n  2001 WL 694594, at *9 (filed by Illinois, et al., on behalf of Kansas). \r\n  (9) We believe the Court's ruling would have been more explicit if \r\n  it intended such consequences. Instead, we believe Crane holds the substantive \r\n  due process clause requires a court to determine an individual suffers from \r\n  a mental illness which makes it seriously difficult, though not impossible, \r\n  for that person to control his dangerous propensities. \r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Act requires commitment of sexually violent predators.  A sexually\r\nviolent predator is defined as a person who:\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and\r\n(b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual    violence if not confined in a secure\r\nfacility for long-term    control, care, and treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a)-(b) (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nThe Act defines \"[l]ikely to engage in acts of sexual violence\" to mean \"the person's\r\npropensity to commit acts of sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a menace to the\r\nhealth and safety of others.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9) (Supp. 2000).  Inherent within the\r\nmental abnormality prong of the Act is a lack of control determination, i.e. the individual can\r\nonly be committed if he suffers from a mental illness which he cannot sufficiently control\r\nwithout the structure and care provided by a mental health facility, rendering him likely to\r\ncommit a dangerous act.  \r\n\r\nThe Act's requirements are the functional equivalent of \r\n  the requirement in Crane. The purpose of each is to ensure involuntary \r\n  commitment procedures are only used to control a \"limited subclass of dangerous \r\n  persons\" and not to broadly subject any dangerous person to what may be indefinite \r\n  terms. The former is best served by a civil commitment scheme which may treat \r\n  and monitor an individual's progress, while the later is more amenable to the \r\n  \"mechanism[s] for retribution or general deterrence\" of criminal law. Crane, \r\n  __ U.S. at __, 122 S.Ct. at 870, 151 L.Ed.2d at 862. It is enough to say that \r\n  the evidence presented at the hearing must show the individual has \"serious \r\n  difficulty in controlling behavior.\"  Id., __ U.S. at __, 121 S.Ct. at \r\n  870, 151 L.Ed.2d at 862.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we hold the Act complies with the United \r\n  States Supreme Court's Crane decision. \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh also argues the Act violates his substantive due process rights because it allows\r\nforcible detention by the State beyond his underlying sentence pending a commitment hearing. \r\nWe disagree.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, an individual will typically be detained awaiting \r\n  a commitment hearing sixty days beyond his release date. \r\n  (10) We note, however, the State may only detain an individual for \r\n  this length of time after a probable cause hearing. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-48-80 (B) (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh fails to cite any authority holding the detention \r\n  of an individual awaiting a civil commitment hearing is unconstitutional. But \r\n  cf. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 \r\n  (1975) (a state may detain an individual prior to trial after a judicial determination \r\n  of probable cause). Instead, Luckabaugh's position rests only on the belief \r\n  that holding a commitment hearing earlier in his sentence is preferable to the \r\n  scheme created by the Legislature. We are unpersuaded by his argument.\r\n\r\nIf Luckabaugh were to prevail, subsequent individuals may \r\n  claim the opposite: holding a commitment hearing early in their sentence deprives \r\n  them of the ability to voluntarily receive treatment and rehabilitation which \r\n  would negate their being labeled as a sexually violent predator. Aside from \r\n  any social stigma created by the label, a sexually violent predator faces the \r\n  life-long requirement of registering as a sex offender even after being released. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-170 (Supp. 2000); State v. Walls, 348 \r\n  S.C. 26, 558 S.E.2d 524 (2002)(upholding the state law requirement for convicted \r\n  sex offenders to register with local officials).\r\n\r\nMoving the determination to the beginning of an individual's prison sentence would\r\nundoubtedly result in more individuals being adjudicated as sexually violent predators.  Since\r\nthe prison system currently offers mental health treatment programs, it would be unwise as a\r\nmatter of judicial policy to deprive an individual of the opportunity to seek such counseling, to\r\nprogress in his treatment and to demonstrate that he is not in need of custodial treatment\r\nprograms as a sexually violent predator at the conclusion of his sentence.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we remind Luckabaugh that where the State \r\n  fails to comply with the Act and detains individuals beyond their sentence, \r\n  the proper procedure is to file a motion to dismiss, not to seek an invalidation \r\n  of the entire Act. See Matthews, supra. This is particularly \r\n  so when the Act itself provides for constitutional safeguards such as probable \r\n  cause hearings to ensure individuals are not arbitrarily held beyond their release \r\n  dates.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the Act complies with the requirements of the substantive due process\r\nclauses of both the United States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n\r\nB. Procedural Due Process\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh asserts the Act violates his procedural due process \r\n  rights which inhere in the due process clause of the United States and South \r\n  Carolina Constitutions. See United States Const. amend XIV; S.C. Const. \r\n  art. I, Â§ 3. Luckabaugh's argument concerns only the process by which an individual \r\n  committed under the Act gains his release. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-110 \r\n  (Supp. 2000). Because this issue is not justiciable, for the reasons set out \r\n  below, we decline to address the merits of his arguments.\r\n\r\nWe are obligated to inquire in every action whether a justiciable \r\n  controversy exists in a matter. See Byrd v. Irmo High School, \r\n  321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996). \"A justiciable controversy is a real and \r\n  substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, \r\n  as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.\" Pee \r\n  Dee Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, \r\n  301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983). \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh asks us to declare the Act unconstitutional because \r\n  of the procedure it establishes for individuals to gain release after being \r\n  committed as sexually violent predators. We decline to address the issue because \r\n  Luckabaugh has never been adjudicated as a sexually violent predator. While \r\n  the possibility exists that a court may do so on remand, we decline to address \r\n  constitutional issues unless required to do so. See In re McCracken, \r\n  supra.\r\n\r\nC. Equal Protection Clause\r\n\r\nLuckabaugh argues the Act violates his equal protection rights (11) because individuals\r\ncommitted under the Act are treated differently than other DMH patients.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe concept of equal protection is \"difficult to define \r\n  and not susceptible of exact delimitation.\" Thompson v. South Carolina Comm'n \r\n  on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463, 472, 229 S.E.2d 718, 722 (1976). \r\n  We have previously written:\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the laws requires that all persons shall be\r\ntreated alike under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in\r\nthe liabilities imposed....The equal protection guaranty is intended to secure equality of\r\nprotection not only for all, but against all similarly situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nIt has long been recognized that the Legislature is not \r\n  barred by the Constitution from classifying persons. See McCandless \r\n  v. Richmond &amp; D.R. Co., 38 S.C. 103, 16 S.E. 429 (1892); see generally, \r\n  19 S.C. Juris. Constitutional Law Â§Â§ 83-98 (for analysis of equal protection \r\n  clause in South Carolina jurisprudence); 3 Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John E. Nowak, \r\n  Treatise on Constitutional Law Â§ 18.3, at 213-26 (3d ed. 1999). If \r\n  the legislation serves a public purpose and treats all similarly situated persons \r\n  alike it does not violate the equal protection clause. See Marley \r\n  v. Kirby, 271 S.C. 122, 245 S.E.2d 604 (1978); Ex parte Hollman, \r\n  79 S.C. 9, 60 S.E. 19 (1908). The equal protection clause only forbids \"irrational \r\n  and unjustified classifications.\" South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Citizens \r\n  &amp; Southern Nat'l Bank, 300 S.C. 142, 164, 386 S.E.2d 775, 786 (1989).\r\n\r\nThe first step in our equal protection analysis of the Act \r\n  is to determine what level of scrutiny to apply. We employ strict scrutiny analysis \r\n  if a law employs a suspect classification. See Curtis v. State, \r\n  345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001); Bibco Corp. v. City of Sumter, 332 \r\n  S.C. 45, 52, 504 S.E.2d 112, 116 (1998); see also 19 S.C. Juris. \r\n  Constitutional Law Â§ 85 (1993). Otherwise we apply the rational basis \r\n  test. See Curtis, supra; Bibco Corp., supra.\r\n\r\nCourts traditionally apply strict scrutiny analysis for \r\n  suspect classifications based on race, alienage, national origin, sex or illegitimacy. \r\n  See, e.g., City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469, 109 \r\n  S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (classification based solely on race is subject \r\n  to strict scrutiny); Gomez v. Perez, 409 U.S. 535, 93 S.Ct. 872, 35 L.Ed.2d \r\n  56 (1978) (applying strict scrutiny to a state statute concerning rights of \r\n  illegitimate children); Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. \r\n  1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (applying strict scrutiny analysis to state restrictions \r\n  on resident aliens receiving welfare assistance); Korematsu v. United States, \r\n  323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed.2d 194 (1944) (subjecting classifications \r\n  based upon race and nationality to the \"most rigid scrutiny.\"). \r\n\r\nLuckabaugh's argument rests on the assertion that the Legislature \r\n  cannot classify by type of mental illness or abnormality. Mental illness is \r\n  not a suspect classification. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \r\n  Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 445-46, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 3257, 87 L.Ed.2d 313, 324 (1985). \r\n  Neither the United States Supreme Court nor state courts apply strict scrutiny \r\n  to challenges similar to Luckabaugh's. See, e.g., Heller v. \r\n  Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321-28, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 2643-47, 125 L.Ed.2d 257, 271-76 \r\n  (1993) (applying rational basis test to law creating different procedures to \r\n  involuntarily commit those mentally ill and those mentally retarded); Baxstrom \r\n  v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 86 S.Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966) (applying rational \r\n  basis test to law providing different treatment between \"dangerous\" and \"non-dangerous\" \r\n  mentally ill); Illinois v. Pembrock, 342 N.E.2d 28, 30 (Ill. 1976) (applying \r\n  rational basis test to a law creating different procedures to commit violent \r\n  predators and other mentally ill individuals); State v. Clemons, 515 \r\n  P.2d 324, 327 (Ariz. 1973) (applying rational basis test to statute creating \r\n  different commitment procedures for those \"guilty but insane\" and general civil \r\n  commitment).\r\n\r\nState courts generally apply the rationale basis test to \r\n  sexually violent predator acts. See, e.g., In re Detention \r\n  of Williams, 628 N.W.2d 447 (Iowa 2001); In re Detention of Samuelson, \r\n  727 N.E.2d 228 (Ill. 2000); In re Detention of Turay, 986 P.2d 790, 806 \r\n  (Wash. 1999); Martin v. Reinstein, 987 P.2d 779, 796 (Ariz. Ct. App. \r\n  1999); but see, In re Hay, 953 P.2d 666, 675 (Kan. 1998) (applying strict scrutiny); \r\n  In re Linehan, 557 N.W.2d 171, 186 (Minn. 1996) (applying \"heightened\" \r\n  scrutiny). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we review the Act under the rational basis test for purposes of the equal\r\nprotection clause.  A classification does not violate the equal protection clause if:  (1) the\r\nclassification bears a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose sought to be effected;  (2)\r\nthe members of the class are treated alike under similar circumstances and conditions;  and (3) \r\n\r\nthe classification rests on some reasonable basis. See \r\n  Curtis v. State, supra, (citing Whaley v. Dorchester County \r\n  Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 337 S.C. 568, 524 S.E.2d 404 (1999)). \"The determination \r\n  of whether a classification is reasonable is initially one for the legislative \r\n  body and will be sustained if it is not plainly arbitrary and there is a reasonable \r\n  hypothesis to support it.\" Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. at 574, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  at 600. \r\n\r\nThe Iowa Supreme Court in In re Detention of Williams, \r\n  supra, reviewed an equal protection challenge to Iowa's sexually violent \r\n  predator act based on differential treatment afforded to sexually ill offenders \r\n  committees versus other mentally ill civil committees. The Court noted rational \r\n  reasons existed to differentiate between the two classes of mentally ill committees. \r\n  Chief among those reasons was the inherent differences between an individual \r\n  committed under the traditional civil commitment statute and one committed as \r\n  a sexually violent predator.\r\n\r\nThe Court found sexually violent predators \"have antisocial \r\n  personality features that are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment \r\n  modalities . . . that render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior.\" \r\n  Id. 628 N.W.2d at 453 (quoting Iowa Code Â§ 229A.1). Contrasted with sexually \r\n  violent predators, other involuntarily committed individuals simply \"'lack[ \r\n  ] sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions' and are likely to physically \r\n  injure themselves or others without treatment . . . . [b]ut their mental illness \r\n  does not predispose them to commit sexually violent acts.\" Id. The Court, \r\n  in upholding the law, found these \"specialized treatment needs of [sexually \r\n  violent predators], when compared to others who suffer from different mental \r\n  abnormalities, justify the different classification and treatment chosen by \r\n  the legislature.\" Id. 628 N.W.2d at 454. Sexually violent predators have \r\n  distinct qualities which separate them as a different class apart from other \r\n  mentally ill individuals. \r\n\r\nOur Legislature, in passing the South Carolina Act, found \"that a mentally abnormal and\r\nextremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exists . . . [and the] likelihood these\r\nsexually violent predators will engage in repeat acts of sexual violence if not treated for their\r\nmental conditions is significant.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp. 2000).  In wording\r\nsimilar to the Iowa statute, the Legislature further found:\r\n\r\n\r\nthe existing civil commitment process is inadequate to address the special needs of sexually\r\nviolent predators and the risks that they present to society, the General Assembly determines\r\nthat a separate, involuntary civil commitment process for the long-term control, care, and\r\ntreatment of sexually violent predators is necessary.  The General Assembly also determines\r\nthat, because of the nature of the mental conditions from which sexually violent predators\r\nsuffer and the dangers they present, it is necessary to house involuntarily committed sexually\r\nviolent predators in secure facilities separated from persons involuntarily committed under\r\ntraditional civil commitment statutes. \r\n\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nTo require the Legislature to treat the two groups similarly \r\n  would require overruling a rational determination that sexually violent predators \r\n  have certain characteristics which make their treatment needs different from \r\n  other involuntarily committed individuals. The potential danger to the community \r\n  provides a rational reason why sexually violent predators should be treated \r\n  differently than other committed patients. The classification is not plainly \r\n  arbitrary, but, instead, is reasonable in light of the differences between the \r\n  two groups. See Curtis v. State, supra. Further, the classification \r\n  bears a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose of confining sexually \r\n  violent predators separately from other involuntarily committed individuals \r\n  for treatment. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the Act does not violate Luckabaugh's right to equal protection.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we VACATE the portion of the lower court's order finding the State did not\r\nmeet its burden of proving Luckabaugh was a sexually violent predator.  Further, we\r\nREVERSE the lower court's finding the Act violated the ex post facto clause of the South\r\nCarolina Constitution. We REMAND this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent.  As the majority notes, this is an action at\r\nlaw tried by a judge alone, and we must affirm his decision if it supported by any evidence. \r\nThe majority also acknowledges the evidence was conflicting on two issues: (1) whether\r\nRespondent suffers from a dangerous mental condition; and (2) whether, assuming that he\r\ndoes, custodial treatment is required.  In order to keep Respondent in custody, the State bore\r\nthe burden of proving both issues beyond a reasonable doubt.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§44-48-100\r\n(2002).  While I may not have reached the same conclusions as the trial judge there is\r\nevidence to support his findings, and we are therefore required to affirm.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this result, the majority concludes that the trial court's order is so deficient\r\nunder Rule 52(a), SCRCP, that the judgment must be set aside and the matter remanded.  I\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nTo support the conclusion that the order is insufficient \r\n  under Rule 52(a), the majority relies on cases involving orders issued by administrative \r\n  agencies, the family court, and a magistrate's court. Each of these bodies has \r\n  a specific rule or statute which mandates the contents of its orders: See Rule \r\n  26, SCRFC, (family court orders); S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-25-105 (Supp. 2001) (magistrate's \r\n  returns); S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-350 (1985) (administrative orders). These decisions, \r\n  like those from other jurisdictions, are irrelevant to the Rule 52(a) issue \r\n  in this case.\r\n\r\nRule 52(a) incorporates the standards found in former code \r\n  sections 15-35-110, 15-35-130, and 15-35-140. See note following Rule 52, SCRCP. \r\n  It is well-settled under those statutes and under the current rule that if an \r\n  order fails to comply with these standards, that deficiency must first be raised \r\n  by a Rule 59 motion in the trial court in order to be preserved for appeal. \r\n  E.g., Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 423 S.E.2d 127 (1992) (Rule 52); State \r\n  v. City of Columbia, 12 S.C. 370 (1879) (former statutes). Here, the State raised \r\n  no objection to the sufficiency of the order below, and accordingly the issue \r\n  is not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\nEven if the sufficiency of the order were properly before us, there is no\r\ndoubt but that the trial judge adequately expressed his \r\n  view that the State failed to meet its burden of proof \r\n  (12) and his conclusion that Respondent must be set free. \r\n  (13) See, e.g., May v. Cavender, 29 S.C. 598, 7 S.E. 489 (1888) (where \r\n  the evidence was conflicting, this Court upheld as sufficient an order stating \r\n  simply, \"After a careful consideration of the testimony in the case, I am satisfied \r\n  that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief demanded\"); see also \r\n  Pawley's Island Civic Ass'n v. Johnson, 292 S.C. 208, 355 S.E.2d 541 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1986) (order sufficient finding only that plaintiff \"failed to provide \r\n  any evidence which substantiates any of the allegations contained in [its] petition\" \r\n  and \"failed to produce any evidence showing that [the defendants] abused their \r\n  discretion . . . .\").\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, that the order could have been drawn with more detail, the requirements\r\nof Rule 52(a) are\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectory and . . . noncompliance would not form the basis for invalidating a judgment.\r\n[citation omitted] Rather, where a trial court substantially complies with Rule 52(a) and\r\nadequately states the basis for the result it reaches, the appellate court should not vacate the\r\ntrial court's judgment for lack of an explicit or specific factual finding.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991). \r\n  Where the trial judge in a law case hears conflicting evidence, and explicitly \r\n  finds the moving party has not met its burden of proof, it is my opinion that \r\n  his order 'substantially complies' with Rule 52(a). May v. Cavender, \r\n  supra; Pawley's Island Civic Ass'n v. Johnson, supra. The \r\n  majority does not explain, nor can I conceive, what more a judge must say when \r\n  he finds the evidence lacking.\r\n\r\nSince I would affirm the trial court's order releasing Respondent, I would not reach the\r\nconstitutional issues. \r\n1.  See generally, S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to 44-48-170 (Supp. 2000) (Sexually Violent Predator Act, \r\n  hereinafter the \"Act\"). \r\n2.  Luckabaugh was incarcerated at 14 years old for attempting to rape a neighbor at gunpoint. \r\nWhile on furlough from a juvenile facility, Luckabaugh stole female undergarments. \r\nLuckabaugh was incarcerated again after stealing female undergarments for a second time.  At\r\nage 19, Luckabaugh was committed to a state mental hospital for \"an impulse to cut someone\r\nand torture them.\" \r\n3.   Dr. Schwartz-Watts noted the writings grew progressively more graphic and detailed\r\nincluding drawings \"of a slaughterhouse where each of the various races would be\r\nhoused...[b]reeding pens, shower areas, target ranges, whorehouse, gas chambers, chopping\r\nblocks, racks; and... a detailed kind of sketch of how such a facility or compound would be\r\nlaid out.\"\r\n4.   A penile plethysmography tests arousal by measuring blood flow to the penis when the\r\nsubject is exposed to visual images. \r\n5.  Generally, we would be inclined to \r\n  vacate the order and remand it to the presiding judge below to issue an order \r\n  that complies with Rule 52(a), SCRCP. Cf. 5A J. MOORE AND J. LUCAS, MOORE'S \r\n  FEDERAL PRACTICE Â¶ 52.06[2] (1989) (\"Where the trial court fails ... to find \r\n  on a material issue and an appeal is taken, the appellate court will normally \r\n  vacate the judgment and remand the action for appropriate findings to be made.\"). \r\n  However, because Judge Martin has retired, we remand the case to the Chief Judge \r\n  for the Ninth Judicial Circuit to assign a new judge to the case. \r\n6.   The due process clause provides no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property\r\nwithout due process of law.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.\r\n7.  We are mindful when reviewing a challenge \r\n  to a state statute under the South Carolina Constitution we apply the rational \r\n  basis test. See R.L. Jordan Company, Inc. v. Boardman Petroleum, Inc., \r\n  338 S.C. 475, 527 S.E.2d 763 (2000). However, we do not separately address the \r\n  constitutionality of the Act under that standard because we find it is constitutional \r\n  under the more stringent strict scrutiny analysis required by the United States \r\n  Constitution. \r\n8.  Currently, sixteen states have involuntary \r\n  commitment statutes for violent sexual offenders: Arizona (Ariz. Rev. Stat. \r\n  Â§ 36-3701); California (Cal. Wel. &amp; Inst. Code Â§ 6600); Florida (Fla. Stat. \r\n  Â§ 394.910); Illinois (75 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1); Iowa (Iowa Code Â§ 229A.1); \r\n  Kansas (Kan. Stat. Ann. Â§ 5929a01); Massachusetts (Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. \r\n  123A, Â§ 1); Minnesota (Minn. Stat. Â§ 253B.185); Missouri (Mo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 632.480); \r\n  New Jersey (N.J. Stat. Ann. Â§ 30:4-27.25); North Dakota (N.D. Cent. Code Â§ 25-03.3-01); \r\n  South Carolina (S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10, et seq.); Texas (Tex. Health &amp; \r\n  Safety Code Ann. Â§ 841.081); Virginia (Va. Code Ann. Â§ 37.1-70.6); Washington \r\n  (Wash. Rev. Code Â§ 71.09.010); and Wisconsin (Wis. Stat. Â§ 980.01). \r\n9.  As of the Crane decision, \r\n  thirteen states provided statistics regarding current commitments under their \r\n  sexually violent predator acts. They were Arizona (71 individuals); California \r\n  (270 individuals); Florida (33 individuals); Illinois (78 individuals); Iowa \r\n  (17 individuals); Kansas (65 individuals); Minnesota (182 individuals); Missouri \r\n  (15 individuals); New Jersey (136 individuals); North Dakota (9 individuals); \r\n  South Carolina (38 individuals); Washington (84 individuals); \r\n  and Wisconsin (213 individuals). See Amicus Curiae Brief in Kansas \r\n  v. Crane, supra, 2001 WL 694594, at *9, n. 5 (filed by Illinois, \r\n  et al., on behalf of Kansas). \r\n10.   The Act requires the agency with jurisdiction to give written notice to the multi-disciplinary team and the Attorney General at least ninety days before the individual's\r\nscheduled release.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-40 (A)(1) (Supp. 2000).  Within thirty days of\r\nreceiving that notice the multi-disciplinary team must determine whether a person meets the\r\ndefinition of a sexually violent predator and forward a copy of its report to a prosecutor's\r\nreview committee.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2000).  The prosecutor's review\r\ncommittee must determine whether probable cause exists within thirty days of receiving the\r\nmulti-disciplinary team's recommendation.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-60 (Supp. 2000).  \r\n\r\nThe review committee must file a petition requesting a probable cause hearing with the\r\nCircuit Court within thirty days of reaching its own decision that probable cause exists.  S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 44-48-70 (Supp. 2000).  The court must hold the probable cause hearing within\r\nseventy-two hours after the individual is taken into custody.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(B)\r\n(Supp. 2000).  A civil commitment hearing must be held within sixty days after a\r\ndetermination that probable cause exists.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2000).   \r\n11.  See U.S. Const. amend. XIV; \r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3. \r\n12.  \"Upon hearing the evidence, I find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat [Respondent] meets the definition of a 'sexually violent predator.'

Heckler, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Paul Newman Allen (\"Allen\") appeals the lower court's Order\r\nconfining him to the Department of Mental Health pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually\r\nViolent Predator Act (\"Act\"), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10, et seq.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn 1978, Allen was given a three-year probationary sentence for Assault and Battery of a High\r\nand Aggravated Nature.  In 1981, he was convicted for committing a Lewd Act Upon a Minor\r\nChild.  Allen received a five-year sentence, suspended on the service of five years of\r\nprobation.  In 1983, he was arrested for committing a Lewd Act on a Child and First Degree\r\nCriminal Sexual Conduct.  He was sentenced to two years confinement and three years\r\nprobation.  In 1984, Allen was charged with Aggravated Assault and Battery and sentenced to\r\nthree years confinement.  He was also convicted of committing a Lewd Act On a Minor, and\r\nhis confinement was consecutive to his other charges.  In 1987, Allen was convicted for\r\nAssault with Intent to Commit First Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct.  He was given a\r\ntwenty-year sentence.  In 1988, he pled Guilty but Mentally Ill to Assault with Intent to\r\nCommit Criminal Sexual Conduct and was given twenty years.  It is unclear from the record\r\nwhether the 1987 and 1988 convictions represented the same charge. (1)   Allen's most recent\r\nconviction involved his attempted fondling of an eight-year-old girl at a church less than three\r\nmonths after he had been released from prison for his last sexual offense.  In addition to the\r\ncriminal charges, Allen has admitted to bestiality and cross-dressing.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 1998, near the time Allen was scheduled to be released from prison, the\r\nState filed a Petition pursuant to the Act seeking to have him civilly committed as a Sexually\r\nViolent Predator (\"SVP\").  Allen appeared for initial hearings during the November and\r\nDecember 1998 terms of the Greenville County Court of Common Pleas.  A final hearing was\r\nheld in April 1999 before the Honorable John C. Hayes, III.  At the hearing, Dr. Schwartz-Watts, the State's expert who examined Allen, concluded that Allen's history indicated he\r\nsuffered from two sexual disorders, pedophilia and paraphilia, both of which are \"chronic\r\nmental illnesses\" which \"do not go away.\"  Dr. Schwartz- Watts concluded \"these disorders\r\nmake [Allen] likely to engage in further acts of sexual violence if not treated in a secure\r\nfacility.\"\r\n\r\nIn an Order dated April 23, 1999, Judge Hayes found Allen was a sexually violent predator\r\nand ordered him committed to the custody of the S.C. Department of Mental Health.  Allen\r\nappeals Judge Hayes' Order and the issue before this Court is:\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes South Carolina's Sexually Violent Predator Act violate the Constitutional prohibitions\r\non Ex Post Facto laws and Double Jeopardy?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAllen argues the Act is not civil is nature and therefore violates the Double Jeopardy (2) and Ex\r\nPost Facto Clauses of the United States Constitution. (3)  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAllen argues the lower court erred in relying on Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S. Ct.\r\n2072, 138 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1997) (4) to hold the Act did not violate the Constitution.  He argues\r\nKansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act is \"markedly different\" from this State's Act in two\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nThis Court has already specifically addressed this issue in In the Matter of the Care and\r\nTreatment of Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001) and In the Matter of the Care\r\nand Treatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001). In Matthews, we found the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court's (USSC) decision in Kansas v. Hendricks, to be controlling. \r\nWe held our state's Act was not meaningfully distinguishable from Kansas' Act, and,\r\ntherefore, the Act did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Matthews.  Furthermore, the\r\nconstitutional holding of Matthews was summarized in McCracken as follows: \"a side by side\r\ncomparison of our SVP Act and the Kansas Act does not reveal any substantial differences.\" \r\nMcCracken, 346 S.C. at 91, 551 S.E.2d at 238.  Therefore, we have already directly addressed\r\nthe issues raised by Allen and found them to be without merit.  However, we will address\r\nAllen's specific arguments regarding the distinctions between the two Acts.\r\n\r\nFirst, Allen argues that \"unlike the Kansas law, criminal conviction is an absolute prerequisite\r\nto our statute's operation.\"   This Court recently addressed this exact issue in Matthews.  In\r\nMatthews, this Court recognized this factor to be the only distinction between the two Acts. \r\nId. at 649-650, 550 S.E.2d at 316.  However, this Court found it to be \"a distinction without a\r\ndifference\" since the use of the word \"conviction\" included \"persons charged but found\r\nincompetent to stand trial, those found not guilty by reason of insanity, and those found guilty\r\nbut mentally ill.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Allen argues that \"those committed under our statute are not treated as mentally ill\r\npersons, but as criminals,\" since those committed under the Act can be housed in ordinary\r\njails and prisons.  This argument was addressed in McCracken.  The appellant in McCracken\r\nlikewise argued, \"the conditions of his confinement demonstrate that he is being improperly\r\npunished as a criminal.\"  McCracken, 346 S.C. at 91, 551 S.E.2d at 238.  This Court held that\r\n\"his remedy for any such unconstitutional confinement would be by writ of habeas corpus.\" \r\nId.  (citing Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S. Ct. 727, 148 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2001)).  This\r\nCourt held that if the statutory requirement for constitutional care and treatment is not met,\r\n\"relief lies with an action brought against [the custodian] and not with a facial challenge to the\r\nstatute which does not prescribe the terms of confinement.\" Id.  Additionally, this Court\r\nrecently addressed this issue in In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Clair Luckabaugh,\r\nOp. No. 25503 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 22, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 25 at ____). \r\nThere, we held that housing sexually dangerous persons within a maximum-security prison\r\ndid \" ' not transform the State's intent to treat into an intent to punish.' \" Id. at ___ (quoting\r\nAllen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 373, 106 S.Ct. 2988, 2994, 92 L. Ed. 2d 296, 307).\r\n\r\nAllen also contends the Act is punitive because it treats a person involuntarily committed\r\nunder the Act differently from other involuntarily committed mental patients.  This Court\r\nrecently found this issue to be without merit in Luckabaugh. (5)  Id.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the forgoing, we AFFIRM the decision of the trial court.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. The record does not contain a clear description of Allen's past charges.\r\n2. U.S. CONST. amend. V.\r\n3. U.S. CONST. Art. 1, Â§ 10, cl. 1.\r\n4. In Hendricks, the United States Supreme Court upheld Kansas' procedure for the civil\r\ncommitment of persons found to be sexual predators.  The Court found Kansas' scheme was\r\nnot punitive in nature and therefore not subject to attack under the Constitutional provisions\r\nintended to protect the criminally accused.\r\n5. This Court also notes Luckabaugh thoroughly discussed the implications of the USSC's\r\nrecent ruling in Kansas v. Crane, __ U.S. __, 122 S.Ct. 867, 138 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2002).  In\r\nLuckabaugh, we found South Carolina's Act complied with the holding of the USSC in\r\nKansas v. Crane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25505","title":"In the Matter of Terry A.

Condon, Senior Assistant Attorney General\r\nJames G. Bogle, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General Nathan\r\nKaminski, Jr., all of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nRichard Anthony Blackmon, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, a full panel of the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct recommended respondent be disbarred. \r\nWe agree and disbar respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Factual/Procedural Background  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 2001, respondent was disbarred for misconduct \r\n  in 24 client matters. In the Matter of Trexler, 343 S.C. 608, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  822 (2001). Following service of the formal charges alleging misconduct in those \r\n  matters, it was discovered that charges alleging misconduct in two additional \r\n  client matters had been omitted. Accordingly, formal charges alleging misconduct \r\n  in the two additional matters were served and filed. After respondent failed \r\n  to respond to the charges, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed an Affidavit \r\n  of Default. At a hearing on the charges, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  asked that the hearing officer find respondent in default and issue an order \r\n  imposing a sanction to run concurrent with respondent's disbarment and include \r\n  the same provisions regarding restitution and payment of the costs of the proceeding.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was some question as to whether service of \r\n  the formal charges was proper, counsel for respondent informed the hearing officer \r\n  that respondent did not want to contest the affidavit of default because he \r\n  was not interested in pursuing a long, drawn out dispute as to the charges.\r\n\r\nThe hearing officer found respondent in default and the \r\n  allegations contained in the seventh set of formal charges were deemed admitted. \r\n  He recommended respondent be disbarred, the sanction to run concurrent with \r\n  his earlier disbarment, and that restitution be made in both matters. He recommended \r\n  respondent not be required to pay the costs of the proceedings since the charges \r\n  should have been disposed of at the earlier hearing. The full panel voted to \r\n  adopt the report of the hearing officer. Neither respondent nor the Office of \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel filed exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Law/Analysis  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nRule 2(p), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, defines a lawyer, in pertinent \r\n  part, as \"anyone admitted to practice law in this state, including any formerly \r\n  admitted lawyer with respect to acts committed prior to resignation or disbarment.\" \r\n  Because the acts of misconduct alleged in the formal charges currently before \r\n  this Court were committed prior to disbarment, we find respondent can be disciplined \r\n  for the additional acts of misconduct despite the fact that he has already been \r\n  disbarred.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have reservations about whether the formal charges \r\n  at issue were properly served on respondent, see Rule 14(c), RLDE (service \r\n  of formal charges by mail must be made by registered or certified mail to the \r\n  lawyer's last known address), respondent stated at the hearing before \r\n  the hearing officer and at the hearing before this Court that he was not putting \r\n  up a defense to the entry of default. (1) In \r\n  addition, respondent did not file any exceptions to the hearing officer's finding \r\n  of default.\r\n\r\nWhen a respondent fails to answer and is in default, the \r\n  factual allegations contained in the formal charges are deemed admitted. Rule \r\n  24, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Because respondent has essentially conceded he was \r\n  in default, the allegations contained in the formal charges currently before \r\n  this Court are deemed admitted. We must simply determine the appropriate sanction. \r\n  In the Matter of Kitchel, 347 S.C. 291, 554 S.E.2d 868 (2001); In \r\n  the Matter of Thornton, 327 S.C. 193, 489 S.E.2d 198 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe following allegations were made in the formal charges \r\n  and deemed admitted by the hearing officer. In the first matter, respondent \r\n  was retained to represent a client. The client paid respondent $350 in legal \r\n  fees. When the client received a summons from magistrate's court advising her \r\n  that her case was scheduled to be heard on December 13, 1995, respondent falsely \r\n  advised her she did not need to be present. Respondent also told the client \r\n  that he did not need to be present at the hearing as her counsel. Despite respondent's \r\n  advice, the client appeared in court and prevailed in her action. Respondent \r\n  made no appearance on the client's behalf. He also failed to refund the fee \r\n  paid by the client.\r\n\r\nIn a second matter, respondent was retained to represent \r\n  a client in a divorce action. The client paid respondent $1,000 in legal fees. \r\n  However, respondent failed to adequately prepare for an emergency/temporary \r\n  hearing and, as a result, the client was required to make monthly payments on \r\n  an automobile or return the automobile. The client was also ordered to pay approximately \r\n  $540 to opposing counsel. The client gave respondent $540 to pay opposing counsel; \r\n  however, when respondent issued a check for the payment, it was returned for \r\n  insufficient funds. As a result, the client was held in contempt of court. Respondent \r\n  failed to respond to the client's inquiries and failed to refund any portion \r\n  of the $1,000 fee. He also failed to advise the client that he had been suspended \r\n  from the practice of law after he was placed on interim suspension. Respondent \r\n  failed to respond to inquiries from Disciplinary Counsel regarding both of these \r\n  matters.\r\n\r\nThe hearing officer found respondent violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a \r\n  lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer \r\n  shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation \r\n  and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); \r\n  Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about \r\n  the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); \r\n  Rule 1.5 (a lawyer's fee shall be reasonable); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall safeguard \r\n  funds of a client); Rule 8.1 (a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter \r\n  shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from \r\n  an admissions or disciplinary authority) and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\nWe find these allegations, when considered in the context \r\n  of the allegations that led to respondent's earlier disbarment, as they should \r\n  have been, warrant disbarment. In the Matter of Craig, 344 S.C. 646, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 823 (2001)(disbarment is the appropriate sanction for multiple acts \r\n  of misconduct, including misappropriation of client funds); See also \r\n  In the Matter of Driggers, 334 S.C. 40, 512 S.E.2d 112 (1999) (attorney \r\n  consented to disbarment for misappropriating funds, failure to appear in court \r\n  on clients' behalf, and other misconduct similar to that shown in this case).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we adopt the full panel's recommendation \r\n  for disbarment. This disbarment shall run concurrent with respondent's earlier \r\n  disbarment. Respondent shall make restitution to the clients addressed in this \r\n  opinion according to the terms of the restitution plan entered into between \r\n  the parties as a result of our earlier opinion disbarring respondent.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n1.

The second consolidates \r\n  two separate disciplinary matters: one count of practicing under suspension, \r\n  and one criminal conviction arising from Respondentâ€™s June 2000 plea to attempted \r\n  possession of powder cocaine.  We impose a six month suspension in the first \r\n  case and a concurrent eighteen month suspension in the second case, both retroactive \r\n  to Respondentâ€™s interim suspension on February 16, 2000. \r\n  [1]   The two cases are discussed separately below.\r\n  A.  Case # 1\r\nOn February 1, 1999, Respondentâ€™s membership in the \r\n  South Carolina Bar was terminated because he failed to pay his 1999 Bar dues.  \r\n  Thereafter, he continued to practice law in violation of Rule 410(d), SCACR, \r\n  which prohibits a person from engaging in the practice of law in South Carolina \r\n  if he is not in good standing with the Bar.  In addition to the twenty-five \r\n  allegations of practicing under suspension, the complaint in this matter also \r\n  alleges that Respondentâ€™s trust account had a negative balance on several occasions. \r\n  [2]   \r\nOn August 21, 2000, Respondent was personally served \r\n  with the Notice of Filing of Formal Charges and the formal charges.  Respondent \r\n  did not file an answer nor seek an extension to answer within the thirty day \r\n  period provided by Rule 23(a), Rule 413, SCACR.  On October 3, 2000, Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel filed an Affidavit of Default.  On October 13, 2000, Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  received an Answer with a cover letter dated September 25, 2000.  The envelope \r\n  containing these documents was postmarked October 11, 2000.  On or about October \r\n  11, Respondent filed a motion to be allowed to file a late answer. \r\n The subpanel found that by his failure to timely file \r\n  an answer, Respondent was in default and deemed to have admitted the formal \r\n  charges.  See Rule 24(a), Rule 413, SCACR.  The subpanel also found:\r\n\r\n(1) Respondent failed to pay his 1999 Bar dues and his \r\n  membership in the South Carolina Bar was terminated February 1, 1999;\r\n(2) After February 1, 1999, Respondent engaged in the \r\n  unauthorized practice of law and/or the practice of law without a proper license \r\n  by representing twenty-five individuals in various civil and criminal matters; \r\n  and\r\n(3) In six of the first eight months of 1999, Respondentâ€™s \r\n  trust account statement reflected a negative balance.\r\n\r\nThe subpanel concluded that Respondent violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR:\r\n\r\n(1) Rule 7(a)(1) by violating a Rule of Professional \r\n  Conduct;\r\n(2) Rule 7(a)(5) by engaging in conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or to bring the legal profession into disrepute \r\n  or demonstrate an unfitness to practice law; and\r\n(3) Rule 7(a)(6) by violating the oath of office taken \r\n  upon his admission to practice law.\r\n\r\nFurther, the subpanel found two violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 5.5(a), practicing law in violation of the rules \r\n  and regulations of the jurisdiction, and Rule 8.4, misconduct.  Finally, it \r\n  concluded Respondent had violated Rule 410(d), SCACR, which prohibits any person \r\n  from engaging in the practice of law in South Carolina who is not in good standing \r\n  with the South Carolina Bar.\r\nThe subpanel recommended Respondent be required to pay \r\n  the costs of the proceedings and be suspended for six months and one day. [3]   Respondent filed \r\n  exceptions to the subpanelâ€™s report.   The full panel adopted the subpanelâ€™s \r\n  report and recommendations.  Respondent has filed a brief with this Court.\r\nRespondent contends the subpanel erred in holding him \r\n  in default for failure to timely answer the formal charges.  He claims that \r\n  he should have been allowed to file a belated answer because he was not receiving \r\n  his mail in a timely manner.  Whether his mail was delayed is irrelevant here, \r\n  however, since Respondent was personally served with the Notice of Filing of \r\n  Formal Charges and the formal charges.\r\nThe standards for setting aside a default and allowing \r\n  a late answer is found in the SCRCP.  In re Moore, 342 S.C. 536 S.E.2d \r\n  367 (2000).  Respondent has shown no cause, much less good cause, for his failure \r\n  to timely respond to the formal charges.  See Rule 55(c), SCRCP.  Accordingly, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the subpanelâ€™s refusal to set aside the default.\r\nSince Respondent is deemed to have admitted the factual \r\n  allegations of the suspension charges and the trust account deficits, the sole \r\n  issue remaining is that of the appropriate sanction.  The authority to discipline \r\n  attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is given rests entirely with \r\n  this Court.  E.g., In re Purvis, 347 S.C. 605, 557 S.E.2d (2001).  \r\n  While Respondent cannot contest the formal chargeâ€™s allegations that the South \r\n  Carolina Bar sent him notice of his failure to pay his 1999 Bar dues, there \r\n  is neither an allegation nor any evidence of Respondentâ€™s actual receipt of \r\n  the Barâ€™s notice.  Although Respondent had constructive notice that he had not \r\n  paid his dues, we find that a lesser sanction than that recommended by the subpanel \r\n  is warranted here.  Similarly, while there were minor deficits in Respondentâ€™s \r\n  trust account, there is no contention that any client money was lost or compromised.  \r\n  We therefore impose a six month suspension, retroactive to February 1, 2000, \r\n  and require Respondent to pay the costs assessed by the subpanel in Case #1.\r\nB.  Case #2\r\nIn January 2000, Respondent was indicted for possession \r\n  of crack cocaine.  He pled guilty to attempted possession of powder cocaine \r\n  in June 2000, and this case involves, in part, the appropriate disciplinary \r\n  sanction for this plea.  The second disciplinary infraction involved in Case \r\n  #2 is a finding that Respondent practiced law while under suspension when he \r\n  assisted a woman in procuring a name change in November 2000.\r\nThe subpanel concluded that Respondent had performed \r\n  legal services while under suspension and that attempted possession of cocaine \r\n  was a serious crime.  It found Respondent violated the following RLDE found \r\n  in Rule 413, SCACR:\r\n\r\n(1) 7(a)(1) by violating a Rule of Professional Conduct;\r\n(2) 7(a)(3) by violating a valid order of the Supreme \r\n  Court;\r\n(3) 7(a)(4) by his conviction for a serious crime;\r\n(4) 7(a)(5) by engaging in conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or bring the legal profession into disrepute; \r\n  and\r\n(5) 7(a)(6) by violating the oath of office.\r\n\r\nThe subpanel also found Respondent violated Rules 5.5(a) and 8.4(a), (b), (c), \r\n  (d), and (e) of Rule 407, and Rule 410(d), SCACR.  It recommended Respondent \r\n  be indefinitely suspended and that he be required to pay the costs of the proceedings.\r\nRespondent filed objections to the subpanelâ€™s report.  \r\n  The full panel adopted that report, and Respondent has raised several issues \r\n  in his brief to this Court.\r\nRespondent first contends the subpanel erred in finding \r\n  he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law when he assisted a woman in obtaining \r\n  a name change.  We disagree.  The women testified that Respondent filled out \r\n  paperwork and drafted the complaint for her, and that he charged her $100 for \r\n  his services.  The preparation of pleadings and the giving of advice in connection \r\n  with the name change constitute the practice of law.  E.g., State \r\n  v. Robinson, 321 S.C. 286, 468 S.E.2d 290 (1996).  Clear and convincing \r\n  evidence supports the finding that Respondent practiced law while under suspension.  \r\n  E.g., In re Devine, 345 S.C. 633, 550 S.E.2d 308 (2001).  \r\nRespondent next contends that attempted possession of \r\n  powder cocaine is not a â€œserious crimeâ€ subjecting him to discipline.  We disagree.  \r\n  Among other definitions, [4] \r\n   a serious crime is one that â€œreflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, \r\n  trustworthiness or fitnessâ€ to practice law.  Rule 2(z), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  \r\n  The attempt to commit a serious crime, in and of itself, subjects an attorney \r\n  to discipline.  Id.  We hold possession of powder cocaine is a serious \r\n  crime because it reflects adversely on an attorneyâ€™s fitness to practice law.  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s attempt to possess cocaine is therefore a serious crime as well.  \r\n  Id.\r\nRespondentâ€™s remaining contentions challenge the constitutionality \r\n  of the subpanelâ€™s recommendation of an indefinite suspension in this case.  \r\n  We perceive no constitutional infirmity in this recommendation, but hold that \r\n  the appropriate sanction is an eighteen month suspension, retroactive to February \r\n  16, 2000, and concurrent with the six month suspension imposed in the first \r\n  case.  Respondent shall also pay the costs assessed by the subpanel.\r\n C.  Conclusion\r\nRespondentâ€™s concurrent six month and eighteen month \r\n  suspensions are retroactive to February 16, 2000.  Prior to applying for readmission \r\n  under Rule 33, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, Respondent shall pay the costs of these \r\n  two proceedings and comply with any requirements imposed by, and pay all dues \r\n  and fees required by, the South Carolina Bar and the Commission on  Continuing \r\n  Legal Education and Specialization.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and \r\n  Acting Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n             \r\n    [1] This Court suspended Respondent on this date following his indictment \r\n    for possession of crack cocaine.\r\n\r\n \r\n             \r\n    [2] There is no contention that any client suffered any loss as the \r\n    result of these trust account deficits.\r\n\r\n \r\n             \r\n    [3] At the time the subpanel and full panel reports were issued, an \r\n    attorney who received a definite suspension of more than six months was required \r\n    to petition the Supreme Court for reinstatement.

Dean Hall, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25507\r\nHeard May 29, 2002 - Filed July 29, 2002\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDeputy Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor J. Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  Michael J. Passaro (\"Passaro\") pled guilty to murder and arson and was sentenced to death. \r\nPassaro's counsel filed an appeal to which Passaro filed a motion to dismiss.  We ordered the circuit court to conduct a\r\ncompetency hearing.  The court found Passaro competent to waive his right to appeal his conviction. \r\n\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nThe facts are not disputed.  Passaro and his wife, Karen Passaro (\"Karen\"), separated because of marital difficulties. \r\nKaren, subsequently, filed for divorce.  The family court issued a temporary order affecting custody of the Passaro's child,\r\nMaggie.  \r\n\r\nThe order granted Passaro weekend custody of Maggie, beginning on Friday, when he would pick her up from daycare, and\r\nending Monday, when he returned her to daycare.  Karen would pick up Maggie on Monday afternoon and keep her until\r\nFriday.  Passaro and Karen had conflicts concerning the custody arrangement, particularly during holidays.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday before Thanksgiving, Passaro did not take Maggie to daycare.  Instead, he drove his van to Karen's\r\ncondominium complex; poured gasoline on the floor of the vehicle; ignited the gasoline and jumped out leaving Maggie to\r\ndie strapped in a child's safety seat.  Investigators found a suicide note in the van, written by Passaro, explaining his wish to\r\nkill himself and Maggie so they could spend time in heaven away from Karen. (1)\r\n\r\nAfter Passaro's indictment, the State served notice \r\n  of its intent to seek the death penalty. The trial judge conducted a Blair \r\n  (2) hearing and found him competent, i.e., he understood \r\n  the charges against him and was able to assist his court-appointed counsel.\r\n\r\nPassaro was arraigned on the day of the competency hearing and entered pleas of guilty to both charges.  The trial court\r\naccepted the pleas after finding they were entered freely, voluntarily and intelligently. (3)  The court reconvened two days\r\nsubsequent to begin the required sentencing phase.  \r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the sentencing hearing the trial judge found the existence of the following statutory aggravating\r\ncircumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: 1) physical torture; (4) 2) offender by his act of murder knowingly created a great\r\nrisk of death to more than one person in a public place by means of a weapon or device which would normally be\r\nhazardous to the lives of more than one person; (5) 3) the murder of a child 11 years of age or younger. (6)  Although the court\r\nfound mitigating circumstances, (7) Passaro waived his right for the court to consider any mitigation.  \r\n\r\nPassaro's counsel, at Passaro's behest, waived closing arguments. Passaro made a brief closing statement:\r\n\r\n\r\nDonna (8) was a big part of my life.  I was devastated by her passing, and when I met Karen I thought I would have another\r\nchance at happiness.  We started having difficulties in our marriage and happiness turned to tragedy.  Thank you, your\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge concluded the evidence warranted the imposition of the death sentence for murder and a concurrent sentence\r\nof 30 years for arson. \r\n\r\nPassaro's counsel filed a timely notice of appeal. \r\n  Passaro, pro se, filed a motion to dismiss his appeal. We remanded \r\n  the matter to the circuit court pursuant to Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. \r\n  75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993), to determine whether Passaro was competent to waive \r\n  his right to appeal.\r\n\r\nAt the Singleton hearing Dr. Pamela Crawford \r\n  (\"Dr. Crawford\"), an expert qualified in forensic psychiatry, testified Passaro \r\n  was competent, under the Singleton standard, to waive his appeal and \r\n  to be executed. She found he suffered from no major mental illness, though he \r\n  had suffered from mild depression in his past, including periods after the death \r\n  of his first wife and after his incarceration for the murder of his daughter. \r\n  Dr. Crawford's findings were consistent with the report of the findings of the \r\n  defense psychiatric expert. \r\n\r\nThe court found Passaro competent under the Singleton \r\n  standard. Specifically, the court found Passaro able to understand the nature \r\n  of the proceedings, the crimes for which he was tried, the reason for and the \r\n  nature of the punishment, and he possessed sufficient mental capacity or ability \r\n  to rationally communicate with counsel.\r\n\r\nWe required the parties submit briefs on Passaro's competence to waive his appeal.  We also denied Passaro's motion to\r\ndismiss his counsel and appear pro se.  However, we allowed Passaro to file an additional pro se brief.  In a letter received\r\nMarch 5, 2002 waiving his right to file a pro se brief, Passaro wrote to appellate counsel:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn following the court's order of December 17, 2001, I understand that I have 20 days to respond to your [Office of\r\nAppellate Defense] brief and the state's brief.\r\n\r\nI received a copy of your brief and the state's brief on February 11, 2002 and after reading both briefs, I do not feel that any\r\nmore [sic] is needed to be said.  I agree with the state.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am waiving the 20 days for my response.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Can an individual who pleads guilty to murder and waives\r\nintroduction of mitigating evidence waive his right to general   appellate review?   \r\n\r\nII.  Is Passaro's waiver of his right to general appellate review competent, knowing and voluntary?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nRight to Waive Appeal\r\n\r\nA capital defendant may waive the right to general \r\n  appellate review. State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (1994) \r\n  (Torrence II). However, this right is limited to competent individuals whose \r\n  decision is knowing and voluntary. Id. \r\n\r\nAppellate counsel argues this Court should not allow Passaro to waive his right to general appellate review.  Appellate\r\ncounsel bases this argument on the theory that Passaro, who pled guilty to capital murder and then waived mitigation at the\r\npenalty phase, should not be allowed to prevent review of his conviction and sentence by waiving appellate review.  To do\r\nso, counsel insists, is \"little more than government-assisted suicide.\" (9)\r\n\r\nOur decisions in Torrence II and State v. Torrence, \r\n  322 S.C. 475, 473 S.E.2d 703 (1996) (Torrence III), permit an individual \r\n  to waive general appellate review of a death penalty conviction. Appellate counsel \r\n  suggests the distinction between the Torrence line of cases and the instant \r\n  case is our affirming Torrence's underlying conviction in our initial review \r\n  of the case. See State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 \r\n  (1991) (Torrence I) (affirming conviction, but reversing the sentence of death \r\n  and remanding for new sentencing proceeding). Because this Court has never reviewed \r\n  Passaro's conviction, counsel asserts we should refuse any request to waive \r\n  appeals in the case. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIt is true Torrence did not waive his right to appellate review until after this Court upheld his conviction.  When Torrence\r\nwas sentenced to death the second time, he chose to waive appellate review because he could, at best, receive life without\r\nparole at a new sentencing hearing.  Torrence preferred the execution of his death sentence to the only alternative, life\r\nwithout parole.  \r\n\r\nPassaro, unlike Torrence, pled guilty. Allowing \r\n  individuals, even defendants facing capital punishment, to plead guilty is recognized \r\n  both in this state and throughout the nation. See State v. Shaw, \r\n  273 S.C. 194, 255 S.E.2d 799 (1979) (upholding death sentence of two defendants \r\n  who pled guilty to murder) overruled on other grounds by Torrence I, \r\n  supra; see generally Barry J. Fisher, Judicial Suicide \r\n  or Constitutional Autonomy? A Capital Defendant's Right to Plead Guilty, \r\n  65 Alb. L. Rev. 181 (2001) (noting all states except Arkansas, Louisiana and \r\n  New York allow a defendant in a capital case to plead guilty). By allowing Passaro \r\n  to plead guilty, we allow him to significantly restrict the scope of review \r\n  on appeal because a guilty plea generally constitutes a waiver of non-jurisdictional \r\n  defects and claims of violations of constitutional rights. See Rivers \r\n  v. Strickland, 264 S.C. 121, 124, 213 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1975) (stating \"[t]he \r\n  general rule is that a plea of guilty, voluntarily and understandingly made, \r\n  constitutes a waiver of non-jurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims \r\n  of violation of constitutional rights prior to the plea\"). Counsel does not \r\n  argue or suggest Passaro was not guilty or his guilty plea defective.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with appellate counsel's argument that \r\n  allowing an individual to plead guilty to murder, be sentenced to death and \r\n  waive his right to general appellate review is tantamount to State assisted \r\n  suicide. While the competency of the guilty verdict may be in doubt in some \r\n  future case, it is not in doubt here as Passaro pled guilty below and confirmed \r\n  his guilt before this Court. See State v. Sroka, 267 S.C. 664, \r\n  230 S.E.2d 816 (1976) (affirming guilty verdict by jury based on overwhelming \r\n  evidence presented at trial and later admission of guilt by defendant in open \r\n  court).\r\n\r\nImportantly, this Court is the final body to decide whether to grant Passaro's waiver.  Because of the uniqueness of the\r\ndeath penalty, we carefully review, individually, a petition to waive appellate review.  We discern no reason Passaro should\r\nbe denied his right to waive appellate review because he chose to plead guilty. \r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAbility to Waive Appeal\r\n\r\nWe limit a death row inmate's ability to waive \r\n  appeals to those who are competent and whose decision to do so is both knowing \r\n  and voluntary. See Torrence II, supra. Passaro is competent \r\n  to waive his right to appeal. His decision to do so is knowing and voluntary.\r\n\r\nA. Competency\r\n\r\nThe standard to determine competency, set forth \r\n  by Singleton v. State, supra, is: 1) whether the defendant can \r\n  understand the nature of the proceedings, the crimes for which he was tried, \r\n  and the reason for the punishment; and 2) whether the convicted defendant possesses \r\n  sufficient capacity or ability to rationally communicate with counsel. See \r\n  Torrence II, supra.\r\n\r\nThe State argues the only evidence, particularly \r\n  Dr. Crawford's report, presented at the competency hearing demonstrates Passaro \r\n  is competent under Singleton. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe evidence presented at the hearing establishes Passaro suffers from no major mental illness.  The evidence also shows\r\nhe understands the nature of appellate proceedings, including the relevant issues of appeal, the role of his attorneys and the\r\nfunction of the court system in the process.  Passaro was able to state why he was tried and why he received a death\r\nsentence.  \r\n\r\nDr. Crawford noted Passaro was aware of the finality of the death penalty and was able to discuss in detail his reason for\r\nwaiving his appeal.  The defense expert's report provided a similar evaluation.  \r\n\r\nWe questioned Passaro at length during oral arguments.  Our own questioning of him leaves no doubt of his competency. \r\nAt oral arguments we questioned Passaro extensively about his trial, the appeals process and the consequence of his request\r\nto terminate any appeals on his behalf.  It is our observation that Passaro possesses the capacity and ability to communicate\r\nwith counsel.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence suggesting Passaro is not \r\n  competent under the Singleton standard. We conclude, based on the hearing \r\n  below and our questioning, that Passaro is competent to waive his appeal.\r\n\r\nB. Knowing and Voluntary\r\n\r\nThe evidence presented at the competency hearing and Passaro's testimony before this Court establishes the wavier of his\r\nright to \r\n\r\nappellate review is knowing and voluntary. (10)  Dr. Crawford noted Passaro understood the consequences of his action.  No\r\nevidence suggests Passaro is being coerced into waiving his appeal.\r\n\r\nWhile defense counsel notes Passaro, at Dr. Crawford's second visit on March 20, 2001, expressed the possibility he may\r\nchange his mind, he made no such comments at the competency hearing.  In his letter to defense counsel waiving his right\r\nto file a pro se brief, Passaro unequivocally agreed with the State's brief.  Such a statement reaffirms his prior commitment\r\nto waive his right to appeal.\r\n\r\nAt oral argument, we questioned Passaro extensively about the voluntary nature of his request.  We also questioned\r\nwhether he fully understood the appellate process and what he could hope to gain by appealing his sentence. We conclude\r\nPassaro's request is knowingly and voluntarily made.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSentence Review\r\n\r\nHaving concluded Passaro may waive his right to general appellate review, we proceed to review the sentence as required\r\nby S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (1976). (11)\r\n\r\nA. Arbitrariness Review\r\n\r\nWe are required to consider whether a death sentence \r\n  \"was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary \r\n  factor.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) (1976). Appellate counsel has not argued \r\n  Passaro's sentence was influenced by passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary \r\n  factor. Having reviewed the record we conclude the sentence was not influenced \r\n  by such arbitrary factors, but was the product of sound deliberation based on \r\n  the evidence. See State v. Shaw, supra, overruled on \r\n  other grounds by Torrence I, supra. \r\n\r\nB. Circumstances of Aggravation Review\r\n\r\nThe trial judge imposed the death penalty after finding the following statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt: 1) physical torture; (12) 2) offender by his act of murder knowingly created a great risk of death to more\r\nthan one person in a public place by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more\r\nthan one person; (13) 3) the murder of a child 11 years of age or younger. (14)  \r\n\r\nIt is not disputed Maggie Passaro was under 11 \r\n  years of age at the time of the murder. The child was 2 years of age at the \r\n  time of her death. Because the State has proved the existence of at least one \r\n  aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt it is not necessary to address \r\n  the other aggravating circumstances. See State v. Chaffee, 285 \r\n  S.C. 21, 328 S.E.2d 464 (1984), overruled on other grounds by Torrence \r\n  I, supra (death penalty may be imposed upon finding at least one statutory \r\n  aggravating factor).\r\n\r\nAfter a review of the record, we conclude the evidence supports the trial judge's findings beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nC. Proportionality Review\r\n\r\nThe United States Constitution requires the death \r\n  penalty to be imposed only if the sentence is \"neither excessive nor disproportionate \r\n  in light of the crime and the defendant.\" State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. \r\n  572, 590, 300 S.E.2d 63, 74 (1982). In conducting a proportionality review, \r\n  this court searches for \"similar cases\" where the death sentence has been upheld. \r\n  Id. \r\n\r\nA review of case law reveals no factually similar case, i.e., the murder of a person under eleven years of age by arson.  \r\n\r\nThis Court has, however, upheld the death sentence \r\n  in cases where a defendant has murdered a person under the age of eleven. See \r\n  State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998) (upholding death sentence \r\n  for defendant convicted of murder of his unborn, but viable, son); State \r\n  v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 518 S.E.2d 588 (1999) (death penalty was proper \r\n  for a defendant who murdered his girlfriend's ten-year old daughter by shooting \r\n  her); State v. Wilson, 306 S.C. 498, 413 S.E.2d 19 (1992) (death sentence \r\n  was proportional to crime where defendant gunned down elementary school students). \r\n  Passaro's crime is no less gruesome than those, perhaps more so considering \r\n  the evidence Passaro knowingly and intentionally started the fire, jumped from \r\n  the van, and failed to inform rescuers that his child was still strapped to \r\n  a safety seat in the vehicle. The brutality of the murder is underscored by \r\n  evidence the victim was alive during the fire, succumbing to death only after \r\n  the intense heat caused her severe pain and suffering.\r\n\r\nEvidence of Passaro's individual characteristics \r\n  show he suffered slight mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murder \r\n  and did not have a substantial history of violent criminal conduct. We upheld \r\n  a death sentence under similar mitigating circumstances in State v. Wilson, \r\n  supra. The death sentence is proportional to the characteristics of this \r\n  crime and the individual defendant.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nPassaro may waive his right to general appellate review.  He is competent to do so, and his request is both knowing and\r\nvoluntary.  We further find the death sentence was properly imposed after finding the existence of at least one aggravating\r\ncircumstance.  The sentence was not imposed arbitrarily and was not disproportionate.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   The letter is caustic in tone, urging at one point for Karen to not kill herself so she may \"live in pain [because of\r\nMaggie's death] for the rest of her life.\"  \r\n2.  State v. Blair, 275 \r\n  S.C. 529, 273 S.E.2d 536 (1981). \r\n3.   The judge noted Passaro took 40 milligrams/daily of the drug Prozac, which did not impair his ability to assist counsel. \r\n4.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(h) (Supp. 2001). \r\n5.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(3) (Supp. 2001).\r\n6.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(10) (Supp. 2001).\r\n7.  The trial court found the \r\n  existence of two statutory mitigating circumstances: 1) Passaro had no significant \r\n  history of prior criminal conviction involving the use of violence against another \r\n  person; 2) the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence \r\n  of mental or emotional disturbance. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(1)-(2) \r\n  (Supp. 2001). \r\n8.  Donna was Passaro's first wife.  She was struck and killed by an automobile while attempting to help another motorist\r\ninvolved in a separate accident.  She died in 1988.\r\n9.  Death row volunteers are \r\n  neither new or unusual. See Christy Chandler, note, Voluntary \r\n  Executions, 50 Stan. L. Rev. 1897 (1998); Richard C. Dieter, Ethical \r\n  Choices for Attorneys Whose Clients Elect Execution, 3 Geo. J. Legal Ethics, \r\n  799, 802-03 (1990); Jane L. McClellan, Stopping the Rush to the Death House: \r\n  Third-Party Standing in Death-Row Volunteer Cases, 26 Ariz. St. L.J. 201, \r\n  202, 212 (1994). States executed 302 inmates between 1973 and 1995, with 12% \r\n  of those being the result of inmates refusing their right to appeal or petition \r\n  for various post-conviction relief.

Passaro stated the\r\nmedication does not affect his ability to reason, coherently or rationally.  The medical evidence presented at the hearing\r\nbelow confirms this assessment.  \r\n11.  We have never directly \r\n  addressed whether a defendant may waive sentence review under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-3-25 (C) (1976). See, e.g., Patterson v. Commonwealth, \r\n  262 Va. 301, 551 S.E.2d 332 (Va. 2001) (allowing death row defendant to waive \r\n  general appeal for errors but not sentence review) State v. Dodd, 120 \r\n  Wash.2d 1, 838 P.2d 86 (Wash. 1992). We do not address Passaro's ability to \r\n  waive sentence review here because the issue has neither been raised nor briefed \r\n  by either party. Because this case arises from the direct appeal filed by appellate \r\n  counsel, we have conducted the sentence review. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-3-25(F). \r\n12.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(h) (Supp. 2001). \r\n13.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(3) (Supp. 2001).\r\n14.  S.C. Code Ann.
