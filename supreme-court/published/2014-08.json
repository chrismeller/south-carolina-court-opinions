Ranucci v. Crain, Op.\r\nNo. 27422 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 23, 2014) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 49).\r\n(\"Ranucci II\"). Additionally, we conclude that Brouwer successfully invoked this\r\nexception and, thus, was not required to file an expert witness affidavit with her\r\nNOI. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand the\r\ncase for further proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I.     Factual / Procedural History\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Section 15-79-125 provides, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n              Prior to filing or initiating a civil action alleging injury or death\r\n       as a result of medical malpractice, the plaintiff shall\r\n       contemporaneously file a Notice of Intent to File Suit and an affidavit\r\n       of an expert witness, subject to the affidavit requirements established\r\n       in Section 15-36-100, in a county in which venue would be proper for\r\n       filing or initiating the civil action.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125(A) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).\r\n2   Section 15-36-100 states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n       (C)(2) The contemporaneous filing requirement of subsection (B) is\r\n       not required to support a pleaded specification of negligence\r\n       involving subject matter that lies within the ambit of common\r\n       knowledge and experience, so that no special learning is needed to\r\n       evaluate the conduct of the defendant.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-100(C)(2) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).\r\n\n       On January 9, 2009, Brouwer was admitted to Sisters of Charity Providence\r\nHospital (\"Hospital\") for a uvulopalatopharyngoplasy, a procedure used to treat\r\nsleep apnea. During the surgery, Brouwer suffered an allergic reaction that\r\nrequired her to be treated in the Intensive Care Unit (\"ICU\"). Brouwer attributed\r\nthe reaction to her latex allergy that was disclosed to medical personnel on\r\nBrouwer's forms for \"Pre-Anesthesia Evaluation\" and \"Consent to Operation,\r\nAnesthetic and Other Medical Services.\" Prior to surgery, the Hospital issued\r\nBrouwer a wrist band that identified the latex allergy.\r\n\r\n       On December 29, 2011, Brouwer filed an NOI and a Summons and\r\nComplaint, wherein she asserted a medical malpractice claim against the Hospital,\r\nthe medical practice, the operating physician, the anesthesiologist, and other\r\nunnamed medical personnel. On January 4, 2012, Brouwer filed an Amended NOI\r\nto correct a scrivener's error as to a named defendant. Brouwer did not file an\r\nexpert witness affidavit with her NOI because it was her \"good faith belief\" that\r\nher allergic reaction to latex \"lies within the ambit of common knowledge and\r\nexperience, so that no special learning is needed to evaluate the conduct of the\r\nDefendants.\" If the circuit court deemed its submission necessary, Brouwer\r\nrequested additional time to procure and file an expert witness affidavit.\r\n\r\n       Respondents moved to dismiss Brouwer's NOI and Complaint pursuant to\r\nRule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. In support of the motion, Respondents alleged Brouwer's\r\nfailure to file an expert witness affidavit with her NOI violated the mandatory\r\nprovisions of section 15-79-125. Brouwer opposed the motion, but conceded the\r\nComplaint was prematurely filed as the parties had not yet engaged in mediation.3\r\n\r\n      After a hearing, the circuit court denied Respondents' motion to dismiss\r\nBrouwer's NOI on the ground the common-knowledge exception codified in\r\nsection 15-36-100(C)(2) was applicable. The court, however, dismissed the\r\nSummons and Complaint without prejudice.\r\n\r\n       Subsequently, Respondents filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP. In support of its motion, Respondents relied on the recently issued\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals in Ranucci v. Crain, 397 S.C. 168, 723 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n3 See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125(C) (Supp. 2013) (stating, \"[w]ithin ninety days\r\nand no later than one hundred twenty days from the service of the Notice of Intent\r\nto File Suit, the parties shall participate in a mediation conference unless an\r\nextension for no more than sixty days is granted by the court based upon a finding\r\nof good cause\").\r\n\n242 (Ct. App. 2012) (\"Ranucci I\"), wherein the court found \"section 15-79-125(A)\r\ninvokes only the provisions of section 15-36-100 governing the preparation and\r\ncontent of the affidavit.\" Id. at 176, 723 S.E.2d at 246. The court explained, \"The\r\nplain language of section 15-36-100, which ties the filing of affidavits under that\r\nstatute to a complaint or other initial pleading, prevents the remaining provisions\r\nfrom applying to affidavits filed pursuant to section 15-79-125.\" Id. at 177, 723\r\nS.E.2d at 246. Based on this holding, Respondents asserted \"the common\r\nknowledge exception found in § 15-36-100 does not apply to the requisite\r\nprelitigation procedures mandated in § 15-79-125 and cannot be used to obviate\r\nthe requirement that there be an expert affidavit filed with the Notice of Intent.\"\r\n\r\n      Finding Ranucci I dispositive, the circuit court granted Respondents' motion\r\nto dismiss Brouwer's NOI. Following the denial of her Rule 59(e) motion,\r\nBrouwer appealed to the Court of Appeals. This Court certified the appeal\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\n\r\n                             II.    Standard of Review\r\n\r\n       \"On appeal from the dismissal of a case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), an\r\nappellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court.\" Rydde v.\r\nMorris, 381 S.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009). \"That standard requires\r\nthe Court to construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the nonmovant and\r\ndetermine if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible from the\r\npleadings would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.\" Id.\r\n(internal quotations omitted). The Court may sustain the dismissal when \"the facts\r\nalleged in the complaint do not support relief under any theory of law.\" Flateau v.\r\nHarrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 202, 584 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n                                   III.   Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Arguments\r\n\r\n       Brouwer contends the circuit court erred in granting Respondents' motion to\r\ndismiss the NOI for her failure to contemporaneously file an expert witness\r\naffidavit. In support of this contention, Brouwer disputes the propriety of Ranucci\r\nI on the ground the decision is inconsistent with the rules of statutory construction.\r\nBecause section 15-79-125(A) clearly references section 15-36-100, Brouwer\r\nclaims all of the affidavit requirements enunciated in section 15-36-100, including\r\nthe common-knowledge exception in subsection (C)(2), are applicable to an NOI.\r\nBrouwer explains that to construe these statutes separately would lead to an absurd\r\n\nresult where the common-knowledge exception would apply to the actual filing of\r\na medical malpractice complaint but not to the filing of an NOI. Stated another\r\nway, Brouwer claims \"prelitigation [would] require[] an expert witness affidavit\r\nregardless of whether the subject matter is within the ambit of common knowledge\r\nand experience, but actual litigation [would] not require an expert witness\r\naffidavit.\" Brouwer argues that such a conclusion violates public policy as it\r\nmakes \"access to the legal system more expensive and more difficult.\"\r\n\r\n       Alternatively, Brouwer contends that even if the NOI did not comply with\r\nthe statutory requirements, Respondents' claim regarding the insufficiency of the\r\nNOI became moot when the parties engaged in mediation as Respondents were\r\napprised of the specifics of the underlying medical malpractice claim.4\r\n\r\nB.    Analysis\r\n\r\n       Recently, this Court overruled the decision of the Court of Appeals in\r\nRanucci I. Ranucci v. Crain, Op. No. 27422 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 23, 2014)\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 49). (\"Ranucci II\"). In so ruling, we specifically\r\nheld that section 15-79-125 incorporates section 15-36-100 in its entirety. Thus,\r\nthe common-knowledge exception of section 15-36-100(C)(2) may operate to\r\neliminate the need to file an expert witness affidavit with the NOI under section\r\n15-79-125(A). Consequently, we hold the circuit court erred in finding that\r\nBrouwer could not invoke the common-knowledge exception when she filed her\r\nNOI. This decision, however, does not end our analysis as we must consider\r\nwhether Brouwer's case fell within this exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 In her brief to this Court, Brouwer's argument on this point is conclusory and is\r\nnot supported by any authority. Moreover, the circuit court did not rule on this\r\nissue. Thus, we find this issue is not preserved for the Court's review. See First\r\nSav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting when\r\na party fails to cite authority or when the argument is simply a conclusory\r\nstatement, the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal); Eaddy v.\r\nSmurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 164, 584 S.E.2d 390, 396 (Ct. App.\r\n2003) (\"[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are\r\ndeemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not preserved for our review.\"); see\r\nalso Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding\r\nan issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be\r\npreserved for appellate review).\r\n\n      To establish a cause of action for medical malpractice, the plaintiff must\r\nprove the following facts by a preponderance of the evidence:\r\n\r\n      (1)\t   The presence of a doctor-patient relationship between the \n\r\n             parties; \n\r\n\r\n      (2)\t   Recognized and generally accepted standards, practices, and\r\n             procedures which are exercised by competent physicians in the\r\n             same branch of medicine under similar circumstances;\r\n\r\n      (3)\t   The medical or health professional's negligence, deviating from\r\n             generally accepted standards, practices, and procedures;\r\n\r\n      (4)\t   Such negligence being a proximate cause of the plaintiff's\r\n             injury; and\r\n\r\n      (5)\t   An injury to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n27 S.C. Jur. Med. & Health Prof'ls § 10 (2014) (footnotes omitted); Smith v.\r\nUnited States, 119 F. Supp. 2d 561 (D.S.C. 2000). \"A plaintiff in a medical\r\nmalpractice case must establish by expert testimony both the standard of care and\r\nthe defendant's failure to conform to the required standard, unless the subject\r\nmatter is of common knowledge or experience so that no special learning is needed\r\nto evaluate the defendant's conduct.\" Carver v. Med. Soc'y of S.C., 286 S.C. 347,\r\n350, 334 S.E.2d 125, 127 (Ct. App. 1985); David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367\r\nS.C. 242, 248, 626 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2006). \"The application of the common knowledge\r\nexception in proving negligence in a case involving medical malpractice depends\r\non the particular facts of the case.\" Hickman v. Sexton Dental Clinic, P.A., 295\r\nS.C. 164, 168, 367 S.E.2d 453, 455 (Ct. App. 1988). \"When expert testimony is\r\nnot required, the plaintiff must offer evidence that rises above mere speculation or\r\nconjecture.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Here, Brouwer conceded her claim involves medical malpractice, thus, her\r\ncause of action cannot be construed as one of ordinary negligence. See Dawkins v.\r\nUnion Hosp. Dist., 408 S.C. 171, 758 S.E.2d 501 (2014) (distinguishing between\r\ncases involving medical malpractice and ordinary negligence). Accordingly, she\r\nmust either present expert witness testimony or establish that the negligent act\r\nalleged in her NOI \"lies within the ambit of common knowledge and experience,\r\nso that no special learning is needed to evaluate the conduct of the defendant.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-100(C)(2) (Supp. 2013).\r\n\n       We find the substance of Brouwer's allegation, i.e., that the negligent\r\nexposure of a patient to latex with a known allergy can result in an allergic reaction\r\nin that patient, is a matter within the common knowledge or experience so that no\r\nspecial learning is needed to evaluate Respondents' conduct at the pre-litigation\r\nstage. Cf. Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 249 S.E.2d 910 (1978) (holding tubal\r\nligation rendering intrauterine device and other birth control device useless\r\nconstitutes a matter of common knowledge); Thomas v. Dootson, 377 S.C. 293,\r\n659 S.E.2d 253 (Ct. App. 2008) (recognizing expert testimony was not required for\r\nclaim arising from a surgical drill that burned skin on contact because claim would\r\nfall within the common knowledge or experience of laymen); Hickman v. Sexton\r\nDental Clinic, P.A., 295 S.C. 164, 367 S.E.2d 453 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding\r\nevidence presented was sufficient for the jury to infer without the aid of expert\r\ntestimony a breach of duty to dental patient where patient testified an unsupervised\r\ndental assistant rammed a sharp object into patient's mouth).\r\n\r\n       Therefore, we hold that Brouwer did not need to file an expert witness\r\naffidavit with her NOI. See 70 C.J.S. Physicians & Surgeons § 142 (Supp. 2014)\r\n(\"[I]n a common-knowledge case, whether a medical malpractice plaintiff's claim\r\nmeets the threshold of merit can be determined on the face of the complaint, and\r\nbecause the defendant's careless acts are quite obvious, the plaintiff need not\r\npresent expert testimony to establish the standard of care; in such a case, requiring\r\nan affidavit of merit is not necessary to weed out meritless lawsuits.\" (footnotes\r\nomitted)). Because Brouwer's NOI was sufficient to satisfy the pre-litigation\r\nrequirements of section 15-79-125(A), Brouwer's lawsuit remains viable as the\r\nstatute of limitations has been tolled during the pendency of this appeal. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 15-79-125(A) (Supp. 2013) (\"Filing the Notice of Intent to File Suit tolls all\r\napplicable statutes of limitations.\").\r\n\r\n                                 IV.    Conclusion\r\n\r\n        Having overruled Ranucci I, we conclude that Brouwer was permitted to\r\ninvoke the common-knowledge exception of section 15-36-100(C)(2) in her pre-\r\nlitigation filings. Because the negligent act alleged by Brouwer fits within this\r\nexception, she was not required to file an expert witness affidavit with her NOI to\r\nsatisfy the pre-litigation requirements of section 15-79-125(A). Accordingly, we\r\nreverse the decision of the circuit court and remand the case for further\r\nproceedings.\r\n\n     REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n     KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P.\r\n            Turner, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of\r\n            Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n            Billy J. Garrett, Jr., Esquire, of The Garrett Law Firm,\r\n            PC, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent\r\n(Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 502 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a public reprimand and agrees never to seek nor accept a judicial\r\noffice in South Carolina without the express written permission of this Court after\r\nwritten notice to ODC. We accept the Agreement and publicly reprimand\r\nrespondent, the most severe sanction we are able to impose under these\r\ncircumstances.1 The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n Since respondent no longer holds judicial office, a public reprimand is the most\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nsevere sanction which can be imposed. In the Matter of O'Kelley, 361 S.C. 30, 603\r\nS.E.2d 410 (2004).\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\nRespondent was indicted on two counts of Misconduct in Office. The first\r\nindictment alleged respondent offered and gave Jane Doe #1 money and/or other\r\nbenefits for the handling and disposition of legal matters involving Jane Doe #1\r\nbefore him in his official capacity as Magistrate in return for Jane Doe #1 allowing\r\nrespondent to have sexual contact with her from 1996 to 2009. The second\r\nindictment alleged respondent offered and gave Jane Doe #2 money and/or other\r\nbenefits for the handling and disposition of legal matters involving Jane Doe #2\r\nbefore him in his official capacity as Magistrate in return for Jane Doe #2 allowing\r\nrespondent to have sexual contact with her from 2001 to 2011.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 2014, respondent entered a guilty plea to Misconduct in Office on the\r\nfirst indictment. He was sentenced to one (1) year imprisonment provided that,\r\nupon service of ninety (90) days, the balance would be suspended with probation\r\nfor a period of five (5) years. On the same day, respondent entered a guilty plea to\r\nMisconduct in Office on the second indictment.

We\r\naffirm.                FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Appellants are limited partners in five separate limited partnerships and have\r\nasserted legal claims in five separate actions against their general partners,\r\nRespondents.1 Each of the limited partnerships owned separate apartment\r\ncomplexes in one of the three counties—Beaufort, Orangeburg, and Charleston.\r\nOn appeal, each of the cases involves a different grouping of limited partners,2\r\ndifferent properties, and different facts.\r\n\r\n       In essence, the limited partnerships were formed in the 1960s to construct\r\nand operate the properties at issue, affordable housing projects for low-income\r\ncitizens in the three counties. Respondents became general partners around 1975,\r\nand from that point forward, Appellants took no part in the management or\r\nbusiness affairs of the complexes. In 1984, Respondents notified Appellants that\r\nthey had contracted to sell the properties to Boston Financial Group (BFG). The\r\nterms of the sale called for a small amount to be paid upfront but the majority\r\nwould be paid in 1999 in a \"balloon\" payment with accruing interest. However,\r\nBFG defaulted on the payment, and sold the properties without intervention from\r\nthe partnerships. All of the claims stem from Respondents' roles in selling the\r\nproperties and their actions in the aftermath of BFG's default.\r\n\r\n      On April 22, 2003, certain Appellants filed the complaint in Davis v.\r\nParkview Apartments (the Parkview case). On July 7, 2003, Respondents filed\r\nvarious motions, including a motion to dismiss certain claims against certain\r\n\r\n1 All Appellants and Respondents are successors in interest to either the original\r\nlimited partners (except for Laurance Davis) or original general partners.\r\n2 In other words, some of the limited partners held interests in more than one of the\r\nlimited partnerships, and some held an interest in only one of the limited\r\npartnerships, but none of the limited partners held interests in all of the\r\npartnerships.\r\n\nRespondents and a motion to strike or make more specific allegations contained in\r\nAppellants' complaint. The circuit court denied the motions. Appellants filed an\r\namended complaint on March 23, 2004, alleging causes of action at law for\r\ndamages, including, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty and causes of action for\r\nequitable relief. On April 9, 2004, Respondents filed an Answer, setting forth a\r\ngeneral denial and affirmative defenses, including, inter alia, the statute of\r\nlimitations. On April 13, 2004, Respondents filed a motion to dismiss and other\r\nrelated motions. By order dated February 11, 2005, the court dismissed one cause\r\nof action, styled \"bad faith,\" but denied the motion to dismiss as to the remaining\r\ncauses of action.\r\n\r\n      On October 13, 2005, certain Appellants filed complaints in Davis v.\r\nPalmetto Apartments (the Palmetto case) and Carolina Management Corporation\r\nof Beaufort v. Pinewood Park Apartments (the Pinewood Park case), and on\r\nOctober 17, 2005, certain Appellants then filed complaints in Rentz v. Orleans\r\nGardens (the Orleans Gardens case) and Laurance Davis v. Roosevelt Gardens\r\n(the Roosevelt Gardens case). In each of these cases, the groups of Appellants\r\nalleged causes of action at law for damages, including, inter alia, a claim for\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty, and causes of action for equitable relief. Respondents\r\nanswered on January 17, 2006, setting forth a general denial and affirmative\r\ndefenses, including the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n       By administrative order dated March 7, 2006, all five of the cases were\r\nassigned to Circuit Judge Doyet A. Early III \"to hear and decide all pre-trial\r\nmotions and other matters pertaining to these cases, including the trial and post-\r\ntrial motions.\" The purpose of assigning the cases to a single circuit court judge\r\nwas to \"promote the effective and expeditious disposition of this litigation by\r\nuniform rulings and [to] conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel, and\r\nthe judiciary.\" However, these cases have never been consolidated.\r\n\r\n        The Record in this case is voluminous, and illustrates the complex and, at\r\ntimes, contentious nature of these proceedings. The circuit judge presided over\r\nnumerous motion hearings and issued numerous orders over the course of this\r\nlitigation. However, this appeal concerns a final order, dated April 9, 2010, and\r\nentitled \"Order Granting Defendants' Two Motions for Sanctions, Finding\r\nPlaintiffs in Contempt of Court, and Dismissing the Above-Captioned Actions as\r\nSanctions for Plaintiffs' Contempt\" (the Dismissal Order), in which the circuit\r\njudge dismissed all of the cases and awarded fees and costs to Respondents as\r\nsanctions for Appellants' continued refusal to comply with his previous discovery\r\n\nrulings. In addition, Appellants appeal the judge's failure to disqualify himself at\r\nthe outset of this litigation and late refusal to recuse himself.\r\n\r\n       From the outset, the statute of limitations emerged as an important issue in\r\nthis case. On January 17, 2006, Respondents moved for summary judgment in the\r\nPalmetto, Orleans Gardens, and Roosevelt Gardens cases based on the affirmative\r\ndefense that Appellants' legal claims in these cases were barred by the statute of\r\nlimitations.3 In support of the motion for summary judgment, Respondents served\r\nAppellants with Requests for Admission in order to ascertain the point at which\r\nAppellants became aware of the alleged injuries that they claimed. On February\r\n13, 2007, the court denied the motion, granting Respondents leave to raise the\r\n\r\n3 Respondents contend that all of the legal claims alleged in the complaints center\r\non Respondents' business judgment in 1999 when they concluded the properties at\r\nissue had no value above the HUD mortgages (with the exception of the Pinewood\r\nPark case), and that repossessing the apartments was not in the best interests of the\r\nlimited partnerships. However, Respondents also contend that Appellants allege\r\ninjury to the limited partnerships as far back as the early 1980s in each case,\r\nincluding, inter alia, Respondents' alleged: failure to entertain other offers to\r\npurchase the properties in the 1980s, misrepresentations of the purchaser's financial\r\nsolvency, sale of the properties to an entity created by BFG, instead of BFG,\r\nfailure to forward appropriate documentation of the sale, failure to properly secure\r\nthe notes, and undervaluation of the properties in order to acquire various limited\r\npartnership interests. Appellants asserted that Respondents were estopped from\r\nasserting their statute of limitations argument because all parties agreed to\r\npostpone discovery in the Parkview case and the filing of additional related cases\r\nin an attempt to resolve all of the cases through mediation, including those that had\r\nnot yet been filed. On the other hand, Respondents contend they agreed to\r\npostpone discovery in the Parkview case only, but did not agree to stay the statute\r\nof limitations applicable in any other cases Appellants had not yet brought.\r\nUltimately, the mediation fell through. Appellants contend that mediation was\r\ncancelled because the jointly retained independent appraiser failed to complete the\r\nappraisals in time. Regardless of the reason for the failure of the mediation to go\r\nforward, Respondents point out in their brief that the mediation and surrounding\r\nnegotiations fell through as of July 26, 2004, but Appellants did not file the\r\nremaining cases until October 2005. Therefore, Respondents contend, whether or\r\nnot they were estopped from asserting the statute of limitations during that period,\r\nAppellants' claims are still time-barred.\r\n\nstatute of limitations defense again after the commencement of discovery in the\r\ncases. Respondents again moved for summary judgment with respect to the statute\r\nof limitations issue in the Palmetto, Orleans Gardens, and Roosevelt Gardens\r\ncases. The judge held a hearing on the motion on November 19, 2007. On June\r\n17, 2008, the circuit court denied Respondents' motion because \"a genuine issue\r\nexists as to material facts involving the statute of limitations.\"4\r\n\r\n       On August 28, 2008, Respondents served Appellants with supplemental\r\ndiscovery requests. After granting Appellants additional time to file their\r\nresponses, on November 6, 2008, Respondents filed a motion to compel Appellants\r\nto respond to their discovery requests. Appellants served their initial discovery\r\nresponses on November 14, 2008, but Respondents chose to proceed with their\r\nmotion to compel, claiming Appellants failed to answer their discovery requests\r\ncompletely. Respondents specifically sought to compel Appellants to provide full\r\nand complete responses to Respondents' interrogatories and the production of all\r\ndocuments in Appellants' possession responsive to Respondents' requests for\r\nproduction. The court held a hearing on the motions on December 9, 2008.\r\n\r\n      On January 29, 2009, Appellants served their Supplemental Responses to the\r\nDiscovery Requests, expressly providing that the responses were made only by\r\nAppellants in the Parkview action, and that Appellants in the other actions would\r\nsupplement their responses \"at a later date.\" Moreover, the Parkview Appellants\r\nonly additionally produced the financial statements of Appellant Laurance Davis.\r\nMuch of the remainder of the responses was identical to the previous responses.\r\n\r\n       By order dated March 3, 2009, entitled \"Order Granting Defendants' Motion\r\nto Compel, dated November 6, 2008\" (the Discovery Order), the circuit court\r\ngranted Respondents' motion to compel, specifically finding that all of the\r\nAppellants were required to \"provide full and complete responses\" and \"produce\r\nall documents in their possession, custody or control, which [were] responsive to\"\r\nthe discovery requests. The court took issue with Appellants' blanket method of\r\nobjecting to the requests, \"mak[ing] it impossible for [Respondents] to know if\r\n\r\n4 During a later hearing, the circuit judge stated: \"[T]here's some significant issues\r\nin this case from day one when I first got in it dealing with the statute of limitations\r\nproblem. And I found that it was an issue of fact. And I still stuggle with that\r\nsomewhat . . . .\"\r\n\nresponsive information and/or documents [were] being withheld, and, if so, based\r\non which specific grounds.\" In addition, the court specifically ordered Appellants\r\nto provide more information in their answers to interrogatories concerning\r\nAppellants' proposed expert witnesses and contents of their testimony. The court\r\nalso required Appellants to provide sufficient identifying information in their\r\nprivilege log, so that Respondents could recognize which documents Appellants\r\nwere withholding on the basis of the attorney-client privilege and assess the\r\napplicability of the privilege to those documents. Finally, the court mandated the\r\ndisclosure of pertinent discovery responses in all five cases (not just the Parkview\r\ncase), and by all of the Appellants, stating \"[e]ach and every [Appellant] is\r\nrequired to provide all information reasonably available to him or her, which\r\nwould be responsive to any of the Interrogatories,\" and \"each and every\r\n[Appellant] is required to produce all documents in his or her possession, custody\r\nor control, which would be responsive to any of the Requests for Production.\"5\r\nThe Discovery Order required Appellants' compliance within thirty days.6 To date,\r\nAppellants have not complied with the Discovery Order.\r\n\r\n       Simultaneous to the discovery response dispute, the parties also disagreed\r\nregarding what materials were protected from disclosure by the attorney-client\r\nprivilege. Approximately one month after the court denied Respondents' summary\r\njudgment motion, counsel for Respondents indicated to the court that Appellants\r\nfailed to produce a complete privilege log. The court allowed Appellants thirty\r\ndays to produce a complete privilege log. On July 28, 2008, Appellants produced a\r\nnew privilege log (the 7/28/08 privilege log) containing 90 documents, created\r\nbetween 1998 and 2004, for the first time in the litigation. In their 7/28/08\r\nprivilege log, Appellants only included a description of the date, author, and\r\nrecipient of each document, and the classification of each document, i.e. fax, letter,\r\nor memorandum. At the December 9, 2008, hearing, Respondents also argued for\r\nthe production of certain documents contained in Appellants' privilege log.\r\nLikewise, Appellants took issue with Respondents' claims of privilege.\r\n\r\n5By order dated June 16, 2009, the circuit court denied Appellants' Rule 59(e)\r\nmotion with respect to this ruling.\r\n6 On the same date the court issued the Discovery Order, it also issued an order,\r\nentitled \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel,\r\nDated July 29, 2005.\" In that order, the circuit court found that certain of\r\nAppellants' discovery requests were overly broad and unduly burdensome and\r\nrestricted those requests.\r\n\n       Therefore, on December 30, 2008, the court, with the consent of all of the\r\nparties, ordered Gary Clary to serve as special master for the purpose of\r\nconducting an in camera review of the so-called \"privileged\" documents at issue\r\nand to \"make his ruling as to whether each such document is subject to discovery\r\nand production should be compelled.\"7 The order required the special master to\r\nprovide the circuit judge with a report setting forth his findings and conclusions.\r\nOn December 31, 2008, Appellants provided a more descriptive privilege log (the\r\n12/31/08 privilege log), which forms the basis of the current dispute over privilege.\r\n\r\n       Upon the special master's issuance of his reports on April 14 and 22, 2009,\r\nthe circuit judge issued an order on June 2, 2009, adopting the special master's\r\nfindings in toto, yet still permitting the parties to object to the findings and\r\nconclusions contained therein by the filing of a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or\r\namend the judgment. Both Appellants and Respondents filed timely Rule 59(e)\r\nmotions on June 11, 2009, and June 15, 2009, respectively. On July 6, 2009, the\r\ncircuit judge held a hearing on the motions.\r\n\r\n       By order dated July 28, 2009, entitled \"Order Amending Court's Order\r\nDated June 2, 2009\" (the Privilege Order), the circuit judge denied the Rule 59(e)\r\nmotions in part, granted the motions in part, and amended his order adopting the\r\nfindings and conclusion of the special master. Specifically, the court ordered\r\nAppellants to disclose 96 documents identified in their privilege log. The court\r\nfound 32 of the allegedly privileged documents were not privileged because they\r\nhad been disclosed to third parties, and the privilege had been waived with respect\r\nto the remaining 64 documents because, by filing suit, Appellants had placed the\r\nstatute of limitations at issue in this case. To date, Appellants have still not\r\ncomplied with the court's order.8\r\n\r\n       Due to Appellants' continued noncompliance with the court's discovery\r\norders, Respondents filed a motion for sanctions on July 24, 2009, for failure to\r\ncomply with the Discovery Order and on August 10, 2009, for failure to comply\r\nwith the Privilege Order. The circuit court held a hearing on Respondents' motions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 The circuit judge subsequently amended the order twice to increase the number of \n\r\ndocuments for the special master to review. \n\r\n8 Respondents were also ordered to produce certain documents previously deemed \n\r\nto be privileged, which they produced on August 3, 2009. \n\r\n\non August 24, 2009. At the hearing, Appellants represented to the court that they\r\nwere filing supplemental discovery responses that same day, and that their\r\nresponses would be in compliance with the courts orders.9 The court admonished\r\nAppellants that their non-compliance, coupled with the looming January 2010 trial\r\ndate in the Parkview case,10 could elicit the court's dismissal of the case: \"It's [the\r\nParkview case] going to be tried in January, whenever it's set for. If they don’t get\r\nthe discovery I'm going to throw the case out.\" In addition, the court noted that the\r\nmaterials were relevant to the statute of limitations issue and Appellants had not\r\nproduced a legitimate reason for not complying with the Discovery Order.11 At the\r\nhearing, counsel for Appellants stated their clients were weighing their options as\r\nto whether to appeal the court's rulings. Despite stating that he was strongly\r\nleaning towards dismissing the cases, the circuit court decided to hold\r\nRespondents' motion in abeyance pending Appellants' decision to appeal, which\r\nprovided Appellants with even more time to comply with the court's orders.12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9        [The Court:]        As an officer of the court you're telling me it's in\r\n                             full compliance with my order dealing with that\r\n                             area of discovery?\r\n\r\n         [Appellants'        Correct, your Honor, to the extent this stuff is\r\n         Counsel:]           information known to my clients. We've got it and\r\n                             it's being delivered.\r\n10 The circuit court had already continued the trial date in the Parkview case from\r\nits May 2009 trial date due to the ongoing discovery dispute.\r\n11 In fact, counsel for Appellants at one point went so far as to admit Appellants\r\ndid not want to disclose the discovery because it went to the statute of limitations\r\nissue:   [The Court:] \t      Mr. Bailey, you don’t like it [the Privilege Order]\r\n                             because it's opened up wide open the issue of the\r\n                             statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n         [Appellants'        That's certainly one reason, Judge.\r\n         Counsel:]\r\n12   The circuit court never placed this decision in writing.\r\n\n       Upon receipt of Appellants' supplemental responses, Respondents filed\r\nanother supplemental motion for sanctions on August 27, 2009, claiming that\r\nAppellants had still not complied with the Discovery Order. Due to Appellants'\r\nattempts to appeal the Privilege Order,13 the court did not hold a hearing on\r\nRespondents' supplemental motion to compel until January 14, 2010, at this point\r\nslightly over a week prior to the Parkview trial date. Appellants had still not\r\nprovided Respondents with the discovery information concerning their experts'\r\ntestimony. However, Appellants stated they were planning to provide the expert\r\ninformation on the day before trial. The court was not satisfied with this response:\r\n\"This case has been going on for seven years, a long time. And don’t hand me this\r\nabout getting an expert on Friday. This is not an expert-to-be-given-on-Friday\r\ncase.\" The court then addressed Appellants' continued noncompliance. One\r\nexcuse Appellants gave for their failure to disclose the expert information is that\r\nthey only had preliminary reports from the experts. Again, the court was not\r\nsatisfied with this answer: \"How can you not have a final opinion? . . . . [I]f you\r\nwanted to know what my expert's opinion was in a particular case, I would have to\r\ntell you. You would expect me to tell you. I expect you to tell them. I've ordered\r\nyou to tell them, and you refuse to do so.\"\r\n\r\n      On January 25, 2010, after the trial date in the Parkview case, Appellants\r\nserved Respondents with their Third Supplemental Responses, which again only\r\naddressed the Parkview case. Respondents again took issue with the adequacy of\r\nAppellants responses, especially as to the responses dealing with the substance of\r\nthe expert testimony.\r\n\r\n       On February 22, 2010, Appellants filed a motion for protective order. Under\r\nthe protective order, Appellants sought to submit the requested discovery under\r\nseal, conditioned upon the court allowing them to redact portions Appellants\r\nargued were privileged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13On September 10, 2009, Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal in the court of\r\nappeals. On December 2, 2009, the court of appeals dismissed Appellants' appeal\r\nas premature and issued remittitur on December 17, 2009. On November 19, 2009,\r\nthis Court denied Appellants' petition for writ of prohibition and certiorari after\r\nthey appealed the court's discovery rulings. In addition, on October 6, 2009,\r\nAppellants applied for entry into the Business Courts, which was also denied on\r\nNovember 3, 2009.\r\n\n       Around that time, Appellants began to question their lawyers concerning the\r\njudge's impartiality based on disclosures he made throughout the case concerning\r\nhis social relationships with counsel of record for Respondents and their family\r\nmembers. To substantiate these claims, Appellants sought additional discovery\r\nconcerning financial information from the judge and records from a resort on Fripp\r\nIsland, where the judge officiated in the wedding of Ann Ross Rosen, counsel of\r\nrecord for Respondents from 2007–09, to refute claims made by the judge\r\nconcerning his relationship with Rosen.\r\n\r\n       At a hearing (granted to discuss Appellants' discovery requests and\r\nprotective order) on March 29, 2010, the judge disclosed on the record his\r\nrelationships with Respondents' counsel. Appellants again attempted to argue the\r\nreasons the judge should vacate his prior discovery orders and presented reasons\r\nthe court should not sanction Appellants for failing to comply with these orders.\r\nFurthermore, counsel orally moved for the judge to recuse himself, which he\r\ndenied. The judge memorialized his verbal denial of the recusal motion and\r\nreasons in an ensuing order dated October 7, 2010 (the Recusal Order), wherein the\r\njudge again outlined his relationships with Respondents' counsel, and decided not\r\nto recuse himself, noting that despite the fact that Appellants were \"disappointed\r\nwith some of the rulings of the [c]ourt . . . . such disappointment cannot form the\r\nbasis for recusal.\"\r\n\r\n       Because Appellants still refused to comply with his orders, the court issued\r\nthe Dismissal Order on April 9, 2010, finding Appellants were in contempt of\r\ncourt. As sanctions for Appellants' continued \"willful\" noncompliance with his\r\ndiscovery rulings, the court dismissed all five cases with prejudice and found\r\nRespondents were entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in\r\nconnection with pursuing Appellants' compliance with the court's orders (to be\r\ndetermined at a later date). The court granted Appellants the opportunity to purge\r\nthe contempt by complying with the Discovery Order and the Privilege Order\r\nwithin 25 days of the date of the Dismissal Order.\r\n\r\n      On September 16, 2010, the circuit court denied Appellants' Rule 59(e)\r\nmotion to alter or amend the Dismissal Order. On October 25, 2010, the court\r\ndenied Appellant's motion for protective order, holding that it was in effect an\r\nuntimely Rule 59(e) motion disguised as a Rule 26(c) motion because it merely\r\nsough to amend the Privilege Order. On November 8, 2010, Appellants filed a\r\nRule 59(e) motion seeking to amend the court's order, claiming they were denied\r\n\ndue process because the court signed the proposed order submitted by\r\nRespondents, which the court denied.\r\n\r\n      Appellants served their Notice of Appeal on January 28, 2011, in the court\r\nof appeals. By order dated March 9, 2011, this Court certified these cases for\r\nreview pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.  ISSUES\r\n\r\n     I.\t    Whether the circuit judge erred in dismissing Appellants' claims \n\r\n            and requiring them to pay costs and attorney's fees to Respondents \n\r\n            as sanctions for Appellants' noncompliance with the court's \n\r\n            discovery rulings? \n\r\n\r\n     II.\t   Whether the circuit judge erred in refusing to recuse himself?\r\n\r\n                                       ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n     I.\t    Sanctions\r\n\r\n       Appellants contend the circuit court erred in making the various discovery\r\nrulings in this case.14 As a matter of procedure, we note that Appellants have only\r\nappealed the order awarding sanctions to Respondents, the Dismissal Order. As\r\nsuch, the merits of the underlying discovery orders, including the Privilege Order\r\nand the Discovery Order, are not before us for consideration.\r\n\r\n       Throughout the course of the litigation, the circuit court issued numerous\r\ndiscovery rulings. The Record makes clear that Appellants considered an appeal of\r\none or more of those orders, at one time even seeking review of the Privilege Order\r\nin the court of appeals, which was held to be interlocutory. However, to challenge\r\nthe specific rulings of the discovery orders, the normal course is to refuse to\r\n\r\n14 In addition to arguments concerning the Privilege Order, Appellants take issue\r\nwith circuit court orders relating to privilege and dated December 17, 2008; March\r\n3, 2009; June 2, 2009; June 16, 2009; July 28, 2009; April 6, 2010; September 16,\r\n2010; October 22, 2010; and December 11, 2010. Moreover, Appellants base their\r\nother discovery arguments on the Discovery Order, and other related discovery\r\norders issued by the circuit court and dated December 17, 2008; March 3, 2009;\r\nMarch 3, 2009 (granting in part, denying in part); and April 6, 2010.\r\n\ncomply, suffer contempt, and appeal from the contempt finding. See, e.g., Ex parte\r\nWhetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 347 S.E.2d 881–82 (1986) (\"An order directing a party to\r\nparticipate in discovery is interlocutory and not directly appealable . . . . Instead of\r\nappealing immediately, a non-party has two alternatives. He may either comply\r\nwith the discovery order and waive any right to challenge it on appeal, or refuse to\r\ncomply with the order and appeal after he is held in contempt for his failure to\r\ncomply.\") (internal citations omitted). Appellants did not follow that route here.\r\nRather, they continued along in the litigation, attempting to divert the\r\nimplementation of the court's rulings by providing incomplete responses and\r\ncausing delay through other tactics while they decided whether or not to surrender\r\nto the possibility of being held in contempt of court. However, during this time,\r\nAppellants continued to accept the circuit court's formulation of discovery. Right\r\nor wrong, these decisions form the law of the case, and Appellants are bound by\r\nthem now. ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte & Touche, 327 S.C. 238,\r\n241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997). Only after Respondents filed a motion for\r\nsanctions, and Appellants were found to be in contempt of court as part of those\r\nsanctions, did they appeal. While this was a final order for purposes of appellate\r\nreview, as it ordered dismissal of the case, the merits of the underlying discovery\r\norders are not before this Court on appeal. Thus, despite Appellants' vehement\r\nobjections to the Privilege Order and Discovery Order, the only reviewable\r\nquestion before this Court is whether the sanctions were properly awarded.15\r\n\r\n       \"The imposition of sanctions is generally entrusted to the sound discretion of\r\nthe Circuit Court.\" Downey v. Dixon, 294 S.C. 42, 45, 362 S.E.2d 317, 318 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1987). Therefore, an appellate court will not interfere with \"a trial court's\r\nexercise of its discretionary powers with respect to sanctions imposed in discovery\r\nmatters\" unless the court abuses its discretion. Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co.,\r\nInc., 327 S.C. 538, 542, 489 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 1997) (citation omitted).\r\n\"An 'abuse of discretion' may be found by this Court where the appellant shows\r\nthat the conclusion reached by the lower court was without reasonable factual\r\nsupport, resulted in prejudice to the right of appellant, and, therefore, amounted to\r\nan error of law.\" Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 502, 381 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15 While the parties certainly mention the Privilege Order and Discovery Order and\r\nthe various intermediate orders on which they are based in their brief, Appellants\r\nonly raise general issues with those orders. Without specific objections to each\r\nitem of discovery deemed discoverable by the circuit judge, the specific discovery\r\nfindings are unreviewable on appeal.\r\n\n(citation omitted). The appealing party bears the burden of demonstrating that the\r\nlower court abused its discretion. Id. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       Appellants argue the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding unduly\r\nharsh sanctions in this case. Specifically, Appellants contend the court abused its\r\ndiscretion by dismissing these cases under the facts, particularly because (1) less\r\n\"draconian\" punishments were available to the court; (2) Appellants agreed to\r\nreceive a less harsh sanction and \"took extraordinary steps to avoid dismissal\"; (3)\r\nthe judge consistently espoused Respondents' arguments as evidence constituting a\r\nfactual basis to support his decisions; and (4) the judge deviated from South\r\nCarolina law to effect dismissal.\r\n\r\n      Rule 37(b)(2)(C), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\n      If a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, . . .\r\n      the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in\r\n      regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:\r\n\r\n      ...    An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or\r\n             staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or\r\n             dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof,\r\n             or rendering a judgment by default against the\r\n             disobedient party.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"when the court orders default or dismissal, or the sanction itself results\r\nin default or dismissal, the end result is harsh medicine that should not be\r\nadministered lightly.\" Griffin Grading & Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg.\r\nCo., 334 S.C. 193, 198, 511 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Orlando v.\r\nBoyd, 320 S.C. 509, 466 S.E.2d 353 (1996)). Thus, \"[w]here the sanction would\r\nbe tantamount to granting a judgment by default, the moving party must show bad\r\nfaith, willful disobedience or gross indifference to its rights to justify the sanction.\"\r\nId. at 198–199, 511 S.E.2d at 718–19 (citing Baughman v. AT & T Co., 306 S.C.\r\n101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991)); see also Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 112, 495\r\nS.E.2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating when deciding the severity of sanctions\r\n\"for failure to disclose evidence during the discovery process, the trial court should\r\nweigh the nature of the interrogatories, the discovery posture of the case,\r\nwillfulness, and the degree of prejudice\") (citations omitted).\r\n\n       We disagree with Appellants' claim that the sanctions imposed here were\r\nunduly harsh. With respect to the discovery orders regarding privileged\r\ndocuments, the circuit court made every effort to ensure that no privileged\r\ndocuments were compelled, and Appellants refused to comply merely because\r\nthese rulings had adverse implications on their cases. We also note that the circuit\r\njudge provided Appellants ample opportunity to amend their discovery responses\r\nboth before and after he issued the Discovery Order, and Appellants willfully and\r\nrepeatedly failed to comply with the circuit court's orders in any meaningful way.\r\nThus, in our view, Appellants' failure to comply with the various orders of the\r\ncourt was willful and deliberate and caused unnecessary delay of this case and\r\nprejudice to Respondents. Accordingly, we hold the circuit court did not err in\r\nissuing the Dismissal Order as a sanction for Appellants' noncompliance with the\r\ncourt's orders.16\r\n\r\n     II.   Disqualification and Recusal\r\n\r\n       Appellants argue that the circuit judge was not legally qualified to accept or\r\nretain his assignment to preside over these cases at the time the cases were\r\nassigned to him. Specifically, Appellants contend that the judge violated his duty\r\nto fully disclose the full nature of his and his family's long-term relationships with\r\nRespondents' counsel, Ellis Johnston, and members of his family. Moreover,\r\nAppellants argue that the circuit judge violated his continuing duty to fully disclose\r\nadditional relationships between him and members of his family with Johnston and\r\nmembers of his family, which developed following his acceptance of the\r\nassignment of this case, and the full nature of his relationships with attorneys Anne\r\nRoss Rosen and Marvin Infinger after they became counsel of record for\r\nRespondents. Thus, Appellants contend, this Court should vacate the order\r\nassigning the circuit judge to preside over these cases, and reassign them to a fair\r\nand impartial judge. Appellants contend that because a judge must disqualify\r\nhimself and recusal motions are rare and unlikely to be overturned on appeal, an\r\natmosphere exists \"whereby, as in the present appeal, judges recognize the\r\nprobable outcome of a recusal request and take advantage of that reality, to the\r\nundeserving prejudice of litigants with legitimate grounds for recusal.\" We\r\ndisagree and find that the circuit judge was not disqualified from hearing this case\r\nand had no duty to recuse himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16We note that Appellants have the opportunity to purge the contempt by\r\ncomplying with the court's discovery rulings.\r\n\n        Pursuant to Canon 3(E)(1) of the Judicial Code of Conduct, \"[a] judge shall\r\ndisqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality\r\nmight reasonably be questioned . . . .\" Canon 3(E)(1), Rule 501, SCACR. The\r\njudicial canons provide direction as to when disqualification may be necessary,\r\nincluding but not limited to, instances where: (1) the judge holds personal bias or\r\nprejudice towards a litigant or counsel or has personal knowledge of evidentiary\r\nfacts in dispute in the proceeding; (2) the judge either worked on the case as a\r\nlawyer, a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law worked on the case\r\nwhile the judge was associated with the lawyer's firm, or the judge has been a\r\nmaterial witness concerning the case; (3) the judge \"knows\" that he or a member of\r\nhis family (spouse, parent, or child) has more than a de minimus economic interest\r\nin the litigation and the litigation will \"substantially affect[]\" that interest; or (4)\r\nthe judge or his spouse or a person within the third degree of relationship to them\r\n(or the spouse of such a person) is either a party or the officer, director, or trustee\r\nof a party, is a lawyer in the case, known to have more than a de minimus interest\r\nthat could be substantially affected by the litigation, or, to the judge's knowledge,\r\nis likely to be a material witness in the proceeding. Canon 3(E)(1)(a)–(d).\r\n\r\n       \"Under South Carolina law, if there is no evidence of judicial prejudice, a\r\njudge's failure to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal.\" Patel v. Patel,\r\n359 S.C. 515, 524, 599 S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004) (citation omitted); Simpson v.\r\nSimpson, 377 S.C. 519, 522, 660 S.E.2d 274, 276 (Ct. App. 2008); see also Ellis v.\r\nProcter & Gamble Distrib. Co., 315 S.C. 283, 285, 433 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1993)\r\n(\"In cases involving a violation of Canon 3, this Court will affirm a trial judge's\r\nfailure to disqualify himself only if there is no evidence of judicial prejudice.\")\r\n(citations omitted). Appellate courts \"accord great weight to the trial judge's\r\nassurance of his own impartiality.\" Id. It is the movant's responsibility to provide\r\nsome evidence of the existence of the judge's impartiality. Lyvers v. Lyvers, 280\r\nS.C. 361, 367, 312 S.E.2d 590, 594 (Ct. App. 1984) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n      At the hearing on Appellants' recusal motion on March 29, 2010, and in the\r\nensuing Recusal Order, the circuit judge revealed the following information\r\nconcerning his relationships with Respondents' counsel of record:\r\n\r\n     (1) Johnston's wife's ex-husband was a fraternity brother of the judge\r\n         40 years ago;\r\n\r\n     (2) Infinger spent the night at the judge's lake house 30 years ago after\r\n         both attended the wedding of another Haynsworth shareholder who\r\n\n         is not affiliated with this case;\r\n\r\n     (3) the judge's son and Johnston's son were fraternity brothers in\r\n         college 14 years ago, went to Europe together 13 years ago, and\r\n         have stayed in contact since then;\r\n\r\n     (4) the judge and his son accepted an invitation to go fishing with \n\r\n         Johnston's brother; \n\r\n\r\n     (5) the judge officiated at Rosen's wedding in 2007, and the Rosen\r\n         family provided him with accommodations at Fripp Island for the\r\n         wedding;17\r\n\r\n     (6) Rosen's father, a surgeon, performed a medical procedure on the\r\n         judge;\r\n\r\n     (7) Rosen's parents once lived in Bamberg, South Carolina, but the\r\n         judge did not see them socially; and\r\n\r\n     (8) the judge has been a member of a social club that holds an annual\r\n        white tie dance for approximately ten years, and in 2009, Johnston\r\n        was invited to join the club.18\r\n\r\n       The court found that the mere fact that Appellants were \"disappointed with\r\nsome of the rulings of the [c]ourt . . . . such disappointment cannot form the basis\r\nfor recusal.\" Moreover, the court stated:\r\n\r\n      Plaintiffs have no evidence proving bias or prejudice against them or\r\n      for the Defendants. Instead, they argue that the [c]ourt ruled against\r\n      them on several motions without basis in law or fact, and reason that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n As stated, supra, Appellants subpoenaed the Fripp Island resort where the\r\nwedding was held to determine the length of the judge's stay.\r\n18 The judge disclosed his relationship with Rosen and that he had been on the\r\nfishing trip with Johnston's brother when the case was assigned to him. He\r\ndisclosed his son's relationship with Johnston's son via conference call on February\r\n13, 2008.\r\n\n      the [c]ourt's relationship with [d]efense counsel is the sole cause of\r\n      these rulings. Their Motion for Recusal is made without basis or\r\n      justification, with the sole purpose of polluting the record and\r\n      intimidating me into recusal. I refuse to comply. I have addressed this\r\n      issue repeatedly, openly, and unabashedly, and though Plaintiffs\r\n      continue to harass and prod me to recuse myself, the law does not\r\n      justify said action, and thus I refuse to do so.\r\n\r\n             This litigation is now over five years old. Many, many hours\r\n      have been devoted by the judiciary and court personnel in getting this\r\n      case ready to try and both sides [] have incurred substantial attorney's\r\n      fees. To start a new [sic], absent any bias or prejudice, would be a\r\n      colossal waste of time, effort[,] and expense.\r\n\r\n             If I thought for one moment my prior involvement with any of\r\n      the lawyers had an influence on any of my decisions, I would step\r\n      aside. I practiced law for thirty years, attended school in South\r\n      Carolina, have been active in social, civic, family and bar\r\n      organizations, clubs and events all of my adult life and thankfully\r\n      have formed many types of relationships with many people, a lot who\r\n      are lawyers who practice in my court on an everyday basis. I am\r\n      cognizant of these relationships, but if I recused myself when that\r\n      happened, I could not hold court.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the court denied Appellants' motion for recusal.19\r\n\r\n       None of the disqualification situations outlined by Canon 3(E) were present\r\nhere. Rather, Appellants' allegations concern mere social relationships between the\r\ncircuit judge or his family members and Respondents' counsel of record or their\r\nfamily members. Some of these relationships, such as Rosen's father's physician-\r\npatient relationship with the judge, are tenuous. Thus, we find that, under the\r\n\r\n19 At the March 29, 2010, hearing, the judge revealed that he has known\r\nAppellants' attorney, Joel Bailey, for 36 years and they have \"shared a lot of social\r\ntime together over the years.\" Furthermore, the judge stated on the record he\r\n\"maintained what I considered to be a very cordial social relationship\" with\r\nAppellants' counsel, Thomas Pendarvis. Both of the judge's sons worked with\r\nPendarvis at another law firm while they were in school, and both maintained\r\nfriendships with him.\r\n\nRules, the circuit judge was not required to disclose any of these relationships with\r\ncounsel, nor recuse himself. See Commentary, Canon 3(E) (\"A judge should\r\ndisclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their\r\nlawyers might consider relevant to the question of disqualification, even if the\r\njudge believes there is no real basis for disqualification.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       If anything, the judge's decision to disclose these relationships during the\r\ncourse of the litigation demonstrates his sensitivity to assuaging any concerns\r\nabout his impartiality. See Simpson, 377 S.C. at 525, 660 S.E.2d at 277 (finding\r\nthe judge's \"remarks about her concern for not disclosing the information at the\r\nbeginning of the hearing do not show any bias or prejudice but instead show her\r\nsensitivity to any apprehension each side might have in her ability to make a fair\r\nand impartial ruling in the case\"); Doe v. Howe, 367 S.C. 432, 441, 626 S.E.2d 25,\r\n29 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"Because Doe made no showing of actual prejudice, we find\r\nno abuse of discretion in the trial judge's refusal to disqualify himself. If anything,\r\nthe trial judge demonstrated sensitivity toward any concerns Doe might have had\r\nregarding his impartiality by voluntarily making full disclosure of his and his law\r\nclerk's contacts with Howe and Howe's counsel.\"). Furthermore, if friendship or\r\nsocial interactions became the standard for disqualification, then as the judge stated\r\nin the Recusal Order, members of the judiciary would rarely be able to hold court\r\nin this state.20 Obviously, there could be circumstances where an extremely close\r\nfriendship could rise to the level of disqualification, as the Canons do not limit\r\ndisqualification to the scenarios listed under Canon 3(E)(1). However, under the\r\nfacts of this case, the relationships and interactions that occurred in this lawsuit did\r\nnot require the judge's recusal.\r\n\r\n       Importantly, Appellants have also failed to prove that they suffered any\r\nprejudice as a result of the judge's refusal to recuse himself in this case. Other than\r\nadverse rulings, Appellants have not presented any evidence of prejudice or bias\r\nagainst them. See Mortg. Elec. Sys., Inc. v. White, 384 S.C. 606, 616, 682 S.E.2d\r\n498, 503 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"The fact [that] a trial judge ultimately rules against a\r\nlitigant is not proof of prejudice by the judge, even if it is later held the judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20As the judge stated at the hearing on the matter, \"[F]rom day one, because I had\r\n30 years of practice practically every lawyer that come[s] before me . . . I have\r\nsocialized with, I have been friends with . . . and I have never ever allowed any\r\npersonal friendships, past acquaintances, children's relationships with other\r\npeople's children to influence anything that I've done.\"\r\n\ncommitted errors in his rulings.\") (citation omitted). Mere conjecture cannot\r\nsupport a recusal motion. See 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judges § 208 (1994) (\"Allegations of\r\nfacts that are merely frivolous or fanciful will not support a motion to disqualify on\r\nthe ground of prejudice, nor will conclusory statements, conjecture, or innuendo be\r\nsufficient to support a motion for disqualification.\"). If anything, the trial judge\r\nbent over backwards to provide Appellants an opportunity to be heard, from\r\ndenying Respondents' motion for summary judgment early in the case, to providing\r\nAppellants numerous opportunities to cure their noncompliance and allowing for\r\nnumerous hearings on discovery matters.\r\n\r\n       In addition, the Record supports all of the court's orders in this case,\r\nincluding the Discovery Order and the Privilege Order. See Burgess v. Stern, 311\r\nS.C. 326, 331, 428 S.E.2d 880, 884 (1993) (finding \"an objective view of the\r\nrecord and circumstances surrounding the convoluted proceedings in [that] case\r\nlead[] to the conclusion that [the judge's order], and the ensuing orders [were]\r\nsupported by the evidence\" and concluding that no prejudice arose from the alleged\r\nimpartial acts); Ellis, 315 S.C. at 285, 433 S.E.2d at 857 (finding a judge's\r\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned \"when his factual findings are not\r\nsupported by the record\" and holding that the judge's factual findings in that case\r\nwere not supported by the record). Thus, Appellants have not proven they suffered\r\nany prejudice from the judge's alleged bias again them.\r\n\r\n       Finally, the timeliness of the motion is questionable. See Duplan Corp. v.\r\nMilliken, 400 F. Supp. 497, 510 (D.S.C. 1975) (\"Timeliness is essential to any\r\nrecusal motion. To be timely, a recusal motion must be made at counsel's first\r\nopportunity after discovery of the disqualifying facts.\").The Appellants were well-\r\naware that the judge planned to issue the Dismissal Order when they raised their\r\nconcerns regarding the judge's impartiality and moved for recusal on the eve of the\r\nDismissal Order, nearly two years after the judge disclosed the bulk of these\r\nrelationships. Therefore, the recusal motion appears to be nothing more than a\r\nlast-ditch effort to delay the Court's filing of that order. Thus, we also find\r\nAppellants' motion for recusal untimely.\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we hold that the judge was not required to recuse\r\nhimself under the circumstances. Furthermore, the frivolous nature and\r\nquestionable timing of this motion only serve to lend further support to the\r\nsanctions imposed in the Dismissal Order.21\r\n\r\n21   Appellants further argue the circuit court erred in failing to ensure that\r\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       In conclusion, we make clear that we do not hold Appellants' able,\r\ncompetent, and experienced counsel at fault for Appellants' discovery abuses.\r\nAppellants' counsel diligently and professionally pursued these claims on behalf of\r\ntheir clients. Unfortunately, Appellants have brought about the dismissal of their\r\nclaims by their continued refusal to comply with the court's orders, and they have\r\nonly themselves to blame for this harsh result.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court's dismissal\r\nof this case and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellants received a fair and impartial forum in which to litigate their claims,\r\nthereby depriving them of their right to due process of law under the United States\r\nand South Carolina constitutions. Because this issue is tied to whether or not the\r\ncourt erred in refusing to recuse himself and we find that he did not, we need not\r\nreach this issue. See Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co.,\r\n382 S.C. 295, 307, 676 S.E.2d 700, 706 (2009) (appellate court need not discuss\r\nremaining issues when determination of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in part and dissent in part. I concur in\r\nthe majority's affirmance of the recusal ruling but dissent from its affirmance\r\nof the contempt/sanctions issue. In my view, this appeal requires we review\r\nthe merits of the Privilege Order as well as the Dismissal Order. As\r\nexplained below, I find the Privilege Order is affected by an error of law and\r\nwould reverse the Dismissal Order's contempt findings related to that order.\r\nFurther, I would hold the findings of fact cited in the Dismissal Order in\r\nsupport of the conclusion that appellants were in contempt of the Discovery\r\nOrder are woefully inadequate and would therefore reverse that contempt\r\nholding. Finally, I would reverse the Dismissal Order's sanctions as the\r\ncontempt findings cannot stand.\r\nI begin with the majority's erroneous limitation of the scope of appellant's\r\nappeal. The Dismissal Order begins:\r\n            This matter comes before the Court on [Respondents'] two\r\n            Motions for Sanction . . . For the reasons set forth below,\r\n            the Court grants [Respondents'] motions. The Court finds\r\n            and hereby declares that [Appellants] are in contempt of\r\n            court as a result of their willful failure to comply with the\r\n            Court's order dated July 28, 2009 [the Privilege Order] and\r\n            dismiss each of the above captioned actions with prejudice\r\n            as sanctions for such contempt . . . The Court further finds\r\n            and declares that [Appellants] are in contempt of court for\r\n            the separate and additional reason that they have willfully\r\n            disobeyed the Court's Order dated March 3, 2009 [the\r\n            Discovery Order].\r\nIt is well-settled that a party22 can obtain review of the merits of a discovery\r\norder only after refusing to comply and being held in contempt. On appeal\r\nfrom the contempt order, the contemnor may argue that the contempt finding\r\nmust be reversed because the underlying discovery order was itself improper.\r\nE.g. Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 377 S.C. 12, 659 S.E.2d 112 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I note the majority cites the non-party discovery appeal rule from Ex parte\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nWhetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 347 S.E.2d 881 (1986).\r\n\nThe majority acknowledges that appellants have done exactly what is\r\nrequired of them but concludes that our review is somehow limited. I quote\r\nfrom the majority's opinion:\r\n            Throughout the course of the litigation, the circuit court\r\n            issued numerous discovery rulings . . . [T]o challenge the\r\n            specific rulings of the discovery orders, the normal course\r\n            is to refuse to comply, suffer contempt, and appeal from the\r\n            contempt finding . . . Only after Respondents filed a motion\r\n            for sanctions and Appellants were found to be in contempt\r\n            of court as part of those sanctions, did they appeal. While\r\n            this was a final order for purposes of appellate review, as it\r\n            ordered dismissal of the case [sic], the merits of the\r\n            underlying discovery orders are not before this Court on\r\n            appeal.\r\nThe majority is simply wrong to hold that appellants are now foreclosed from\r\narguing that the discovery orders upon which the Dismissal Order's contempt\r\nfindings and sanctions rest were erroneous. Further, I disagree with the\r\nmajority's representation that appellants have only raised a general challenge\r\nto the Privilege and Discovery Orders. See fn. 15, supra. Each of the five\r\nappellants' briefs argue the merits of the Privilege Order and the Discovery\r\nOrder. In each brief, the argument regarding the flaws in the Privilege Order\r\nbegins on page 12, and of those in the Discovery Order begins on page 27.\r\nAppellants' ability to challenge the specifics of the Discovery Order is limited\r\nby the circuit court's inadequate factual findings.\r\nI fundamentally disagree with the majority's decision to limit its review of\r\nthese consolidated appeals.\r\nA. Privilege Order\r\nAppellants contend, and I agree, that the circuit court erred in finding them in\r\ncontempt for violating the Privilege Order. The Privilege Order was largely\r\npredicated on the circuit court's determination that appellants had waived\r\ntheir attorney-client privilege, applying the test for waiver derived from\r\nHearn v. Rhay, 68 F.R.D. 574 (E.D. Wash. 1975). The circuit court found\r\nthe statute of limitations \"was a major issue in this case\" and held that by\r\n\nputting the statute in issue, appellants \"implicitly waived their claims of\r\nprivilege with respect to documents dated (i.e. created) more than three years\r\nprior to the filing of this lawsuit.\"\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in adopting the Hearn \"at-issue\"\r\nwaiver theory in the Privilege Order and that this error requires that we\r\nreverse the contempt findings that are based on Hearn as well as the\r\nsanctions in the Dismissal Order. I agree.\r\nIn my view, the circuit court erred in adopting the Hearn at-issue waiver test\r\nbecause this test substantially diminishes the attorney-client privilege without\r\nregard to the important public interests that privilege is designed to advance.\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized the attorney-client privilege. See, e.g.,\r\nClary\r\nv. Blackwell, 160 S.C. 142, 149, 158 S.E. 223, 226 (1931). The privilege is\r\ngrounded    upon a wise public policy that considers that the interests of\r\n            society are best promoted by inviting the utmost confidence\r\n            on the part of the client in disclosing his secrets to his\r\n            professional advisor, under the pledge of the law that such\r\n            confidence shall not be abused by permitting disclosure of\r\n            such communications.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Highway Dept. v. Booker, 260 S.C. 245, 254, 195 S.E.2 615,\r\n619-\r\n20 (1973); see also State v. James, 34 S.C. 49, 57, 12 S.E. 657, 660 (1891)\r\n(\"[T]he rule of evidence which holds as inviolable professional\r\ncommunications between attorney and client is one of the most important,\r\nand in all forms must be maintained in all its integrity.\"). The attorney-client\r\nprivilege is not absolute, rather, its traditional contours balance competing\r\npublic interests. For example, courts have traditionally held it does not\r\nextend to communications in furtherance of criminal, tortious, or fraudulent\r\n\nconduct. Ross v. Medical University of South Carolina, 317 S.C. 377, 384,\r\n453 S.E.2d 880, 884-85 (1994).\r\nWhile the client may waive the privilege, Drayton v. Industrial Life & Health\r\nIns., 205 S.C. 98, 108, 31 S.E.2d 148, 152 (1944), the rule in South Carolina\r\nhas been that such a \"waiver must be distinct and unequivocal[,]\" and we\r\nhave held that a claim of implied waiver should be treated with caution. State\r\nv. Thompson, 329 S.C. 72, 76-77, 495 S.E.2d 437, 439 (1998).\r\nNotwithstanding that caution must be exercised in finding waiver, it is widely\r\nrecognized that a client impliedly waives the privilege when he relies on\r\nconfidential communications with his attorney to make out a claim or\r\ndefense. See Savino v. Luciano, 92 So.2d 817, 819 (Fla. 1957) (\"[W]hen a\r\nparty has filed a claim, based upon a matter ordinarily privileged, the proof of\r\nwhich will necessarily require that the privileged matter be offered in\r\nevidence, we think that he has waived his right to insist . . . that the matter is\r\nprivileged.\"); Pennsylvania v. Harris, 32 A.3d 243 (Pa. 2011) (\"In-issue\r\nwaiver occurs when the privilege-holder asserts a claim or defense, and\r\nattempts to prove that claim or defense by reference to the otherwise\r\nprivileged material.\"); see also, e.g., Sedco Int'l S.A. v. Cory, 683 F.2d 1201,\r\n1206 (8th Cir. 1982) (courts find waiver by implication when a client testifies\r\nabout the attorney-client communication, places the attorney-client\r\nrelationship at issue, or cites the attorney's advice as part of a claim or\r\ndefense). Hearn alters this traditional implied waiver standard.\r\nHearn summarized the factors common to the exceptions to the rule of\r\nprivilege as(1) assertion of the privilege was a result of some\r\n            affirmative act, such as filing suit, by the asserting party;\r\n            (2) through this affirmative act, the asserting party put the\r\n            protected information at issue by making it relevant to the\r\n            case; and (3) application of the privilege would have denied\r\n            the opposing party access to information vital to his\r\n            defense.\r\n68 F.R.D. at 581. This statement of the factors for finding implied waiver\r\ndramatically expands the traditional rule. Because the existence of privilege\r\nfor attorney-client communications has significance only when the\r\n\ninformation sought to be protected is relevant to a case, and when the\r\nopposing party believes access to the information is vital to his defense,\r\nfactors two and three operate merely to limit waiver of the privilege to the\r\nmost sensitive of the client's communications.\r\nThe first factor of the Hearn test requires that assertion of the privilege be the\r\nresult of an affirmative act on the part of the person asserting the privilege,\r\nsuch as by filing suit. As used by the Hearn court and as applied by the\r\ncircuit court in this case, this factor expands the circumstances in which a\r\nparty impliedly waives his attorney-client privilege. Rather than being\r\nlimited to situations in which the client inserts the privileged communications\r\ninto the controversy, waiver is expanded to situations in which the client\r\nraises any issue to which the privileged communications are relevant. As\r\nexplained below, Hearn has been rejected by most courts and many\r\ncommentators.\r\nAdoption of the Hearn test virtually eliminates attorney-client privilege in a\r\nwide range of cases without taking into account the public policy on which\r\nattorney-client privilege is grounded or that the well-settled contours of the\r\nattorney-client privilege already balance the competing public interests. See,\r\ne.g., In re County of Erie, 546 F.3d 222, 227-29 (2d Cir. 2008) discussing\r\nHearn and its critics, rejecting the Hearn test, and holding that when good\r\nfaith is asserted as a defense, waiver is implied only when the client relies on\r\nprivileged advice to establish good faith); Kevin Bennardo, At Issue Waiver\r\nof the Attorney-Client Privilege in Illinois: An Exception in Need of a\r\nStandard, 30 N. Ill. U. L. Rev. 553, 561 (2010) (\"By focusing on relevancy\r\nand fairness, the Hearn test seeks to remedy the 'problem' caused by the truth-\r\nsuppressing effect of the attorney-client privilege. The anticipatory waiver\r\ntest, on the other hand, seeks to address the problem created by one party\r\nselectively relying on a privileged communication while attempting to shield\r\nother privileged communications--thereby 'garbling' the truth. It is only in\r\nthis 'truth-garbling' scenario, rather than the truth-suppressing scenario (a\r\nscenario inherent in all privileges), that waiver of the privilege should be\r\nfound.\" (internal footnote omitted)); Note, Developments in the Law:\r\nPrivileged Communications, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450, 1641-42 (1985) (Hearn\r\nconcept of unfairness refers to incompleteness of evidence rather than\r\n\ntraditional concept in privilege context of unfairness as abuse of a privilege;\r\nlogic of Hearn leads to \"outrageous\" results).23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23 For additional criticism of Hearn and its progeny, see Remington Arms Co.\r\nv. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 142 F.R.D. 408, 413 (D. Del. 1992) (\"The core\r\nproblem,\r\naccording to this line of reasoning [criticizing Hearn], is that expansive\r\nlanguage\r\nfor determining implied waiver leads to a type of ad hoc determination that\r\nignores the system-wide role of the attorney-client privilege and undermines\r\nany confidence that parties can place in that privilege. These authorities\r\ncontend that extremely liberal waiver rules increase litigation costs and\r\njudicial time spent on discovery disputes, favor the wealthiest litigants,\r\nundermine the values served by the privilege rules, and vary according to the\r\nidentity of the litigants and their purported need for privileged information.\"\r\n(internal citations omitted)); Trustees of Elec.

Cal. 1987); and Smith v.\r\nKavanaugh, Pierson & Talley, 513 So.2d 1138 (La. 1987).\r\n\nMoreover, particularly in the context of a statute of limitations defense,\r\nadoption of the Hearn test produces the result that\r\n            [i]n virtually every case in which the statute of limitations .\r\n            . . is pleaded as a defense and the client relies on the\r\n            discovery rule to overcome the limitation period, the\r\n            opposing party would be able to inquire of the client's\r\n            counsel: Did your client tell you anything in confidence\r\n            about what he or she knew that differs from or contradicts\r\n            what he or she stated in responses to discovery?\r\nDarius v. City of Boston, 741 N.E.2d 52, 57 (Mass. 2001). I agree with the\r\nDarius court that \"[t]o permit that kind of inquiry would pry open the\r\nattorney-client relationship and strike at the very core of the privilege.\" Id. at\r\n56-57.\r\nBecause in my view the Hearn at-issue waiver rule sweeps far too broadly,\r\neviscerating the attorney-client privilege without regard to the weighty public\r\ninterest it serves, the circuit court erred in adopting it in the Privilege Order.\r\nThe circuit court ordered appellants to produce documents that would have\r\nbeen privileged but for the court's application of the Hearn at-issue test. It\r\nfound that appellants had waived attorney-client and \"any otherwise\r\napplicable privilege\" in documents created more than three years before the\r\nlawsuit was filed that contained appellants' litigation and trial strategies\r\n\"through their actions (e.g. the allegations in the . . . Complaints).\" The\r\ncircuit court's determination in the Dismissal Order that appellants were\r\ncontumacious in refusing to produce these documents and that the sanctions\r\nof dismissal and attorneys' fees were appropriate depended in part on its\r\ndetermination that appellants had waived all privileges in these documents\r\nmerely by filing suit. Because the circuit court's ruling was based on an error\r\nof law, i.e. Hearn, I would reverse and remand for the circuit court to\r\nconsider whether appellants' other violations of the Privilege Order warrant a\r\nfinding of contempt. This remand necessarily requires reconsideration of the\r\nscope of any sanctions.\r\nB. Discovery Order\r\n\nAppellants also contend they should not have been found in contempt and\r\nsanctioned for violations of the Discovery Order. I agree with appellants that\r\nthe flaws in the Dismissal Order finding appellants in violation of the\r\nDiscovery Order require we reverse the Dismissal Order on this ground as\r\nwell.\r\nI agree with appellants that the trial judge's specifications of deficiencies in\r\ntheir compliance with the Discovery Order are simply too vague, and rely too\r\nheavily on mere references to memoranda prepared by respondents' counsel,24\r\nto support the finding of contempt. Moreover, the decision to dismiss the\r\ncases and impose other sanctions for noncompliance with discovery \"should\r\nbe imposed only in cases involving bad faith, willful disobedience, or gross\r\nindifference to the opposing party's rights.\" McNair v. Fairfield Cty., 379\r\nS.C. 462, 466, 665 S.E.2d 830, 832 (Ct. App. 2008) (internal citations\r\nomitted). Here, the circuit court's findings that appellants' conduct rose to\r\nthis level are inexorably tied to its findings regarding disobedience of the\r\nwrongfully decided Privilege Order.\r\nI would reverse the Dismissal Order and remand, but affirm the recusal ruling\r\nas I find no evidence of judicial prejudice in this record. State v. Howard,\r\n384 S.C. 212, 682 S.E.2d 42 (Ct. App. 2009). It is patent that these cases\r\nhave been pending far too long, and that appellants share in the responsibility\r\nfor the delay. I am optimistic that the parties and trial judge will work\r\ndiligently to bring these cases to speedy and appropriate resolutions upon\r\nremand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Each of the five findings of contempt in the Dismissal Order is supported only by\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\ncitation to a memorandum prepared by respondents.

Based on this call, Deputy Clark removed Appellant, a sixteen-year-\r\nold student at the school, from a classroom and took him to a secure area to\r\nquestion him regarding his alleged possession of a weapon. Appellant admitted\r\nthat he had a pocketknife in his sock. Deputy Clark then searched Appellant and\r\nfound a pocketknife with a three-inch retractable blade.\r\n\r\n       On October 24, 2011, Deputy Clark filed a juvenile petition in Richland\r\nCounty family court, alleging Appellant was a delinquent for carrying a weapon on\r\nschool grounds. The Honorable Robert E. Newton held an adjudicatory hearing on\r\nJuly 24, 2012. At the beginning of the hearing, Appellant's counsel moved for a\r\njury trial on the ground Appellant was entitled to have a jury adjudicate his case\r\nbased on the federal and state constitutions. Judge Newton denied Appellant's\r\nmotion and proceeded with the bench trial. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge\r\nNewton adjudicated Appellant to be delinquent for possessing a weapon on school\r\ngrounds. Because Appellant was currently being evaluated at the Midlands\r\nEvaluation Center, Judge Newton delayed sentencing until the evaluation was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n      On August 1, 2012, the Honorable Gwendlyne Y. Smalls held a hearing and\r\nultimately sentenced Appellant to an indeterminate period of time not to exceed his\r\ntwenty-first birthday. She then suspended the sentence and placed Appellant on\r\nprobation, subject to certain conditions, until his eighteenth birthday. Appellant\r\nappealed to the Court of Appeals. This Court certified the case pursuant to Rule\r\n204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\n\n                                     II.   Discussion\r\n\r\nA.      Arguments\r\n\r\n        1.     Appellant\r\n\r\n        Appellant contends section 63-3-590 of the South Carolina Code,4 which\r\nprovides in part that \"[a]ll cases of children must be dealt with as separate hearings\r\nby the court and without a jury,\" violates the clear mandate of the South Carolina\r\nConstitution that \"any person\" charged with an \"offense\" shall be entitled to a jury\r\ntrial. In support of this contention, Appellant asserts a juvenile is guaranteed the\r\nright to a jury trial because (1) a \"child\" is a \"person\" as defined throughout the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4    Section 63-3-590 provides in full:\r\n\r\n        All cases of children must be dealt with as separate hearings by the\r\n        court and without a jury. The hearings must be conducted in a formal\r\n        manner and may be adjourned from time to time. The general public\r\n        must be excluded and only persons the judge finds to have a direct\r\n        interest in the case or in the work of the court may be admitted. The\r\n        presence of the child in court may be waived by the court at any stage\r\n        of the proceedings. Hearings may be held at any time or place within\r\n        the county designated by the judge. In any case where the\r\n        delinquency proceedings may result in commitment to an institution\r\n        in which the child's freedom is curtailed, the privilege against self-\r\n        incrimination and the right of cross-examination must be preserved.\r\n        In all cases where required by law, the child must be accorded all\r\n        rights enjoyed by adults, and where not required by law the child must\r\n        be accorded adult rights consistent with the best interests of the child.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-590 (2010) (emphasis added); see Rule 9(a), SCRFC (\"All\r\nhearings in the family courts shall be conducted by the court without a jury.\r\nHearings shall be conducted in a judicial atmosphere, with the judge wearing a\r\nblack judicial robe.\").\r\n\nSouth Carolina Code,5 and (2) a juvenile petition charges a child with an\r\n\"offense.\"6\r\n       As to the United States Constitution, Appellant acknowledges the United\r\nStates Supreme Court's decision in McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528\r\n(1971), in which a plurality of the Court determined that juveniles are not\r\nconstitutionally entitled to a jury trial in adjudication proceedings. However,\r\nAppellant challenges the propriety of McKeiver because \"[i]n the forty years since\r\nMcKeiver, the purposes and consequences of delinquency proceedings have\r\nchanged.\" Specifically, Appellant asserts the South Carolina juvenile justice\r\nsystem is now much like the adult criminal justice system as the focus is\r\npunishment of the juvenile offender rather than rehabilitation. For example,\r\nAppellant notes that juveniles, who are adjudicated delinquent for enumerated sex\r\noffenses, must register for life as sex offenders.7 Thus, Appellant maintains that\r\n\r\n5 See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 63-1-40(1) (2010) (generally defining \"child\" as a\r\n\"person under the age of eighteen\" in the context of the South Carolina Children's\r\nCode); id. § 63-19-20(1) (defining \"child\" or \"juvenile\" to mean \"a person less than\r\nseventeen years of age\" in the context of the South Carolina Juvenile Justice\r\nCode).\r\n6 See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-360(4) (2010) (providing for juvenile\r\ndetention services for \"juveniles charged with having committed a criminal offense\r\nwho are found, after a detention screening or detention hearing, to require\r\ndetention or placement outside the home pending an adjudication of delinquency or\r\ndispositional hearing\"); id. § 63-19-810(B)(1) (requiring officer who takes a child\r\ninto custody for violating a criminal law or ordinance to include in his or her report\r\n\"the facts of the offense\").\r\n7 See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(A) (2007) (stating, in part, \"Any person,\r\nregardless of age, residing in the State of South Carolina who in this State has\r\nbeen convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, pled guilty or nolo contendere to an\r\noffense described below, or who has been convicted, adjudicated delinquent, pled\r\nguilty or nolo contendere, or found not guilty by reason of insanity in any\r\ncomparable court in the United States, or a foreign country, or who has been\r\nconvicted, adjudicated delinquent, pled guilty or nolo contendere, or found not\r\nguilty by reason of insanity in the United States federal courts of a similar offense,\r\nor who has been convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, pled guilty or nolo\r\ncontendere, or found not guilty by reason of insanity to an offense for which the\r\nperson was required to register in the state where the conviction or plea occurred,\r\nshall be required to register pursuant to the provisions of this article\" (emphasis\r\n\n\"[l]ittle distinguishes delinquency proceedings from criminal prosecutions except\r\nthe absence of a jury.\"\r\n        2.      Amici Curiae\r\n\r\n       An amicus brief was filed on behalf of the South Carolina Association for\r\nJustice, the South Carolina Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the\r\nLawyers Committee for Children's Rights. In this brief, the Amici Curiae reiterate\r\nAppellant's arguments that a juvenile should be \"allowed to demand\" a trial by jury\r\nin family court because: (1) a juvenile was entitled to a jury trial at the time of the\r\nadoption of the South Carolina Constitution in 1868;8 and (2) a \"child\" is a\r\n\"person\" as defined throughout the South Carolina Code and a juvenile petition\r\ncharges a child with an \"offense.\"\r\n\r\n       The Amici Curiae supplement Appellant's arguments with policy\r\nconsiderations that were raised during the oral argument of Stephen W. Initially,\r\nthey contend the availability of a trial by jury for a juvenile will \"result in more\r\nreliable verdicts\" because there are several deficiencies in family court bench trials.\r\nSpecifically, they claim juvenile adjudications are not always accurate or reliable\r\nbecause a family court judge, who is the sole fact-finder, may: (1) be inclined to\r\nfind guilt due to his or her \"professional bias\" that \"fault must be found and the\r\nyoungster punished\"; (2) apply an erroneous legal standard in determining whether\r\nan offense was committed; and (3) reach \"erroneous conclusions based on\r\ninsufficient evidence.\" Given the significant collateral consequences a juvenile\r\nfaces as the result of an adjudication of guilt, they maintain a jury trial is necessary\r\nto ensure accuracy in fact-finding and to create a complete record for appellate\r\nreview. Although the Amici Curiae concede there would need to be certain\r\nprocedural and logistical changes to accommodate a juvenile's request for a jury\r\ntrial, they assert these changes are not insurmountable as evidenced by the states\r\n\r\nadded)); id. § 23-3-490(D)(1) (Supp. 2013) (providing for public disclosure of the\r\nidentity of juvenile offenders who have been adjudicated delinquent for\r\nenumerated sex offenses).\r\n8 See Verenes v. Alvanos, 387 S.C. 11, 15, 690 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2010) (\"The right\r\nto trial by jury is guaranteed in every case in which the right to a jury was secured\r\nat the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1868.\" (quoting Mims Amusement\r\nCo. v. S.C. Law Enforcement Div., 366 S.C. 141, 149, 621 S.E.2d 344, 348\r\n(2005))).\r\n\nthat currently provide jury trials for adjudication proceedings.9 For several\r\nreasons, they believe South Carolina family courts could join these jurisdictions\r\nwith minimal disruption to the state's court system. They contend there would be\r\nfew jury trials conducted as contested adjudications occur infrequently. In\r\naddition, they state the venue for conducting these trials \"should be relatively\r\nsimple\" as the family court in each judicial circuit has access to a courtroom, either\r\nin circuit court or magistrate's court, which contains a jury box. Finally, they posit\r\nthat assembling a venire for jury selection would not be difficult as the clerks of\r\ncourt throughout the state routinely summon jurors for jury duty in Common Pleas\r\nor General Sessions. Thus, jurors could be selected from these jury pools to serve\r\non family court jury trials.\r\n\r\nB.    Analysis\r\n\r\n      1.     Implication of In the Interest of Stephen W.\r\n\r\n        Recently, this Court held that neither the federal nor the state constitution\r\nrequires a jury trial in juvenile adjudication proceedings. In re Stephen W., Op.\r\nNo. 27413 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 16, 2014) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 28 at 29).\r\nAs noted in Stephen W., the United States Supreme Court's decision in McKeiver\r\ndefinitively resolves Appellant's argument with respect to the federal constitution.\r\nId. at 31. Moreover, \"[m]ost jurisdictions that have dealt with the issue of the\r\ncontinued viability of McKeiver have determined that it is still settled law; that is,\r\njury trials in juvenile proceedings may be provided if a State chooses to do so, but\r\nit is not a mandated right required by concerns of fundamental fairness under the\r\nFederal Constitution.\" In the Interest of A. C., 43 A.3d 454, 461 (N.J. Sup. Ct.\r\n2012) (emphasis added). See generally B. Finberg, Annotation, Right to Jury Trial\r\nin Juvenile Delinquency Proceedings, 100 A.L.R.2d 1241, § 2[a] (1965 & Supp.\r\n2014) (collecting state and federal cases discussing whether a juvenile is entitled to\r\na jury trial in juvenile court proceedings; recognizing that \"the individual charged\r\nwith being a delinquent has no right, under the pertinent state or federal\r\nconstitution, to demand that the issue of his delinquency be determined by a jury\").\r\n\r\n\r\n9 A minority of states have enacted statutes that provide jury trials for juvenile\r\nadjudication proceedings. See Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 119, § 55A (2010); Mich.\r\nComp. Laws § 712A.17(2) (2011); Mont. Code Ann. § 41-5-1502(1) (2011); N.M.\r\nStat. Ann. § 32A-2-16(A) (2011); Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 10A, § 2-2-401 (2011); Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 54.03(c) (2009); W. Va. Code § 49-5-6 (2011); Wyo. Stat. Ann.\r\n§ 14-6-223(c) (2011) (amended on Mar. 10, 2014 regarding juror selection).\r\n\n       Furthermore, as analyzed in Stephen W., the General Assembly has created a\r\nsystem for juveniles that is distinctly different from adult offenders based on the\r\npremise that \"South Carolina, as parens patriae, protects and safeguards the\r\nwelfare of its children.\" Harris v. Harris, 307 S.C. 351, 353, 415 S.E.2d 391, 393\r\n(1992); see State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144 (2007) (noting state's\r\ncontinued recognition of parens patriae in juvenile proceedings). The continued\r\nrecognition of the parens patriae doctrine distinguishes South Carolina from those\r\njurisdictions that have found a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a jury trial.\r\n\r\n       For example, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that juveniles have a\r\nconstitutional right to a jury trial in juvenile offender proceedings. In the Matter of\r\nL. M., 186 P.3d 164 (Kan. 2008). In so ruling, the court premised its analysis by\r\nstating that \"the Kansas Legislature has significantly changed the language of the\r\nKansas Juvenile Offender Code (KJOC).\" Id. at 168. Specifically, the court noted\r\nthese changes negated the rehabilitative purpose set forth in the KJOC, replaced\r\nnonpunitive terminology with criminal terminology similar to the adult criminal\r\ncode, aligned the sentencing provisions with the adult sentencing guidelines, and\r\nremoved \"the protections that the McKeiver Court relied on to distinguish juvenile\r\nsystems from the adult criminal systems.\" Id. The court explained that \"[t]hese\r\nchanges to the juvenile justice system have eroded the benevolent parens patriae\r\ncharacter that distinguished it from the adult criminal system.\" Id. at 170. Unlike\r\nKansas, South Carolina has retained the doctrine of parens patriae in juvenile\r\nproceedings. Thus, Appellant's reliance on In the Matter of L. M. is misplaced.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, the collateral consequences claimed by Appellant do not entitle a\r\njuvenile to a jury trial as the General Assembly has specifically stated that\r\nadjudication is not the equivalent of a conviction. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-\r\n1410(C) (2010) (\"No adjudication by the court of the status of a child is a\r\nconviction, nor does the adjudication operate to impose civil disabilities ordinarily\r\nresulting from conviction, nor may a child be charged with crime or convicted in a\r\ncourt, except as provided in Section 63-19-1210(6). The disposition made of a\r\nchild or any evidence given in court does not disqualify the child in a future civil\r\nservice application or appointment.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Additionally, any assertion that juveniles should be entitled to a jury trial\r\nbecause they are subject to registering as a sex offender if they are adjudicated\r\ndelinquent for certain sex offenses is without merit as our appellate courts have\r\nheld that registering as a sex offender is a civil, non-punitive consequence. See In\r\nre Justin B., 405 S.C. 391, 747 S.E.2d 774 (2013) (affirming juvenile's guilty plea\r\nin family court for criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree and\r\n\nconcluding imposition of lifetime electronic monitoring was a civil obligation and\r\nnot a punishment), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1496 (2014); In re Ronnie A., 355 S.C.\r\n407, 585 S.E.2d 311 (2003) (holding requirement that a juvenile, who is\r\nadjudicated delinquent for committing criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first\r\ndegree, to register as a sex offender is non-punitive and does not violate due\r\nprocess).10 Accordingly, we reaffirm the analysis in Stephen W. that addressed the\r\nissues raised by Appellant in the instant case.\r\n\r\n        Our decision in Stephen W., however, is not dispositive as we have now\r\nbeen presented with arguments raised by the Amici Curiae. Initially, we are not\r\npersuaded by the assertions of the Amici Curiae regarding the lack of reliability in\r\nfamily court juvenile proceedings and the changes that would be needed to\r\naccommodate jury trials in family court. Significantly, they offer no objective\r\nevidence that family court bench trials in juvenile proceedings are somehow less\r\nreliable than other family court proceedings or proceedings conducted as bench\r\ntrials in the circuit or probate courts. In all of these contexts, a judge presides as\r\nthe sole fact-finder regarding cases that implicate a person's liberty interest. See,\r\ne.g., S.C. Code § 43-35-45(E) (Supp. 2013) (outlining procedure for family court's\r\ndetermination that someone qualifies as a \"vulnerable adult\"); id. § 44-17-580(A)\r\n(outlining procedure for probate court's determination regarding a person's\r\ninvoluntary commitment to a mental health facility).11 Thus, in the absence of any\r\n\r\n10  Although the issue is not before the Court, we note the inconsistent positions of\r\nthe General Assembly to limit the negative civil parameters of adjudication\r\nproceedings but permit the consequences of an adjudication to continue for the\r\nlifetime of one who is adjudicated delinquent for sex offenses. If this state retains\r\nthe doctrine of parens patriae in juvenile proceedings, then the consequences of\r\nthese proceedings should expire when the individual reaches the age of twenty-one\r\nyears old. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-1410(A)(5) (2010) (providing that\r\ncommitment \"must be for an indeterminate period but in no event beyond the\r\nchild's twenty-first birthday\").\r\n11 Some proceedings in probate court may be tried before a jury; however, these\r\ncases are extremely limited. See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-1-306(a) (Supp. 2013) (\"If\r\nduly demanded, a party is entitled to trial by jury in any proceeding involving an\r\nissue of fact in an action for the recovery of money only or of specific real or\r\npersonal property, unless waived as provided in the rules of civil procedure for the\r\ncourts of this State. The right to trial by jury exists in, but is not limited to, formal\r\nproceedings in favor of the probate of a will or contesting the probate of a will.\").\r\n\nfundamental distinction,12 we discern no basis on which to find that a jury trial is\r\nwarranted in juvenile proceedings.\r\n       Moreover, judges are presumed impartial and if a juvenile believes a family\r\ncourt judge has \"professional bias,\" the juvenile may move to recuse that particular\r\njudge. See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 524, 599 S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004) (\"It is not\r\nsufficient for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege bias; the party must\r\nshow some evidence of bias or prejudice.\"); Reading v. Ball, 291 S.C. 492, 494,\r\n354 S.E.2d 397, 398 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"When no evidence is presented other than\r\nclaimed 'adverse' rulings by the judge, the judge is not required to recuse\r\nhimself.\"); see also Canon 3(B)(5) of Rule 501, SCACR (\"A judge shall perform\r\njudicial duties without bias or prejudice.\").\r\n\r\n      Furthermore, a juvenile who objects to the adjudication procedure or ruling\r\nhas several avenues of recourse as he or she may file an appeal, an application for\r\npost-conviction relief, or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 63-3-640 (2010) (\"Post conviction proceedings, including habeas corpus\r\nactions, shall be instituted in the court in which the original action was concluded;\r\nprovided, however, that the family courts shall also have original jurisdiction of\r\nhabeas corpus actions if the person who is the subject of the action would\r\notherwise be within the jurisdiction of the family court.\"); id. § 63-3-650 (\"Any\r\njudge shall have the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus to produce any person\r\nunder the age of seventeen in court where necessary.\").\r\n\r\n       As to the changes that would be necessary to implement a juvenile's right to\r\na jury trial, the Amici Curiae oversimplify what would be required. They contend\r\njurors for a family court trial could be selected from a jury pool that has been\r\nsummoned for the Court of Common Pleas or the Court of General Sessions. This\r\nprocedure would defeat the General Assembly's intent to keep juvenile proceedings\r\nseparate and distinct from adult proceedings. It would also create an inefficient\r\nand overlapping system where a circuit court judge qualifies a jury panel and then\r\njurors are selected before a family court judge to serve on a juvenile case.\r\nAdditionally, this procedure would result in increased expenditures for counties as\r\nmore jurors would need to be compensated and staff employed.\r\n\r\n12 Arguably, the difference in the burdens of proof in the proceedings, i.e., beyond\r\na reasonable doubt versus clear and convincing, constitutes a fundamental\r\ndistinction. However, this distinction is not dispositive as bench trials are routinely\r\nconducted in the Court of General Sessions where the burden of proof is beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\r\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold that Appellant has not met his burden to\r\nprove that section 63-3-590 violates either the federal or state constitution.13 See\r\n43 C.J.S. Infants § 134 (Supp. 2014) (\"Although a jury trial in a juvenile\r\ndelinquency proceeding may not be a federal nor a state constitutional requisite, in\r\nthe adjudicative stage of a state juvenile court delinquency proceeding, if, in its\r\nwisdom, any state feels that a jury trial is desirable, there is no impediment to its\r\ninstalling a system embracing that feature, but such is the State's privilege and not\r\nits obligation.\"). Consequently, we adhere to our decision in Stephen W.\r\n\r\n      2.     Constitutional Concerns Beyond Adjudication Proceedings\r\n\r\n       While we find a decision to affirm the family court is correct as Appellant's\r\narguments are confined to challenging a juvenile's inability to request a jury trial in\r\nadjudication proceedings, we recognize a state constitutional conundrum. Under\r\nthe plain terms of our state constitution, a juvenile charged with a criminal offense\r\nhas an absolute right to a jury trial. Although the General Assembly may prohibit\r\na juvenile from exercising this right in juvenile adjudications, it cannot\r\nlegislatively eliminate the right in its entirety.\r\n\r\n       As the law currently stands, the General Assembly has authorized only the\r\nState and the family court to initiate the transfer of a juvenile into a court where the\r\ncase could be tried by a jury. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-1210(4)-(10) (2010)\r\n(providing circumstances transferring jurisdiction of a juvenile from family court\r\nto a \"court which would have trial jurisdiction of the offenses if committed by an\r\nadult\" based on determination by family court either on its own decision or\r\nfollowing the State's request); 21 S.C. Jur. Children & Families § 102 (Supp.\r\n2014) (discussing circumstances involving \"transfer of a juvenile to adult court\").\r\nThis procedure is arguably unconstitutional as a juvenile should be able to\r\naffirmatively exercise the right to have a jury trial if charged with an offense for\r\nwhich the family court could waive jurisdiction. See 47 Am. Jur. 2d Juvenile\r\nCourts § 94 (Supp. 2014) (\"There is no constitutional right to a jury trial in\r\n\r\n13 See State v. Ross, 185 S.C. 472, 477, 194 S.E. 439, 441 (1937) (\"A court should\r\nnot declare a statute unconstitutional unless its invalidity is manifest beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, and the burden to show its unconstitutionality rests upon the one\r\nmaking the attack. It does not require citation of authorities to sustain this\r\nproposition, for our court has so often announced this principle, in cases which it\r\nhas been called upon to decide the question of the constitutionality of certain\r\nstatutes, that this principle has become axiomatic.\").\r\n\njuvenile delinquency proceedings and such right is purely statutory. Some\r\nauthority, though, holds that a juvenile has a state constitutional right to a jury trial,\r\nor that a juvenile has a right to a jury trial if accused of an act which would be a\r\ncrime if committed by an adult.\" (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added)).14\r\n\r\n       Without question, the South Carolina Children's Code and its adjudication\r\nprocedure emanate from the State's power and responsibility as parens patriae.\r\nThe State's status as parens patriae is substantial and should not be easily\r\ndismissed. Concomitant with this status is the responsibility not to arbitrarily\r\nabandon it without articulable good cause. Given the significance of abdicating\r\nthis role, this Court has adopted factors for a family court to evaluate before\r\ntransferring a juvenile's case to the Court of General Sessions.15 Nonetheless, the\r\n\r\n14 Although a juvenile may not initiate the waiver of jurisdiction, we note that he\r\nor she may appeal the waiver order or consent to the transfer. See State v. Rice,\r\n401 S.C. 330, 737 S.E.2d 485 (2013) (affirming juvenile's plea of guilty in general\r\nsessions court and finding that juvenile, by pleading guilty, waived any\r\nconstitutional challenge to the family court waiver of jurisdiction); State v. Lamb,\r\n374 S.C. 346, 649 S.E.2d 486 (2007) (affirming juvenile's conviction for murder\r\nand concluding court of general sessions had subject matter jurisdiction to try\r\njuvenile after the family court accepted juvenile's consent to transfer jurisdiction).\r\nHowever, these procedures do not equate to an absolute right to affirmatively\r\nrequest a jury trial.\r\n15 This Court has stated that \"[u]pon a motion to transfer jurisdiction, the family\r\ncourt must determine if it is in the best interest of both the child and the\r\ncommunity before granting the transfer request.\" State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527,\r\n558, 647 S.E.2d 144, 160 (2007). \"The family court must consider eight factors, as\r\napproved by the United States Supreme Court in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S.\r\n541 (1966), in making this determination.\" Id. at 558-59, 647 S.E.2d at 160. The\r\nfactors are:\r\n\r\n      (1) The seriousness of the alleged offense.\r\n\r\n      (2) Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive,\r\n      violent, premeditated, or willful manner.\r\n\r\n      (3) Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against \n\r\n      property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons \n\r\n      especially if personal injury resulted. \n\r\n\nState's status as parens patriae cannot supplant a juvenile's immutable state\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\n       The apparent tension between the State's power as parens patriae and a\r\njuvenile's state constitutional right to a jury trial must be reconciled.\r\nReconciliation is found by recognizing that the two are not mutually exclusive and\r\nthat they are in fact dual tracks for handling juvenile transgressions. Although a\r\njuvenile is not entitled to a jury trial in an adjudication proceeding, the juvenile\r\nshould be permitted to remove his case from the family court to a court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction where a jury trial may be conducted. However, when this\r\nelection is made, the juvenile forfeits the benevolent treatment of the parens\r\npatriae adjudication proceeding.   III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n       After consideration of the issues raised by Appellant and the Amici Curiae,\r\nwe adhere to our decision in Stephen W. Accordingly, we affirm the family court's\r\ndenial of Appellant's motion for a jury trial in his adjudication proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      (4) The prosecutive merit of the complaint.\r\n      (5) The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one\r\n      court.\r\n\r\n      (6) The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined by\r\n      consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude\r\n      and pattern of living.\r\n\r\n      (7) The record and previous history of the juvenile, including previous\r\n      contacts with law enforcement agencies, juvenile courts and other\r\n      jurisdictions, prior periods of probation, or prior commitments to\r\n      juvenile institutions.\r\n\r\n      (8) The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the\r\n      likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found to\r\n      have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures,\r\n      services and facilities currently available.\r\n\r\nId. at 559, 647 S.E.2d at 160.\r\n\n\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      HEARN, J., concurs.

I decline to join Section II(B)(2) of\r\nthe lead opinion and dissent therefrom.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in part and dissent in part. First, I agree that\r\nour decision in Stephen W,16 is dispositive of the only issue properly before this\r\nCourt: whether a juvenile is entitled to a jury trial in a family court delinquency\r\nproceeding. To the extent that the majority addresses matters raised only by the\r\namicus curiae, I dissent. See Rule 213 SCACR. I also disagree with any\r\nsuggestion that a juvenile's \"immutable right to a jury trial\" requires the Court sua\r\nsponte create a right allowing the juvenile to waive his case from family court to\r\ngeneral sessions. The purported \"constitutional conundrum\" results from the\r\nequation of a juvenile delinquency petition with a criminal charge, a\r\nmisunderstanding that is wholly at odds with our analysis in Stephen W. Further,\r\nwere this new procedure indeed constitutionally mandated, then I do not\r\nunderstand why we would not remand this appeal to allow Appellant the\r\nopportunity to exercise his right to a jury trial in general sessions.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this case is controlled in its entirety by Stephen W. Accordingly, I\r\nrespectfully dissent from any discussion beyond the issue raised by the Appellant,\r\nand would hold only that the family court order should be affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     In re Stephen W., Op.

Preferred Fire\r\nProtection, L.L.C., 397 S.C. 379, 725 S.E.2d 495 (Ct. App. 2012), in which a\r\nsupplier of materials (\"Ferguson Fire\") brought an action for foreclosure of a\r\nmechanic's lien against the owner of a data center (\"Immedion\") and its contractor\r\n(\"Preferred Fire\"). Ferguson Fire contends, and we agree, that the Court of\r\nAppeals erred in adding requirements to S.C Code Ann. § 29-5-40 (2007),\r\ngoverning a notice of furnishing, that are not in the statute itself and in concluding\r\nFerguson Fire did not establish an effective lien upon which a foreclosure action\r\ncould be premised. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n      This case arises out of Ferguson Fire's efforts to obtain payment for\r\nmaterials it supplied to Preferred Fire for Immedion's data center. An outline of\r\nthe events leading to Ferguson Fire's mechanic's lien action and the lower courts'\r\nrulings follow.\r\n\r\n             Contracts for Improvements to Immedion's Data Center\r\n\r\n       In 2007, Immedion, a telecommunications company, hired Rescom, L.L.C.\r\nto be the general contractor for improvements planned for its data center on\r\nproperty Immedion leased in Greenville. This contract excluded the performance\r\nof part of the fire protection work that was needed. Rescom, in turn, hired\r\nPreferred Fire, a fire sprinkler company, as a subcontractor.\r\n\n       In addition, Immedion directly hired Preferred Fire under a separate contract\r\nfor $30,973.00 to install a special \"pre-action\" fire suppression system1 in its data\r\ncenter. To complete this work, Preferred Fire purchased materials from Ferguson\r\nFire. Ferguson Fire began delivering materials to Preferred Fire on August 24,\r\n2007, and the deliveries continued through October 16, 2007.\r\n\r\n                   Notice of Furnishing Labor and/or Materials\r\n\r\n        On September 21, 2007, while its deliveries were in progress, Ferguson Fire\r\nsent a \"Notice of Furnishing Labor and Materials\" (\"Notice of Furnishing\") to\r\nImmedion advising it in relevant part that it had been employed by Preferred Fire\r\nto deliver labor, services, or materials with an estimated value of $15,000.00 to\r\nImmedion's premises. The Notice of Furnishing advised that it was being given as\r\n\"a routine procedure to comply with certain state requirements that may exist,\" and\r\nthat it was not a lien, nor any reflection on Preferred Fire's credit standing.\r\n\r\n       Immedion paid Preferred Fire $15,486.50 of the $30,973.00 contract price\r\nfor installation of the system before receiving Ferguson Fire's Notice of Furnishing\r\non September 21, 2007. After receiving the Notice of Furnishing, Immedion issued\r\ntwo additional checks to Preferred Fire totaling $15,486.50 for the unpaid balance\r\nof the contract price.\r\n\r\n      It is undisputed that Immedion paid everything it owed to Rescom, and it\r\nalso paid its contractor Preferred Fire in full under the separate contract for the fire\r\nsuppression system. However, Preferred Fire never paid Ferguson Fire for the\r\nmaterials it furnished.      Notice or Certificate of Lien\r\n\r\n       On January 8, 2008, Ferguson Fire served upon Immedion, Preferred Fire,\r\nand others (and later filed) a \"Statement and Notice of Mechanic's Lien,\" which\r\ngave notice of the existence of a lien and included a Statement of Account.\r\nFerguson Fire indicated it had supplied $15,548.93 in materials to Preferred Fire\r\nfor Immedion's premises from August 24, 2007 through October 16, 2007 pursuant\r\nto an agreement with Preferred Fire that was entered into \"with the knowledge and\r\nconsent and permission and authorization of Immedion.\" Ferguson Fire stated\r\n\r\n1 Pre-action fire suppression systems are multi-step systems designed to prevent\r\naccidental activation in areas that are highly sensitive to water damage. See \"Fire\r\nsprinkler system,\" available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_sprinkler_system.\r\n\n$15,548.93 was still owing and due, and it asserted a mechanic's lien upon the\r\ndescribed premises.\r\n\r\n       Complaint for Foreclosure of Lien & Summary Judgment Motions\r\n\r\n       On April 11, 2008, Ferguson Fire filed a complaint and a lis pendens against\r\nPreferred Fire, Fair Forest of Greenville, L.L.C., Thomas F. Wong, and Immedion\r\nseeking foreclosure of a mechanic's lien as to all defendants, as well as attorney's\r\nfees, costs, and interest.2\r\n\r\n       Immedion answered3 and thereafter moved for summary judgment,\r\nmaintaining (1) there was no evidence Ferguson Fire had furnished any materials\r\nfor the benefit of property owned by Immedion, as it was a mere leaseholder;\r\n(2) there was no contractual relationship giving rise to liability between Ferguson\r\nFire and Immedion; and (3) Immedion paid in full for all work performed by its\r\ncontractors, so it had no further liability pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-20(B).\r\n\r\n       Ferguson Fire filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing (1) under\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-30 a leasehold interest in property is subject to a\r\nmaterialman's lien; (2) a materialman supplying materials to a contractor has a lien\r\nfor the value of the materials on the leaseholder's interest under S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 29-5-20, and the value of the lien is limited to the amount due to the contractor\r\nby the owner/leaseholder as of the date of notice under sections 29-5-20 and 29-5-\r\n40; and (3) Immedion should have been aware of its potential claim because\r\nFerguson Fire gave Immedion the Notice of Furnishing prior to Immedion's full\r\npayment to Preferred Fire.\r\n\r\n      Ferguson Fire asserted since it gave Immedion notice on September 21,\r\n2007 that it was furnishing materials for its premises, under South Carolina's\r\n\r\n2 Ferguson Fire additionally asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust\r\nenrichment as to Preferred Fire only. Ferguson Fire obtained a default judgment\r\nagainst Preferred Fire but was unable to collect on it. Ferguson Fire stipulated to a\r\ndismissal of Fair Forest and Wong.\r\n3 In addition, Immedion counterclaimed against Ferguson Fire for attorney's fees,\r\nand it instituted a third-party complaint against Rescom for breach of contract.\r\nRescom counterclaimed against Immedion, but the two reached a settlement and\r\ndismissed Immedion's third-party complaint when they determined Ferguson Fire's\r\nsuit did not involve Immedion's contract with Rescom.\r\n\nmechanic's lien statutes, it was entitled to a lien up to the amount Immedion paid to\r\nits contractor, Preferred Fire, after that date, plus attorney's fees and interest.4\r\nFerguson Fire noted that the value of the materials it supplied to Preferred Fire was\r\nactually greater than the amount of its lien, but acknowledged that under the\r\nstatutory provisions its lien was limited to the unpaid balance of the contract\r\nbetween Immedion and Preferred Fire as of the date of its Notice of Furnishing.\r\n\r\n                  Decisions of Circuit Court & Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n      The circuit court granted summary judgment to Immedion and extinguished\r\nthe mechanic's lien filed by Ferguson Fire. The court stated, \"The issue is whether\r\nthe Notice of Furnishing was sufficient to notify the owner [Immedion] of the lien\r\ngiven by § 29-5-20. Because the Notice explicitly stated that it was not a\r\nmechanic's lien and contained no demand for payment, the Notice is ineffective\r\nunder § 29-5-40 as a Notice of Lien.\"\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding the Notice of Furnishing was\r\nineffective under section 29-5-40 because it \"was sent prior to furnishing all the\r\nmaterial, failed to identify the final amounts of the goods delivered, and never\r\nmade a demand for payment.\" Ferguson Fire & Fabrication, Inc. v. Preferred\r\nFire Protection, L.L.C., 397 S.C. 379, 386, 725 S.E.2d 495, 499 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\nThe court concluded \"the circuit court did not err in finding the Notice [of\r\nFurnishing] was insufficient to notify Immedion of a lien.\" Id. at 387, 725 S.E.2d\r\nat 499. This Court granted Ferguson Fire's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides a motion\r\nfor summary judgment shall be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\n\r\n      \"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the\r\nsame standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.\"\r\n\r\n4 Although Ferguson Fire inadvertently referred to the balance remaining on the\r\nnotice date as $15,485.50 in some of its materials, this appears to be a scrivener's\r\nerror as the balance remaining on the notice date, and thus the potential lien, was\r\n$15,486.50.\r\n\nProgressive Max Ins. Co. v. Floating Caps, Inc., 405 S.C. 35, 42, 747 S.E.2d 178,\r\n182 (2013) (citation omitted). Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is\r\na question of law, which this Court reviews de novo. Town of Summerville v. City\r\nof N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 662 S.E.2d 40 (2008).\r\n\r\n                               III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      On certiorari, Ferguson Fire contends the Court of Appeals erred in adding\r\nrequirements for the timing and form of a Notice of Furnishing under S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 29-5-40; specifically, it erred in determining a Notice of Furnishing could\r\nnot be delivered to an owner until after a materialman delivers all materials to the\r\nworksite and that a demand for payment of a specific amount must be included in\r\nthe notice. We agree. The Court of Appeals has added requirements that are not\r\npresent in the statute itself and, as a result, erred in concluding Ferguson Fire's lien\r\nwas ineffective as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n      A. Overview of Mechanics' Liens Statutes\r\n\r\n       In South Carolina, mechanics' liens are purely statutory and may be acquired\r\nand enforced only in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the\r\nstatutes creating them. Multiplex Bldg. Corp. v. Lyles, 268 S.C. 577, 235 S.E.2d\r\n133 (1977); accord Skiba v. Gessner, 374 S.C. 208, 212, 648 S.E.2d 605, 606\r\n(2007) (stating \"one's right to a mechanic's lien is wholly dependent upon the\r\nlanguage of the statute creating it\"); Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court St., L.L.C.,\r\n369 S.C. 121, 130, 631 S.E. 252, 257 (2006) (observing mechanics' lien statutes\r\n\"must be strictly followed\"). The statutory process encompasses several steps,\r\nincluding the (1) creation, (2) perfection, and (3) enforcement of the lien. See\r\ngenerally S.C. Code Ann. §§ 29-5-10 to -440 (2007 & Supp. 2013) (governing\r\nmechanics' liens).\r\n\r\n      (1) Creation of Lien\r\n\r\n        As a general rule, mechanics' liens arise when a contractor, subcontractor, or\r\nother person improves real property by furnishing labor and/or materials for a\r\nbuilding or structure. 22 S.C. Jur. Mechanics' Liens § 2 (1994). \"Because the\r\nimprovements usually attach to and become an inseparable part of the structure, the\r\nlien statutes give the persons responsible for the improvements a security interest,\r\nor a lien on the improvement to the value of the amount due them.\" Id. § 3\r\n(footnote omitted).\r\n\n       The primary lien statutes are found in sections 29-5-10 and 29-5-20 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code, and they distinguish between two classes of persons:\r\n(1) those with a direct contractual relationship to the owner (or leaseholder, as the\r\ncase may be), such as contractors, and (2) those who are not in direct privity of\r\ncontract with the owner, such as subcontractors and materialmen or suppliers. Id.\r\n§ 8; see S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-10 (2007) (creating liens for those with a direct\r\ncontractual relationship with the owner); id. § 29-5-20 (creating liens for those not\r\nin direct privity with the owner).\r\n\r\n        In this case, Ferguson Fire did not contract directly with the leaseholder of\r\nthe premises, Immedion; rather, it was a supplier of materials to Immedion's\r\ncontractor, Preferred Fire. This implicates section 29-5-20(A), which provides in\r\nrelevant part: \"Every laborer, mechanic, subcontractor, or person furnishing\r\nmaterial for the improvement of real estate when the improvement has been\r\nauthorized by the owner has a lien thereon, subject to existing liens of which he\r\nhas actual or constructive notice, to the value of the labor or material so furnished .\r\n. . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-20(A) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      \"The lien arises, inchoate, when the labor is performed or the materials are\r\nfurnished.\" Shelley Constr. Co. v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 26, 336\r\nS.E.2d 488, 489 (Ct. App. 1985). In other words, \"when the labor is performed or\r\nmaterial is furnished, the right exists but the lien has not been perfected.\" Butler\r\nContracting, 369 S.C. at 128, 631 S.E.2d at 256 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, if the person furnishing the labor or materials was employed by\r\nsomeone other than the owner (such as a contractor), for the lien to attach the\r\nperson must meet the additional requirement of giving written notice to the owner\r\nof the furnishing of the labor or material. Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-40;\r\nLowndes Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229 S.C. 619, 93 S.E.2d 855\r\n(1956); Shelley Constr. Co., 287 S.C. at 26, 336 S.E.2d at 490).\r\n\r\n     Section 29-5-40, entitled \"Notice to owner before lien attaches when laborer\r\nwas employed by someone other than owner,\" provides in full as follows:\r\n\r\n             Whenever work is done or material is furnished for the\r\n      improvement of real estate upon the employment of a contractor or\r\n      some other person than the owner and such laborer, mechanic,\r\n      contractor or materialman shall in writing notify the owner of the\r\n      furnishing of such labor or material and the amount or value thereof,\r\n      the lien given by § 29-5-20 shall attach upon the real estate improved\r\n\n      as against the true owner for the amount of the work done or material\r\n      furnished. But in no event shall the aggregate amount of liens set up\r\n      hereby exceed the amount due by the owner on the contract price of\r\n      the improvement made.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-40 (2007) (emphasis added). By its terms, section 29-5-40\r\nrequires a supplier to give written notice to the owner (1) \"of the furnishing of such\r\nlabor or material\" and (2) \"the amount or value thereof.\"\r\n\r\n      (2) Perfection & Enforcement of Lien\r\n\r\n       For an inchoate lien to become valid, the lien must be perfected and\r\nenforced in compliance with South Carolina's mechanic's lien statutes. Preferred\r\nSav. & Loan Ass'n v. Royal Garden Resort, Inc., 301 S.C. 1, 389 S.E.2d 853\r\n(1990). To perfect and enforce a lien, one must timely complete the following\r\nthree steps found in sections 29-5-90 and 29-5-120 of the South Carolina Code:\r\n(1) serve and file a notice or certificate of the lien, (2) commence a lawsuit to\r\nenforce the lien, and (3) file a lis pendens. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 29-5-90 & -120\r\n(2007); Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at 129, 631 S.E.2d at 256; see also 22 S.C.\r\nJur. Mechanics' Liens §§ 15 to 19 (1994) (discussing procedures). The trigger for\r\ndetermining when all three of these events must be performed is the date when the\r\nsupplier ceases furnishing labor or materials.\r\n\r\n              (a) Notice or Certificate of Lien. Section 29-5-90 requires that,\r\nwithin ninety days after he ceases to furnish labor or materials for a building or\r\nstructure, the party asserting a lien must serve upon the owner (or person in\r\npossession of the property) and file with the register of deeds or clerk of court a\r\nnotice or a certificate that includes a statement of the amount due him, together\r\nwith a description of the property intended to be covered by the lien, the name of\r\nthe owner of the property, if known, and other required information. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 29-5-90 (2007); Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at 129, 631 S.E.2d at 256.\r\n\r\n             (b) Commencement of Lawsuit to Enforce the Lien. Pursuant to\r\nsection 29-5-120, a party must commence a lawsuit seeking to enforce the lien\r\nwithin six months after ceasing to provide labor or materials for the property. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 29-5-120 (2007). The lien may be enforced by a petition to the court\r\nof common pleas in the county where the building or structure is located. Id. § 29-\r\n5-140.\r\n\n               (c) Notice of Lis Pendens. Section 29-5-120 further requires a party\r\nto file a notice of the pending action (lis pendens) within six months after ceasing\r\nto provide labor or materials. Id. § 29-5-120.\r\n\r\n       \"If these steps are taken, the person claiming the lien may foreclose against\r\nthe property to satisfy the debt.\" Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at 129, 631 S.E.2d\r\nat 256. \"On the other hand, if he fails to take any one of these steps, the lien\r\nagainst the property is dissolved pursuant to Sections 29-5-90 and 29-5-120.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      The importance of strictly adhering to the statutory requirements is that,\r\nonce a party claiming a lien gives the proper notice, he is entitled to be paid in\r\npreference to the contractor who procured the labor or materials, and the owner's\r\npayment to the contractor after receiving the proper notice shall not diminish the\r\namount recoverable by the party asserting a lien. S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-50\r\n(2007).\r\n\r\n      B. Application of Statutory Scheme to Ferguson Fire\r\n\r\n        The current dispute centers on the Court of Appeals's determination that\r\nFerguson Fire never acquired a lien because it gave a Notice of Furnishing to\r\nImmedion prior to delivering all of the materials to the worksite and without\r\nincluding a demand for payment of a specific amount. The court's holding turns on\r\nits interpretation of section 29-5-40, which imposes written notice upon the owner\r\nas a prerequisite for a lien to attach when the supplier is hired by someone other\r\nthan the owner.\r\n\r\n      If a statute is ambiguous, the courts must construe its terms. Sparks v.\r\nPalmetto Hardwood, Inc., 406 S.C. 124, 750 S.E.2d 61 (2013). \"A statute as a\r\nwhole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the\r\npurpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.\" Id. at 128, 750 S.E.2d at 63 (citation\r\nomitted). However, \"[w]here the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and\r\nconveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\nneeded and the court has no right to impose another meaning.\" Hodges v. Rainey,\r\n341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).\r\n\r\n       \"What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best\r\nevidence of the legislative intent or will. Therefore, the courts are bound to give\r\neffect to the expressed intent of the legislature.\" Id. (quoting Norman J. Singer,\r\nSutherland Statutory Construction § 46.03, at 94 (5th ed. 1992)). \"We are not at\r\nliberty, under the guise of construction, to alter the plain language of [a] statute by\r\n\nadding words which the Legislature saw fit not to include.\" Shelley Constr. Co.,\r\n287 S.C. at 28, 336 S.E.2d at 491. \"Our duty is to apply the statute according to its\r\nown terms.\" Id. at 29, 336 S.E.2d at 491.\r\n\r\n       Upon reviewing the plain terms of section 29-5-40 and considering its\r\nrelation to the other mechanic's lien provisions as well as prior case law, we\r\nbelieve Immedion and the Court of Appeals have confused the requirements for a\r\nNotice of Furnishing to an owner under section 29-5-40 with the requirements for a\r\nnotice or certificate of a lien under section 29-5-90.\r\n\r\n       Application of the mechanic's lien statutes outlined above indicates\r\nFerguson Fire followed the proper timing and sequence of events for (1) creation,\r\n(2) perfection, and (3) enforcement of a mechanic's lien. An inchoate lien\r\nnormally arises upon the furnishing of the labor and materials under section 29-5-\r\n20. However, section 29-5-40 additionally provides that, in cases where the person\r\nseeking the lien was employed by someone other than the owner, the supplier must\r\nnotify the owner in writing \"of the furnishing of such labor or material and the\r\namount or value thereof\" for \"the lien given by § 29-5-20 [to] attach upon the real\r\nestate . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-40. Thus, Ferguson Fire was required to meet\r\nthe terms of both section 29-5-20(A) and section 29-5-40 for it to have an inchoate\r\nlien attach.\r\n\r\n       In this case, Ferguson Fire gave Immedion written notice on September 21,\r\n2007 that it was supplying materials to Preferred Fire for its premises with an\r\nestimated value of $15,000.00. This is all of the information specifically required\r\nby the General Assembly in section 29-5-40 for a Notice of Furnishing. Ferguson\r\nFire's Notice of Furnishing correctly indicated that it was not then noticing a lien\r\nand it did not include a demand for payment as it had not yet delivered all of the\r\nmaterials to the premises, and there was no amount delinquent at that time. The\r\ncessation of deliveries and a specific demand for payment are elements that are\r\nrequired for a lien notice. In contrast, the Notice of Furnishing under section 29-5-\r\n40 was simply to apprise Immedion as the leaseholder of the property that\r\nFerguson Fire was \"furnishing . . . labor or material\" to its premises.\r\n\r\n      Once all of the materials had been furnished and Preferred Fire failed to pay\r\nthe amount due, Ferguson Fire then proceeded with the next step in the process\r\nunder section 29-5-90 to prepare a lien notice that included a Statement of\r\nAccount. The lien notice indicated that the materials had been furnished and that\r\nthere was a specific amount then owing and unpaid for which a lien was being\r\npursued.\r\n\n        The Court of Appeals acknowledged that section 29-5-40 \"does not\r\nprescribe the specific format of the notice,\" and it \"does not contain a time limit for\r\nproviding written notice to the owner,\" but stated that \"it is impossible for a notice\r\nof a lien to precede the actual performance of work that creates the lien.\"\r\nFerguson Fire & Fabrication, Inc. v. Preferred Fire Protection, L.L.C., 397 S.C.\r\n379, 387, 725 S.E.2d 495, 499 (Ct. App. 2012). We agree with the Court of\r\nAppeals that a lien notice could not be prepared until all of the materials were\r\ndelivered. See S.C. Code Ann. § 29-5-90 (providing a notice or certificate of a lien\r\nis to be served and filed \"after [a person] ceases to labor on or furnish labor or\r\nmaterials for such building or structure\"). However, Ferguson Fire provided both a\r\nNotice of Furnishing and a lien notice, which serve two different purposes, and it\r\ndid not file its lien notice until after the delivery of all materials.\r\n\r\n       In Lowndes Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229 S.C. 619, 629,\r\n93 S.E.2d 855, 860 (1956), this Court expressly stated that the Notice of\r\nFurnishing statute specifies no time when the notice should be given to the owner,\r\nand it could be \"given at any time\":\r\n\r\n             Section 45-254 [now 29-5-40] specifies no time at which or\r\n      within which notice of the furnishing of material is to be given to the\r\n      owner. Such notice may be given at any time. Cf. Hughes v. Peel,\r\n      221 S.C. 307, 70 S.E.2d 353; but of course it will be ineffectual if the\r\n      other requisites to the perfection and enforcement of the lien, Sections\r\n      45-259 and 45-262 [now sections 29-5-90 and 29-5-120], are not met.\r\n      Delay in giving the notice cannot operate to the detriment of the\r\n      owner, because his liability under the lien is limited to the balance due\r\n      by him to the prime contractor at the time he receives the notice.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) In Wood v. Hardy, 235 S.C. 131, 137-38, 110 S.E.2d 157, 160\r\n(1959), this Court quoted Lowndes extensively and reiterated that the General\r\nAssembly has set forth no time limit as to the filing of a Notice of Furnishing, so it\r\nmay be given at any time. However, as noted in Lowndes, the lien is limited to the\r\namount of the unpaid balance at the time the owner receives the notice, so the\r\ntiming of the notice affects the amount of the potential lien. Id. at 138, 110 S.E.2d\r\nat 160.\r\n\r\n      The Court of Appeals also recognized the impact of the timing of a Notice of\r\nFurnishing upon the potential lien amount in Stovall Building Supplies:\r\n\n      S.C. Code Ann. § 29–5–40 (1976) provides, in pertinent part, that a\r\n      mechanic's lien will not attach to the owner's property unless the\r\n      owner is given notice of the claim of a materialman who contracted\r\n      with a person other than the owner prior to the payment in full of the\r\n      amount owed the contractor. In addition, the materialman's lien is\r\n      limited to the amount the owner owes the contractor at the time the\r\n      materialman gives notice.\r\n\r\nStovall Bldg. Supplies, Inc. v. Mottet, 305 S.C. 28, 32, 406 S.E.2d 176, 178 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1990) (footnote omitted). More recently, in Butler Contracting, this Court\r\nagain explicitly noted, \"Section 29-5-40 does not contain a time limit for providing\r\nwritten notice to the owner when the person asserting the lien is employed by\r\nsomeone other than the owner.\" Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at 128 n.3, 631\r\nS.E.2d at 256 n.3 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Ferguson Fire obviously gave its Notice of Furnishing to Immedion. Once it\r\nreceived the proper notice, Immedion made any additional payments at its own\r\nperil. See generally Lowndes Hill Realty Co., 229 S.C. at 629, 93 S.E.2d at 860\r\n(citing the prior codifications of sections 29-5-20 and 29-5-40 and stating there is a\r\n\"manifest two-fold purpose\" for the two statutes, to wit, \"(1) [t]he protection of\r\none, not a party to a contract with the owner, who furnishes labor or material in the\r\nimprovement of the owner's property, by giving him a lien for such labor or\r\nmaterial; and (2) the protection of the property owner by limiting his liability and\r\nthat of his property in respect of all such liens 'to the amount due by the owner on\r\nthe contract price of the improvement made'\" (citation omitted)).\r\n                                                \r\n\r\n        The Court of Appeals has created additional requirements not provided by\r\nthe General Assembly in section 29-5-40 for a Notice of Furnishing. Ferguson\r\nFire gave proper notice to Immedion that it was furnishing materials to its\r\npremises, as well as a separate lien notice that included a demand for the amount\r\ndue once the materials had actually been supplied and its invoices became\r\ndelinquent. All of these steps occurred prior to Ferguson Fire's service and filing\r\nof its complaint for foreclosure of the mechanic's lien and a lis pendens. As a\r\nresult, the Court of Appeals erred in holding Ferguson Fire did not establish an\r\neffective lien.                 IV. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n     We conclude Ferguson Fire followed the statutory procedures to establish a\r\nmechanic's lien upon which a foreclosure action could be maintained, so summary\r\n\njudgment was improperly awarded to Immedion. We reverse and remand for\r\nfurther proceedings.5\r\n\r\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n      KITTREDGE, J. and Acting Justices D. Craig Brown and Dorothy M.\r\nJones, concur.

Defillo, of Jacksonville, Florida, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Respondent is licensed to practice law in Florida; she is not\r\nlicensed to practice law in South Carolina. In November 2013, the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed Formal Charges against respondent alleging she\r\noperated a law firm and offered legal services in South Carolina. In addition,\r\nODC alleged that respondent advertised and solicited clients in South Carolina in\r\nviolation of Rule 7, RPC, Rule 413, SCACR, and Rule 418, SCACR. Respondent\r\ndid not answer the Formal Charges, was found to be in default, and is therefore\r\ndeemed to have admitted the factual allegations made in those charges. See Rule\r\n24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Following an evidentiary hearing in which\r\nrespondent did not appear, the Hearing Panel issued a Panel Report recommending\r\nthe Court sanction respondent for her misconduct. Neither ODC nor respondent\r\nfiled exceptions to the Panel Report. The matter is now before the Court for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\n                                        Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nIn 2012, respondent opened an office in Greenville, ostensibly to handle federal\r\nimmigration matters. Respondent had no law partners or associates who were\r\nlicensed in South Carolina except for a period of approximately fourteen days in\r\nAugust 2012. Respondent offered to provide legal services in South Carolina\r\nusing methods specifically targeted at potential clients in South Carolina, including\r\na law firm website, business cards, print advertisements, and radio commercials as\r\ndiscussed below.\r\n\r\nIn connection with her representation of two clients in federal immigration matters,\r\nrespondent sent letters to judges for the state circuit court in Greenville, requesting\r\ncertification that the clients were crime victims. The letterhead contained the\r\nphrase \"Attorneys and Counselors at Law\" when, in fact, respondent had no\r\npartners or associates at the times the letters were written. Respondent's letterhead\r\nincluded her Greenville office address without indicating the jurisdictional\r\nlimitations on her ability to practice law.\r\n\r\nRespondent advertised her law firm through the use of a website available to\r\nresidents of South Carolina. Included on the website are references to respondent's\r\nGreenville office. Respondent's website contains material misrepresentations and\r\nomits facts necessary to make the contents considered as a whole not materially\r\nmisleading. On her website, respondent advertises her office in Greenville but\r\nfails to state that she is not licensed to practice law in South Carolina or to\r\notherwise set forth the jurisdictional limitations on her practice in this state.\r\nFurther, respondent's website is not limited to the promotion of her federal\r\nimmigration practice as she advertises her experience in both criminal and family\r\nlaw and offers to \"analyze the facts of [her prospective client's] case by applying\r\ncurrent…State Laws.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to false and misleading statements regarding offers to practice in this\r\njurisdiction, respondent repeatedly refers to the firm's \"lawyers\" and \"attorneys\"\r\nwhen, in fact, respondent is a sole practitioner with no partners, only sporadically\r\nemploying associates in her law firm.\r\n\nRespondent's website compares her services with other lawyers' services in a way\r\nthat cannot be factually substantiated by stating her law firm is \"unique\" because\r\nshe and her staff are fluent in Spanish and English. Additionally, respondent\r\nincludes forms of the words \"specialist\" and \"expert\" on her website even though\r\nshe is not a specialist certified by this Court.\r\n\r\nRespondent promotes her law firm by distributing printed business cards. The\r\nbusiness cards advertise her office in Greenville without disclosing the fact that\r\nrespondent is not licensed to practice law in South Carolina or disclosing the\r\ngeographical limitation of her law practice in this state.\r\n\r\nRespondent promotes her law firm by publication of print advertisements in\r\nSpanish-language magazines and other periodicals distributed in South Carolina.\r\nRespondent's print media advertisements lists her office in Greenville without\r\ndisclosing the fact that she is not licensed to practice law in South Carolina or\r\ndisclosing the jurisdictional limitations on her practice in this state.\r\n\r\nRespondent promotes her law firm by broadcasting commercials on Spanish-\r\nlanguage radio stations in South Carolina. Respondent's radio commercials include\r\nreference to her office in Greenville without disclosing the fact that she is not\r\nlicensed in South Carolina or disclosing the geographical limitations of her practice\r\nof law in this state.                Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent initially cooperated with the disciplinary investigation by timely\r\nsubmitting her responses to the notice of investigation and ODC's subpoena for her\r\nclient files and record of advertising dissemination. However, respondent failed to\r\nsubmit a response to the supplemental notice of investigation served on her on\r\nApril 5, 2013.\r\n\r\nAs a result of her failure to submit a response to the supplemental notice of\r\ninvestigation, ODC issued a notice for respondent to appear for an interview on\r\nMay 23, 2013. Respondent contacted ODC and requested the interview be\r\npostponed. Pursuant to that request, ODC issued an amended notice to appear,\r\nsetting the interview for May 31, 2013. Respondent failed to appear, although her\r\nhusband called ODC thirty-two minutes before the scheduled interview time to\r\nstate respondent would not be attending the interview due to a court appearance in\r\nGeorgia. Respondent's husband was asked to instruct respondent to contact ODC\r\nafter her court appearance in Georgia to reschedule the interview. As a result of\r\n\nrespondent's failure to contact ODC pursuant to this instruction, ODC issued a\r\nthird notice to appear, setting the interview for July 2, 2013. Respondent did not\r\nappear on July 2, 2013, and has not contacted ODC with regard to this disciplinary\r\nmatter since that time.\r\n\r\nRespondent made the following false or misleading statements in her response to\r\nthe initial notice of investigation that she submitted to ODC:\r\n\r\n      My practice is limited to Immigration Law.\r\n\r\n      I have [not] portrayed myself to practice any other law but federal\r\n      immigration law.\r\n\r\n      At no time I have portrayed myself to represent residence [sic] of South\r\n      Carolina with any legal services other than those that are exclusively related\r\n      to immigration law.\r\n\r\n      I solely practice federal immigration law.\r\n\r\nThe Hearing Panel found respondent's conduct violated the following Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR1: Rule 5.5(b)(2) (lawyer who is not\r\nadmitted in this jurisdiction shall not hold out to public or otherwise represent that\r\nlawyer is admitted to practice law in this jurisdiction); Rule 7.1(a) (lawyer shall not\r\nmake false, misleading, or deceptive communications about lawyer or lawyer's\r\nservices: communication violates this rule if it contains a material\r\nmisrepresentation of fact or law, or omits fact necessary to make statement\r\nconsidered as a whole not materially misleading); Rule 7.1(c) (lawyer shall not\r\nmake false, misleading, or deceptive communications about lawyer or lawyer's\r\nservices: communication violates this rule if it compares the lawyer’s services with\r\nother lawyers’ services, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated); Rule\r\n7.4(b) (lawyer who is not certified as a specialist by the Supreme Court of South\r\nCarolina may not advertise or publicly state lawyer is a “specialist” or “expert” );\r\nRule 7.5(a) (lawyer shall not use firm name, letterhead or other professional\r\ndesignation that is false, misleading, or deceptive); Rule 7.5(b) (law firm with\r\n\r\n1 The Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, are applicable as\r\nrespondent's advertising and solicitation specifically targeted prospective clients in\r\nSouth Carolina. See Rule 418(b), SCACR (any advertising or solicitation by\r\nunlicensed lawyer shall comply with Rules 7.1 through 7.5 of RPC when\r\nadvertising or solicitation is targeted to potential client in this state).\r\n\noffices in more than one jurisdiction shall indicate jurisdictional limitations of\r\nlawyers not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located);\r\nRule 7.5(d) (lawyer may state or imply that lawyer practices in a partnership or\r\nother organization only when that is the fact); and Rule 8.1(b) (in connection with\r\ndisciplinary matter, lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand\r\nfrom disciplinary authority).\r\n\r\nThe Hearing Panel further found respondent is subject to discipline pursuant to the\r\nfollowing Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule\r\n7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional\r\nConduct or other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of\r\nlawyers) and Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully\r\nviolate valid order of Commission or hearing panel, willfully fail to appear\r\npersonally as directed, or knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand from\r\ndisciplinary authority to include request for response or appearance).\r\n\r\n                                     Discussion\r\n\r\nThe Commission and this Court have jurisdiction over all allegations that a lawyer\r\nhas committed misconduct. The term \"lawyer\" includes \"a lawyer not admitted in\r\nthis jurisdiction if the lawyer …offers to provide any legal services in this\r\njurisdiction [and] anyone whose advertisement or solicitations are subject to Rule\r\n418, SCACR.\" Rule 2(q), RLDE. Further, Rule 418, SCACR, titled \"Advertising\r\nand Solicitation by Unlicensed Lawyers\" defines \"unlicensed lawyer\" as an\r\nindividual \"admitted to practice law in another jurisdiction but…not…in South\r\nCarolina.\" Rule 418(a). The rule also provides for jurisdiction over allegations of\r\nmisconduct by unlicensed lawyers, procedures for determining charges of\r\nmisconduct, and for sanctions. Rule 418(c) and (d). Accordingly, even though she\r\nis not admitted to practice law in South Carolina, respondent is subject to\r\ndiscipline in this state.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, since respondent failed to answer the Formal Charges, she is\r\ndeemed to have admitted the allegations in the charges. See Rule 24(a), RLDE.\r\nFurther, since she failed to appear for the Panel Hearing, respondent is deemed to\r\nhave admitted the factual allegations and to have conceded the merits of any\r\nrecommendations considered at the Panel Hearing. See Rule 24(b), RLDE.\r\nFinally, since respondent did not file a brief taking exception to the Hearing Panel's\r\nreport, she has accepted the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the Hearing\r\nPanel's recommendations. See Rule 27(a), RLDE.\r\n\nThe authority to discipline lawyers and the manner in which the discipline is\r\nimposed is a matter within the Court's discretion. In the Matter of Berger, 2014\r\nWL 1386688 (2014); In the Matter of Van Son, 403 S.C. 170, 742 S.E.2d 660\r\n(2013). When the lawyer is in default, the Court need only determine the\r\nappropriate sanction. Id.\r\n\r\nThe misconduct in this matter is similar to that in In the Matter of Van Son, id.,\r\nwhere a lawyer who was not admitted in this state sent solicitation letters to at least\r\ntwo South Carolina residents and, thereafter, failed to cooperate with ODC's\r\ninvestigation. In addition to other sanctions, the Court barred the lawyer from\r\nadmission in this state and from advertising or soliciting clients in South Carolina\r\nfor a period of five years.\r\n\r\nIn the current matter, not only did respondent target residents of South Carolina\r\nthrough various forms of advertising including radio communications and print\r\nmedia, but she also held herself out as licensed to practice law in this state,\r\nwelcomed clients with criminal and family law concerns, and sent letters on behalf\r\nof clients addressed to state court judges. Further, when she did participate in the\r\ndisciplinary investigation, respondent made false statements of material fact\r\nconcerning the extent of her practice and the extent of her advertising in South\r\nCarolina to ODC. Since then, respondent has failed to cooperate in the disciplinary\r\ninvestigation and to appear for the hearing. In the Matter of Hall, 333.S.C. 247,\r\n251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998) (\"An attorney's failure to answer charges or\r\nappear to defend or explain alleged misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in\r\nthe practice of law. Such an attorney is likely to face the most severe sanctions\r\nbecause a central purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from\r\nunscrupulous or indifferent lawyers.\").\r\n\r\nWe find it appropriate to permanently debar respondent from seeking any form of\r\nadmission to practice law in this state (including pro hac vice admission) without\r\nfirst obtaining an order from this Court allowing her to seek admission. Further,\r\nwe prohibit respondent from advertising or soliciting business in South Carolina\r\nwithout first obtaining an order from this Court allowing her to advertise or solicit\r\nbusiness in this state. Before seeking an order from this Court to either allow her\r\nto seek admission or to advertise or solicit, respondent shall complete the South\r\nCarolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Advertising\r\nSchool. Respondent shall pay the costs of the investigation and prosecution of this\r\nmatter by ODC and the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\norder.\r\n\nDISCIPLINE IMPOSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27432","title":"In the Matter of Eric J.

Davidson, of Baltimore, Maryland, pro se\r\n             Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney discipline matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) filed formal charges against Eric J. Davidson (Respondent) based\r\non allegations of misconduct. On July 9, 2012, Respondent was served with a\r\nnotice of filing of formal charges and formal charges by certified mail. After two\r\nextensions, Respondent did not file an answer.\r\n\r\n       By administrative order dated December 14, 2012, the Commission on\r\nLawyer Conduct (the Commission) declared Respondent in default for failing to\r\nrespond to the formal charges against him; thus, it deemed the facts contained in\r\nthe formal charges admitted.1\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (\"Failure to answer the formal charges\r\nshall constitute an admission of the allegations. On motion of disciplinary counsel,\r\nthe administrative chair may issue a default order setting a hearing to determine the\r\nappropriate sanction to recommend to the Supreme Court.\").\r\n\n       On February 26, 2013, a Panel of the Commission (the Panel) held a hearing\r\nto determine the appropriate sanctions. Following this hearing, the Panel\r\nrecommended that Respondent be disbarred, as well as other conditions.\r\n\r\n      We adopt the Panel's recommendation of disbarment.\r\n\r\n                        FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n      A. Complaint\r\n\r\n      Respondent hired a lawyer to represent him in a domestic matter (the\r\ndomestic lawyer). After the representation ended, the domestic lawyer hired\r\nanother lawyer (the settlement lawyer) to collect unpaid attorneys' fees from\r\nRespondent. The settlement lawyer negotiated an agreement with Respondent\r\nwhereby Respondent agreed to pay the domestic lawyer two payments of $2,000.\r\n\r\n       In January 2009, Respondent made the first payment. In March 2009,\r\nRespondent sent the settlement lawyer the second $2,000 payment. Upon receipt\r\nof the check, the settlement lawyer noticed that Respondent wrote the check from\r\nhis trust account. He telephoned Respondent, who stated that he had earned a fee\r\nand that he was paying his settlement obligation from that fee. The settlement\r\nlawyer informed Respondent that it was improper to pay his personal obligations\r\ndirectly from a trust account, even if it was an earned fee. Respondent agreed to\r\nreplace the trust account check with a personal check. Respondent asked the\r\nsettlement lawyer if he could wire the payment directly into his account. The\r\nsettlement lawyer agreed, and Respondent completed the wire transaction. When\r\nthe settlement lawyer later received confirmation from his bank, he noticed that the\r\npayment again drew on Respondent's trust account. Therefore, the settlement\r\nlawyer filed a complaint with ODC.\r\n\r\n      B. Financial Recordkeeping Investigation\r\n\r\n       As a result of the complaint, ODC initiated an investigation and uncovered\r\nfurther financial misconduct. From 1988 until 2003, Respondent was a partner in a\r\nlaw firm practicing general litigation and real estate. From the Fall of 2003 until\r\nApril 2004, Respondent had a solo practice, but kept open various trust accounts\r\nfrom his prior partnership. In 2004, Respondent entered into a new partnership in\r\nwhich he held a majority interest, Davidson & Bradshaw. Respondent continued\r\nto practice in the area of real estate law, while his new law partner handled tax,\r\nbusiness, and estate matters at the firm. Davidson & Bradshaw opened several\r\n\ntrust accounts for use by the firm, but Respondent kept open various trust accounts\r\nfrom his prior law firms.\r\n\r\n       In June 2009, Respondent moved to Maryland.2 In February 2010, he began\r\nto perform legal work for a nonprofit agency; however, Davidson & Bradshaw\r\ncontinued to operate until September 2010.\r\n\r\n       Until 2004, Respondent's title insurance company reconciled some of his\r\ntrust accounts; other trust accounts were not reconciled. From 2004 until 2007,\r\nRespondent did not reconcile any of his trust accounts. In 2007, Respondent hired\r\na bookkeeper to reconcile the Davidson & Bradshaw's trust accounts; however,\r\nRespondent did not supervise the reconciliation process and did not review any\r\nreports from the bookkeeper. Moreover, Respondent did not make arrangements\r\nfor the bookkeeper to reconcile several of the trust accounts he kept open from his\r\nformer law practices, some of which still contained client funds.\r\n\r\n       In addition, paralegals employed by Davidson & Bradshaw prepared\r\nsettlement statements for Respondent's real estate closings, entered the data into\r\nbookkeeping software, and prepared disbursement checks from an account\r\ndesignated as the real estate trust account. Respondent's paralegals were given\r\nsignatory authority on this real estate trust account. Respondent did not verify that\r\nchecks matched settlement statements prior to closing or disbursement and failed\r\nto ensure that all earned fees were withdrawn from the trust account in a timely\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, Respondent did not maintain an accounting journal, accurate\r\nclient ledgers, bank statements, images of canceled checks, or deposit records as\r\nrequired by Rule 417, SCACR. Likewise, Respondent failed to identify and\r\ncorrect numerous discrepancies in various client transactions because the accounts\r\nwere not being properly reconciled.\r\n\r\n       When Respondent moved to Maryland in 2009, he took no steps to disburse\r\nthe funds in the old trust accounts or make any steps to close the accounts. One of\r\nthose trust accounts contained positive ledger balances, or undispersed client\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 At oral arguments before the Court, Respondent stated that, even at the time of\r\nthe formation of the partnership, it had always been his intention to \"phase out\" his\r\nwork at Davidson & Bradshaw and move into the non-profit sector.\r\n\nfunds, dating to 2004 and totaling approximately $1,000. That account also had\r\nthirteen outstanding checks totaling approximately $3,600 dating to November\r\n2005. Another old trust account contained a balance of approximately $41,000.\r\nThe limited records provided by Respondent indicate that, with respect to that trust\r\naccount, there were (1) 95 outstanding checks totaling approximately $21,000 and\r\ndating to 2003; (2) approximately $25,000 in positive ledger balances, or\r\nundispersed client funds, some as old as ten years; (3) seven negative ledger\r\nbalances totaling approximately $1,900; and (4) approximately $5,600 in\r\nunidentified transactions. Respondent did not produce any bank statements for this\r\naccount. Since the initiation of these proceedings, Respondent has neither\r\nproduced an accounting of these funds, nor personally attempted to reconcile this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n      A final trust account has had a balance of over $10,000 since at least\r\n2008. Respondent did not produce any reconciliations of this account or an\r\naccounting of these funds.3\r\n\r\n       Based on these facts, ODC alleged that Respondent engaged in misconduct\r\nas defined in Rule 7(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in that he violated the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rules 1.15, 8.4(d), and 8.4(e); and Rules\r\n7(a)(1) and 7(a)(5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                             Panel's Recommendation\r\n\r\n       Respondent did not appear before the Panel, and therefore the Panel deemed\r\nhim to have admitted the factual allegations and conceded the merits of the\r\nallegations of misconduct.4 Therefore, the Panel found Respondent violated the\r\n\r\n3During ODC's investigation, Respondent provided limited financial records to\r\nODC. Rather, his former law partner provided the requisite information to the best\r\nof his ability, as he was unaware of the existence of all of the former trust\r\naccounts. He further participated in the investigation as to all of the accounts\r\nowned by Davidson & Bradshaw. ODC did not uncover any wrongdoing by\r\nRespondent's former law partner.\r\n4See Rule 24(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (\"If the respondent should fail to\r\nappear when specifically so ordered by the hearing panel . . . , the respondent shall\r\nbe deemed to have admitted the factual allegations which were to be the subject of\r\n\nfollowing Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.15\r\n(Safekeeping Property), Rule 8.4(d) (Conduct involving Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit\r\nor Misrepresentation), and Rule 8.4(e) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration\r\nof Justice). The Panel also determined the Respondent violated Rule 417, SCACR\r\n(Financial Recordkeeping).\r\n\r\n       The Panel considered two aggravating circumstances: Respondent's prior\r\ndisciplinary offenses5 and Respondent's failure to answer the formal charges or\r\nappear at the hearing.\r\n\r\n       Based on these findings, the Panel recommended that this Court: (1) disbar\r\nRespondent from the practice of law; (2) order Respondent, within 120 days of this\r\norder, to file a report of outstanding client obligations and unidentified funds in all\r\ntrust accounts, including documentation demonstrating that Respondent has fully\r\ndisbursed any remaining client funds from all accounts and will close those\r\naccounts; (3) order Respondent to pay restitution to any clients who were\r\nunderpaid; (4) order Respondent to pay any unidentified funds to the Lawyers'\r\nFund for Client Protection; and (5) pay the costs of these proceedings.\r\n\r\n                                     DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n       The sole authority to discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions\r\nrests with this Court. In re Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 96, 584 S.E.2d 369, 370 (2003); In\r\nre Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10–11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000). We are not bound\r\nby the Panel's recommendation and may make our own findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law. In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102, 106 (2008).\r\nNonetheless, the findings and conclusions of the Panel are entitled much respect\r\nand consideration. Thompson, 343 S.C. at 11, 539 S.E.2d at 401.\r\n\r\nsuch appearance and to have conceded the merits of any motion or\r\nrecommendations to be considered at such appearance.\").\r\n5 Respondent's disciplinary history includes an admonition in 2001 citing Rules 1.7\r\n(Conflict of Interest: Current Clients) and 1.9 (Duties to Former Clients) of the\r\nRules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR; and an admonition in 2006\r\nciting Rules 1.5 (Fees), 4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others), 8.4(a)\r\n(Violating the Rules of Professional Conduct), 8.4(b) (Criminal Act Reflecting\r\nAdversely on Lawyer's Honesty), and 8.4(e) (Conduct Prejudicial to the\r\nAdministration of Justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\n       We agree with the Panel that Respondent committed misconduct with\r\nrespect to the matters discussed above. While Respondent appeared and\r\nrepresented himself at the hearing before this Court, he took no exception to the\r\nPanel's findings. Accordingly, he is \"deemed to have accepted the Panel's findings\r\nof fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations\" as to these matters. In re\r\nPrendergast, 390 S.C. 395, 396 n.2, 702 S.E.2d 364, 365 n.2 (2010) (citing Rule\r\n27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, which states, \"The failure of a party to file a brief\r\ntaking exceptions to the report constitutes acceptance of the findings of fact,\r\nconclusions of law, and recommendations.\").\r\n\r\n       Thus, we find Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional\r\nConduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping Property); Rule 8.4(d)\r\n(Conduct involving Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation), and Rule\r\n8.4(e) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice); and Rule\r\n417,SCACR (Financial Recordkeeping).\r\n\r\n      Respondent's misconduct, coupled with his failure to cooperate with or\r\nanswer the ODC investigation, failure to appear before the Panel, and failure to\r\nprovide any explanation for his lack of diligence in resolving this disciplinary\r\nmatter, warrant disbarment from the practice of law.6\r\n\r\n       This Court has recognized that \"the primary purpose of disbarment . . . is the\r\nremoval of an unfit person from the profession for the protection of the courts and\r\nthe public, not punishment of the offending attorney.\" In re Pennington, 393 S.C.\r\n300, 304, 713 S.E.2d 261, 263 (2011) (citing In re Burr, 267 S.C. 419, 423, 228\r\nS.E.2d 678, 680 (1976)). Moreover, a central purpose of the disciplinary process is\r\nto protect the public from unscrupulous and indifferent lawyers. In re Hall, 333\r\nS.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998). In Hall, this Court said:\r\n\r\n      An attorney usually does not abandon a license to practice law\r\n      without a fight. Those who do must understand that \"neglecting to\r\n      participate in a disciplinary proceeding is entitled to substantial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Currently, Respondent is administratively suspended from the practice of law for\r\nfailing to pay his bar dues and comply with Continuing Legal Education\r\nrequirements.\r\n\n      weight in determining the sanction.\" An attorney's failure to answer\r\n      charges or appear to defend or explain alleged misconduct indicates\r\n      an obvious disinterest in the practice of law. Such an attorney is likely\r\n      to face the most severe sanctions . . . .\r\n\r\n333 S.C. at 251, 509 S.E.2d at 268 (quoting Matter of Sifly, 279 S.C. 113, 115, 302\r\nS.E.2d 858, 859 (1983)) (alterations in original).\r\n\r\n       Not only did Respondent abandon his practice without proper closure, but he\r\nthen failed to engage in these disciplinary proceedings, despite asking for\r\nnumerous extensions of time. During oral arguments before this Court, he could\r\nnot explain his indifference toward resolving this matter. Therefore, at that time,\r\nODC took exception to the Panel's recommendation that Respondent be given 120\r\ndays to reconcile his trust accounts, and instead requested that the Court appoint a\r\nreceiver to handle the reconciliation of his trust accounts and proper disbursement\r\nof the funds therein. We agree with ODC that Respondent has been given\r\nnumerous opportunities to reconcile his accounts, and even though it is in his best\r\ninterests to do so, he has not.7 We find that the appointment of a receiver would\r\nbest facilitate the closure of these accounts.\r\n\r\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Therefore, Respondent is disbarred. Respondent is further ordered to pay\r\nthe costs of these proceedings within 60 days. Furthermore, a receiver shall be\r\nappointed by separate order to reconcile Respondent's files and accounts, pay\r\nrestitution to any clients who were underpaid, or otherwise disperse funds from the\r\naccounts according their ownership. In the event that unidentified funds remain in\r\nthe accounts, at the end of his appointment, the receiver will relinquish those funds\r\nto the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, until the claims period expires.\r\n\r\n       Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\naffidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of\r\nRule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the\r\nPractice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7Based on the limited records in the possession of ODC, most of the funds in these\r\naccounts appear to belong to Respondent.\r\n\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27433","title":"Stevens v.

Harpootlian and Graham L. Newman, both of\r\n   Richard A. Harpootlian, PA, of Columbia, for\r\n   Respondent.\r\n\nJUSTICE HEARN: This case arises from a grant of partial summary judgment in\r\nfavor of an architectural firm finding a contract existed between it and the City of\r\nColumbia. On certiorari, the City concedes a contract exists, but argues the\r\ncontract terms have been satisfied. We find the City's arguments are unpreserved\r\nand affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       In April 2003, the City entered into a Memorandum of Understanding\r\n(MOU) with Stevens & Wilkinson of South Carolina, Inc. (S&W) and several\r\nother parties, to develop a publicly-funded hotel adjacent to the Columbia\r\nMetropolitan Convention Center. As architect, S&W was to complete sufficient\r\npreliminary design work to determine a guaranteed maximum price for the project,\r\nwhich would be used by the City to obtain municipal bond funding to cover the\r\ncost of the hotel. Pursuant to the MOU, the construction company was to pay\r\nS&W directly. On June 26, 2003, the City received a letter stating S&W would\r\ncomplete its preliminary design on July 10, 2003, and would thereupon cease\r\nfurther work until the bond financing for the hotel was finalized. Realizing this\r\ncould delay the start of construction, S&W offered to continue working the\r\nremaining ninety days until the anticipated bond closing date of October 13, 2003,\r\nbut required assurance it would be compensated for the work it performed during\r\nthis time frame. It provided an estimate requiring $650,000 through October 13\r\nand $75,000 per week after that. On July 30, the City approved \"$650,000 for\r\ninterim architectural design services for a period of 90 days prior to bond closing.\"\r\n\r\n       The bond closing did not occur as scheduled, but S&W nevertheless\r\ncontinued to work. On December 16, 2003, S&W submitted an invoice to the City\r\nfor $697,084.79 for work that took place from July 10 to December 15, 2003. By\r\nletter dated December 17, 2003, S&W informed the construction company that the\r\nCity had voted that day \"to advance [$705,000.000] to the design team for design\r\nservices and expenses at cost covering the time period between July 10, 2003 to\r\nDecember 15, 2003.\" Because under the MOU the construction company was to\r\npay S&W, not the City, the construction company agreed to reimburse the City for\r\nthe funds paid to S&W after the bond closing. The City remitted $697,084.79\r\ndirectly to S&W later that month. S&W continued to work on the project, but in\r\nMarch 2004, the City abandoned its plans under the MOU and ended its\r\nrelationship with S&W. S&W received no further compensation and sued the City\r\n\nfor breach of contract under the MOU and the July 2003 agreement.1 S&W then\r\nmoved for partial summary judgment arguing it had a contract with the City as a\r\nmatter of law based on the performance of and payment for architectural design\r\nservices agreed to in July 2003. S&W's motion clarified that it only sought\r\nresolution of whether there was a contract, and did not seek summary judgment on\r\nthe issue of breach or damages.\r\n\r\n       The City argued there was no separate agreement and the payment of interim\r\nfees was merely an advance on fees under the MOU and furthermore, the MOU\r\nprovided that S&W was to be paid by the construction company, not the City. The\r\ncircuit court agreed with S&W and granted partial summary judgment on the sole\r\nissue of the existence of a contract under the July 2003 agreement. Specifically,\r\nthe court found S&W made an offer by delivering its estimate to the City, and the\r\nCity accepted the offer, \"albeit on seemingly modified terms,\" by voting to\r\nauthorize the $650,000.\r\n\r\n      The City filed a Rule 59(e) motion, abandoning the argument that there was\r\nno contract. For the first time, the City argued the authorization of the $650,000\r\ncould not constitute an acceptance on \"seemingly modified terms\" because any\r\nmodification of the terms resulted in a counteroffer, which S&W accepted by\r\nperformance. It further argued that because S&W accepted by performance, the\r\nterms were limited to the counteroffer of $650,000. Because S&W had already\r\nbeen paid that sum, the City argued the court should find the City had fully\r\nperformed and the contract was satisfied.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court denied the motion, finding the City never argued the\r\nauthorization of payment was a counteroffer and consistent with settled principles,\r\nit would not consider new theories in a Rule 59(e) motion. It further declined to\r\naddress satisfaction of the contract because the issue of breach and damages was\r\nnot before the court, only the issue of the existence of a contract.\r\n\r\n      The City appealed and the court of appeals affirmed the circuit court as\r\nmodified, adopting the City's position that the agreement to pay $650,000 was a\r\ncounteroffer which S&W accepted by performance. Stevens & Wilkinson of South\r\nCarolina, Inc. v. City of Columbia, Op. No. 2011-UP-519 (S.C. Ct. App. filed\r\nNovember 29, 2011). However, the court declined to address the issue of\r\n\r\n1 The breach of contract claim under the MOU is the subject of this Court's opinion\r\nin Stevens & Wilkinson of South Carolina, Inc. v. City of Columbia, Op. No. x\r\n(S.C. Sup. Ct. filed x).\r\n\nsatisfaction on preservation grounds and remanded to the circuit court for\r\ndetermination of the terms of the contract, whether it had been breached, and if so,\r\nthe amount of damages. Id. We granted certiorari.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n       Did the court of appeals err in declining to find the City's counteroffer\r\nconstituted the final terms of the contract and accordingly find the contract\r\nobligations satisfied?           LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       Although this appeal arises from the grant of S&W's motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment finding a contract existed between the parties, we note that the\r\nCity now concedes this very issue. The City instead argues the court of appeals\r\nerred in remanding the case for determination of the terms of the contract because\r\nS&W accepted the City's counteroffer for payment of $650,000 and there was no\r\nevidence that agreement was modified. Therefore, the City asks the Court to hold\r\nthe contract has been satisfied. We decline to address this issue because it is not\r\nproperly before us.\r\n\r\n       Issue preservation rules are designed to give the trial court a fair opportunity\r\nto rule on the issues, and thus provide the Court with a platform for meaningful\r\nappellate review. Herron v. Century BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 465, 719 S.E.2d 640,\r\n642 (2012). \"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\nappeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\npreserved for appellate review.\" Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497\r\nS.E.2d 731, 733 (1998). Furthermore, a party cannot use a Rule 59(e) motion to\r\nadvance an issue the party could have raised to the circuit court prior to judgment,\r\nbut did not. Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1990).\r\n\r\n      As an initial matter, we hold it was error for the court of appeals to consider\r\nthe City's argument that the agreement to pay $650,000 constituted a counteroffer.\r\nThe circuit court, relying on well-settled precedent, declined to reach this issue\r\nbecause it was improperly raised for the first time in the Rule 59(e) motion. The\r\ncourt of appeals should have refused to entertain that theory as well for the same\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n     Similarly, we find equally unpreserved the City's request that this Court\r\ndeem the terms of the contract satisfied. The issue before the circuit court was\r\n\nlimited to the existence of a contract. The initial order explicitly states: \"Whereas\r\nthe existence of a contract between [S&W] and [the City] as a result of the July 30,\r\n2003 agreement is the only issue now before the court, the Court hereby grants\r\n[S&W's] motion for partial summary judgment.\" (emphasis added). Furthermore,\r\nin the order denying the Rule 59(e) motion, the court declined to find the contract\r\nwas satisfied and reiterated that the \"previous order did not rule on the question of\r\nthe breach of contract or any damages related thereto. Thus it would be\r\ninappropriate [to] extend a ruling in this case.\" We agree with the circuit court and\r\nemploy the same restraint. It is improper for the City to concede the sole issue\r\nbefore the circuit court and attempt to inject new issues and theories on appeal.\r\nS&W never had the opportunity to present an argument on the exact terms of the\r\ncontract, how the contract was breached, and what damages flowed from that\r\nbreach. Those were not the questions before the circuit court and we will not allow\r\nthem to now be placed before us. CONCLUSION\r\n      We therefore affirm the court of appeals' opinion as modified and hold\r\nS&W's estimate to continue services constituted an offer and the City's\r\nauthorization to pay $650,000 in interim architectural design services served as an\r\nacceptance. We remand the case for further proceedings for determination of the\r\nterms of the contract and whether the contract has been satisfied or damages should\r\nbe awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27434","title":"Stevens v.

The City eventually abandoned its\r\nplan under the MOU, and the respondents brought suit on several causes of action\r\nincluding breach of contract and equitable relief. The City moved for summary\r\njudgment arguing the MOU was not a contract and therefore the contract claims\r\nfailed. The circuit court agreed and, rejecting the equitable claims as well, granted\r\nsummary judgment in favor of the City. The respondents appealed and the court of\r\nappeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. Stevens & Wilkinson of South\r\nCarolina, Inc. v. City of Columbia, 396 S.C. 338, 721 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\nWe reverse.      FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       In January of 2001, the City, seeking a team to develop a publicly-funded,\r\nfull-service hotel adjacent to the convention center, issued a request for\r\nqualifications. The City settled on a project team in December of 2002 that\r\nconsisted of the architectural firm of Stevens & Wilkinson of South Carolina, Inc.\r\n(S&W); Turner Construction Company; Hilton Hotels Corporation; the\r\nunderwriter Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.; and three developers—Edens & Avant\r\nReal Estate Services LLC; Garfield Traub Development, LLC; and Gary Realty\r\nCompany Inc.\r\n\r\n      In April of 2003, the City and the project team members entered into the\r\nMOU. The MOU documented \"the understandings reached with respect to the\r\nfinancing, development and operation of the Hotel.\" It contemplated multiple\r\nfuture agreements to fully define the duties of the parties—the Development\r\nManagement Agreement, the Design/Build Agreement, the Qualified Management\r\nAgreement, and the HQ Hotel Room Block Commitment, a joint use agreement for\r\nparking, and a bond financing agreement. At the outset, the MOU provided:\r\n\n      This MOU reflects the intent to proceed in good faith to execute\r\n      definitive written agreements with respect to the business terms and\r\n      conditions herein contained. Notwithstanding anything herein to the\r\n      contrary, if the City determines that is it not feasible to proceed with\r\n      the Hotel project it shall have no liability under this MOU.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the MOU illustrated the roles of the signatories. The City was to\r\nacquire the land and prepare it for construction, establish a non-profit corporation\r\nto own the Hotel and issue bonds for financing, and \"retain [Salomon] and legal\r\ncounsel to structure and issue approximately $60 million in tax exempt hotel\r\nrevenue bonds.\" Under the MOU, the \"Developer\"—Edens, Garfield, and Gary—\r\n\"will coordinate design, development, construction and delivery of Hotel in\r\naccordance with the terms of the Development Management Agreement to be\r\nfinalized between the City or [non-profit corporation].\" S&W, the architect, \"shall\r\ndevelop and implement a design review process.\"\r\n\r\n      The MOU also addressed payment of the project team, stating:\r\n\r\n      The Project Team will be responsible for the costs incurred prior to\r\n      closing the financing. . . . If Hotel financing fails to close as a result\r\n      of the City not meeting its obligations outlined in the Development\r\n      Management Agreement, . . . the City will reimburse the Project Team\r\n      for actual, documented costs incurred to that point up to an amount to\r\n      be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the MOU clarified any payment to S&W, Turner, or Salomon was\r\ncontingent upon Salomon successfully closing the bond financing. The MOU also\r\nstated: \"All studies, tests, plans and the like prepared or obtained by the Project\r\nTeam will be assigned to and become property of the City.\"\r\n\r\n      The parties began negotiating the contracts required under the MOU during\r\nthe course of the next year. S&W completed its initial design thereby allowing\r\nTurner to determine the guaranteed maximum price of the project as envisioned\r\nunder the MOU, and that price was approved by the City in July 2003. S&W\r\ninformed the City it would cease design work for the ninety days remaining until\r\nthe bond financing closed unless the City agreed to compensate it for work\r\nperformed in the interim. S&W submitted an estimate of $650,000 to continue\r\nworking until the anticipated bond closing and $75,000 per week after that. On\r\nJuly 30, 2003, the city council voted to approve \"$650,000 for interim architectural\r\ndesign.\"\r\n\n       Over the course of the negotiations, the bond issuance required to fund the\r\nproject rose from the $60 million estimated in the MOU to $71 million by\r\nFebruary 2004. Nevertheless, the non-profit organization accepted the financing\r\nplan for the $71 million and set the bond closing date as April 1, 2004. However,\r\nby mid-March the estimate had climbed to above $72 million. A little over a week\r\nafter receiving this most recent financial report, the City issued a new request for\r\nproposals to develop a privately-funded hotel for the convention center.\r\nUltimately Windsor/Aughtry Co., Inc. was chosen as the developer and it\r\nsuccessfully constructed the Hilton.\r\n\r\n       S&W sued the City for breach of contract based on the MOU and the July 30\r\nagreement, and on the equitable grounds of quantum meruit and estoppel.1 Gary\r\nand Garfield also sued the City for quantum meruit and breach of the duty of good\r\nfaith, later adding a breach of contract claim. The City moved for summary\r\njudgment arguing the MOU was not a contract, it retained no benefit from the work\r\nof the project team, and the MOU contained no promise to pay S&W.\r\n\r\n       In a consolidated order, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor\r\nof the City on all claims.2 Specifically, the court found the MOU was not a\r\nbinding contract, and instead was a nonbinding agreement to agree in the future. It\r\nfurther held that the respondents failed to present any evidence they had conferred\r\na benefit on the City, and that S&W failed to prove a promise to pay existed within\r\nthe MOU or that reliance on the MOU for payment was reasonable.\r\n\r\n      S&W appealed the issue of whether the MOU was a contract and the issue\r\nof promissory estoppel. Gary and Garfield appealed the issue of whether the MOU\r\nwas a contract and their claim for quantum meruit. The court of appeals affirmed\r\nin part and reversed in part. Stevens, 396 S.C. at 340, 338 S.E.2d at 456. The\r\ncourt affirmed the grant of summary judgment on S&W's claim for promissory\r\n\r\n1 S&W moved for partial summary judgment arguing the July 30 agreement\r\ncreated a contract between it and the City. That case is the subject of our opinion\r\nin Stevens & Wilkinson of South Carolina, Inc. v. City of Columbia, Op. No. 27433\r\n(S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 20, 2014).\n\r\n2 Turner Construction also filed suit against the City for breach of contract, \n\r\nquantum meruit, contract implied by law, and breach of the duty of good faith and \n\r\nfair dealing. Turner's case was consolidated with the respondents' cases and it \n\r\nsimply joined the arguments of the respondents at the hearing. It did not file an \n\r\nappeal. \n\r\n\nestoppel. Id. It held the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on the\r\ngrounds the MOU is not a contract, finding there was conflicting evidence as to\r\nwhether the parties intended to create a binding contract, and therefore reversed\r\nand remanded on that issue. Id. at 344, 721 S.E.2d at 458. The court of appeals\r\nalso reversed the grant of summary judgment on Gary and Garfield's quantum\r\nmeruit claims, stating it could not rule as a matter of law the City retained no\r\nbenefit. Id. at 347, 721 S.E.2d at 460. The Court granted certiorari to review the\r\ncourt of appeals' opinion.     ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n   I.\t      Did the court of appeals err in finding a genuine issue of material fact\r\n            existed as to whether the MOU is a binding contract?\r\n\r\n   II.\t     Did the court of appeals err in reversing the circuit court's grant of\r\n            summary judgment in favor of the City on Gary and Garfield's claim for\r\n            quantum meruit?  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n      \"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which\r\ndo not require the services of a fact finder.\" Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69,\r\n580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003). On review from a grant of summary judgment, the\r\nCourt applies the same standard applied by the circuit court pursuant to Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP. Knight v. Austin, 396 S.C. 518, 521–22, 722 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2012).\r\nAccordingly, summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions,\r\naffidavits, and discovery prove there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\r\nmovant must prevail as a matter of law. Id. In reviewing the evidence, all\r\ninferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id.\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t      MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\r\n\r\n          A. Extrinsic Evidence\r\n       Initially, the City argues the court of appeals erred in looking outside the\r\nfour corners of the MOU to determine whether it constituted a binding contract.\r\nBecause we find the MOU is unambiguously not an enforceable contract, we\r\nagree.\r\n\n       \"Where an agreement is clear on its face and unambiguous, the court's only\r\nfunction is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found\r\nwithin the agreement.\" Miles v. Miles, 393 S.C. 111, 117, 711 S.E.2d 880, 883\r\n(2011) (quotation omitted). Where the contract language is plain and capable of\r\nlegal construction, that language alone determines the instrument's force and effect.\r\nJordan v. Sec. Grp., Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993).\r\n\r\n       The respondents argue the MOU is a complete contract, lacking no material\r\nterms and the MOU itself claims it fully \"identifies the understandings of the\r\nparties.\" Although the majority of case law addressing extrinsic evidence pertains\r\nto contract construction and not the existence of a contract, the inquiry in both\r\ninstances involves giving force and effect to the intent of the parties, and we\r\ndiscern no reason for different rules of analysis.3 As this Court has stated:\r\n\r\n            When a writing, upon its face, imports to be a complete\r\n      expression of the whole agreement, and contains thereon all that is\r\n      necessary to constitute a contract, it is presumed that the parties have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The respondents rely heavily on Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460,\r\n611 S.E.2d 905 (2005), for the proposition that \"when the existence of a contract is\r\ndisputed or its terms are ambiguous, evidence that a party complied with the terms\r\nof the alleged contract or acted in conformity therewith is relevant and admissible\r\non the issues of the contract's existence, the meaning of its terms, and whether the\r\ncontract was breached.\" Id. at 473, 611 S.E.2d at 912. The facts of Conner are\r\ninapposite. Conner was a so-called \"employee handbook claim\" which dealt with\r\nthe termination of an employee and posed the question of whether evidence of the\r\nemployer's grievance procedures was admissible in determining whether the\r\nemployee handbook provisions constituted contractual terms. Id. at 473, 611\r\nS.E.2d at 912. The employee contended the handbook modified the terms of her\r\nexisting at-will employment contract, and therefore the Court held evidence that\r\nthe employer followed the procedures within the handbook was probative of the\r\nintent to treat the handbook as contractual. Id. at 473, 611 S.E.2d at 911.\r\nTherefore, Conner addressed contract modification, not whether a single document\r\nconstituted a contract.\r\n\n      introduced into it every material item and term, and parol evidence is\r\n      not admissible to add another term to the agreement, although the\r\n      writing contains nothing on the particular item to which the parol\r\n      evidence is directed.\r\n\r\nGladden v. Keistler, 141 S.C. 524, 542, 140 S.E. 161, 167 (1927). We accordingly\r\nhold that where the language of a purported contract clearly expresses the intent to\r\nbe non-binding, the analysis is limited to the four corners of the document.4\r\n\r\n      B. Existence of Enforceable Contract\r\n      The City also argues the court of appeals erred in holding a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact exists as to whether the MOU is a contract. We agree.\r\n\r\n       Although the existence of a contract is ordinarily a question of fact for the\r\njury, where the undisputed facts do not establish a contract, the question becomes\r\none of law. Capital City Garage & Tire Co. v. Elec. Storage Battery Co., 113 S.C.\r\n352, 362, 101 S.E. 838, 841 (1920). A valid and enforceable contract requires a\r\nmeeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all essential and material\r\nterms of the agreement. Patricia Grand Hotel, LLC v. MacGuire Enters, 372 S.C.\r\n634, 638, 643 S.E.2d 692, 694 (Ct. App. 2007). Thus, for a contract to be binding,\r\nmaterial terms cannot be left for future agreement. Aperm of S.C. v. Roof, 290 S.C.\r\n442, 447, 351 S.E.2d 171, 173 (Ct. App. 1986). \"In a contract for services two\r\nessential terms are the scope of the work to be performed and the amount of\r\ncompensation.\" W.E. Gilbert & Assocs. v. S.C. Nat. Bank, 285 S.C. 421, 423, 330\r\nS.E.2d 307, 309 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\n       In reversing the circuit court, the court of appeals focused on the intent of\r\nthe parties, noting that there were mutual promises within the MOU and some\r\nboilerplate contractual language that at least create a genuine issue of material fact\r\nas to whether the parties intended the MOU to be a contract. However, regardless\r\n\r\n4 The dissent contends our holding in some way does violence to the parol\r\nevidence rule as well as the statute of frauds. We disagree. Of course the parol\r\nevidence rule involves actual contracts, not purported ones such as the written\r\nagreement here. We make only the unremarkable assertion that where a written\r\ndocument, by its own terms, unambiguously indicates it is meant to be non-\r\nbinding, we will not allow the introduction of extrinsic evidence in an attempt to\r\ncontradict that clear expression.\r\n\nof intent, an agreement which leaves open material terms is unenforceable. Aperm,\r\n290 S.C. at 447, 351 S.E.2d at 173; 1 Corbin on Contracts § 2.8 (Rev. ed. 1993)\r\n(\"Even if an intention to be bound is manifested by both parties, too much\r\nindefiniteness may invalidate the agreement, because of the difficulty of\r\nadministering the agreement.\"); 1 Corbin on Contracts § 4.1 (\"A court cannot\r\nenforce a contract unless it can determine what it is. It is not enough that the\r\nparties think that they have made a contract. They must have expressed their\r\nintentions in a manner that is capable of being understood.\").\r\n\r\n       Examining the plain language of the document, we find there was no\r\nmeeting of the minds as to all material terms and the MOU is therefore\r\nunenforceable. It is only an agreement to agree in the future outlining the\r\nframework under which the parties would proceed to negotiate the development of\r\nthe hotel. By its own terms, it \"reflects the intent to proceed in good faith to\r\nexecute definitive written agreements with respect to the business terms and\r\nconditions herein contained.\" (emphasis added). The MOU expressly states the\r\nintention to enter into future \"definitive\" agreements, such as the Development\r\nManagement Agreement, the Design/Build Agreement, the Qualified Management\r\nAgreement, and the HQ Hotel Room Block Commitment. Thus, the clear language\r\nof the MOU indicates the parties consciously agreed to finalize binding agreements\r\nat some point in the future.\r\n\r\n      The respondents counter that the MOU provides clear guidelines for the\r\nsubsequent agreement and therefore the MOU is enforceable under Aperm. In that\r\ncase, Aperm of South Carolina, the owner of a roof coating composition and\r\napplication method entered into an option agreement with Roof and granted him\r\nexclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and sell its invention. Aperm,\r\n290 S.C. at 444, 351 S.E.2d at 172. The agreement allowed Roof to terminate the\r\ncontract upon written notice by August 1, otherwise the agreement would become\r\nfixed. Id. Under the agreement, Roof was also required to present Aperm with a\r\ncomprehensive manufacturing and marketing program which conformed to the\r\nagreement's guidelines. Id.\r\n\r\n      The program was required to include minimum royalty payments of\r\n      $4,800.00 per month during the period August 1, 1981 to July 31,\r\n      1982, and increased monthly royalty payments thereafter. The\r\n      marketing and manufacturing program was subject to Aperm's\r\n      approval, but disapproval had to be reasonably related to the\r\n      guidelines set out. The contract stated specifically that if the program\r\n      provided for the minimum royalties, then objections to the program by\r\n\n      Aperm would be subject to arbitration, but if the program failed to\r\n      provide for minimum royalties, Aperm could cancel the contract.\r\n\r\nId. at 444–45, 351 S.E.2d at 172. Roof exercised his rights under the agreement to\r\nproceed therewith, but almost immediately defaulted for failing to pay the required\r\nroyalties to Aperm. Id. at 445, 351 S.E.2d at 172. Aperm sued Roof for breach of\r\ncontract and the trial court awarded damages pursuant to the licensing agreement.\r\nId. at 446, 351 S.E.2d at 173. Roof appealed, arguing the licensing agreement was\r\nmerely an agreement to enter into a contract after August 1 and was therefore\r\nunenforceable. Id. at 446–47, 352 S.E.2d at 173. The court of appeals disagreed,\r\nfinding sufficient guidelines for drafting a subsequent manufacture and marketing\r\nagreement within the licensing agreement to enforce it. Id. at 447, 352 S.E.2d at\r\n174. The court stated that the sine qua non of the manufacture and marketing\r\nprogram was the payment of minimum royalties, noting Aperm agreed to arbitrate\r\nthe other terms. Id.\r\n\r\n       We find this case distinguishable from Aperm. In Aperm, the licensing\r\nagreement clearly set out the specific sum of minimum royalties and clarified that\r\nthis payment was the salient factor for the program. Additionally, the Aperm\r\nagreement only contemplated one future document. Here, the MOU envisions the\r\nparties entering into multiple agreements and describes the intended agreements\r\nwith a fluidity that renders it impossible for a court to anticipate the terms. For\r\nexample, pursuant to the MOU, \"The Developer will coordinate design,\r\ndevelopment, construction and delivery of the Hotel in accordance with the terms\r\nof the Development Management Agreement to be finalized between the City or\r\n[non-profit corporation] and the Developer.\" This leaves the scope of work to be\r\nperformed by the Developer still undefined as it is as yet unclear how it will\r\ndesign, develop, and construct the hotel. We cannot see how merely stating a\r\nforthcoming document will dictate the terms of the \"design, development,\r\nconstruction and delivery\" does not plainly leave material terms undecided. The\r\nwhole project is the design, development, construction, and delivery of the hotel.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5  The respondents claim the Preliminary Development Management Scope of\r\nServices which was an attachment to the MOU, could have been the final\r\nDevelopment Management Agreement. We disagree. That document also lacks\r\nsignificant material terms, including any duties of the City and caps on financial\r\nliability as contemplated in the MOU.\r\n\n       Nor is the scope of S&W's duties clearly defined. The only description of\r\nthe work S&W was to perform under the MOU is to \"develop and implement a\r\ndesign review process\" and contains no specific reference to an actual design.\r\nThere are no guidelines as to what this process should look like, only that it should\r\n\"provide the City, neighborhood and professional staff input into the design of the\r\nhotel.\" The MOU lacks any provisions on actual design duties of S&W and\r\ninstead plainly envisions a subsequent contract between S&W and Turner. It is\r\npursuant to this contract with Turner that S&W would be paid.\r\n\r\n        Furthermore, although initially the parties' compensation appears\r\nascertainable with some certainty, calculating the amounts requires unknown\r\nnumbers. For example, the Developer \"is to be paid a development fee of 4.75%\r\nof the project budget,\" which was undetermined. S&W was to be paid by Turner\r\n\"a fee of 7.25% . . . based on hard construction costs together with [Turner's]\r\ngeneral expenses and fees.\" Aside from the fact Turner, and not the City, was to\r\npay S&W, that amount was based on a sum—costs and fees determined by\r\nTurner—that was yet to be determined. Additionally, the MOU specifically states\r\nin reference to Turner and S&W that \"[i]f the Underwriter does not close the\r\nfinancing, the City will not be responsible for reimbursing any costs incurred\r\n[unless the City breached its duties in the Development Agreement].\" The MOU\r\nfurther clarifies that \"[t]he Project Team will be responsible for the costs incurred\r\nprior to closing the financing. . . . If the Hotel financing fails to close as a result of\r\nthe City not meeting its obligations outlined in the Development Agreement, . . .\r\nthe City will reimburse the Project Team for actual, documented costs incurred to\r\nthat point in time up to an amount to be agreed upon.\" Thus, any possible liability\r\nof the City for costs incurred prior to closing the financing was to be agreed upon\r\nin a future agreement—the Development Agreement. This document would\r\nillustrate the obligations of the City and create liability for any breach.\r\nFurthermore, the document would contain an agreed upon limitation on liability. It\r\nappears the parties all acknowledged the City's liability would be predicated on the\r\nDevelopment Agreement, a forthcoming contract that was never executed.\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, the respondents argue that focusing on the unfilled gaps of the\r\nagreement, such as the bond financing, ignores the fact that one of the duties under\r\nthe MOU was to obtain the bond financing. Essentially, they argue the MOU is\r\ncomprised of interdependent parts that are all promises to perform certain specified\r\nduties to develop a plan for a feasible, publicly-funded hotel. While we agree that\r\nthe determination of many of the terms within the MOU necessarily depend on the\r\n\nexecution of other portions of the MOU, we fail to see how that changes the\r\nanalysis.Frequently, agreements are arrived at piecemeal with different terms\r\n         and items being discussed and agreed upon separately. However, as\r\n         long as the parties know there is an essential term not yet agreed on,\r\n         there is no contract. The preliminary agreements on specific items are\r\n         mere preliminary negotiation building up the terms of the final offer\r\n         that may or may not be made.\r\n\r\n1 Corbin on Contracts § 2.8. From the plain language of the MOU, it is clear the\r\nparties knew material terms still remained to be agreed upon. They were also\r\nundoubtedly aware that payment and reimbursement was contingent upon\r\nobtaining bond financing, which never took place. The parties were in the process\r\nof negotiating a plan to develop the hotel and the MOU simply memorialized how\r\nthe parties planned to proceed in those negotiations toward the execution of\r\nbinding contracts.\r\n\r\n      Because the MOU is simply comprised of agreements to execute further\r\nagreements, there was no meeting of the minds on numerous material terms which\r\nhad not yet been defined. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals and hold\r\nthe MOU is unenforceable as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n   II.      QUANTUM MERUIT\r\n      The City also argues the court of appeals erred in reversing the circuit court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment finding no evidence of a benefit conferred on the City\r\nto maintain Gary and Garfield's quantum meruit claim. We agree.\r\n\r\n       Quantum meruit is an equitable doctrine which allows recovery for unjust\r\nenrichment under a quasi-contract theory. Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder\r\nMay N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994). \"The elements of a\r\nquantum meruit claim are: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the\r\nplaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention by the\r\ndefendant of the benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him to retain it\r\nwithout paying its value.\" Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich, 390 S.C. 609,\r\n616–17, 703 S.E.2d 221, 225 (2010).\r\n\r\n      Gary and Garfield point to plans and drawings prepared by the project team,\r\nas well as their expertise, to argue the City retained a benefit from their services.\r\nAt oral argument, they focused on the site location and orientation of the hotel that\r\n\nwas eventually used. Additionally, they highlight the deposition of the City's Rule\r\n30(b)(6) representative, the assistant city manager, who admitted the City gave a\r\nrendering of the original project team's proposed hotel to Windsor/Aughtry. It is\r\nunclear what Windsor/Aughtry then did with the rendering, but the City manager\r\nnoted the rendering \"looks much like the building, the hotel that we presently\r\nhave.\" Additionally, Raymond Garfield, the founding member of Garfield Traub,\r\nstated in his deposition that Gary and Garfield's work \"gave [the City] the ability to\r\ndistinguish the different financing types, different hotel types\" and the City was\r\n\"educated significantly by [Gary and Garfield and their] team in all respects.\"\r\n\r\n       The circuit court found this was insufficient to create a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact, noting it was not enough to say the constructed building \"looks like\"\r\nthe previous rendering, with no further detail as to specific \"striking similarities.\"\r\nFurthermore, there was no evidence Windsor/Aughtry did anything with the plans\r\nor how that directly benefitted the City. The court also rejected the argument that\r\nthe City benefitted from the project team's expertise, stating any benefit as to how\r\nthese deals should be structured was conferred upon the other project members, not\r\nthe City. However, the court of appeals reversed stating, \"We do not believe it is\r\npossible to rule as a matter of law that the alleged benefit to the City had no value.\r\nTherefore, we reverse the circuit court's decision to grant summary judgment on\r\nthis element of the quantum meruit claim.\" Stevens, 396 S.C. at 347, 721 S.E.2d at\r\n460.   We agree with the circuit court's finding there was no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact as to whether the City retained a benefit. An anecdotal visual\r\ncomparison alleging the building Windsor/Aughtry constructed looks similar to the\r\nschematics for Gary and Garfield's proposed hotel and a vague assertion that Gary\r\nand Garfield imparted some knowledge to the City does not suffice to withstand\r\nthe mere scintilla standard.       There is no other evidence offered that\r\nWindsor/Aughtry used the plans in any way or, even if it did, how that benefitted\r\nthe City. Likewise, we are unpersuaded that the City retained a benefit by learning\r\nfrom Gary and Garfield's expertise. To some extent any dealing with other\r\nprofessionals is educational, and this is certainly true in the context of business\r\nnegotiations. We again, however, fail to find any intrinsic value to the City.\r\n\r\n      Moreover, even if we were to find the City received some benefit, we find\r\nno evidence any enrichment was unjust. There is no evidence Gary and Garfield\r\n\nhad any reason to expect the City would otherwise compensate them for any work\r\nthey performed in the event the project was not completed. As the MOU makes\r\nplain, the parties were aware they were proceeding at risk until the bond financing\r\nclosed.                          CONCLUSION\r\n      Accordingly, we reverse the opinion of the court of appeals and reinstate\r\nsummary judgment in favor of the City on the contract claims and on Gary and\r\nGarfield's quantum meruit claim.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.                  PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals as I agree that the circuit court erred in granting the City\r\nsummary judgment on S&W's contract claim and on Gary and Garfield's quantum\r\nmeruit claim. As explained below, I strongly disagree with that portion of the\r\nmajority's opinion that would extend the applicability and scope of the parol\r\nevidence rule.\r\n\r\nThe parol evidence rule is a substantive rule of law that prohibits the introduction\r\nof evidence to contradict, add to, alter, explain, or vary the terms of an\r\nunambiguous valid written contract. E.g. Garnett v. WRP Enterps., Inc, 380 S.C.\r\n206, 669 S.E.2d 591 (2008). The scope of this rule is limited to evidence of\r\nunderstandings and negotiations that preceded the making of the complete written\r\nagreement, not post-formation conduct or agreements. 6 Peter Linzer, Corbin on\r\nContracts § 25.2 (Joseph M. Perillo ed. 2010).\r\n\r\nThe majority would now expand the reach of the parol evidence rule in two ways.\r\nAs explained above, the predicate for the application of the parol evidence rule is a\r\nvalid and complete written contract: the majority now proposes to apply the rule to\r\nan incomplete writing. The majority would also expand the scope of the rule and\r\nhold not only that it bars pre-writing understandings of the parties, but all extrinsic\r\nevidence, whether ante- or post-writing. Explaining the effect of this newly\r\nexpanded rule, the majority holds that when a writing \"unambiguously fails to\r\ncreate an enforceable agreement,\" the determination whether that document is a\r\nvalid contract is to be made by looking only within the four corners of the\r\n[unambiguously unenforceable] document. In other words, if parties place some\r\npart of their contract in writing, but that writing is insufficient to stand alone as a\r\ncontract, then as a matter of law the parties have no contract.\r\n\r\nThis new rule unintentionally affects the statute of frauds,6 since, for example, no\r\nlonger could evidence of part performance satisfy the statute where the written\r\nmemoranda did not. E.g. Mims v. Chandler, 21 S.C. 480(1884) (written receipt\r\ninsufficient to satisfy statute but part performance allowed court to order specific\r\nperformance). Moreover this new rule fundamentally alters the law of contracts in\r\nthis State. See e.g. Gladden v. Keistler, 141 S.C. 524, 140 S.E. 161 (1927) (while\r\nholding a receipt was a contract, opinion acknowledges parol evidence rule does\r\nnot apply to incomplete written agreements). Further, the majority purports to\r\n\r\n6S.C. Code Ann. § 32-3-10 (2007). See also Corbin, supra at pp. 20-22, \"The\r\nStatute of Frauds Compared with the Parol Evidence Rule.\"\r\n\ndistinguish Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 611 S.E.2d 905 (2005),\r\nwhich reiterates and applies the here-to-fore well settled rule that evidence of\r\nconduct is admissible to decide an issue of contract formation. In the majority's\r\nview, Conner asked whether an employee handbook altered the employee's \"at-will\r\nemployment contract.\" As I understand Conner, there was no pre-handbook \"at-\r\nwill employment contract.\" Instead, the employee's at-will status resulted from\r\nSouth Carolina's continued recognition of the doctrine of at-will employment, that\r\nis, \"employment at-will is presumed absent the creation of a specific contract of\r\nemployment.\" E.g., Barron v. Labor Finders of S.C., 393 S.C. 609, 614, 713\r\nS.E.2d 634, 636 (2011). In my opinion, the majority errs when it holds that\r\nevidence found outside the four corners of an incomplete writing is no longer\r\nadmissible to prove the existence of a contract.\r\n\r\nI respectfully dissent and would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27435","title":"Williams v.

The circuit court concluded coverage was\r\nlimited to the statutory minimum of $15,000 based on a family step-down\r\nprovision in the policy that reduced coverage for bodily injury to family members\r\nfrom the stated policy coverage of $100,000 to the statutory minimum amount\r\nmandated by South Carolina law during the policy period. The PRs appeal,\r\ncontending the step-down provision is ambiguous and/or violative of public policy.\r\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n\r\n       The facts in this case were either stipulated to by the parties or are not in\r\ndispute. The Murrys, who were husband and wife, purchased a motor vehicle\r\ninsurance policy from GEICO, policy number 0685-44-55-04, effective September\r\n2, 2006 until March 2, 2007. The Murrys were the only named insureds on the\r\npolicy. The Murrys carried liability coverage in excess of the statutory minimum\r\nlimits. As indicated on the \"Family Automobile Renewal Policy Declarations\"\r\npage for the policy (Declarations), they purchased liability insurance with limits of\r\n$100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $50,000 per\r\naccident for property damage.\r\n\r\n       On September 3, 2006, the Murrys were the sole occupants of their vehicle\r\nwhen it was struck by a train. Both of the Murrys died from injuries caused by the\r\ncollision. It is unknown who was the driver and who was the passenger at the time\r\nof the accident. However, since both of the Murrys were insureds under the policy,\r\nthe accident resulted in bodily injury to an insured, regardless of who was driving.\r\n\r\n      A dispute arose as to the amount of liability proceeds due under the policy.\r\nThe PRs believed the proper amount of coverage was the stated policy amount of\r\n$100,000. GEICO took the position that only $15,000 was owed under the\r\nExclusions portion of the policy as a result of the following provision contained\r\nunder Section I, entitled \"Liability Coverage\":\r\n\n      EXCLUSIONS\n\r\n      When Section I Does Not Apply \n\r\n\r\n              We will not defend any suit for damage if one or more of the\r\n      exclusions listed below applies. We do not provide liability coverage,\r\n      under Exclusions 1, 2, 3 and 8, in excess of the minimum limits of\r\n      liability required by South Carolina law. We do not provide any\r\n      liability coverage for the remaining Exclusions.\r\n\r\n      1. Bodily injury to any insured or any relative of an insured residing\r\n      in his household is not covered.1\r\n\r\nThe above language is often referred to as a family \"step-down provision\" as it\r\noperates to \"step down,\" or reduce, coverage for injured family members from the\r\noriginal policy limit, which was $100,000 here, to the statutory minimum limit\r\nrequired by law during the policy period, which was $15,000.2\r\n\r\n       The PRs filed this complaint against GEICO seeking a declaratory judgment\r\nas to the amount of liability proceeds due under the policy for the accident. After a\r\nbench trial, the circuit court entered judgment for GEICO. The court concluded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 With respect to an \"owned vehicle,\" the policy provides Section I applies to the\r\nfollowing \"insureds\": (1) \"you and your relatives\"; (2) \"any other person driving\r\nthe auto with your permission and within the actual scope of your permission\"; and\r\n(3) \"any other person or organization for his or its liability because of acts or\r\nomissions of an insured under 1. or 2. above.\"\r\n2  Although GEICO has called the policy provision a \"family member exclusion,\"\r\nwe believe the provision here is more accurately termed a \"step-down provision\" as\r\nit does not eliminate all coverage, contrary to its captioning. A step-down\r\nprovision is one in which \"the coverage 'steps down' from the actual policy limits\r\nto the minimum required by statute.\" Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Shores, 147 P.3d\r\n456, 458 n.4 (Utah Ct. App. 2006) (quoting 1 Rowland H. Long, The Law of\r\nLiability Insurance § 2.05[5] (2003)). However, it should be noted that in previous\r\nlitigation in other jurisdictions GEICO has successfully argued that similar\r\nprovisions totally excluded family members.\r\n\n\"the Family Member Exclusion in the Policy applies to limit liability coverage to\r\n$15,000.00 for damages arising out of the accident of September 3, 2006.\"3\r\n\r\n        The court rejected the PRs' assertion that the GEICO insurance policy was\r\nambiguous, stating even though the Declarations page listed liability coverage for\r\nbodily injury of $100,000/$300,000, the policy terms had to be read as a whole and\r\nthe family step-down provision was capable of only one reasonable interpretation.\r\nThe circuit court also found the family step-down provision did not violate this\r\nstate's public policy or the statutes governing automobile insurance, particularly\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-142. The PRs appealed, and this Court certified the case\r\nfrom the Court of Appeals for its review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       \"A suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is\r\ndetermined by the nature of the underlying issue.\" Felts v. Richland County, 303\r\nS.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). \"When the purpose of the underlying\r\ndispute is to determine whether coverage exists under an insurance policy, the\r\naction is one at law.\" S.C.

Code Ann. § 38-77-140 provided for liability\r\ncoverage with a minimum limit of $15,000 at the time the policy was issued.\r\nSection 38-77-140 was later amended in 2006 for policies issued or renewed on or\r\nafter January 1, 2007 to increase the minimum to $25,000. The limits are currently\r\n$25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $25,000 for\r\nproperty damage. S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-140 (Supp. 2013).\r\n\n                               III.   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      On appeal, the PRs contend the circuit court erred in failing to find (1) the\r\ninsurance contract was misleading and ambiguous, and (2) the family step-down\r\nprovision violates South Carolina's public policy.\r\n\r\nA.      Ambiguity\r\n      The PRs first argue the insurance contract is contradictory and misleading\r\nand that the circuit court erred in failing to find the policy was ambiguous.\r\n\r\n       An insurance policy is a contract between the insured and the insurance\r\ncompany, and the policy's terms are to be construed according to the law of\r\ncontracts. Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 663 S.E.2d 484 (2008);\r\nCoakley v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 376 S.C. 2, 656 S.E.2d 17 (2007); Estate of\r\nRevis v.

If the court\r\ndecides the language is ambiguous, however, evidence may be admitted to show\r\nthe intent of the parties, and the determination of the parties' intent becomes a\r\nquestion of fact for the fact-finder.4 Id. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 878-79.\r\n\r\n       \"Ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must be construed\r\nliberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.\" Diamond State\r\n\r\n4   The circuit court conducted a bench trial here and, thus, was the fact-finder.\r\n\nIns.

Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1995).\r\n\"A contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when\r\nviewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the\r\ncontext of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,\r\npractices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or\r\nbusiness.\" Hawkins, 328 S.C. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 878 (quoting 17A Am. Jur. 2d\r\nContracts § 338, at 345 (1991)).\r\n\r\n      \"A contract is read as a whole document so that one may not create an\r\nambiguity by pointing out a single sentence or clause.\" McGill, 381 S.C. at 185,\r\n672 S.E.2d at 574. Whether a contract is ambiguous is to be determined from\r\nexamining the entire contract, not by reviewing isolated portions of the contract.\r\nFarr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 218 S.E.2d 431 (1975); Silver v. Aabstract\r\nPools & Spas, Inc., 376 S.C. 585, 658 S.E.2d 539 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\r\n       The PRs contend the circuit court wrongly found they were reading the\r\nDeclarations in isolation when they had actually pointed to a variety of\r\ncontradictions in the Declarations and the body of the policy document to show the\r\ncontract \"was far from clear.\" The PRs argue the policy starts out by listing the\r\nMurrys as the named insureds with $100,000/$300,000 of liability coverage for\r\nbodily injury, but it is not indicated anywhere in the Declarations that the coverage\r\ndoes not include either of the named insureds or their household relatives and that\r\nonly the statutory minimums in South Carolina apply to them. Further, there is\r\nnothing in the Declarations or the rest of the policy stating what the statutory\r\nminimum limits are in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n        The PRs additionally point out that the general language in the policy states\r\nGEICO will pay damages which an insured becomes legally obligated to pay\r\nbecause of bodily injury sustained by a person, but the policy does not define\r\n\"person\" or explicitly limit that term to everyone who is not an insured or a\r\nresident relative. The PRs argue, \"After repeated indications that the named\r\ninsureds are covered up to the liability amounts provided in the declarations page\r\nfor bodily injury, GEICO slips in the family step-down, which is unclear in and of\r\nitself.\" The PRs contend, \"It fails to alert the purchaser what the statutory\r\nminimums are, and fails to alert them that this provision means you and your\r\nhousehold relatives are NOT protected in these amounts shown. This creates an\r\nirreparable ambiguity upon which GEICO cannot deny coverage in the full liability\r\nlimits.\"\r\n\r\n      In contrast, GEICO argues the PRs do not consider the entire integrated\r\nagreement, but instead read the Declarations and certain provisions in the policy in\r\n\nisolation to create an ambiguity. GEICO asserts, \"Insurance contracts contain\r\nmany limitations and exclusions and it would be unrealistic and unreasonable to\r\nexpect an insurer to identify every such limitation and exclusion and note it on the\r\ndeclarations page. Hence, the rule that the entire integrated agreement must be\r\nconsidered.\"\r\n\r\n      GEICO contends \"person\" need not be defined in the policy as it is\r\nunderstood to refer generically to \"any human being.\"5 Moreover, any of the\r\nprovisions for coverage in the policy must be read in conjunction with the\r\nexclusions explicitly contained therein.\r\n\r\n       Section V, paragraph 12 of the policy, entitled \"Declarations,\" states in\r\nrelevant part: \"By accepting this policy, you agree that . . . this policy, along with\r\nthe application and declaration sheet, embodies all agreements relating to this\r\ninsurance.\" Thus, by its terms, the policy, along with the application and the\r\nDeclarations, constitute the entire agreement between the Murrys and GEICO.\r\nCompare Prince v. State Mut. Life Ins. Co., 77 S.C. 187, 191, 57 S.E. 766, 767\r\n(1907) (\"For the general purposes of construction, an application will be\r\nconsidered a part of the contract, if it is referred to in the policy in such a way as to\r\nindicate a clear intent to make it a part thereof.\" (citation omitted)) with Ferguson\r\nv. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 512 N.W.2d 296, 299 (Iowa 1994) (\"When construing\r\ninsurance policies we consider the effect of the policy as a whole, in light of all\r\ndeclarations, riders, or endorsements attached.\").\r\n\r\n      Section I of the policy states GEICO will pay damages that an insured\r\nbecomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury sustained by a person\r\nand damages to or destruction of property. Although the Declarations page\r\nindicates the named insureds have liability limits of $100,000 per person and\r\n$300,000 per accident for bodily injury, Section I of the policy contains a list of\r\ntwelve enumerated items under the heading \"EXCLUSIONS,\" among them, the\r\nfamily step-down provision and three others (1, 2, 3, and 8) for which the statutory\r\nminimum limits apply. Consequently, these specified items are not actually full\r\nexclusions, but rather, are limitations on, or reductions in, coverage.\r\n\r\n       GEICO concedes, \"While perhaps Exclusions 1, 2, 3, and 8 might more\r\nproperly have been labeled 'limitations' under a separate heading, there is only one\r\nfair and reasonable way to interpret this language. Liability coverage will be\r\n\r\n5 \"Person\" is statutorily defined in this context as \"[e]very natural person, firm,\r\ncopartnership, association or corporation[.]\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-9-20(10)\r\n(2006).\r\n\nprovided for Exclusions 1, 2, 3, and 8 but only up to the minimum limits of\r\nliability required by South Carolina law while no liability coverage will be\r\nprovided for the other Exclusions. Simply because an insurance contract is not\r\nwritten in the most desirable manner, if it is unmistakable in its meaning, when\r\ncarefully read, it is valid and enforceable.\" GEICO maintains, \"When all of the\r\nprovisions of the [p]olicy are read together, it unambiguously provides that liability\r\ncoverage for bodily injury to an insured or resident relative is limited to the\r\nminimum limits of liability required by South Carolina law.\"\r\n\r\n       Read as a whole, we agree with the circuit court that the language in the\r\ncontract is unambiguous. Although it was not artfully worded, as GEICO\r\nacknowledges, it is, nevertheless, apparent upon examination that there is an\r\nunambiguous limitation in this regard because it may only be understood one way.\r\nThe PRs correctly note that the exclusion for named insureds and resident relatives\r\nactually states there is \"no coverage\"; however, when all of the pertinent provisions\r\nare read together, including the sentences immediately before it that \"[w]e do not\r\nprovide liability coverage, Under Exclusions 1, 2, 3 and 8, in excess of the\r\nminimum limits of liability required by South Carolina law\" and \"[w]e do not\r\nprovide any liability coverage for the remaining Exclusions,\" then it is\r\nunmistakable what the intent for coverage is here.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, we disagree with the PRs' assertion that the failure to specifically\r\nstate what the statutory minimum limits of coverage were renders the GEICO\r\npolicy ambiguous. An ambiguity exists only when the language is reasonably\r\ncapable of being understood in more than one way. Hawkins, 328 S.C. at 592, 493\r\nS.E.2d at 878. The fact that the parties would need to look up the statutory\r\nminimum limits for coverage does not render the policy ambiguous. See Universal\r\nUnderwriters Ins. Co. v. Hill, 955 P.2d 1333, 1336-37 (Kan. Ct. App. 1998)\r\n(holding step-down provision and language in addendum limiting liability to\r\n\"limits required by Kansas law\" might be \"stylistically inelegant,\" but it was not\r\nambiguous as a reasonable person would not be misled as to the policy limits).\r\nConsequently, we hold the circuit court did not err in failing to find the GEICO\r\npolicy contained an ambiguity that invalidated the step-down provision.\r\n\r\nB.    Public Policy\r\n\r\n      The PRs next assert the circuit court erred in failing to find the step-down\r\nprovision is invalid because it contravenes this state's public policy.\r\n\r\n      As a general rule, insurers have the right to limit their liability and to impose\r\nconditions on their obligations provided they are not in contravention of public\r\n\npolicy or some statutory inhibition. B.L.G. Enters., Inc. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 334\r\nS.C. 529, 535-36, 514 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1999); Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\r\nCo., 297 S.C. 520, 523, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989); Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C.\r\n573, 580-81, 482 S.E.2d 589, 593 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\n       While parties are generally permitted to contract as they see fit, freedom of\r\ncontract is not absolute and coverage that is required by law may not be omitted.\r\nJordan v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 294, 297, 214 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1975).\r\nStatutes governing an insurance contract are part of the contract as a matter of law,\r\nand to the extent a policy provision conflicts with an applicable statute, the\r\nprovision is invalid. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Thatcher, 283 S.C. 585, 587, 325 S.E.2d\r\n59, 61 (1985); Jordan, 264 S.C. at 297, 214 S.E.2d at 820; Boyd v. State Farm\r\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 316, 319, 195 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1973).\r\n\r\n       The purpose of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act (MVFRA),\r\ncontained in Title 56 of the South Carolina Code, is to give greater protection to\r\nthose injured through the negligent operation of automobiles. Pa. Nat'l Mut. Cas.\r\nIns. Co. v. Parker, 282 S.C. 546, 551, 320 S.E.2d 458, 461 (Ct. App. 1984). This\r\nlegislation requires insurance for the benefit of the public, and an insurer may not\r\nnullify its purposes by engrafting exceptions from liability as to uses that the\r\nevident purpose of the legislation was to cover. Id.; Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v.\r\nProgressive N. Ins. Co., 406 S.C. 534, 539-40, 753 S.E.2d 437, 440 (Ct. App.\r\n2013). Similarly, the stated purpose of the chapter on automobile insurance in\r\nTitle 38 was to implement a complete reform of automobile insurance in order to,\r\namong other things, make sure every risk meeting certain criteria was entitled to\r\nautomobile insurance and prevent the evasion of coverage provided for by that\r\nchapter. S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-10 (2002).\r\n\r\n       Whether a particular provision in an insurance policy violates the public\r\npolicy of the state is a question of law that is reviewed de novo by an appellate\r\ncourt. County Preferred Ins. Co. v. Whitehead, 979 N.E.2d 35, 42 (Ill. 2012).\r\nPublic policy considerations include not only what is expressed in state law, such\r\nas the constitution and statutes, and decisions of the courts, but also a\r\ndetermination whether the agreement is capable of producing harm such that its\r\nenforcement would be contrary to the public interest or manifestly injurious to the\r\npublic welfare. Id. at 42-43.\r\n\r\n      The PRs contend the public policy of this state, as evidenced in section 38-\r\n77-142, prevents an insurer from reducing coverage from the amount stated in the\r\npolicy, which here was $100,000, to the statutory minimum limit required by\r\n\nsection 38-77-140(A), which was $15,000 per person for bodily injury during the\r\npolicy period at issue. We agree.\r\n\r\n      Section 38-77-142 provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n      SECTION 38-77-142. Policies or contracts of bodily injury or \n\r\n      property damage liability insurance covering liability; required \n\r\n      provisions. \n\r\n\r\n            (A) No policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage\r\n      liability insurance covering liability arising from the ownership,\r\n      maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle may be issued or delivered in\r\n      this State to the owner of a vehicle . . . unless the policy contains a\r\n      provision insuring the named insured and any other person using\r\n      or responsible for the use of the motor vehicle with the expressed\r\n      or implied consent of the named insured against liability for death\r\n      or injury sustained or loss or damage incurred within the coverage of\r\n      the policy or contract as a result of negligence in the operation or use\r\n      of the vehicle by the named insured or by any such person. . . .\r\n\r\n            (B) No policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage\r\n      liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a\r\n      motor vehicle may be issued or delivered in this State to the owner of\r\n      a vehicle . . . without an endorsement or provision insuring the\r\n      named insured, and any other person using or responsible for the\r\n      use of the motor vehicle with the expressed or implied consent of\r\n      the named insured, against liability for death or injury sustained, or\r\n      loss or damage incurred within the coverage of the policy or\r\n      contract as a result of negligence in the operation or use of the motor\r\n      vehicle by the named insured or by any other person. If an insurer has\r\n      actual notice of a motion for judgment or complaint having been\r\n      served on an insured, the mere failure of the insured to turn the motion\r\n      or complaint over to the insurer may not be a defense to the insurer,\r\n      nor void the endorsement or provision, nor in any way relieve the\r\n      insurer of its obligations to the insured, provided the insured\r\n      otherwise cooperates and in no way prejudices the insurer.\r\n\r\n           ....\r\n\r\n           (C) Any endorsement, provision, or rider attached to or\r\n      included in any policy of insurance which purports or seeks to\r\n\n      limit or reduce the coverage6 afforded by the provisions required\r\n      by this section is void.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-142 (2002) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       The PRs rely particularly upon subsection (C) and argue \"[t]he statute\r\nmandates that all South Carolina insurance policies must insure the named insureds\r\nagainst liability for death or injury and, more importantly, the insurance policy\r\nmay not limit or reduce that coverage or it will be void [as] against public policy.\"\r\nThe PRs contend, \"Here, GEICO is attempting to reduce the coverage its policy\r\nstates is provided for the named insureds through the step-down provision which\r\nplainly contravenes this statue because it reduces the amount of coverage stated in\r\nthe declarations page under Section I.\" The PRs note section 38-77-142 does not\r\nreference in any way the minimum coverage statutorily provided by section 38-77-\r\n140, but instead specifically states that an insurance contract may not reduce the\r\ncoverage afforded in the policy against liability for death or injury, and the amount\r\ncontracted for under the policy at issue is $100,000, not the $15,000 statutory\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court correctly concluded that section 38-77-142 \"requires every\r\npolicy issued to insure the named insured and permissive users against liability for\r\ndeath or injury sustained or loss or damage incurred 'within' the coverage of the\r\npolicy.\" However, the court erred when it found \"that 'within the coverage of the\r\npolicy' does not mandate coverage up to the maximum amount of liability coverage\r\nunder a policy when there is a family member claimant.\" The court failed to give\r\nany consideration to subsection (C).\r\n\r\n        The circuit court found section 38-77-142 provides liability coverage may\r\nbe reduced, so long as it is not reduced below the statutory minimum mandated by\r\nsection 38-77-140. Therefore, it does not contravene public policy, citing Hansen\r\nex rel. Hansen v. United Services Automobile Association, 350 S.C. 62, 565 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n6 The concurrence/dissent interprets the word \"coverage\" as referring to the\r\nindividuals protected by the policy. However, such an interpretation conflicts with\r\nthe way the word \"coverage\" is used in subsections (A) and (B). It is striking that\r\nthe word \"coverage\" is used in these sections to refer to the levels of protection\r\nafforded by the policy. Moreover, these subsections clearly indicate that the\r\nGeneral Assembly knew when and how to use the words \"insured\" or \"person\" and\r\nwould have used those words in subsection (C) if that was what it intended\r\n\"coverage\" to mean.\r\n\n114 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding a step-down provision along with an out-of-state\r\nprovision in an Ohio insurance policy did not create an ambiguity voiding\r\ncoverage).\r\n\r\n       Initially, we note Hansen is not controlling of our decision here as it\r\ninvolved Ohio insurance provisions drafted in accordance with Ohio law and did\r\nnot address section 38-77-142. The accident in that case occurred in 1998, prior to\r\nthe effective date of the statute. See Cowan v. Allstate Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 625, 626,\r\n594 S.E.2d 275, 276 (2004) (noting the General Assembly enacted section 38-77-\r\n142 in 1997 and it became effective on March 1, 1999). Although the circuit court\r\nrecognized this fact, it nevertheless referenced the case in support of its conclusion.\r\n\r\n       Likewise, several decisions GEICO additionally references for the\r\nproposition that coverage for insureds may be reduced from the policy amount to\r\nthe statutory minimums are not controlling here as they, like Hansen, involve\r\naccidents that occurred prior to the effective date of section 38-77-142, and the\r\ndecisions do not address the statute's application. See, e.g., United Servs. Auto.\r\nAss'n v. Markosky, 340 S.C. 223, 530 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 2000); Universal\r\nUnderwriters Ins. Co. v. Metro. Prop. & Life Ins. Co., 298 S.C. 404, 380 S.E.2d\r\n858 (Ct. App. 1989). To the extent the concurrence/dissent maintains the validity\r\nof step-down provisions has already been established by this Court, it is mistaken.\r\nAlthough it refers to the Court of Appeals's decision in Universal Underwriters,\r\nthat case cannot possibly control our decision here because the accident in\r\nUniversal Underwriters occurred at least a decade prior to the effective date of\r\nsection 38-77-142. In any event, we are not limited by a decision of the Court of\r\nAppeals, as this Court exercises de novo review of public policy issues. The\r\nGeneral Assembly is presumed to know the law, so in our view, the enactment of\r\nsection 38-77-142 could be perceived as a response to these earlier decisions. See\r\nGrier v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 397 S.C. 532, 536, 725 S.E.2d 693, 696 (2012)  \r\n(stating \"we presume the General Assembly is 'aware of the common law'\" when\r\nenacting subsequent legislation (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       In viewing the plain wording of section 38-77-142, we find subsections (A)\r\nand (B) require a policy for liability insurance to contain a provision insuring the\r\nnamed insureds and permissive users against liability for damage incurred \"within\r\nthe coverage of the policy.\" Subsection (B) additionally contains a provision\r\nregarding notice that states the mere failure to turn over a motion or complaint will\r\nnot void coverage. Finally, subsection (C) provides that no policy provision may\r\nlimit or reduce the coverage required by this section, which refers to section 38-\r\n77-142, or else it is void.\r\n\n       We think it is significant that section 38-77-142 provides insurers must\r\nprovide liability coverage to insureds \"within the coverage of the policy\" and may\r\nnot limit or reduce liability coverage in the policy below the amount provided in\r\nthis section, meaning section 38-77-142. Thus, it is the face amount of the\r\ncoverage that is relevant under section 38-77-142, not the statutory minimum\r\nlimits of liability coverage set forth in section 38-77-140, which are not even\r\nmentioned in the statute.7 In contrast to the circuit court's interpretation, we\r\nbelieve the General Assembly could have simply stated coverage may not be\r\nreduced below the statutory minimum limits and/or below the amount provided in\r\nsection 38-77-140, if that was its intent. However, it did not do so. Here, the\r\ncircuit court has engrafted an additional restriction into section 38-77-142 that was\r\nnot included by the General Assembly by determining coverage may be reduced to\r\nthe statutory minimum, in direct contravention to the explicit language of section\r\n38-77-142(C) that coverage may not be reduced below the coverage in the policy.\r\n\r\n       The General Assembly, in considering section 38-77-142, contemplated how\r\nautomobile insurance is actually marketed. It realized that the actual policy\r\ncontaining any exclusions or limitations is not provided contemporaneously with\r\nthe entering of the insurance agreement. As a result, the General Assembly\r\nspecifically included language in section 38-77-142(C) prohibiting provisions in\r\nthe policy that limit or reduce coverage:\r\n\r\n           (C) Any endorsement, provision, or rider attached to or\r\n      included in any policy of insurance which purports or seeks to\r\n      limit or reduce the coverage afforded by the provisions required\r\n      by this section is void.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-142(C) (2002) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Therefore, once the face amount of coverage is agreed upon, it may not be\r\narbitrarily reduced or limited by conflicting policy provisions that effectively\r\nretract this stated coverage. Any other interpretation of section 38-77-142(C)\r\nwould render the section useless, and the General Assembly is presumed not to\r\nperform useless acts. See Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 212,\r\n574 S.E.2d 196, 198 (2002) (\"The Court must presume the legislature did not\r\nintend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something.\" (citing\r\n\r\n7 Moreover, the Declarations page of the Murrys' policy explicitly states: \"This is\r\na description of your coverage\" and it lists bodily injury liability coverage of\r\n$100,000/$300,000. (Emphasis added.)\r\n\nTNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Rev., 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998)). After\r\nagreeing on a policy with $100,000 in stated liability coverage for the named\r\ninsureds, GEICO should not be permitted to subsequently reduce it with what it\r\ndeems an \"exclusion\" in the policy.\r\n\r\n       There is, indeed, a wide divergence of authority in this area, as courts have\r\nconsidered the statutory schemes, case law, and public policy determinations in\r\ntheir own jurisdictions in scrutinizing provisions attempting to reduce or eliminate\r\ncoverage to family members. See Martin J. McMahon, Annotation, Validity,\r\nUnder Insurance Statutes, of Coverage Exclusion for Injury to or Death of\r\nInsured's Family or Household Members, 52 A.L.R.4th 18 (1987 & Supp. 2014)\r\n(discussing a variety of scenarios in which courts have examined such provisions).\r\nThere is no true consensus.\r\n\r\n       In one case, Lewis v. West American Insurance Co., 927 S.W.2d 829 (Ky.\r\n1996), the Supreme Court of Kentucky found a step-down provision was void as\r\nagainst that state's public policy. The Kentucky court focused on two key points:\r\n(1) a customer's motivation in purchasing liability insurance above the statutory\r\nminimum is to obtain increased protection for anyone injured; and (2) the fact that\r\nthe only possible justification for these types of exclusions is to prevent the\r\npossibility of collusion among family members, a concern which has been mostly\r\nabrogated in other contexts.\r\n\r\n       In Lewis, the court acknowledged that neither Kentucky's state constitution\r\nnor its statutes addressed family exclusions, so it would turn to its court decisions\r\nto determine the state's public policy. Id. at 836. The court stated it has long been\r\nrecognized that, where there is no legislative prohibition on a certain character of\r\nagreement, before a court is authorized to declare it void \"it must appear that such\r\nan agreement or contract has a tendency to injure the public or is against the public\r\ngood, or is contrary to sound policy . . . .\" Id. at 835 (citation omitted). The court\r\nobserved that, \"[w]ith the erosion of the immunities provided by the doctrines of\r\ninterspousal and parental immunity, insurance companies sought to protect their\r\ninterests by inserting family exclusions into their insurance contracts.\" Id. at 832.\r\nOver the years, the purported justification for those rules, the possibility of fraud\r\nand collusion, was determined to no longer justify the hardships imposed by these\r\nrules. Id. The court found the family exclusion \"prevents a specific class of\r\ninnocent victims from receiving adequate financial protection\" and is based\r\nentirely on the person's status. Id. \"Without documentation or factual basis, every\r\nmember of this excluded class is labeled high risk and branded as being more\r\nlikely to engage in collusion and fraud.\" Id. The court concluded, \"To uphold the\r\n\nfamily exclusion would result in perpetuating socially destructive inequities.\" Id.\r\nat 833.\r\n\r\n      Family exclusions are injurious to a substantial segment of the citizens\r\n      of our Commonwealth. They deny injured persons the ability to rely\r\n      upon the insurance coverage purchased by the policyholder. As a\r\n      result, seriously injured accident victims will suffer financial hardship\r\n      if family exclusion clauses are validated. Almost every member of\r\n      the public is potentially a member of this excluded class. The\r\n      exclusion is overly broad, based upon surmise, and against the public\r\n      good.  It is time for us to take the next logical step . . . . Thus, we hold\r\n      that family exclusion provisions in liability insurance contracts violate\r\n      the public policy of this Commonwealth and are unenforceable.\r\n\r\nId. at 836. We agree with the court's reasoning in Lewis. To allow an insurer to\r\ndetermine the extent to which an injured party can recover within the insured's\r\npolicy coverage based solely on a familial relationship is arbitrary and capricious\r\nand violative of public policy. See Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. Wiscomb, 643\r\nP.2d 441, 444 (1982) (\"This exclusion becomes particularly disturbing when\r\nviewed in light of the fact that this class of victims is the one most frequently\r\nexposed to the potential negligence of the named insured. Typical family relations\r\nrequire family members to ride together on the way to work, church, school, social\r\nfunctions, or family outings. Consequently, there is no practical method by which\r\nthe class of persons excluded from protection by this provision may conform their\r\nactivities so as to avoid exposure to the risk of riding with someone who, as to\r\nthem, is uninsured.\"), cited with approval in Lewis, 927 S.W.2d at 832-33; see also\r\nFactory Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. of Am. v. Kennedy, 256 S.C. 376, 380-81, 182 S.E.2d\r\n727, 729 (1971) (stating liability insurance not only affords protection to insured\r\nmotorists, it serves the important \"public purpose of affording protection to\r\ninnocent victims of motor vehicle accidents\" (citation omitted) (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       As written by GEICO, the policy in the current matter provides very limited\r\ncoverage to families where those injured would otherwise undisputedly fall within\r\nthe defined class of \"insureds.\" As noted above, children injured while being\r\ndriven to school by a parent would come under the family step-down provision,\r\nand thus only the statutory minimum limit would be available, regardless of the\r\nactual policy coverage purchased by the parent. The exclusion would also apply to\r\nthe transportation of infants in family vehicles, where collusion could not be\r\nseriously asserted. Likewise, a husband and wife traveling together, as happened\r\n\nin the current appeal, would have only the statutory minimum amount, not the\r\ncoverage provided for in the policy. In this case involving the Murrys, there can be\r\nno possibility of collusion, as both of the named insureds tragically perished in the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n       The policy provision here has far-reaching effects that can impact a\r\nsubstantial segment of the population, as it serves not only to markedly reduce\r\ncoverage to family members, but it even reduces the policy's coverage to the\r\nnamed insureds, as happened with the Murrys. The legislative purpose of\r\naffording protection to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents is\r\neviscerated by GEICO's reduction in coverage to injured family members, who are\r\nno less innocent victims in accidents solely because they are injured by the\r\nnegligence of a family member. It would indeed be an unusual public policy that\r\nwould condone denying coverage to a child where he or she is catastrophically\r\ninjured while being driven by a parent to school, but would allow recovery where\r\nthe parent injures a stranger while on the way to work.\r\n\r\n       Ultimately, regardless of the split of authority from other jurisdictions, we\r\nfind the clear terms of section 38-77-142 are controlling of this state's public policy\r\nand justify the result we reach today.8 In this case, the Murrys, the named\r\n\r\n8 We disagree with the position taken by the concurrence/dissent that section 56-9-\r\n20(d) of the MVFRA somehow serves to thwart the application of section 38-77-\r\n142(C) because the Murrays purchased coverage over the statutory minimum\r\nlimits. This assertion rests on the premise that \"excess\" coverage is not part of the\r\ninsurance policy that is subject to the MVFRA and, consequently, its public policy\r\nconsiderations. See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-9-20(d) (2006) (stating \"excess or\r\nadditional coverage shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter,\" and \"the\r\nterm 'motor vehicle liability policy' shall apply only to that part of the coverage\r\nwhich is required by this article [Article 1 of Chapter 9]\"). However, by its express\r\nterms, section 56-9-20(d) limits its reach to the provisions in the MVFRA. Id.\r\n(stating excess coverage \"shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter,\" i.e,\r\nChapter 9 of Title 56); see id. § 56-9-10 (\"This chapter [Chapter 9 of Title 56] may\r\nbe cited as the 'Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act.'\"). As a result, section\r\n                                                                 \r\n56-9-20(d) has no bearing on the application of other motor vehicle laws, such as\r\nsection 38-77-142, or the related consideration of our state's public policy. See\r\ngenerally id. § 56-9-100 (\"This chapter [Chapter 9 of Title 56] shall in no respect\r\nbe considered a repeal of any other provision contained in this Title or the motor\r\nvehicle laws of this State but shall be considered as supplemental and cumulative\r\nthereto.\").\r\n\ninsureds, purchased a policy with liability coverage limits of $100,000 per person\r\nand $300,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $50,000 per accident for property\r\ndamage. In our view, GEICO has improperly attempted to reduce the coverage in\r\nthe policy to the named insureds by means of the step-down provision, which it has\r\ncharacterized as an \"exclusion.\" We find this provision is in direct contravention\r\nto the prohibition set forth in section 38-77-142. In addition, to allow an insurer to\r\ndetermine the extent to which an injured party can recover within the insured's\r\npolicy coverage based solely on a familial relationship is arbitrary, capricious and\r\ninjurious to the public good. See Lewis, 927 S.W.2d at 836. For these reasons, the\r\nfamily step-down provision is void as against the public policy of this state.\r\n\r\n       A provision that is against public policy is void ab initio and, because it is\r\ndeemed legally never to have come into existence, it is incapable of being enforced\r\nby courts. 16 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 49:12 (4th ed. 2000). We\r\nsee no reason to depart from this procedure here, as suggested in the\r\nconcurrence/dissent, as it would be a hollow victory indeed for the prevailing\r\nparties if we were to enforce the offending provision here and restrict relief to\r\nprospective cases only. Where courts have found insurance provisions to be void\r\nas against public policy, they have, as a matter of course, refused to give any effect\r\nto those provisions in the appeals before them. See generally Lewis v. W. Am. Ins.\r\nCo., 927 S.W.2d 829, 836 (Ky. 1996); Watters v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 361 N.E.2d\r\n1068 (Ohio Ct. App. 1976); Ryan v. Knoller, 695 A.2d 990 (R.I. 1997).\r\n\r\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We agree with the circuit court that GEICO's policy is not ambiguous, but\r\nwe conclude the family step-down provision, which reduced the coverage under\r\nthe liability policy from the stated policy amount to the statutory minimum, is\r\nviolative of public policy and is, therefore, void. The provision not only conflicts\r\nwith the mandates set forth in section 38-77-142, but its enforcement would be\r\ninjurious to the public welfare.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\n       TOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES,\r\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I agree with the majority that the insurance policy at \n\r\nissue here is not ambiguous, but disagree with the finding that the family step-\n\r\ndown provision offends South Carolina's public policy. I therefore concur in part \n\r\nand dissent in part, and would therefore affirm the circuit court order. \n\r\n\r\nThe majority finds the family step-down provision offends public policy as \n\r\nexpressed by the General Assembly in S.C. Code Ann. §38-77-142 (C) (2006). In \n\r\nmy opinion, reliance on § 38-77-142 is misplaced here, as that statute is concerned \n\r\nwith the persons who must be covered under an automobile insurance policy, and \n\r\nnothing in the family step-down alters the individuals covered by the GEICO \n\r\npolicy. In my view, the relevant statutes against which we should judge the step-\n\r\ndown are S.C. Code Ann. 38-77-140 (2006) 9 and S.C. Code Ann. § 56-9-20 \n\r\n(d)(2006).10 I find nothing in the family step-down provisions that offends the \n\r\npolicies expressed in these statutes. \n\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-140 provides that all South Carolina automobile insurance policies \n\r\nmust contain \"a provision insuring the persons defined as insured against losses \n\r\nfrom the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, \n\r\nmaintenance, or use of these motor vehicles . . .\" and then establishes the minimum \n\r\nliability limits. § 38-77-140. The statute concludes \"Nothing in this article prevents \n\r\nan insurer from issuing, selling, or delivering a policy providing liability coverage \n\r\nin excess of these requirements.\" Id. Section 38-77-140 is the statute that \n\r\nestablishes the minimum monetary coverage that must be a part of every South \n\r\nCarolina automobile liability policy. While this section permits but does not \n\r\nrequire an insurer to offer a policy that provides coverage in excess of the \n\r\nminimums, § 38-77-140 contains no language analogous to that found in § 38-77-\r\n142 (C). \n\r\n\r\nSections 38-77-142(A) and (B), on the other hand, are concerned with the persons \n\r\nwho must be afforded coverage under an automobile insurance policy, and not with\n\r\nthe amount of coverage that must be offered. When § 38-77-142(C) voids any \n\r\n\r\n\r\n  This version of the statute rather than the amended version found in the 2012 \n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplement applies here. \n\r\n   This section found in the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act (MVFRA), \n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §§56-9-10 et seq. (2006 and Supp. 2012), states that any liability\r\ncoverage offered over the minimum statutory limits is \"not subject to the\r\nprovisions of this chapter.\" Thus the legislature has explicitly permitted insurers to\r\noffer different terms so long as the mandatory minimum coverage amounts are\r\nmet. Nothing in GEICO's family step-down provision offends the MVFRA.\r\n\nprovision \"which purports or seeks to limit or reduce the coverage afforded by the\r\nprovisions required by this section,\" it is referring only to the persons who must be\r\ncovered, which is the subject of § 38-77-142, and not to the monetary amount of\r\nliability coverage, which is the subject of § 38-77-140. In my opinion, a family\r\nstep-down provision does not offend § 38-77-142(C) because it does not limit or\r\nreduce the type of coverage to an individual identified in § 38-77-142(A) or (B),\r\nbut rather only reduces the amount of monetary coverage to the minimum limits\r\nfound in § 38-77-140.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have already decided that an automobile insurance policy may\r\ncontain a provision stepping-down coverage to minimum limits without offending\r\npublic policy. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Metropolitan Prop. and Life Ins.\r\nCo., 298 S.C. 404, 380 S.E.2d 858 (Ct. App. 1989) (insurers have the right to limit\r\ntheir liability within statutory limits, and while permitted to offer additional\r\ncoverage, are only required to provide the mandatory minimums). In my opinion,\r\ngiven the pervasive statutory regulation of automobile insurance policies, it is for\r\nthe General Assembly and not for the Court to decide that a family step-down\r\nprovision offends South Carolina's public policy. That the legislature has not acted\r\nto alter the rule announced in Universal Underwriters indicates to me that we were\r\ncorrect in holding that step-downs are valid. Finally, if we are to change the rules\r\nand now prohibit step-down provisions in automobile insurance policies, we\r\nshould do so prospectively. Such a delay would permit both insurers and insureds\r\nentering contracts after the date this opinion becomes final to decide what coverage\r\nthey will offer, and what coverage they will buy.\r\n\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27436","title":"Hansen v.

Hopkins, Jr., of Hopkins Law Firms, LLC, of\r\n           Pawleys Island, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n        JUSTICE HEARN: At its simplest, this appeal concerns whether a limited\r\nliability company (LLC) may be held liable for the actions of a promoter and\r\n\nwhether any evidence to support such liability was presented here. We reverse and\r\nhold the circuit court erred in denying the directed verdict on the issue of liability\r\nbecause there was no evidence on which a jury could hold the defendant\r\nBeechwood Development Group of South Carolina, LLC (Appellant) liable.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       The events giving rise to this lawsuit involve numerous individuals and\r\ncorporate entities and are particularly fact-intensive. Prior to recounting those\r\nfacts in detail, briefly, the facts are these: Clifford Hansen, the plaintiff, was\r\nintroduced to Robert Fields and through Fields engaged the services of Beechwood\r\nAdvisory Group, Inc. (Advisory Group) to assist him in procuring capital in order\r\nto purchase a water bottling company in South Carolina. Fields and Hansen\r\nworked together toward this goal until Fields disavowed any obligation to Hansen\r\nand effectively cut him out of the deal. In doing so, Fields found investors, formed\r\nAppellant, and purchased the water bottling company. Hansen sued Appellant for\r\nthe actions of Fields and his various corporate entities, and following the denial of\r\nAppellant's motion for a directed verdict, a jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nHansen.In much greater detail, the facts are as follows. Hansen, an entrepreneur,\r\nsought to purchase Hickory Springs Water Company, Inc. (Water Company) in\r\nElloree, South Carolina. He met with the company's owner, George Milner, and\r\nthereafter, Milner produced a letter of understanding setting forth initial terms for\r\nthe purchase. Hansen created Carolina Springs Bottling, LLC as the entity that\r\nwould purchase Water Company, and because he did not have the necessary capital\r\nto close the deal, he approached Fields about locating investors and financing for\r\nhim. Fields was a Charleston businessman who was involved in and acted on\r\nbehalf of a number of corporate entities including Advisory Group which was\r\nowned by Fields, Dennis Byrd, Andrew Easter, and Richard Gregg.\r\n\r\n      Advisory Group agreed to represent Hansen in procuring capital and\r\nproduced a letter of understanding to that effect dated December 16, 2003, which\r\nFields signed on behalf of the corporation. The agreement provided that Advisory\r\nGroup would assist Hansen in securing capital and financing the purchase.\r\nHowever, on January 12, 2004, Advisory Group terminated its representation of\r\n\nHansen and informed him that it reserved the right to purchase Water Company.1\r\nDuring that same week, the four partners of Advisory Group—Fields, Byrd, Gregg,\r\nand Easter—created a new corporation, Beechwood Development Group, Inc.\r\n(Development Group), whose purpose was to purchase the water company.\r\n\r\n       Despite the letter and his knowledge that Fields, Byrd, Gregg, and Easter\r\nhad set up a new corporate entity for the purpose of purchasing Water Company,\r\nHansen approached Fields about the possibility of his wealthy friend from Texas,\r\nDavid Hunt, investing in the deal. Hansen and Fields then executed a second\r\nagreement whereby Advisory Group again committed to assist Hansen in finding\r\ncapital.2 Hansen would compensate Advisory Group in the amount of $100,000\r\nfor those services. It also provided that in the deal, Hunt would own 75% and\r\nHansen would own 25% of the resulting company, Carolina Springs Bottling,\r\nLLC. Carolina Springs Bottling, LLC would own 100% of Carolina Springs\r\nBottling, Inc. which would be the entity that owned the springs and bottling\r\nfacility.3\r\n\r\n      Several weeks after flying to Texas to meet with Hunt, Fields sent an e-mail\r\nto Patrick Cobb, a business acquaintance, soliciting interest in the deal. Fields\r\nsigned the e-mail as \"Partner, Beechwood Advisory Group, Inc.\" and attached an\r\n\"Executive Summary\" for Carolina Springs Bottling, Inc. The Executive Summary\r\nmentioned Hansen in three respects. The cover page provided contact information\r\nfor \"Clifford Hansen\" and \"Robert Fields, Beechwood Advisory Group.\" It also\r\ndescribed the proposed management team of Carolina Springs Bottling, Inc. as\r\nincluding Hansen as chief executive officer and listed Hansen as a member of the\r\nboard of directors.\r\n\r\n      Three days later, Fields e-mailed Cobb with a new purpose, signing as\r\n\"Partner, Beechwood Advisory Group.\" He proposed a new deal in which Hunt\r\nwould own 60% of the equity, \"Beechwood\" would own 15%, another investor\r\nwould own 15%, and 10% would \"be for the owner/operator (Hansen) on an earn\r\nin basis.\" About this time, Fields and Hansen's relationship became strained.\r\n\r\n1 Advisory Group had previously informed Hansen that he failed to pay as required\r\nby the agreement and if he did not meet the requirements of the agreement within a\r\nweek, it would cease representing him.\r\n2 More specifically, Advisory Group agreed to secure capital from Hunt, advise\r\nHansen on negotiations with Milner, and assist in obtaining bank financing.\r\n3 Although the agreement consistently referred to Advisory Group, Fields indicated\r\nby his signature that he executed it on behalf of Development Group.\r\n\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to Hansen as we must, Hansen\r\nrealized Fields was working to acquire the water company to his exclusion.\r\nHansen thus began working on his own to secure financing.4\r\n\r\n        On May 26, Fields sent Hansen a letter on behalf of Advisory Group stating\r\nthat it had \"terminated any representation on [his] behalf.\" By this time, Hansen's\r\nletter of understanding with the water company's owner had long since expired.\r\nHansen sent Milner a proposed new letter of understanding, but Milner did not sign\r\nit.  On July 7, Hickory Springs Water, LLC was incorporated. The entity's\r\nmembers were Appellant and Greenbax Enterprises, Inc., with Appellant owning a\r\n48% interest and Greenbax owning a 52% interest.\r\n\r\n      On July 12, Appellant was formed. The members of the LLC were\r\nDevelopment Group which owned a 43.5% interest, ACC Ventures, LLC which\r\nowned a 41.5% interest, and TDTF Partnership which owned a 15% interest. ACC\r\nVentures was an LLC operated by Cobb and owned by him and his three sons.\r\nACC Ventures committed to the deal in July. TDTF Partnership was a partnership\r\nbetween George Finnegan and James Felder. Finnegan met Fields in March of\r\n2004 and became involved in the deal in May.\r\n\r\n      Hickory Springs Water, LLC ultimately purchased Water Company. At the\r\nclosing, Fields was present on behalf of Appellant.\r\n\r\n       Hansen brought suit against Fields Company, LLC; Advisory Group;\r\nDevelopment Group; and Appellant. He asserted the defendants were all jointly\r\nand severally liable for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, breach of\r\ncontract accompanied by a fraudulent act, misrepresentation, conversion, and\r\ninterference with prospective contractual relations. Prior to trial, he settled his\r\nclaims against Advisory Group and potential claims against Gregg and Byrd.\r\nFields Company, LLC and Development Group did not file an answer and\r\nultimately defaulted. Appellant proceeded to trial.\r\n\r\n4 Hansen applied for a bank loan in his effort to secure financing. The bank\r\nrequested financial information for Water Company in order to decide whether to\r\napprove the loan. Hansen had previously either prepared or obtained financial\r\ndocuments from Milner and then provided those documents to Fields. Due to a\r\ncomputer crash, Hansen lost the documents and contacted Fields seeking copies.\r\nFields responded to his request by rejecting the idea of bank financing and refusing\r\nto provide the documents.\r\n\n       Following the close of Hansen's case, Appellant moved for a directed verdict\r\non all causes of action, arguing the allegedly wrongful acts were all committed by\r\nFields, Advisory Group, and Development Group, and it should not be held liable\r\nfor those other parties' acts. The circuit court denied the motion, concluding there\r\nwas evidence from which a jury could find that Appellant ratified the conduct of\r\nthe other parties.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court permitted a bifurcated jury deliberation whereby the jury\r\nwould first determine liability on all claims. If the jury found Appellant liable on\r\nany of the claims, Hansen would then have to elect a cause of action. The jury\r\nwould then determine Hansen's damages.\r\n\r\n      The jury returned a liability verdict for Hansen on all causes of action.\r\nThereafter, Hansen elected to proceed on his interference with prospective\r\ncontractual relations claim, and the jury returned a damages verdict in the amount\r\nof $1,189,408. The trial court granted Appellant's motion for a set off and reduced\r\nthe verdict by $130,000, the amount of Hansen's settlement with the other\r\ndefendants.\r\n\r\n      The parties filed cross-appeals, and this Court certified the case pursuant to\r\nRule 204(b), SCACR.             LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n        Appellant appeals the denial of its motion for a directed verdict on all of\r\nHansen's claims, asserting there was no evidence from which a jury could conclude\r\nthat it is liable to Hansen. The parties do not dispute that Appellant did not breach\r\nany contract with Hansen, nor did it act tortiously towards him. Rather, Hansen's\r\ntheory of the case depends on Appellant being liable for its promoters'—\r\nspecifically Fields' and his related entities'—acts.5\r\n\r\n        The first step in resolving this case is determining if and when a limited\r\nliability company can be held liable for its promoter's pre-incorporation contracts\r\nor torts, issues of first impression in South Carolina. Turning first to a corporate\r\nentity's liability for preformation contracts, we adopt the prevailing rule that\r\n\"[b]ecause a corporation cannot have agents, contract for itself, or be contracted\r\n\r\n5 A promoter of a corporate entity is a person who acts to organize the entity by\r\npreparing it to transact business and establishing it. See Bivens v. Watkins, 313\r\nS.C. 228, 233 n.5, 437 S.E.2d 132, 135 n.5 (Ct. App. 1993) (\"[P]ersons who plan\r\nor organize a corporation are 'promoters.'\").\r\n\nwith prior to its incorporation, it is not liable on any contracts that a promoter\r\nmakes for its benefit prior to incorporation unless it assumes the obligation by its\r\nown act after incorporation . . . .\" 18 Am. Jur. 2d Corporations § 123 (2014); see\r\nalso Duray Dev., LLC v. Perrin, 792 N.W.2d 749, 755 (Mich. Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(applying the rule to a limited liability company); JCL Props., LLC v. Equity Land\r\nDevelopers, LLC, 958 N.Y.S.2d 433, 434 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013) (applying the rule\r\nto a limited liability company).\r\n\r\n       While initially not liable for a promoter's contracts, a corporation may\r\nbecome liable for a promoter's preformation contract either through expressly\r\nratifying the contract or through implicitly ratifying it by accepting its benefits\r\nwith full knowledge of its terms.

Jur. 2d Corporations § 123 (\"A\r\ncorporation may after its organization become liable on preliminary contracts made\r\nby its promoters by expressly adopting such contracts or by receiving the benefits\r\nfrom them . . . .\").\r\n\r\n       Here, the directed verdict should have been granted as to Hansen's contract\r\nclaims because he failed to present any evidence from which a jury could find that\r\nAppellant ratified any contract with Hansen.6 There was no evidence that\r\nAppellant expressly ratified any preformation contract. There also was no\r\nevidence to show that Appellant benefited from or accepted any benefits of Fields'\r\nor his related entities' contracts with Hansen. The contracts Hansen entered into\r\n\r\n6 Hansen failed to point to any particular contract and articulate how it was\r\nexpressly or impliedly ratified. Rather, Hansen relies on broad and conclusory\r\ncontentions that Appellant \"sought to and did, in fact, ratify all of the actions,\r\nagreements, representations, contracts and warranties made by Fields in\r\nfurtherance of their purchase of [Water Company] . . . .\"\r\n\nwith Advisory Group and Development Group dealt with those entities finding\r\ncapital for him in order to enable him to purchase Water Company. Appellant\r\nwanted to purchase Water Company and was a competitor in that respect.\r\nTherefore, Appellant could not and did not benefit from any efforts to find capital\r\nfor Hansen. Thus, because there was no evidence from which a jury could find\r\nthat Appellant expressly or impliedly ratified any contract with Hansen, the\r\ndirected verdict should have been granted as to Hansen's contractual claims.\r\n\r\n       Turning to Hansen's tort claims, for the preformation torts of a corporate\r\nentity's promoter, the rule among those jurisdictions that have considered the issue\r\nis that a \"corporation is not liable for torts that its promoters committed before it\r\ncame into existence.\" 1A William M. Fletcher et al., Fletcher Cyclopedia of the\r\nLaw of Corporations § 218 (perm. ed., rev. vol. 2010); see also Arch Aluminum &\r\nGlass Co. v. Haney, 964 So. 2d 228, 234 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007) (rejecting the\r\nplaintiff's tort claim against a corporation for the acts of its promoters on the basis\r\nof the rule that a corporation is not liable for the tortious acts of its promoters);\r\nNilavar v. Osborn, 711 N.E.2d 726, 740 (Ohio Ct. App. 1998) (\"[A] corporation\r\ncannot be held liable for the acts of a promoter that were performed before the\r\ncorporation's existence.\"); Fisk v. Leith, 3 P.2d 535, 535 (Or. 1931) (holding a\r\ncorporation cannot be held liable for the acts of its promoter undertaken prior to\r\nthe corporation's existence); Edmunds v. Sanders, 2 S.W.3d 697, 704 (Tex. App.\r\n1999) (\"Normally, a corporation which has no legal existence at the time of an\r\nincident cannot be liable for that incident.\"). Hansen has not cited, nor have we\r\nfound, any authority applying a different rule. Additionally, three policy concerns\r\nlead us to conclude that it is the proper rule. First, there is no agency relationship\r\nbetween a promoter and a non-existent corporate entity. Second, the individual\r\ntortfeasor—the promoter—is still liable for any tort he committed and thus, the\r\ninjured party is not denied recourse for the wrong suffered. To the extent the\r\npromoter owns a portion of the corporate entity, the injured party could use that\r\ninterest to satisfy any judgment against the promoter. Additionally, other members\r\nof the corporate entity could potentially be held liable under a conspiracy theory if\r\nthey knew of and aided in the tort. See Peoples Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n of S.C. v.\r\nRes. Planning Corp., 358 S.C. 460, 470, 596 S.E.2d 51, 56–57 (2004) (\"A civil\r\nconspiracy is a combination of two or more parties joined for the purpose of\r\ninjuring the plaintiff and thereby causing special damage.\"). Third, a contrary rule\r\nwould permit innocent investors to be financially harmed due to tortious conduct\r\nthey neither aided nor were aware of and therefore, may stifle investment by\r\ncausing potential investors to fear that a corporation will be held liable for tortious\r\n\nconduct of which it had no knowledge. Accordingly, we adopt the rule that a\r\ncorporation is not liable in tort for the preformation acts of its promoter.7\r\n\r\n      Because a corporation is not liable for the preformation acts of its promoter,\r\nAppellant cannot be liable in tort for Fields' or his related entities' preformation\r\nacts. Thus, the circuit court should have granted the motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n       Because Hansen failed to present any evidence Appellant ratified Fields' or\r\nhis related entities' contracts, Appellant was entitled to a directed verdict on the\r\ncontract claims. Additionally, consistent with the prevailing rule elsewhere, we\r\nhold Appellant was not liable for any torts committed by its promoters.\r\nAccordingly, we hold the circuit court erred in denying Appellant's motion for a\r\ndirected verdict and reverse.8\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Although inapplicable here because there is no evidence Appellant ratified Fields'\r\nconduct, we recognize there are exceptions to this rule. See Nanodetex Corp. v.\r\nDefiant Techs., 349 F. App'x 312, 322 (10th Cir. 2009) (\"[C]orporations are\r\nusually prevented from retaining the benefits of wrongful conduct while escaping\r\nliability for it.\"); 18 C.J.S. Corporations § 104 (\"A corporation is not liable for the\r\nfraud, negligence, or other torts of its promoters or corporators prior to its creation,\r\nunless it has in some way rendered itself liable by its own act after acquiring\r\ncorporate existence.\").\r\n8 Because our resolution of this issue is dispositive, we need not reach Hansen's\r\narguments or the other issues raised by Appellant. See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\nof Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\nappellate court need not address remaining issues when the disposition of a prior\r\nissue is dispositive).\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27437","title":"Sloan v.

Etter, seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief,\r\nand attorney's fees and costs. After suit was filed, DOR produced the requested\r\ninformation and asserted that Sloan's action was mooted and should be dismissed.\r\nThe trial court agreed with DOR and dismissed the complaint, denying all relief.\r\nWe affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for an award of reasonable attorney's\r\nfees and costs to Sloan.                    I.\r\n\r\nOn November 19, 2012, Sloan sent a FOIA request to DOR, seeking specific\r\ndocuments related to the procurement process through which DOR retained a\r\ncomputer security company in response to a cyber-attack on DOR databases.\r\n\r\nDOR responded to Sloan by letter on December 10, 2012:\r\n\r\n        The South Carolina Department of Revenue has received your\r\n        Freedom of Information request dated November 19, 2012. Your\r\n        request is currently being researched and reviewed. As soon as the\r\n        information has been compiled, you will be contacted again and the\r\n        requested information will be sent to you.\r\n\r\n        If we are unable to locate, obtain or release the requested file(s) you\r\n        will be notified of the decision and the reasons for it.\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of FOIA is to protect the public by providing a mechanism for the\r\ndisclosure of information by public bodies.\" Sloan v. Friends of the Hunley, Inc.\r\n(Friends I), 369 S.C. 20, 26, 630 S.E.2d 474, 478 (2006) (citing Bellamy v. Brown,\r\n305 S.C. 291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991)). To that end, FOIA provides:\r\n\r\n        Each public body, upon written request for records made under this\r\n        chapter, shall within fifteen days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and\r\n        legal public holidays) of the receipt of any such request notify the\r\n\r\n1Sloan brought this action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated as\r\nwell as the South Carolina Public Interest Foundation. We refer to these parties\r\ncollectively as \"Sloan.\"\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 30-4-10 to -165 (2007 & Supp. 2013).\r\n\n      person making such request of its determination and the reasons\r\n      therefor. Such a determination shall constitute the final opinion of the\r\n      public body as to the public availability of the requested public record\r\n      and, if the request is granted, the record must be furnished or made\r\n      available for inspection or copying. If written notification of the\r\n      determination of the public body as to the availability of the requested\r\n      public record is neither mailed nor personally delivered to the person\r\n      requesting the document within the fifteen days allowed herein, the\r\n      request must be considered approved.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-30(c) (2007) (emphasis added). Part of the December 10,\r\n2012 letter appears compliant with section 30-4-30(c), but the final one-sentence\r\nparagraph—the \"if we are unable to . . . release the requested file(s) you will be\r\nnotified of the decision\" language—seeks to delay DOR's final determination as to\r\nthe public availability of the requested documents. DOR's response is best\r\ncharacterized as \"we will get to it when we get to it,\" which is manifestly at odds\r\nwith the clarity mandated by section 30-4-30(c).\r\n\r\nWhen a public body does not render a final opinion within the fifteen-day\r\ndetermination period, FOIA provides for both declaratory and injunctive relief. Id.\r\n§ 30-4-100(a) (2007). FOIA also provides for attorney's fees and costs to the\r\nprevailing party. Id. § 30-4-100(b) (2007).\r\n\r\nBecause DOR's response did not satisfy the requirements of FOIA, Sloan filed suit\r\non December 21, 2012, seeking a declaratory judgment that DOR's actions violated\r\nFOIA, an injunction requiring DOR to cease violating FOIA by producing the\r\nrequested documents, and attorney's fees and costs pursuant to section 30-4-100(b).\r\n\r\nThree weeks after Sloan filed suit, DOR provided Sloan with the documents he had\r\nrequested. The trial court held a hearing at which Sloan conceded that his request\r\nfor injunctive relief was mooted by DOR's production of documents, but Sloan\r\nmaintained that his request for declaratory relief and attorney's fees and costs\r\nremained viable. Conversely, DOR contended Sloan was entitled to no relief. The\r\ntrial court, in a Form 4 order, summarily ended the case, thereby agreeing with\r\nDOR and denying all relief Sloan sought. Sloan appealed, and this Court certified\r\nthe appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\n                                          II. \n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Sloan contends that DOR did not comply with FOIA, that his claim for\r\ndeclaratory relief was not mooted by DOR's production of documents, and that he\r\nis entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\nDOR's response did not comply with the statutory dictates of FOIA. While DOR\r\ndid respond to Sloan, its equivocal and evasive response was not a final opinion on\r\nthe public availability of the requested documents and did not state whether the\r\ninformation requested by Sloan was publicly available for inspection, copying, or\r\nproduction.3 See S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-30(c) (requiring a \"final opinion of the\r\npublic body as to the public availability of the requested public record\" within\r\nfifteen days of the receipt of a FOIA request).\r\n\r\nDespite DOR's failure to comply with the requirements of FOIA, we hold the trial\r\ncourt properly found that Sloan's request for a declaratory judgment was mooted\r\nwhen DOR produced the requested information. Indeed, Sloan acknowledges that\r\nhis claim for injunctive relief was mooted when he received the documents. Sloan\r\ncontends, however, that the claim for declaratory relief remained viable. We\r\ndisagree, for \"the information Sloan sought has been disclosed, [and] there is no\r\ncontinuing violation of FOIA upon which the trial court could have issued a\r\ndeclaratory judgment.\" Friends I, 369 S.C. at 26, 630 S.E.2d at 478. This,\r\nhowever, does not end the case, for Sloan further sought to recover his attorney's\r\nfees and costs4 as provided in section 30-4-100(b).\r\n3 We are not unsympathetic with the burden placed on public bodies to make a\r\nfinal determination within fifteen days. This requirement is, however, a\r\nlegislatively mandated time period with which public bodies must comply and\r\ncourts must enforce.\r\n4 DOR contends the issue of attorney's fees and costs is not preserved for appellate\r\nreview because the Form 4 order did not explicitly reference the issue. We\r\ndisagree, for Sloan sought attorney's fees and costs in his complaint and the issue\r\nwas argued at the hearing. See State v. Oxner, 391 S.C. 132, 134, 705 S.E.2d 51,\r\n52 (2011) (\"'[A]ll this Court has ever required is that the questions presented for its\r\ndecision must first have been fairly and properly raised to the lower court and\r\npassed upon by that court.'\" (quoting Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 19, 5 S.E.2d\r\n187, 189 (1939))). By denying all requested relief and \"ending\" the case, the Form\r\n4 order necessarily ruled on Sloan's request for attorney's fees and costs, as well as\r\nhis request for injunctive and declaratory relief. Because we construe this\r\n\nSloan is the prevailing party. See Sloan v. Friends of the Hunley, Inc. (Friends II),\r\n393 S.C. 152, 157, 711 S.E.2d 895, 897 (2011) (\"When a public body frustrates a\r\ncitizen's FOIA request to the extent that the citizen must seek relief in the courts\r\nand incur litigation costs, the public body should not be able to preclude prevailing\r\nparty status to the citizen by producing the documents after litigation is filed.\"\r\n(citations omitted)). As the prevailing party under these circumstances, the trial\r\ncourt erred in not awarding Sloan his reasonable attorney's fees and costs.5 Sloan\r\nis entitled to recover his reasonable attorney's fees and costs in this action. See\r\nLitchfield Plantation Co. v. Georgetown Cnty. Water & Sewer Dist., 314 S.C. 30,\r\n34, 443 S.E.2d 574, 576 (1994) (Toal, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (\"A\r\ngovernmental agency should not be allowed to stonewall an FOIA request without\r\nsome penalty for its actions.\"). We reverse the trial court and remand to the trial\r\ncourt for an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs to Sloan.\r\n\r\n                                        III.\r\n\r\nWe affirm the trial court's dismissal of Sloan's claims for declaratory and\r\ninjunctive relief, and we reverse the denial of attorney's fees and costs and remand\r\nfor a determination of Sloan's reasonable attorney's fees and costs in this action.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part\r\nand dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary dismissal as a denial of Sloan's request for attorney's fees and costs, the\r\nremand proposed by the dissent to revisit the issue anew is not warranted.\r\n5 Sloan's request for attorney's fees and costs is not limited to the period of time\r\nconcluding with the production of the requested documents. The temporal\r\nlimitation in Friends II was a consequence of the law of the case doctrine from\r\nFriends I, as we were \"constrained to reverse the award of fees beyond the time\r\n[the public body] produced the requested documents.\" Friends II, 393 S.C. at 158,\r\n711 S.E.2d at 898. No such constraint is present here.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in part and dissent in part. I agree with the\r\nmajority's holding that DOR's response to Sloan's document request failed to\r\ncomply with the requirement of FOIA. 6 I further agree that Sloan's action for\r\ndeclaratory relief was rendered moot when DOR produced the requested\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nI dissent from that portion of the majority's decision as mandates an award of\r\nattorney's fees and costs to Sloan upon remand. The award of fees and costs to the\r\nprevailing person or entity in a suit brought pursuant to section 30-4-100(a) is\r\nentrusted to the discretion of the trial court. S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-100(b) (2007)\r\n(\"If a person or entity seeking such relief prevails, he or it may be awarded\r\nreasonable attorney fees and other costs of litigation.\") (emphasis supplied). The\r\ntrial court in this case declined to exercise its discretion in regard to an award of\r\nfees and costs. Therefore, I would remand this case to circuit court where the\r\nparties should be permitted to present the full panoply of considerations germane\r\nto an award of fees and costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 I share in the majority's concern over the burden placed on public bodies to make\r\na final determination within fifteen days. See S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-30(c) (2007).\r\nI note that our version of FOIA, unlike the Federal Act, does not allow an agency\r\nto extend its determination of a FOIA request where that request is especially\r\nburdensome or voluminous.

Because we find Respondent\r\nRobert Malloy's claim is not based on a duty derived from the agreements\r\ncontaining arbitration clauses as asserted by Merrill Lynch, we agree with the\r\ncircuit court that as a non-signatory Malloy cannot be compelled to arbitrate under\r\nthese agreements.                      FACTS\r\n\r\nThis action arises out of a dispute between Malloy and Swain R. Thompson,\r\nregarding assets of Robert L. Chamblee (Decedent). The complaint alleges that\r\nThompson, with the assistance of Merrill Lynch,1 acted to disrupt Decedent's estate\r\nplan and divert Decedent's assets from Malloy to Thompson.\r\n\r\nMalloy denominates his claims against Merrill Lynch as: (a) intentional\r\ninterference with inheritance;2 (b) aiding and abetting intentional interference with\r\ninheritance; (c) and civil conspiracy.\r\n\r\nMerrill Lynch moved to dismiss and compel arbitration arguing that its only\r\nconnection to this dispute is through its contractual duties under the client\r\n\r\n1 The complaint also alleges that the other named defendants, Greene and\r\nCompany, L.L.P. and Joseph T. Argo, assisted in diverting these assets.\r\n  The parties give this claim different titles including: tortious interference with\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\ninheritance, tortious interference with an expectancy of inheritance, intentional\r\ninterference with inheritance, and intentional interference with an expectancy of\r\ninheritance. The correct name is intentional interference with inheritance. See\r\nDouglass v. Boyce, 344 S.C. 5, 542 S.E.2d 715 (2001) (discussing \"intentional\r\ninterference with inheritance\").\r\n\nrelationship agreements (CRAs) entered into between Decedent and Merrill Lynch,\r\nwhich contained mandatory arbitration clauses. Merrill Lynch argued that although\r\nMalloy was a non-signatory to the agreements, any duty, if any, owed by Merrill\r\nLynch to Malloy derives from the CRAs, and therefore, he is bound by the\r\narbitration clauses.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court denied the motion and found that while non-signatories may be\r\nbound to an arbitration agreement under common law principles of contract and\r\nagency law, none of those principles apply in this case, and therefore, there was no\r\nbasis to compel Malloy to arbitrate. Merrill Lynch appealed.\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\n\r\n   1.\t Whether Malloy has sufficiently pled a valid claim against Merrill Lynch\r\n       since South Carolina has not adopted the tort of intentional interference with\r\n       inheritance?\r\n\r\n   2.\t If South Carolina does recognize the tort, are Malloy's claims subject to\r\n       arbitration?                DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n   1. Did Malloy's complaint sufficiently allege a valid cause of action?\r\nMerrill Lynch contends for the first time on appeal that the circuit court should\r\nhave dismissed Malloy's claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\r\ngranted because the tort it alleges, intentional interference with inheritance, is not\r\nrecognized by South Carolina. Additionally, Merrill Lynch argues that even if\r\nSouth Carolina were to recognize the tort, Malloy's complaint fails to allege facts\r\nnecessary to sustain such an action. We decline to address these contentions\r\nbecause this issue was neither argued nor ruled upon in the proceedings below.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, issue preservation requires that an issue be raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the trial judge. Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733\r\n(1998). The issue must be sufficiently clear to bring into focus the precise nature of\r\nthe alleged error so that it can be reasonably understood by the judge. Id. at 76, 497\r\nS.E.2d at 733. “It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\nappeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\npreserved for appellate review.” Id.\r\n\nThe issue whether South Carolina recognizes intentional interference with\r\ninheritance was neither raised nor ruled upon below, nor was there any discussion\r\nor ruling as to the sufficiency of Malloy's complaint. While our rules allow us to\r\naffirm the trial court's ruling on any ground appearing in the record, Rule 220\r\nSCACR, Merrill Lynch asks us to reverse on such a ground. We decline to do so,\r\nand this opinion must not be understood as either adopting or rejecting the tort of\r\nintentional interference with inheritance.\r\n\r\n    2. Should Malloy's claims against Merrill Lynch be subject to arbitration?\r\nMerrill Lynch contends that Malloy is bound by the arbitration agreement\r\ncontained in two CRAs that Decedent executed with Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch\r\navers that at all times germane to this asserted claim, its relationship with Decedent\r\nwas pursuant to the CRAs. Merrill Lynch contends that any duty owed to Malloy\r\nwas derivative of its duty to Decedent under the CRAs, and therefore, the circuit\r\ncourt erred in not compelling arbitration. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court ruled that as a non-signatory to the CRAs Malloy could be bound\r\nby an arbitration agreement under common law principles of contract and/or\r\nagency law, but none of those principles apply in this case, and therefore, there was\r\nno basis to compel Malloy to arbitrate. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals has recognized that five theories \"'aris[ing] out of common\r\nlaw principles of contract and agency law' could provide a basis 'for binding\r\nnonsignatories to arbitration agreements: 1) incorporation by references; 2)\r\nassumption; 3) agency; 4) veil piercing/alter ego; and 5) estoppel.'\" Pearson v.\r\nHilton Head Hosp., 400 S.C. 281, 288, 733 S.E.2d 597, 601 (Ct. App. 2012)\r\n(quoting Int'l Paper Co. v. Schwabedissen Maschinen & Anlagen GMBH, 206\r\nF.3d 411, 416 (4th Cir. 2000)). In addition to these theories, some federal courts\r\nhave recognized that a third-party beneficiary of a contract containing an\r\narbitration clause may be compelled to arbitrate as a non-signatory. See Bridas\r\nS.A.P.I.C. v. Gov't of Turkmenistan, 345 F.3d 347 (5th Cir. 2003).\r\n\r\nMerrill Lynch does not argue that any contract, agency, or third-party beneficiary\r\ntheory supports a finding that Malloy is obligated to arbitrate pursuant to the\r\nCRAs.3 Instead, it presents its general argument that arbitration should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Regardless, we agree with the circuit court that in this case none of these theories\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\ncould bind Malloy to the arbitration agreement CRAs.\r\n\ncompelled because any duty violated by Merrill Lynch is derivative of its duties to\r\nDecedent under the CRAs.\r\n\r\nMerrill Lynch's argument that a derivative \"duty\" from the CRAs binds Malloy, a\r\nnon-signatory to the CRAs, conflates the duties created by the CRA contracts and\r\ngeneral tort duties. Malloy does not claim that Merrill Lynch breached a duty\r\ncreated by the CRAs, but rather that it breached the duty owed by all persons not to\r\nintentionally interfere with another's expected inheritance. The contractual duties\r\nbetween Decedent and Merrill Lynch are irrelevant to whether Merrill Lynch\r\nintentionally interfered with Malloy's expected inheritance. Accordingly, we find\r\nthat Malloy is not bound by the CRA's arbitration agreements and affirm the circuit\r\ncourt's denial of Merrill Lynch's motion to dismiss and compel arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27439","title":"State v.

The State appeals from a decision of the\r\n\nCourt of Appeals that reversed and remanded the matter for a new trial based\r\nsolely on the trial court's admission of seven pre-autopsy photos of the victim.\r\nState v. Collins, 398 S.C. 197, 727 S.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 2012). We reverse.\r\n\r\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n       On November 3, 2006, the mother of the victim returned to her home in\r\nDillon County around 7:00 p.m. and discovered that her ten-year-old son had not\r\ncome home for dinner at 5:30 p.m. as expected. She checked with her aunt, who\r\nresided with her, and then began looking around the neighborhood. She called the\r\npolice when she could not find her son. The police arrived and the mother rode\r\nwith them as they scoured the neighborhood. Shortly after 10:00 p.m., they\r\ndiscovered the boy's body on the ground in Collins's yard, with a group of dogs\r\nnearby. The mother poignantly recalled that her son \"was tore to pieces. Pieces.\"\r\n\r\n       The mother and the police tried to get to the boy, but the dogs ran at them\r\neach time they approached his body. Agents from SLED arrived, and they could\r\nnot process the crime scene until animal control employees arrived to capture and\r\nremove the dogs from the scene.\r\n\r\n      Neither Collins nor any of his family members were at home. Collins had\r\nsix dogs on the premises, all of which were unrestrained. Collins had no fence or\r\ndog pens, and neighbors reported that he never kept his dogs on leashes or chains.\r\nMost of the dogs appeared to be pitbull mixes. The three largest dogs weighed 47\r\npounds, 44 pounds, and 36 pounds, respectively, and they ranged in age from about\r\none to two years old. Several of the dogs had bite wounds on their shoulders,\r\nwhich was indicative of dog fighting. One of the female dogs captured was\r\ndetermined to be in heat.\r\n\r\n      An autopsy of the victim revealed the boy died of extensive traumatic injury\r\nsecondary to being severely mauled by dogs. According to the forensic\r\npathologist, Edward Proctor, the boy suffered a \"tremendous number\" of bite\r\nmarks on his legs and had \"extensive\" loss of skin and soft tissue on his upper body\r\nand his face, including his ears and nose, which were \"completely eaten away\" by\r\nthe dogs. Areas of the boy's chest and his arm had also been eaten, exposing the\r\nbone. The boy's jugular vein on the left side was torn in half, causing significant\r\nblood loss leading to his death. The pathologist determined the boy \"would have\r\nbeen alive until the injuries to the neck that transected the blood vessel in the neck\r\nallowing him to bleed enough until he either became unconscious or expired.\"\r\n\n       Two boys who lived in the neighborhood, \"J\" and \"B,\" gave statements to\r\nthe police the day after the incident. They were in J's yard at around sunset on\r\nNovember 3, 2006 when they heard growling and barking nearby. J had been\r\nlooking for his puppy, so they went to investigate and saw three of Collins's dogs\r\neating something on the ground that appeared to be \"a bloody piece of meat.\" As J\r\nwalked to within about ten feet of the \"meat,\" another dog that they had not seen\r\nran out and jumped on J, knocking him to the ground. J shoved that dog away, but\r\nanother one then came after him. One of the larger dogs bit J \"behind [his] neck,\"\r\nso the boys left immediately.\r\n\r\n      Collins was indicted for involuntary manslaughter and three counts of\r\nowning a dangerous animal1 and allowing it to be unconfined, resulting in the\r\nmauling death of the victim. A jury convicted Collins of all charges. Collins\r\nappealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded for a new trial\r\nbased solely on the admission of seven photographs that were taken by the\r\npathologist to document the victim's injuries prior to performing the autopsy. This\r\nCourt granted the State's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       \"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\"\r\nState v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). \"This Court is\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\" Id.\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a\r\nmanifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.\" State v. Wise,\r\n359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when\r\nthe conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled\r\nby an error of law.\" Id.      III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       On appeal, the State contends the challenged photos, taken before the\r\nautopsy was commenced, accurately documented the injuries sustained by the\r\nvictim in this case and, while graphic, were properly admitted in accordance with\r\nthe trial court's broad discretion over evidentiary matters. The State argues the\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The State charged Collins with three counts of owning a dangerous animal\r\n(although six dogs were at the scene) based on the fact that the neighborhood boys\r\nspecifically saw three of Collins's dogs eating the victim's body.\r\n\nCourt of Appeals (1) failed to give due deference to the trial court's decision,\r\n(2) erred in finding the photos were more prejudicial than probative, (3) erred in\r\nfinding the photos were not material to the elements of the offenses charged and\r\ncorroborative of other evidence, and (4) erred in making a purely emotional\r\ndecision to reverse and remand for a new trial. We agree.\r\n\r\n                             A. Admissibility of Photos\r\n       In this case, Collins faced three charges under section 47-3-760 for being the\r\nowner of a \"dangerous animal\"2 that attacked and injured a human being in\r\nviolation of section 47-3-710(A)(2)(a) of the South Carolina Code. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 47-3-760(B) (Supp. 2013) (penalty for dangerous animals). As noted by\r\n\r\n2 Section 47-3-710(A) defines \"dangerous animal\" to \"mean[] an animal of the\r\ncanine or feline family:\r\n\r\n    (1) which the owner knows or reasonably should know has a propensity, \n\r\n    tendency, or disposition to attack unprovoked, cause injury, or otherwise \n\r\n    endanger the safety of human beings or domestic animals; \n\r\n\r\n    (2) which:\r\n\r\n        (a) makes an unprovoked attack that causes bodily injury to a human\r\n    being and the attack occurs in a place other than the place where the animal is\r\n    confined as required by Section 47-3-720; or\r\n\r\n        (b) commits unprovoked acts in a place other than the place where the \n\r\n    animal is confined as required by Section 47-3-720 and those acts cause a \n\r\n    person to reasonably believe that the animal will attack and cause bodily \n\r\n    injury to a human being; \n\r\n\r\n    (3) which is owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of fighting\r\n    or which is trained for fighting.\"\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 47-3-710(A) (Supp. 2013). Section 47-3-720, referenced above,\r\nprovides: \"No person owning or harboring or having the care or the custody of a\r\ndangerous animal may permit the animal to go unconfined on the premises,\" with\r\n\"unconfined\" in this context meaning \"the animal is not confined securely indoors\r\nor confined in a securely enclosed fence or securely enclosed and locked pen or\r\nrun area upon the person's premises.\" Id. § 47-3-720.\r\n\nthe Court of Appeals, under section 47-3-760(B) and its associated statutes, the\r\nState was required to prove (1) the defendant owned or had custody or control of a\r\ncanine or feline; (2) he knew or reasonably should have known the animal had a\r\npropensity, tendency, or disposition to attack unprovoked, cause injury, or\r\notherwise endanger the safety of human beings; (3) the animal made an\r\nunprovoked attack; (4) the attack caused bodily injury to a human being; and\r\n(5) the attack occurred while the animal was unconfined on the defendant's\r\npremises. State v. Collins, 398 S.C. 197, 203, 727 S.E.2d 751, 754 (Ct. App.\r\n2012). Collins was also charged with involuntary manslaughter. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-3-60 (2003) (providing \"[a] person charged with the crime of\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter may be convicted only upon a showing of criminal\r\nnegligence,\" which \"is defined as the reckless disregard of the safety of others\").\r\nTo establish this offense, the State must show the defendant killed another person\r\nwithout malice and unintentionally while the defendant was engaged in either\r\n(1) an unlawful activity not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to\r\ncause death or great bodily harm, or (2) a lawful activity with a reckless disregard\r\nof the safety of others. State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 584 S.E.2d 110 (2003); State\r\nv. Tyler, 348 S.C. 526, 560 S.E.2d 888 (2002).\r\n\r\n       In this case, the ten-year-old victim's body was discovered in the defendant's\r\nyard, having suffered numerous bite marks and being partially eaten by the dogs.\r\nThere were no eyewitnesses to the attack. At trial, the State attempted to piece\r\ntogether a theory of what transpired with the best evidence available, the victim's\r\nbody, and its expert witnesses, which included a forensic pathologist and a dog\r\nbehaviorist. They theorized that it was an unprovoked attack in which the victim\r\nwas taken down by his legs first based on the wounds observed on the body, and\r\nthen the boy suffered additional harm to his jugular vein and other areas, leading to\r\nhis death. According to the State's dog behavior expert, the dogs, who were not\r\nrestrained in any way, acted as a pack and could have been malnourished or\r\nmistreated based on the dogs' gaunt appearance, the absence of any food at the\r\nscene, and the appearance of the victim's body, which appeared to have been eaten\r\nby more than one dog due to the significant tissue loss. The dog expert noted that\r\nin over ten years of working for the Sheriff's Office analyzing dog bites, dog\r\nattacks, and deaths caused by dogs, this was the worst case he had ever seen.\r\n\r\n      The State also presented evidence of the dogs' prior acts of aggression\r\ntowards people in the neighborhood, several occurring while Collins stood by and\r\nwatched without taking any action to restrain his dogs. For example, B, one of the\r\ntwo boys who came upon the victim's body after the attack, testified he had\r\n\nnumerous encounters with the dogs, as they were \"never\" restrained. B recounted\r\nthat on at least two occasions, Collins stood by and watched as the dogs ran out\r\ninto the road after him and his friend J as they drove four-wheelers. Collins did not\r\nattempt to intervene. In addition, when B and his mother tried to walk in the\r\nneighborhood for exercise, the dogs would \"frequently\" come out and try to bite\r\ntheir legs, so they wound up having to change their route just to avoid Collins's\r\naggressive dogs.\r\n\r\n       In order to support its assertions about the dangerous propensities of the\r\ndogs, the manner and extent of the attack, and Collins's criminal negligence, the\r\nState also offered a group of photos taken of the victim by Proctor, the forensic\r\npathologist, before he began the autopsy. The trial court engaged in an extended\r\ncolloquy in camera with the State and defense counsel in which the trial court\r\nallowed both sides to make arguments, and then the attorneys and the court\r\nexamined the pathologist about each of the proposed photos in turn. The trial court\r\npulled some photos and ultimately allowed into evidence seven of the pre-autopsy\r\nphotos, State's Exhibits 27 and 30 to 35, over defense counsel's Rule 403, SCRE\r\nobjection.3\r\n\r\n      In his trial testimony, Proctor explained that he did not normally take\r\nautopsy photos, but in his years of experience he had \"never seen an attack by\r\nanimals of this type, [so he] actually left the autopsy and went to [his] home and\r\nbrought [his] camera back and took pictures for [] documentation purposes.\"\r\n(Emphasis added.) Proctor found there was \"tremendous traumatic injury to this\r\nyoung man\" that was as \"significant [a] traumatic injury as [he had] seen.\"\r\n\r\n       During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Proctor's findings\r\nextensively by asking him whether he had surveyed the dogs' teeth marks to\r\ndetermine which dogs inflicted specific injuries, whether the boy's jugular artery\r\nwas \"actually severed,\" and which came first, the \"shredding\" of the boy's jugular\r\nartery or the veins in his arms, etc. Thus, the nature and extent of the boy's\r\nphysical injuries as described by the pathologist were in contention by the defense.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, while Collins did not testify, his witnesses, including his children\r\nand friends, did so, and they maintained the dogs were not at all dangerous, that\r\n\r\n3 The first two photos, numbers 27 and 30, show the boy's legs having numerous\r\nbite marks, but they clearly do not rise to a level that could be deemed unfairly\r\nprejudicial. The remaining five photos, 31 to 35, which are the true focus of our\r\ninquiry, variously show the boy's exposed jawbone and upper arm bone, and the\r\nareas where his chest and face had been partially eaten during the dog attack.\r\n\nthey had never run at people in an aggressive manner, and that they had always\r\nbeen given an abundance of food. The defense opined that the presence of the\r\nfemale dog in heat had perhaps made the dogs more agitated and territorial than\r\nnormal, but they were not dangerous animals. However, after considering all of\r\nthe available evidence, the jury made a determination of guilt as to the charges.\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial solely on the\r\nbasis of the trial court's decision to admit the pre-autopsy photos, reasoning the\r\nprobative value of the challenged photos was substantially outweighed by their\r\npotential for being unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, SCRE, and that the error\r\nwas not harmless. State v. Collins, 398 S.C. 197, 727 S.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\nThe court \"agreed[d] that the photos have some probative value in helping the\r\njury,\" and \"recognize[d] that the photos add a visual element not present in the\r\ntestimony of the witnesses,\" but ultimately found these considerations were\r\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Id. at 206-12, 727 S.E.2d at 756-60.\r\nIn finding the trial court abused its discretion, the court repeatedly described the\r\nphotos as \"disturbing\" and \"gruesome.\" Id. at 208-09, 727 S.E.2d at 757-58.\r\n\r\n       As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, SCRE.\r\n\"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of\r\n  \r\nany fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or\r\nless probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SCRE. \"Although\r\nrelevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\" Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\n      \"The relevancy, materiality, and admissibility of photographs as evidence\r\nare matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\" State v. Nance, 320 S.C.\r\n501, 508, 466 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1996). \"If the offered photograph serves to\r\ncorroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit it.\" Id. \"When\r\n[balancing the danger of unfair prejudice] against the probative value, the\r\ndetermination must be based on the entire record and will turn on the facts of each\r\ncase.\" State v. Lyles, 379 S.C. 328, 338, 665 S.E.2d 201, 206 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\r\n       \"A trial judge's decision regarding the comparative probative value and\r\nprejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional\r\ncircumstances.\" State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App.\r\n2003). \"We review a trial court's decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the\r\nabuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial\r\ncourt's judgment.\" Id.\r\n\n       Under our highly deferential standard of review, we conclude, contrary to\r\nthe Court of Appeals, that the trial court did not abuse its wide scope of discretion\r\nin admitting the pre-autopsy photos. The Court of Appeals's obvious revulsion for\r\nthe evidence, while certainly understandable, permeated its legal analysis. The\r\nevidence was highly probative, corroborative, and material in establishing the\r\nelements of the offenses charged; its probative value outweighed its potential\r\nprejudice; and the appellate court should not have invaded the trial court's\r\ndiscretion in admitting this crucial evidence based on its emotional reaction to the\r\nsubject matter presented.4\r\n\r\n       Courts must often grapple with disturbing and unpleasant cases, but that\r\ndoes not justify preventing essential evidence from being considered by the jury,\r\nwhich is charged with the solemn duty of acting as the fact-finder. As one court\r\nhas astutely observed, it is the duty of courts and juries to examine the evidence in\r\neven the most unpleasant of circumstances:\r\n\r\n             Courts and juries cannot be too squeamish about looking at\r\n      unpleasant things, objects, or circumstances in proceedings to enforce\r\n      the law and especially if truth is on trial. The mere fact that an item of\r\n      evidence is gruesome or revolting, if it sheds light on, strengthens or\r\n      gives character to other evidence sustaining the issues in the case,\r\n      should not exclude it.\r\n\r\nNichols v. State, 100 So. 2d 750, 756 (Ala. 1958) (citations omitted); see also\r\nCamargo v. State, 940 S.W.2d 464, 467 (Ark. 1997) (\"Even the most gruesome\r\nphotographs may be admissible if they tend to shed light on any issue, to\r\ncorroborate testimony, or if they are essential in proving a necessary element of a\r\ncase, are useful to enable a witness to testify more effectively, or enable the jury to\r\nbetter understand [the] testimony. Other acceptable purposes are to show the\r\ncondition of the victims' bodies, the probable type or location of the injuries, and\r\nthe position in which the bodies were discovered.\" (internal citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4  To the extent the Court of Appeals stated it would not defer to the trial court's\r\ndiscretion because it did not conduct its \"own\" Rule 403 analysis, we find the\r\nrecord shows the trial court did thoroughly consider the arguments of both the\r\nState and the defense, and it examined each photo while also conducting an\r\nexamination of the forensic pathologist who took the photographs before making\r\nits decision. Moreover, Collins did not object to any alleged delict in the trial\r\ncourt's procedure at the time of the ruling.\r\n\n       Numerous jurisdictions have found that photos are not inadmissible merely\r\nbecause they are gruesome, especially where, as here, the photos simply mirror the\r\nunfortunate reality of the case. See M.C. Dransfield, Annotation, Admissibility of\r\nPhotograph of Corpse in Prosecution for Homicide or Civil Action for Causing\r\nDeath, 73 A.L.R.2d 769 (1960 & Later Case Serv. 2013) (collecting cases\r\ninvolving death photos). As one court has stated, \"The law is well settled that the\r\nmere fact that a photograph is gruesome is not a reason for its non admission.\"\r\nState v. Ernst, 114 A.2d 369, 373 (Me. 1955).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, the standard is not simply whether the evidence is prejudicial;\r\nrather, the standard under Rule 403, SCRE is whether there is a danger of unfair\r\nprejudice that substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. Where\r\nthe State had the burden of proving the elements of the offenses charged and there\r\nwere no eyewitnesses to the incident resulting in the victim's death, the photos here\r\nprovided concrete evidence as to what transpired on that fateful day. We\r\nparticularly note the photos were taken before the autopsy was conducted as a\r\nmeans to document the extent and nature of the victim's injuries. Thus, they show\r\nthe unaltered condition of the victim, not any additional wounds that could have\r\nbeen made to the body by the pathologist in performing his examination.\r\n\r\n       These are not ordinary dog bites with which most jurors would ever be\r\nfamiliar. Even the pathologist stated he felt compelled to document the injuries\r\nprior to the start of the autopsy because he had never come across a situation this\r\nextreme. Since there was no one else present at the time of the event, the photos\r\naided the jury in evaluating the testimony offered by both the State and the\r\ndefendant, especially as to determining the dangerous propensities of the dogs and\r\nwhether or not Collins's conduct was criminally reckless.\r\n\r\n       In Turnipseed v. State, 367 S.E.2d 259 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988), the Court of\r\nAppeals of Georgia considered a case in which a four-year-old was mauled by the\r\ndefendant's pitbull terriers. The court held a jury could find that the defendant's\r\nconduct of leaving the dogs unguarded, along with his knowledge of past incidents\r\ninvolving the dogs, constituted reckless conduct supporting a charge of involuntary\r\nmanslaughter. Id. at 261. In doing so, the court rejected the defendant's assertion\r\nthat the trial court's \"admission of five pre-autopsy photographs of the victim lying\r\non the autopsy table\" was error because the photos \"were irrelevant and\r\nprejudicial.\" Id. at 262. The court stated:\r\n\r\n             The photographs were not devoid of probative value because\r\n      they showed the nature of the attack on the victim. From observation\r\n      of the wounds of the victim, the jury could draw conclusions about the\r\n\n      vicious propensities of the animals and weigh this in light of the other\r\n      evidence about the dogs to determine whether or not Turnipseed's\r\n      conduct regarding them was criminally reckless.\r\n\r\nId. at 262-63; cf. State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 290-91, 676 S.E.2d 690, 697\r\n(2009) (stating \"[a]lthough the photos were graphic, the facts in this case were\r\ngraphic\" and holding the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting\r\nautopsy photos of the child victim as they corroborated the pathologist's testimony\r\nand aided the jury in understanding that testimony); State v. Edwards, 194 S.C.\r\n410, 412, 10 S.E.2d 587, 588 (1940) (holding, in a murder prosecution, that the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a graphic photo of the victim's\r\ndecomposed body where \"everything depicted by the photograph was . . . testified\r\nto in detail by the witnesses\"). B. Harmless Error\r\n      Although we find no abuse of the trial court's broad scope of discretion here,\r\nwe further find any alleged error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nSee State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 596 S.E.2d 475 (2004) (stating both error and\r\nprobable prejudice must be shown to warrant reversal).\r\n\r\n       The harmless error rule generally provides that an error is harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt if it did not contribute to the verdict obtained. Arnold v. State,\r\n309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992). \"To say that an error did not 'contribute' to\r\nthe ensuing verdict is not, of course, to say that the jury was totally unaware of that\r\nfeature of the trial . . . .\" Id. at 166, 420 S.E.2d at 838. Rather, \"[t]o say that an\r\nerror did not contribute to the verdict is . . . to find that error unimportant in\r\nrelation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed\r\nin the record.\" Id. at 166, 420 S.E.2d at 839 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n         \"No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and\r\nprejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the\r\nentire case.\" State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985). \"In\r\napplying the harmless error rule, the court must be able to declare the error had\r\nlittle, if any, likelihood of having changed the result of the trial and the court must\r\nbe able to declare such belief beyond a reasonable doubt.\" State v. Watts, 321 S.C.\r\n158, 165, 467 S.E.2d 272, 277 (Ct. App. 1996) (emphasis added) (citing Chapman\r\nv. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967))).\r\n\r\n      Another description frequently cited is that error \"is harmless where a\r\ndefendant's guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no\r\n\nother rational conclusion can be reached.\" State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 518, 633\r\nS.E.2d 152, 156 (2006); see also 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review § 659 (2007)\r\n(\"The United States Supreme Court has recognized that although the harmless error\r\ninquiry is entirely distinct from a sufficiency of the evidence inquiry, this does not\r\nmean that overwhelming evidence of guilt is irrelevant.\" (citing United States v.\r\nLane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986))).\r\n\r\n       We hold there was overwhelming evidence presented of Collins's guilt as to\r\nthe charges of (1) having an unrestrained, dangerous animal that attacked and\r\ninjured a human being, and (2) involuntary manslaughter. The undisputed\r\nevidence was that Collins's dogs were unattended and they were not confined, as\r\nthere were no fences, leashes, dog pens, or chains used to restrain them. In\r\naddition, other evidence showed Collins's dogs attacked, killed, and partially ate\r\nthe ten-year-old victim in this case, and they also attacked one of the neighborhood\r\nboys who happened upon the scene soon thereafter and bit him on the neck.\r\nLastly, there was evidence that Collins was aware of his animals' dangerous\r\npropensities, as the dogs, the largest of whom weighed 47 and 44 pounds, had\r\npreviously exhibited overt acts of aggression towards people in the neighborhood\r\nwhile Collins was present. In light of the foregoing, a jury could not rationally\r\nconclude anything other than that Collins had violated the law governing\r\nunrestrained dangerous animals and was criminally negligent in the death of the\r\nvictim. See generally State v. Powell, 446 S.E.2d 26 (N.C. 1994) (affirming a\r\nconviction for involuntary manslaughter where the jury found the defendant guilty\r\nbased on the defendant's culpable negligence in leaving his dogs, two Rottweilers,\r\nunattended and unrestrained, and the dogs mauled the victim).\r\n\r\n                               IV. CONCLUSION\r\n      We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the pre-\r\nautopsy photos. Consequently, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n      REVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      TOAL, C.J., concurs. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a separate\r\nopinion in which HEARN, J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I concur in result. In my judgment, the admission of\r\nthe autopsy photographs was clear error. The primary, if not sole, purpose of these\r\nhorrific photographs was to inflame the passions of the jury. The detailed and\r\ngraphic testimony of the pathologist was more than sufficient to enable the State to\r\nestablish the elements of the offense. I agree with Justice Pleicones that these\r\nchallenged photographs far exceed \"the outer limits of what our law permits a jury\r\nto consider.\" State v. Torres, 390 S.C. 618, 624, 703 S.E.2d 226, 229 (2010). I\r\nfully understand that there are circumstances where autopsy photographs are\r\nrelevant and that the relevance of the photographs is not substantially outweighed\r\nby the danger of unfair prejudice. See Rules 402, 403, SCRE. But this is not such\r\na case. I nevertheless believe the error was harmless for the reasons set forth in the\r\nmajority opinion. I note this case was tried in 2009, prior to our decision in Torres,\r\nwhere we expressed our concern over the State's seeming practice of seeking\r\nadmission of highly prejudicial and inflammatory autopsy photographs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the well-\r\nreasoned opinion of the court of appeals. I agree with the court of appeals that any\r\nminimal probative value of the admitted photographs was substantially outweighed\r\nby the danger of unfair prejudice and that their admission violated Rule 403,\r\nSCRE. In my opinion, the prejudice to Collins from the admission of these\r\nphotographs requires reversal.\r\n\r\nThis Court recently addressed to the bench and bar our concern over the admission\r\nof gruesome photographs in State v. Torres, 390 S.C. 618, 703 S.E.2d 226 (2010),\r\nwhere we observed:\r\n\r\n      Although we affirm the admission of the photographs, we take this\r\n      opportunity to address an area of growing concern to this Court. The\r\n      photographs at issue in this case, while admissible, are at the outer\r\n      limits of what our law permits a jury to consider. Moreover, the State\r\n      also sought to introduce evidence in the form of an autopsy dissection\r\n      photo at trial, which the trial judge wisely excluded. Today, we\r\n      strongly encourage all solicitors to refrain from pushing the envelope\r\n      on admissibility in order to gain a victory which, in all likelihood, was\r\n      already assured because of other substantial evidence in the case.\r\n\r\n      Id. at 624, 703 S.E.2d at 229.5\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, the majority has today approved the admission of evidence that\r\nfar exceeds \". . . the outer limits of what our law permits a jury to consider.\" Id. In\r\nmy opinion, the only way we can educate the bench and bar as to that which is and\r\nis not beyond the pale is to publish these horrific photographs with our opinion.\r\n\r\nI would affirm the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Photographs 31 to 35 at issue here are at least as disturbing as the autopsy\r\ndissection photo in Torres.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27393","title":"State v.

State v. Sawyer, 2011-UP-263\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed June 7, 2011). We affirm, holding that a videotape from the\r\nbreath test site that lacks the audio portion of the reading of Miranda rights and the\r\ninformed consent law did not satisfy the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(2) (2006).1                    FACTS\r\n\r\nIn September 2007, respondent was taken to the Spartanburg County Jail by\r\nDeputy Evett, who picked him up following a traffic stop made by Lt. Woodward.\r\nEvett, a certified Data Master operator, placed respondent in the \"subject test area\"\r\nwhich is a room that adjoins the Data Master room. The rooms are separated by a\r\nglass panel. The deputy retrieved some forms from the Data Master room and\r\nthen appeared to read respondent his Miranda rights and the implied consent\r\ninformation. Both respondent and Deputy Evett signed the forms. There are\r\nseparate audio and video recording devices in both the subject test area and in the\r\nbreathalyzer room. In this case, the audio device in the subject test area did not\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nRespondent moved to suppress the evidence relating to the breath test site alleging\r\nthe videotape did not meet the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A).\r\nSection (A) required that a person charged with DUI have his conduct at both the\r\nincident site and the breath test site videotaped. Subsection (A)(2) provided:\r\n\r\n             The videotaping at the breath site:\r\n\r\n                    (a) must be completed within three hours of the person's\r\n                    arrest for a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or\r\n                    56-5-2945 or a probable cause determination that the\r\n                    person violated Section 56-5-2945, unless compliance is\r\n                    not possible because the person needs emergency\r\n                    medical treatment considered necessary by licensed\r\n                    medical personnel;\r\n\r\n Subsection A of this statute was rewritten by 2008 Act No. 201, § 11, effective\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 10, 2009 or when new equipment is installed. Essentially, the statute no\r\nlonger requires the test to be conducted within 3 hours, and eliminates the\r\nrequirement that the video include the reading of Miranda rights at the breath test\r\nsite.\r\n\n                    (b) must include the reading of Miranda rights, the entire\r\n                    breath test procedure, the person being informed that he\r\n                    is being videotaped, and that he has the right to refuse the\r\n                    test;\r\n\r\n                    (c) must include the person taking or refusing the breath\r\n                    test and the actions of the breath test operator while\r\n                    conducting the test;\r\n\r\n                    (d) must also include the person's conduct during the\r\n                    required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period, unless\r\n                    the officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was\r\n                    physically impossible to videotape this waiting period.\r\n                    However, if the arresting officer administers the breath\r\n                    test, the person's conduct during the twenty-minute pre-\r\n                    test waiting period must be videotaped.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court first held that the videotape itself must be excluded because \"the\r\nvideotape has no audio of the conversations between the testing officer and\r\n[respondent] concerning such matters as his Miranda warnings, the explanation of\r\nimplied consent or other matters that may have been discussed between them.\"\r\nThe judge held that evidence other than the videotape could be used, citing § 56-5-\r\n2953(B).\r\n\r\nOn respondent's motion for reconsideration, the circuit court clarified that it was\r\nsuppressing not only the videotape, but also any evidence or testimony that\r\nrespondent was offered and/or took a breath test, as well as the results of that test.\r\nThe court noted the State had supplied an \"exigency\" affidavit, seeking to invoke\r\nthe provisions of § 56-5-2953(B) that provides \"Failure by the arresting officer to\r\nproduce the videotapes required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal\r\nof any charge . . . if the arresting officer submits a . . . sworn affidavit that it was\r\nphysically impossible to produce the videotape because . . . exigent circumstances\r\nexisted.\" (emphasis supplied). The judge held \"an exigency\" required an\r\nemergency situation, or one requiring immediate attention or remedy, and found\r\nthat since the State did not even know of the audio malfunction for several months\r\nafter respondent's test, there was no exigent circumstance here. The court also\r\nnoted the affidavit was not prepared by the arresting officer, Lt. Woodward, as\r\nrequired by the statute, but rather by Deputy Evett, the breath test administrator.\r\n\nIn the direct appeal, the State argued first that since a videotape was produced, no\r\nconsideration of Deputy Evett's \"exigency\" affidavit was necessary.2 The State\r\nalso argued that any defects in the audio portion of the tape went to its weight, not\r\nits admissibility, and that all the statute required was a video, which it produced.\r\nAlternatively, the State argued the trial judge should not have relied on the\r\n\"exigency\" exception, but that instead he should have admitted the evidence based\r\nupon a different part of § 56-5-2953(B), which permits the court to consider \"other\r\nvalid reasons\" for the lack of a videotape based upon the \"totality of the\r\ncircumstances.\" This \"totality of the circumstances\" argument was not preserved\r\nfor appeal as it was not ruled upon in either the circuit court's original order or in\r\nits amended order. E.g. State v. Kromah, 401 S.C. 340, 737 S.E.2d 490 (2013) fn.\r\n3.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the trial court's suppression of\r\nall evidence obtained at the breath test site, the State sought a writ of certiorari. In\r\nits petition, the State made two arguments:\r\n\r\n             I. \tThe Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's\r\n                 suppression of the video recording of the breath test site,\r\n                 testimony or evidence that a breath test was offered or\r\n                 administered, and the results of Respondent's breath test.\r\n\r\n             II. The Court of Appeals erred in refusing to reverse the trial\r\n                court's decision based on the totality of the circumstances\r\n                pursuant to Section 56-5-2953(B) of the South Carolina\r\n                Code.\r\n\r\nState's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals (filed November 18,\r\n2011) (C-TRACK Appellate Case No. 2011-201206).\r\n\r\n On January 9, 2013, the Court granted certiorari on the first question but denied\r\ncertiorari on the second. S. Ct. Order dated January 9, 2013 (C-TRACK Appellate\r\nCase No. 2011-201206).3\r\n\r\n\r\n  We note that, assuming it was error to consider this affidavit, the State was the\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nparty that introduced it. It is well-settled that a party cannot complain of an error it\r\ninduced. E.g. State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984).\r\n  While the dissent would find the scope of the circuit court's suppression order too\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nbroad, there is no challenge to the breadth of that order on certiorari.\r\n\n                                        ISSUE\r\n\r\n             Did a breath test site video that did not include audio\r\n             demonstrating that Miranda warnings were given, that the\r\n             individual was informed that he was being videotaped, or that\r\n             he has the right to refuse the breath test meet the requirements\r\n             of § 56-5-2953(A) as it existed in September 2007?\r\n\r\n                                     ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State argues that the statute only required that the individual's \"conduct\" be\r\nrecorded, and that conduct under the statute has been defined by the Court of\r\nAppeals as \"one's behavior, action or demeanor.\" Murphy v. State, 392 S.C. 626,\r\n709 S.E.2d 685 (Ct. App. 2011). Thus, the State contends that only video of the\r\nindividual is necessary to satisfy the statute. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Murphy, the incident site video did not capture a full length image of the\r\nindividual as she attempted field sobriety tests. Murphy held that the video\r\nadequately reflected the individual's behavior. Here, however, we are concerned\r\nnot with the defendant's conduct but with the content of the statutorily required\r\nwarnings. At the breath test site, the videotape must record the individual's\r\nconduct during the twenty-minute waiting period [§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d)] and the\r\naction of the breathalyzer operator conducting the test [§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c)].\r\nSilent tape of this conduct would be acceptable under Murphy. However, the\r\nstatute required a videotape not merely of the individual's conduct while being read\r\nhis Miranda and informed consent rights, but also that it \"must include\" \"the\r\nreading of Miranda rights\" and \"the person being informed that he is being\r\nvideotaped, and that he has the right to refuse the test.\" § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(b). A\r\nsilent video simply cannot meet these statutory requirements.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Contrary to the dissent's contention that the video shows respondent being read\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nhis Miranda warnings, being told the matter was videotaped, and being informed\r\nof his right to refuse, all that the video shows is the officer's lips moving. As for\r\nrespondent's failure to challenge the contents of the officer's warnings, at this\r\njuncture the sole issue before the circuit court was whether the silent video\r\ncomplied with the statute. Further, respondent has not conceded the adequacy of\r\nthe officer's statements, as reflected in his briefs which refer to the \"alleged\r\nwarnings.\" Finally, \"bad faith\" and \"bad motive\" are irrelevant here.\r\n\nThe State argues that this defect in the videotape goes only to its weight, not its\r\nadmissibility. Here we are concerned with a statute which governs the\r\nadmissibility of certain evidence. Compare e.g. S.C. Code Ann. § 19-1-180 (Supp.\r\n2012) (certain hearsay statements made by children admissible in family court if\r\nstatute's terms complied with). In § 56-5-2953(B), the General Assembly\r\nspecified:  Nothing in this section may be construed as prohibiting the\r\n            introduction of other evidence in the trial of a [DUI charge].\r\n            Failure by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes\r\n            required by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal of\r\n            [charges] if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit\r\n            certifying that the videotape equipment at the time of the . . .\r\n            breath test device [sic] was in an inoperable condition, stating\r\n            reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the equipment . .\r\n            . and certifying there was no other operable breath test facility\r\n            available in the county or, in the alternative, submits a sworn\r\n            affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to produce\r\n            the videotape because the person needed emergency medical\r\n            treatment, or exigent circumstances existed . . . .\r\n            Nothing in this section prohibits the court from considering any\r\n            other valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based\r\n            upon the totality of the circumstances . . . .\r\n\r\n            Section 56-5-2953(B) (2006).\r\n\r\nWhile defects in evidence do not generally affect admissibility, as the State\r\nmaintains, the Court has interpreted the statute to require strict compliance with\r\nSection (A) as a prerequisite for admissibility, unless an exception in Section (B)\r\napplies. City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007); see\r\nalso State v. Elwell, 403 S.C. 606, 743 S.E.2d 802 (2013). The General Assembly\r\nis presumed to be aware of this Court's interpretation of a statute, and where that\r\nstatute has been amended, but no change has been made that affects the Court's\r\ninterpretation, the legislature's inaction is evidence that our interpretation is\r\ncorrect. E.g. McLeod v. Starnes, 396 S.C. 647, 723 S.E.2d 198 (2012). While the\r\nGeneral Assembly has amended § 56-5-2953 following our Suchenski decision,\r\n\nnothing in the amended statute alters our holding that failure to comply with the\r\nstatute's terms renders the evidence inadmissible.5\r\n\r\nAs explained above, we declined certiorari to consider whether the circuit court\r\nmight have admitted the flawed tape under § 56-5-2953(B)'s \"totality of the\r\ncircumstances\" exception, and we have determined this tape did not satisfy § 56-5-\r\n2953(A). The Court of Appeals properly affirmed the circuit court's suppression\r\norder. City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, supra.6\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN and BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate\r\nopinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The dissent maintains that a prejudice analysis is appropriate whenever evidence\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nis obtained without full compliance with statutory requirements, citing State v.\r\nOdom, 382 S.C. 144, 676 S.E.2d 124 (2009) (actually involving violation of\r\nexecutive agreements); State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 562 S.E.2d 472 (2002); State\r\nv. Chandler, 267 S.C. 138, 226 S.E.2d 533 (1976); State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541,\r\n216 S.E.2d 501 (1975). As we have explained, these decisions are inapposite\r\nsince, unlike 56-5-2953, they involve statutes where the General Assembly did not\r\nspecify the remedy for the State's failure to comply. Suchenski, supra.\r\n  The only arguable error of law was the circuit court's failure to dismiss the\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges once it determined that the State did not produce a videotape meeting the\r\nrequirements of (A) and that it did not meet any of the exceptions in (B).\r\nSuchenski, supra; Elwell, supra. Respondent, however, did not appeal the circuit\r\ncourt's denial of his request that the charges be dismissed.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent. I would hold that the circuit\r\ncourt committed an error of law in suppressing the evidence at issue in this case.\r\n\r\n        Assuming, without deciding, that the video recording of Respondent's breath\r\ntest site did not comply with section 56-5-2953,7 I would apply a harmless error\r\nanalysis in determining whether the video recording and breath test evidence\r\nshould have been suppressed. This Court has recognized that the \"exclusion of\r\nevidence should be limited to violations of constitutional rights and not to statutory\r\nviolations, at least where the appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice at trial\r\nresulting from the failure to follow statutory procedures.\" State v. Chandler, 267\r\nS.C. 138, 143, 226 S.E.2d 553, 555 (1976) (emphasis added) (citing State v. Sachs,\r\n264 S.C. 541, 566 n.11, 216 S.E.2d 501, 514 n.11 (1975)). In State v. Huntley, 349\r\nS.C. 1, 5, 562 S.E.2d 472, 474 (2002), the circuit court suppressed a defendant's\r\nbreathalyzer results where the simulator test solution did not contain the proper\r\nalcohol concentration required by an Act.8 Despite non-compliance with the Act,\r\nthis Court held that the circuit court improperly excluded the breathalyzer test\r\nresults because the defendant was not prejudiced by the violation, as the\r\nbreathalyzer machine itself was operating properly. Id. at 6, 562 S.E.2d at 474.\r\nTherefore, the Court determined that evidence of non-compliance with the Act\r\nwent to the weight, not the admissibility of the defendant's breathalyzer results. Id.\r\n\r\nRelying on these cases, I would hold that the circuit court committed an error of\r\nlaw in failing to engage in a prejudice analysis upon finding that the video\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 The State argues that the video recording satisfied section 56-5-2953 because the\r\nvideo recording captured all conduct and events required by the statute. In\r\naddition, the police officer who administered the breath test submitted an affidavit\r\nto the circuit court indicating that exigent circumstances existed under 56-5-\r\n2953(B) because the audio failure was unknown and out of the officer's control at\r\nthe time of the test.\r\n8 The Act amended South Carolina Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(a) to require a\r\nsimulator test be performed before a breath test is administered to ensure the\r\nreliability of the breathalyzer machine results. Act No. 434, 1998 S.C. Acts\r\n3220–23.\r\n\nrecording failed to satisfy the requirements of section 56-5-2953.9\r\n\r\n    Contrary to the majority's assertion, the General Assembly did not specify a\r\nremedy in section 56-5-2953 for failure to comply with the statutory requirements.\r\nSubsection (B) merely provides that noncompliance with the statute \"is not alone a\r\nground for dismissal\" if the video recording qualifies under an exception in\r\nsubsection (B). S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(B); see also Suchenski, 374 S.C. at\r\n16, 646 S.E.2d at 881 (finding that failure to produce a video recording in\r\ncompliance with 56-5-2953 may be a ground for dismissal if no exceptions apply).\r\nRegardless, in my opinion, a statute's failure to specify a remedy for\r\nnoncompliance does not preclude a prejudice analysis, as the majority implies. C.f.\r\nState v. Landon, 370 S.C. 103, 108–09, 634 S.E.2d 660, 663 (finding a prejudice\r\nanalysis appropriate for an alleged violation of a recordkeeping statute which does\r\nnot specify a remedy for noncompliance).\r\n\r\n       In my view, Respondent was not prejudiced by the video recording's lack of\r\naudio. Aside from its lack of audio, the video recording complies with the\r\nstatutory requirements of 56-5-2953 by including the reading of Respondent's\r\nMiranda10 warnings, the officer informing Respondent of the video recording and\r\nhis right to refuse the breath test, and the breath test procedure itself. This Court\r\nhas stated that \"the purpose of section 56-5-2953 . . . is to create direct evidence of\r\na DUI arrest.\" Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 347, 713 S.E.2d\r\n278, 285 (2011). Despite the malfunctioning of the audio, the video recording\r\nnevertheless creates evidence of Respondent's breath test. Significantly,\r\nRespondent has challenged neither the validity of the Miranda warnings he was\r\ngiven nor any other aspect of the breath test procedure. Respondent has not\r\nasserted that bad faith or a bad motive existed on the part of any actor involved in\r\nthe video recording audio failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n9The mention of prejudice in City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 16, 646\r\nS.E.2d 879, 881 (2007) has no impact on the present case. In Suchenski, the Court\r\nfound that a violation of 56-5-2953, even without a showing of prejudice to the\r\ndefendant, may result in dismissal of the charges. Id. As the majority points out,\r\nin this case, Respondent did not appeal the circuit court's denial of his motion to\r\ndismiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n10   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\n       Therefore, I would hold that Respondent was not prejudiced by the omission\r\nof audio in the video recording and, consequently, the circuit court erred in\r\nsuppressing the evidence. Absent a violation of Respondent's constitutional\r\nrights—which are not in dispute here—the circuit court should not have excluded\r\nthe video recording or the evidence surrounding Respondent's breath test without a\r\nshowing that (1) the video did not comply with section 56-5-2953 and (2)\r\nRespondent was prejudiced as a result of the video's non-compliance. See\r\nHuntley, 349 S.C. at 6, 562 S.E.2d at 474; Chandler 267 S.C.at 143, 226 S.E.2d at\r\n555.   In my view, nothing in section 56-5-2953 mandates suppression of a\r\ndefective video recording, nor has this Court ever interpreted the statute as\r\nrequiring strict compliance for admission of a video recording, as the majority\r\nasserts. Defects in evidence generally do not affect admissibility. See State v.\r\nOdom, 382 S.C. 144, 152, 676 S.E.2d 124, 128 (2009) (citing Huntley, 349 S.C. at\r\n6, 562 S.E.2d at 474). As indicated, supra, in the prejudice analysis, \"exclusion is\r\ntypically reserved for constitutional violations.\" Id. (citing Huntley, 349 S.C. at 6,\r\n562 S.E.2d at 474); Chandler, 267 S.C. at 143, 226 S.E.2d at 555. Thus, I would\r\nfind that the defect in the video recording goes to the weight, rather than the\r\nadmissibility, of the evidence. See Odom, 382 S.C. at 152, 676 S.E.2d at 128.\r\n\r\n       Likewise, I disagree with the majority's interpretation of Suchenski.\r\nSpecifically, the majority believes Suchenski stands for the proposition that strict\r\ncompliance with section 56-5-2953 is a prerequisite for admissibility of evidence.\r\nSuchenski merely holds that dismissal of a DUI charge is \"an appropriate remedy\r\nprovided by [section] 56-5-2953 where a violation of subsection (A) is not\r\nmitigated by subsection (B) exceptions.\" Suchenski, 374 S.C. at 17, 646 S.E.2d at\r\n881 (emphasis added). In fact, the case makes no mention of suppression of\r\nevidence, addressing only dismissal of DUI charges as a possible remedy for non-\r\ncompliance with the statute. Id. Because dismissal of Respondent's DUI charges\r\nis not before us, this Court may only review the circuit court's suppression order.\r\nAs a result, the majority's reliance on Suchenski is misplaced.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, the majority provides no support for upholding the circuit\r\ncourt's suppression of Respondent's breath test results along with all evidence or\r\ntestimony related to the breath test.11 Even if the failure to comply with the statute\r\n11I disagree with the majority's contention that there is no challenge to the breadth\r\nof the circuit court's suppression order on certiorari. While the State's petition does\r\nnot use that language, the State argued that the court of appeals erred in affirming\r\nthe circuit court's suppression of the video recording, the testimony or evidence\r\n\ndid, in fact, require suppression of the defective video recording, and assuming the\r\ncircuit court declined to dismiss the DUI charges, I cannot conceive of a basis,\r\nstatutory or otherwise, for excluding the breath test results and the related\r\ntestimony and evidence. To the contrary, section 56-5-2953 provides that\r\n\"[n]othing in this section may be construed as prohibiting the introduction of other\r\nrelevant evidence\" in the trial for a DUI. S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(B).\r\n\r\n      Therefore, because I would hold that the circuit court erred in failing to\r\nconduct a prejudice analysis and Respondent demonstrated no prejudice resulting\r\nfrom admission of the evidence, and because at the very least the circuit court erred\r\nin suppressing the evidence surrounding the breath test, I would reverse the court\r\nof appeals' decision upholding the circuit court's suppression order and remand for\r\na new trial.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat a breath test was offered or administered, and the results of the breath test. In\r\nmy opinion, if the State contended the circuit court erred in excluding the video\r\nrecording only, the State's argument would have only mentioned the video\r\nrecording.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27440","title":"Whigham v.

The single commissioner denied the claim\r\nbecause she found the injury did not arise out of or in the course of his\r\n\nemployment, and that decision was affirmed by the full commission and the court\r\nof appeals. We reverse and remand, holding that under the facts of this case,\r\nWhigham is entitled to workers' compensation because he was impliedly required\r\nto attend the kickball game he organized, and therefore, his injury arose out of and\r\nin the course of his employment.\r\n\r\n                    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       Whigham was employed as the Director of Creative Solutions at Jackson\r\nDawson, a marketing, advertising, and public relations company. As part of his\r\nemployment, Whigham attended bi-monthly meetings wherein the managers\r\ndiscussed, among other things, the importance of team-building events. In\r\naccordance with the company's desire to cultivate an enjoyable work atmosphere,\r\nWhigham conceived the idea of having a company kickball game. He proposed\r\nthe idea to his superior, Kevin Johnson, who instructed him to move forward with\r\nit. Whigham proceeded to contact a rental facility and designed T-shirts for the\r\nevent. Johnson authorized Whigham to spend $440 of company funds for the\r\nrental, the T-shirts, drinks, and snacks.\r\n\r\n       Once the event was organized, Whigham used the company intranet to\r\npromote it and encourage attendance. The game took place on a Friday afternoon\r\nat 3:00 with roughly half of Jackson Dawson's employees in attendance. Whigham\r\nwas injured on the last play when he jumped to avoid being thrown out by the\r\nopposing team. He landed awkwardly on his right leg, shattering his tibia and\r\nfibula. He was taken away in an ambulance and eventually underwent two\r\nsurgeries. His doctor later informed him he would need a knee replacement in the\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\n      The single commissioner denied compensability on the grounds that the\r\ninjury did not arise out of or in the course of Whigham's employment.\r\nSpecifically, she found he was neither required to attend the event, nor was there\r\nany benefit beyond general employee morale to the company. The full\r\ncommission affirmed, essentially adopting the single commissioner's order. The\r\ncourt of appeals affirmed in a memorandum opinion, citing cases involving the\r\nsubstantial evidence standard. Whigham v. Jackson Dawson Commc'ns, Op. No.\r\n2012-UP-223 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 11, 2012). This Court granted certiorari to\r\nreview the opinion of the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n                              ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\n      Did the court of appeals err in affirming the denial of workers' compensation\r\nbecause the injury did not arise out of and in the course of Whigham's\r\nemployment?                STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, this Court can reverse or\r\nmodify a decision of the full commission only if the claimant's substantial rights\r\nhave been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is not\r\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record. Hutson v. S.C. State Ports Auth.,\r\n399 S.C. 381, 387, 732 S.E.2d 500, 502–03 (2012). \"Substantial evidence is not a\r\nmere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence,\r\nwhen the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\nconclusion the Full Commission reached.\" Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448,\r\n455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       In determining whether a work-related injury is compensable, the Workers'\r\nCompensation Act is liberally construed toward providing coverage and any\r\nreasonable doubt as to the construction of the Act will be resolved in favor of\r\ncoverage. Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455–56, 535 S.E.2d at 442. Pursuant to Section 42–\r\n1–160(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013), for an injury to be\r\ncompensable under the Act, it must \"aris[e] out of and in the course of\r\nemployment.\" An injury arises out of employment when there is apparent to the\r\nrational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal relationship\r\nbetween the conditions under which the work is to be performed and the resulting\r\ninjury. Crisp v. SouthCo., Inc., 401 S.C. 627, 641, 738 S.E.2d 835, 842 (2013). In\r\ngeneral, whether an accident arises out of and is in the course and scope of\r\nemployment is a question of fact for the full commission. Pratt v. Morris Roofing,\r\nInc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004). However, \"[w]here there are\r\nno disputed facts, the question of whether an accident is compensable is a question\r\nof law.\" Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 872 (2007).\r\n\r\n      In finding a recreational or social activity is within the course of\r\nemployment, this Court considers whether the activity falls within one of the\r\nfollowing factors established by Professor Arthur Larson:\r\n\r\n      (1) [It occurs] on the premises during a lunch or recreation period as a\r\n\n      regular incident of the employment; or\r\n\r\n      (2) The employer, by expressly or impliedly requiring participation, or\r\n      by making the activity part of the services of an employee, brings the\r\n      activity within the orbit of the employment; or\r\n\r\n      (3) The employer derives substantial direct benefit from the activity\r\n      beyond the intangible value of improvement in employee health and\r\n      morale that is common to all kinds of recreation and social life.\r\n\r\nLeopard v. Blackman-Uhler, 318 S.C. 369, 370–71, 458 S.E.2d 41, 41 (1995)\r\n(citing 1A Arthur Larson & Lex K. Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation\r\n§ 22.00 (1994) (currently at 2 Arthur Larson & Lex K. Larson, Larson's Workers'\r\nCompensation Law § 22.01 (2013))).\r\n\r\n       Whigham contends the court of appeals erred in finding that his injury was\r\nnoncompensable because it did not arise out of and in the course of his\r\nemployment. Whigham argues his injury is compensable under both the second\r\nand third provisions of Larson's guidelines. We agree that Whigham was impliedly\r\nrequired to attend the kickball game he organized and that it became part of his\r\nservices; therefore, the event was brought within the scope of his employment.\r\nAlthough the event may have been voluntary for company employees generally,\r\nthe undisputed facts unequivocally indicate Whigham was expected to attend as\r\npart of his professional duties. Accordingly, we hold Whigham's injury arose out\r\nof his employment as a matter of law.1\r\n\r\n       The law is clear that when determining whether an employee is required to\r\nattend an event a directive is not necessary \"if the employee is made to understand\r\nthat he is to take part in the affair.\" Larson, supra § 22.04[2]. Here, both\r\nWhigham and his superior plainly considered his presence vital to his job of\r\nexecuting the event. When asked whether Whigham felt the event was voluntary\r\nfor him, he responded: \"I think it would have been a reflection of poor management\r\nif I decided not to show up.\" He further stated that \"[o]n that particular day\" he\r\n1  Because we find Whigham's injury arose out of and in the course of his\r\nemployment as he was impliedly required to attend the game, we do not reach the\r\nquestion of whether the company derives a substantial direct benefit from the\r\nactivity. Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\nS.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining\r\nissues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nconsidered attending the event to be part of his job.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, during his testimony, Johnson was asked whether he would\r\nhave been upset if Whigham did not attended the game, and he responded that he\r\n\"would have been surprised and shocked, because [Whigham] spent all the time\r\nplanning the thing.\" When asked if he would have considered it irresponsible of\r\nWhigham not to show up, Johnson could barely entertain the suggestion, stating: \"I\r\ndon't know. I would have thought—he wouldn't do that. I'll just say that. He\r\nwouldn't do that. . . . It would have been just unexpected, unbelievable. I mean,\r\nyou don't just plan something and then not show up for it.\"\r\n\r\n       We find both Johnson's and Whigham's testimony establish that Whigham's\r\nparticipation was expected rather than voluntary. This fact sets Whigham's\r\nparticipation apart from that of all the other employees. It is undisputed that\r\nWhigham felt compelled to go and his boss would have considered it a dereliction\r\nof duty to miss it. The only fair reading of Johnson's testimony is that he knew he\r\ndid not have to expressly direct Whigham to attend the game because Whigham\r\nwould already feel an obligation to be there.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, although the respondents place much emphasis on the fact that\r\nthis event was Whigham's idea, it is apparent that the company fully embraced the\r\nundertaking so as to make it part of his employment. Johnson testified these team-\r\nbuilding events are considered desirable to the company as occasions to \"promote\r\nfun within the business\" and \"break the stress.\" Jackson Dawson, as a brand\r\nbuilder itself, strived to be a \"non-typical employer\" by being a \"fun place to\r\nwork.\" A fun atmosphere is seen as a means to \"retain good employees and keep\r\npeople happy,\" which would produce better performing employees. When\r\nWhigham brought up the idea of the kickball game to Johnson, his response was\r\n\"that is a crazy idea, but let's talk more about it.\" Johnson authorized Whigham to\r\nspend company funds on renting the facilities as well as purchasing snacks and T-\r\nshirts for the game. Johnson also was aware and supportive of the fact that\r\nWhigham used the company intranet to \"start the hype machine\" to promote the\r\nevent and encouraged employees to attend even though it occurred during typical\r\nbusiness hours. Moreover, Whigham's professional performance evaluations\r\nclearly reflect the kickball game was considered something important that he\r\nbrought to the company. Whigham indicated on his self-evaluation that a cookout\r\nand the kickball game he planned \"both had a very positive lifts to the working\r\nculture at Jackson Dawson.\" Johnson's evaluation of Whigham stated that\r\nWhigham was a \"team player\" and specifically noted he \"has been instrumental in\r\n\nbringing back a couple of fun events, a cookout and dare I say it, kickball.\"\r\n\r\n        Although it may not have been within Whigham's job description to produce\r\nany team-building events, it does not appear it was anyone's job to do so, but\r\ninstead reflected the company's desire to place emphasis on developing a certain\r\ntype of work atmosphere. A specific act need not be designated in an employee's\r\njob description to be compensable. Grant, 372 S.C. at 201, 641 S.E.2d at 871–72\r\n(\"An act outside an employee's regular duties which is undertaken in good faith to\r\nadvance the employer's interest, whether or not the employee's own assigned work\r\nis thereby furthered, is within the course of employment.\"). Whigham exercised\r\ninitiative in responding to a need expressed by Jackson Dawson, and the company\r\nencouraged him in carrying out his plan. Organizing and attending the game\r\nthereby became part of his employment.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we hold that under the facts of this case, Whigham is entitled\r\nto compensation as a matter of law. While we are mindful of our deferential\r\nstandard of review, we find the undisputed facts indicate Whigham's injury arose\r\nout of and in the course of his employment. We therefore reverse the opinion of\r\nthe court of appeals and remand for a hearing on disability and other benefits.\r\n\r\n    TOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES,\r\nJ., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I respectfully dissent. While one view of the evidence\r\nsupports the majority's finding that Petitioner (Whigham) was \"impliedly required\r\nto attend the kickball game[,]\" there is other evidence that supports the decision of\r\nthe Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission). Take for example the\r\nfollowing testimony from Whigham:\r\n\r\n      Q: Let me make sure we're clear on this. There was no requirement to\r\n                                               \t\r\n         be there?\r\n\r\n      A: There was actually—if you were not there, you were expected to\r\n         be in the office working.\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      Q: Okay. \tWas there any pressure on you or anybody that you know\r\n         of that you'd better be playing kickball that day?\r\n\r\n      A: No, there was not. \t here was never an ultimatum given to \n\r\n                            T\r\n         anybody.\n\r\n\r\n      Q: I mean, I've had friends who just don't like sports, and if we set up\r\n         an event or have an event like that, they would choose not to go. I\r\n         mean, if you just chose to go play kickball, you didn't have to play,\r\n         correct?\r\n\r\n      A: No; that’s right.\r\n\r\n      Q: It was totally voluntary?\r\n\r\n      A: Either that or working.\r\n\r\n      Q: Okay. But you would agree it was voluntary to go play kickball.\r\n\r\n      A: Yes. It was not—it was not mandatory.\r\n\r\nBecause there is conflicting evidence whether Whigham was required to attend the\r\nkickball game, the substantial evidence standard of review compels us to affirm,\r\njust as the court of appeals did. See Hill v. Eagle Motor Lines, 373 S.C. 422, 436,\r\n645 S.E.2d 424, 431 (2007) (\"Substantial evidence is that evidence which, in\r\n\nconsidering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\nconclusion the Commission reached.\" (citing Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336\r\nS.C. 154, 159–60, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999))); Barton v. Higgs, 381 S.C. 367,\r\n369–70, 674 S.E.2d 145, 146 (2009) (\"When reviewing an appeal from the\r\nworkers' compensation commission, the appellate court may not weigh the\r\nevidence or substitute its judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight\r\nof evidence on questions of fact.\" (citing Therrell v. Jerry's Inc., 370 S.C. 22, 26,\r\n633 S.E.2d 893, 894–95 (2006))).\r\n\r\nI add two further comments. First, even were I to accept the majority's version of\r\nthe facts, Whigham's claim for benefits would fail in any event. The majority\r\nconflates attending the event with participation in the kickball game. More to the\r\npoint, it was Whigham's supervisory role in organizing the event that the majority\r\npoints to in finding he was \"impliedly required to attend the kickball game.\"\r\n(emphasis added). Attending the event and participating in the kickball game are\r\nentirely different things.\r\n\r\nThis leads to my second comment. I am concerned with an analytical framework\r\nin the workers' compensation recreational or social activity arena that favors\r\nsupervisors over other employees. The majority notes that its \"within the scope of\r\nemployment\" finding is limited to Whigham because he organized the event.\r\nIndeed, the majority observes that other employees would likely not be covered,\r\nfor \"the event may have been voluntary for company employees generally[,]\" and\r\nWhigham's organizational role \"sets Whigham's participation apart from that of all\r\nother employees.\" In terms of participation in the kickball game, I can find no\r\nbasis for favoring Whigham over all other employees.\r\n\r\nI would affirm the court of appeals.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
