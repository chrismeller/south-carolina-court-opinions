The Court granted the petition. We find that DHEC’s action contravened\r\nthe plain language of S.C. Code Ann. § 54-6-10 (2007).\r\n\r\n                                      FACTS\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, initiated the Savannah\r\nHarbor Expansion Project in order to dredge and deepen the navigation channel in\r\nthe Savannah River to facilitate its use by ocean-going vessels traveling to and\r\nfrom the Port of Savannah. Under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act, the\r\nCorps was required to seek certification from the appropriate South Carolina\r\nauthority that the SHEP complied with state water quality standards.\r\n\r\nThe Corps applied to DHEC for the 401 Certification and a Construction in\r\nNavigable Waters permit (the Permit) on November 15, 2010, as well as for a\r\nCoastal Zone Management Act consistency determination. The Savannah River\r\nMaritime Commission, an entity created by S.C. Code Ann. § 54-6-10 (2007),\r\nsubmitted comments to DHEC opposing approval of the Corps’s application for\r\nthe Certification, Permit, and consistency determination. On September 30, 2011,\r\nDHEC issued a notice of decision proposing to deny the Certification because a\r\nstaff assessment had determined that the SHEP did not meet South Carolina’s\r\nwater quality standards. The notice of decision appended the staff assessment.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, DHEC staff, the Corps, and GPA negotiated and entered into an\r\nagreement (the Agreement) addressing the grounds for denial identified by DHEC\r\nstaff as detailed in the assessment. On November 15, 2011, the DHEC Board\r\nissued the § 401 Certification, adopting the Agreement as part of the Certification.\r\n\nThe § 401 Certification also served as approval of the Permit pursuant to 1 S.C.\r\nCode Ann Regs. 19-450.3(G) (2011) and 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-101(A)(9)\r\n(Supp. 2011).1 In December 2011, Conservation Groups and the Commission filed\r\nrequests for contested case review with the Administrative Law Court (ALC),\r\nseeking review of the decision on both procedural and substantive grounds. That\r\nmatter is pending in the ALC. In March 2012, Conservation Groups filed a Motion\r\nfor Original Jurisdiction with this Court, asking the Court to rule on the question\r\nwhether DHEC violated § 54-6-10 when it negotiated with and entered into an\r\nagreement with the Corps and GPA in the course of issuing the 401 Certification\r\nand in authorizing the Corps to conduct construction in navigable waters. DHEC\r\nconsented to the request. This Court granted the petition. The Commission sought\r\nto intervene as a Respondent and was permitted to intervene as a Petitioner.\r\n\r\n                                      ISSUE\r\n\r\nDid DHEC’s action in issuing the 401 Certification contravene § 54-6-10?\r\n\r\n                                  DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n                                          I\r\n\r\nPetitioners contend that DHEC contravened § 54-6-10 in two respects: when it\r\nnegotiated and entered into the Agreement with the Corps and GPA that provided\r\nthe basis for its issuance of the 401 Certification and when it effectively granted\r\nthe Permit. We agree.\r\n\r\nSection 54-6-10 establishes the Commission, in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n      (A)[A] commission to be known as the Savannah River Maritime\r\n          Commission is hereby established to represent this State in all\r\n          matters pertaining to the navigability, depth, dredging, wastewater\r\n          and sludge disposal, and related collateral issues in regard to the\r\n\r\n1 When a § 401 Certification is issued, no separate permit for construction in\r\nnavigable waters is required. Instead, the 401 Certification serves as the\r\nconstruction permit. Before DHEC may issue the permit, however, the staff\r\nreviewing the certification application is “required to coordinate with the\r\nConstruction in Navigable Waters Permitting staff to insure” that the regulatory\r\nrequirements for the construction permit are met. 1 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-\r\n450.3(G).\r\n\n          use of the Savannah River as a waterway for ocean-going\r\n          container or commerce vessels. The commission as an\r\n          instrumentality of this State is empowered to negotiate on behalf\r\n          of the State of South Carolina and enter into agreements with the\r\n          State of Georgia, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and\r\n          other involved parties in regard to the above which bind the State\r\n          of South Carolina[.]\r\n\r\n...    (F) Except as provided below, nothing in this section shall supersede\r\n         the authority of other state agencies, departments, or\r\n         instrumentalities including the Department of Natural Resources,\r\n         the Department of Health and Environmental Control, or the State\r\n         Ports Authority to exercise all powers, duties, and functions within\r\n         their responsibilities as provided by law. However, on an interstate\r\n         basis and specifically in regard to the State of Georgia, the\r\n         responsibilities granted to the Savannah River Maritime\r\n         Commission in this joint resolution supersede any other concurrent\r\n         responsibilities of a particular state agency or department. Any\r\n         requirements for permitting and constructing new terminal\r\n         facilities on the Savannah River in Jasper County are declared not\r\n         to be the responsibility of this commission, except as they may\r\n         relate to this state's responsibility for the navigability or depth of\r\n         the South Carolina portion of the Savannah River.\r\n\r\n “The primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the Legislature.” Gilstrap v. South Carolina Budget and Control Bd., 310 S.C.\r\n210, 213 (1992). “Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the court’s place to\r\nchange the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.” Hodges v. Rainey, 341\r\nS.C. 79, 83, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000). “If the statute is ambiguous, however,\r\ncourts must construe the terms of the statute.” Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts,\r\n393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283 (2011). “A statute as a whole must receive\r\npractical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design,\r\nand policy of lawmakers.” Id.\r\n\r\nThe plain language of the statute gives the Commission the authority “to represent\r\nthis State in all matters pertaining to the navigability, depth, dredging, wastewater\r\nand sludge disposal, and related collateral issues in regard to the use of the\r\nSavannah River as a waterway for ocean-going container or commerce vessels.” §\r\n\n54-6-10(A) (emphasis added). The Commission is specifically “empowered to\r\nnegotiate on behalf of the State of South Carolina and enter into agreements with\r\nthe State of Georgia, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and other\r\ninvolved parties.” Id.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Commission is given not only the authority but the “responsibility”\r\nto represent the state, a responsibility that “supersede[s] any other concurrent\r\nresponsibilities of a particular state agency” to represent South Carolina in all\r\nmatters pertaining to dredging of the Savannah River for navigation by ocean-\r\ngoing container and commerce vessels, and in related collateral issues. § 54-6-\r\n10(F). Given this language, we find the conclusion inescapable that the grant of\r\nauthority was exclusive.\r\n\r\nDHEC argues that the term “represent,” interpreted in the context of the purpose of\r\nthe Act, is limited to activities necessary for the development of the Jasper County\r\nterminal facilities, largely relying on the Act’s title.2 However, an inquiry into the\r\n\r\n2   The title the Act reads as follows:\r\n         A JOINT RESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE STATE PORTS AUTHORITY TO\r\n         CONTINUE AND BRING TO ITS EARLIEST CONCLUSION THE\r\n         CONDEMNATION ACTION IT HAS BEGUN INVOLVING\r\n         APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES IN\r\n         JASPER COUNTY NEEDED TO DEVELOP NEW TERMINAL FACILITIES;\r\n         TO PROVIDE THAT THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF JASPER COUNTY\r\n         TO UNDERTAKE ANY CONDEMNATION ACTION REGARDING THIS\r\n         APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES IN\r\n         JASPER COUNTY OR ANY OTHER CONDEMNATION ACTION IN\r\n         REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TERMINAL FACILITIES IN\r\n         JASPER COUNTY IS SUSPENDED FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS\r\n         FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS JOINT RESOLUTION; TO DIRECT\r\n         THE STATE PORTS AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE AND COMPLETE\r\n         CERTAIN OTHER ACTIONS BEGUN BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF\r\n         THIS JOINT RESOLUTION IN REGARD TO THESE NEW TERMINAL\r\n         FACILITIES; TO DIRECT THE STATE PORTS AUTHORITY TO BEGIN\r\n         SPECIFIC NEW UNDERTAKINGS WITHIN A STIPULATED TIME FRAME\r\n         UPON FINAL CONCLUSION INCLUDING ALL APPEALS OF THE ABOVE\r\n         CONDEMNATION ACTION, TO ESTABLISH THE SAVANNAH RIVER\r\n         MARITIME COMMISSION AND PROVIDE FOR ITS MEMBERSHIP,\r\n         FUNCTIONS, DUTIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AND TO ESTABLISH\r\n         THE JASPER COUNTY PORT FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE FUND AND\r\n         FOR THE USE OF MONIES IN THE FUND.\r\n\npurpose of the Act arises only if the plain language is ambiguous. Garner v.\r\nHouck, 312 S.C. 481, 486, 435 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1993) (title of statute “cannot\r\nundo or limit what the text makes plain”). In our view, there is no ambiguity in the\r\ntext of § 54-6-10.\r\n\r\nThe Corps’s proposed dredging of the Savannah River for purposes of navigation\r\nby ocean-going commerce and container vessels clearly implicates the statute’s\r\ngrant of responsibility and exclusive authority. Moreover, it was the impact of\r\nSHEP dredging in the South Carolina portion of the Savannah River that created\r\nthe Corps’s obligation to obtain the 401 Certification. Pursuant to § 54-6-10, the\r\nCommission has exclusive authority to represent the state in all matters pertaining\r\nto navigability and dredging of the Savannah River for use by ocean-going\r\ncontainer and commerce vessels.\r\n\r\nThe plain language of § 54-6-10 gave the Savannah River Maritime Commission\r\nthe responsibility and exclusive authority to represent South Carolina in all matters\r\npertaining or collaterally related to dredging in the Savannah River for purposes of\r\nnavigation by ocean-going container or commerce vessels, and 401 Certification\r\nfor the SHEP fell within the scope of that authority. Thus, we find that DHEC\r\nacted in contravention of § 54-6-10 when it issued the 401 Certification.\r\n\r\n                                         II\r\n\r\nThe majority finds that DHEC “acted” for purposes of the state certification\r\nrequirement of the Clean Water Act. This question is not at issue. Moreover, the\r\nCorps and GPA are not parties to this case. See Spanish Wells Property Ass’n v.\r\nBoard of Adjustment, 295 S.C. 67, 367 S.E.2d 160 (1988) (rule that permittee is\r\nnecessary party in appeal of action challenging issuance of building permit serves\r\njudicial economy by ensuring that permittee will be bound if permit approval is\r\nreversed); S.C. Const. art. I, § 22 (2009) (“No person shall be finally bound by a\r\njudicial or quasi-judicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private\r\nrights except on due notice and an opportunity to be heard; . . . nor shall he be\r\ndeprived of liberty or property unless by a mode of procedure prescribed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and he shall have in all such instances the right to judicial\r\nreview.”); Ross v. Medical University of South Carolina, 328 S.C. 51, 68, 492\r\nS.E.2d 62, 71 (1997) (“We have interpreted [article I, section 22 of the South\r\nCarolina Constitution] as specifically guaranteeing persons the right to notice and\r\nan opportunity to be heard by an administrative agency, even when a contested\r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. 56, 2007 Acts 181 (H.B. 3505).\r\n\ncase under the APA is not involved.”); Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,\r\n408 U.S. 564, 569-70 (1972).\r\n\r\nLikewise, the majority reaches the questions whether DHEC’s final decision was\r\nrendered a nullity and whether the notice of proposed decision became a final\r\nagency decision even though these questions have not been raised to us and a\r\nnecessary party, the permit applicant, is not before us. I would not reach these\r\nquestions without affording the appropriate parties an opportunity to be heard, and\r\nthus do not join that portion of the majority opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion in\r\nwhich BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I write for a majority of this Court in stating we could\r\nnot agree more with Justice Pleicones's conclusion in Part I of his concurring and\r\ndissenting opinion that DHEC acted on the Certification requested for the SHEP.3\r\nHowever, we do not agree with Part II of his opinion. We take the analysis one\r\nstep further and find that because the Board acted in contravention of section 54-6-\r\n10 of the South Carolina Code when it negotiated the Agreement with the Corps\r\nand the GPA before issuing the Certification requested for the SHEP, no deference\r\nis owed the DHEC Board's decision. Because the Board's decision incorporated\r\nthe statutorily prohibited Agreement, we further hold that the staff denial of the\r\nCertification is now the final agency decision for purposes of contested case\r\nreview. Consequently, the Certification is denied, and the contested case hearing\r\npending in the ALC is moot. Moving forward, any activity, including any\r\nsettlement negotiations, concerning the Certification must properly be directed to\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\nWhen undertaking contested case review, the ALC is the ultimate fact finder, and\r\nis not restricted by the findings of the administrative agency. Risher v. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Health and Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 207–08, 712 S.E.2d 428, 433 (2011);\r\nsee also Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560\r\nS.E.2d 410, 413 (2002) (finding the ALC sits de novo in a contested case hearing).\r\n\r\nHowever, as a general rule, \"agencies charged with enforcing statutes . . . receive\r\ndeference from the courts as to their interpretation of those laws.\" State v. Sweat,\r\n379 S.C. 367, 385, 665 S.E.2d 645, 655 (Ct. App. 2008) (citation omitted). Thus,\r\nthe reviewing tribunal will defer to the relevant administrative agency's decision\r\nunless there is a compelling reason to differ. S.C. Coastal Conservation League v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005)\r\n(holding the circuit court should have deferred to the Panel's decision because\r\n\"there was no compelling reason to overrule the Panel's decision that the\r\n[regulation] governed\"). An agency's interpretation of a statute or regulation that is\r\nerroneous or controlled by an error of law presents a compelling reason not to\r\ndefer to the agency's interpretation. See Brown v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440–\r\n3 Under the federal Clean Water Act, any entity commencing a project that will\r\ncreate a discharge into waters of the United States must apply for a state\r\ncertification that the project will comply with that state's water quality standards.\r\n33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1). However, if a state \"fails or refuses to act on a request for\r\ncertification, within a reasonable period of time (which shall not exceed one year)\"\r\nthe state certification requirement is waived. Id. It is undisputed that DHEC\r\n\"acted\" for purposes of the state certification requirement.\r\n\n41, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838–39 (2003) (reversing the circuit court because the\r\nagency's conclusions in the case were affected by an error of law); Sweat, 379 S.C.\r\nat 385, 665 S.E.2d at 655 (finding the State was \"not entitled to any deference in its\r\ninterpretation because the plain language of [the statute at issue] refute[d] the\r\nState's position\" and holding the Court was \"free to read the statute based on its\r\nplain language without deference to the State's position\"). Thus, where the plain\r\nlanguage of the statute is contrary to the agency's interpretation, the agency's\r\ninterpretation should be rejected. Brown, 354 S.C. at 440, 581 S.E.2d at 838. In\r\nthis case, DHEC has not followed the relevant law in issuing its final decision, as\r\nthe Board erroneously believed it had the authority to enter into the Agreement\r\nwith the Corps and the GPA prior to issuing its final decision. Therefore,\r\ncompelling reasons obviate any deference to the Board's decision in this case.\r\nDHEC usurped the Commission's authority in settling with the Corps and the GPA\r\nbefore the final review conference in contravention of the express requirements of\r\nsection 54-6-10. See S.C. Code Ann. § 54-6-10(A) (endowing the Commission\r\nwith the exclusive power \"to negotiate on behalf of the State of South Carolina and\r\nenter into agreements with the State of Georgia, the United States Corps of\r\nEngineers, and other involved parties.\").\r\n\r\nThus, we find the conditional staff denial of the Certification, which the\r\nCommission actively participated in formulating, is now the final agency decision\r\nfor purposes of contested case review. See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-1-60(F) (Supp.\r\n2011) (\"If a final review conference is not conducted within sixty days, the\r\ndepartment decision becomes the final agency decision, and an applicant . . . may\r\nrequest a contested case hearing before the [ALC].\").\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Appellants' request for a contested case hearing currently\r\npending in the ALC is moot, as the relief Appellants ultimately seek is the\r\nconditional denial of the Certification. See Mathis v. S.C. State Highway Dep't,\r\n260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973) (\"A case becomes moot when\r\njudgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing\r\ncontroversy. This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the]\r\nreviewing Court to grant effectual relief.\").\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hold that the Certification is denied, and any future activity,\r\nincluding any negotiations concerning the Certification, must be directed to the\r\nCommission. See S.C. Code Ann. § 54-6-10(A).\r\n\r\nBEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I would dismiss the grant of original jurisdiction as\r\nimprovidently granted. I emphasize that I do not necessarily disagree with the\r\nCourt's holding that the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental\r\nControl (DHEC) violated section 54-6-10 when it issued the 401 Certification. I\r\nbelieve the Court is addressing the isolated legal question prematurely.\r\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent. I submit three reasons for dissenting.\r\n\r\nFirst, this matter involves more issues than simply the section 54-6-10 challenge,\r\nall of which are presently pending in the Administrative Law Court (ALC). The\r\nmany pending issues are inextricably linked, and therefore the dispute should be\r\nheard as a whole and not in piecemeal fashion. By cherry-picking this one issue\r\nfor resolution, the Court directs the final outcome without allowing the matter to be\r\nfully heard.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Court has even foreclosed a full consideration of the section 54-6-10\r\nchallenge. An amicus curiae brief was filed challenging the constitutionality of the\r\nSavannah River Maritime Commission. This brief was rejected by an order of the\r\nCourt. In hindsight, I believe it was error to deviate from our standard practice of\r\naccepting amici briefs. I do not know whether the amicus brief raised a\r\nmeritorious issue. But I do believe we have an obligation to consider an issue fully\r\nbefore making a decision.\r\n\r\nThird, today's result in favor of what Justice Pleicones refers to as Conservation\r\nGroups may have unintended consequences, particularly regarding the 401\r\nCertification. The action of DHEC resulting in the 401 Certification occurred\r\nwithin the one-year time period as required by federal law. Under the law, a state\r\nagency may approve or deny the application for a 401 Certification, but if it fails to\r\n\"act\" on the application within one year, the requirement for 401 Certification is\r\nwaived. What is the effect of declaring DHEC's actions illegal? Further\r\ncomplicating the matter is the effect of the passage of 2012 Act No. 125, which\r\nprovides:    The General Assembly . . . suspends the authority of the South\r\n      Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control . . . for all\r\n      decisions subsequent to 2007 related to all matters pertaining to the\r\n      navigability, depth, dredging, wastewater and sludge disposal, and\r\n      related collateral issues in regard to the use of the Savannah River as a\r\n      waterway for ocean-going container or commerce vessels, in\r\n      particular the approval by the department of the application of the\r\n      United States Army Corps of Engineers for a Construction in\r\n\n      Navigable Waters Permit for the dredging of the South Carolina\r\n      portion of the Savannah River, because the authority of the Savannah\r\n      River Maritime Commission, hereinafter the Maritime Commission,\r\n      superseded the responsibilities of the department for such approval, as\r\n      established by Act 56 of 2007 . . . .\r\n\r\nDoes the legislature's suspension of all DHEC authority in this matter since 2007\r\nimpact the question of whether DHEC's 2011 action (DHEC staff and Board) has\r\nany efficacy in terms of constituting a timely action for 401 Certification purposes?\r\nHas the state of South Carolina, as a result of the Court's decision today, failed to\r\nact in a timely manner? Chief Justice Toal, for the majority of this Court, holds a\r\ntimely action for 401 Certification purposes occurred through the DHEC \"staff\r\ndenial of the Certification.\" Yet the Chief Justice declares that the DHEC Board\r\n\"acted in contravention of section 54-6-10.\" I cannot reconcile these positions, for\r\nI view them as mutually exclusive. I do not understand how the DHEC staff had\r\nlegal authority to act, but the DHEC Board did not.4\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I believe the proper course is to stay our hand and let these many\r\nand interrelated issues be fully litigated before the ALC. Given that all parties\r\ntrumpet the critical importance of this case to our state's environment and\r\neconomy, I am concerned that the Court's decision today may ultimately have the\r\n4 The Chief Justice validates the authority of DHEC staff because the \"Commission\r\nactively participated in formulating\" the staff decision. The degree of the Maritime\r\nCommission's participation, which is a factual question, cannot be fully assessed\r\nbased on the record before us. Venturing a guess on the limited record before us, it\r\nappears that the Maritime Commission's so-called active participation was nothing\r\nmore than submitting comments to DHEC, just as other entities did. Even if I were\r\ninclined to accept a finding of \"active participation,\" that finding would,\r\nnonetheless, be insufficient to satisfy the text of section 54-6-10. Subsection (A)\r\nempowers the Maritime Commission \"to negotiate on behalf of the State of South\r\nCarolina and enter into agreements with the State of Georgia, the United States\r\nArmy Corps of Engineers, and other involved parties . . . which bind the State of\r\nSouth Carolina . . . .\" Further, subsection (F) expressly disempowers DHEC from\r\nany role whatsoever. S.C. Code Ann. § 54-6-10(F) (\"[O]n an interstate basis and\r\nspecifically in regard to the State of Georgia, the responsibilities granted to the\r\nSavannah River Maritime Commission in this joint resolution supersede any other\r\nconcurrent responsibilities of a particular state agency or department.\"). Therefore,\r\nthe Maritime Commission's mere acquiescence with the action of the DHEC staff\r\nfalls short of section 54-6-10 compliance.\r\n\nregrettable effect of silencing South Carolina's voice in this matter of great public\r\nimportance. In my judgment, we erred in accepting this single question in our\r\noriginal jurisdiction. Thus, I would dismiss the grant of original jurisdiction and\r\nallow the case to proceed in the normal course.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27183","title":"In the Matter of Greenwood County Magistrate Walter Rutledge Martin","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27183.pdf","description":"This is an opinion in which the Court publicly reprimands a magistrate.","date":"2012-11-07","type":"opinion","text":"                  THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                       In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n            In the Matter of Greenwood County Magistrate Walter\r\n            Rutledge Martin, Respondent.\r\n\r\n            Appellate Case No. 2012-213049\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Opinion No. 27183\r\n             Submitted October 16, 2012 – Filed November 7, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lesley M.

This case presents the novel issue of whether \"pre-impact\r\nfear\" should be recognized as a cognizable element of damages in a survival\r\naction. We granted a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the court of\r\nappeals that pre-impact fear is not compensable in this State. Rutland v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Transp., 390 S.C. 78, 85, 700 S.E.2d 451, 455 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\nFinding no evidence of conscious pain and suffering under the facts of this\r\ncase, we reserve judgment on this question for another day and affirm as\r\nmodified.     FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      Tiffanie was riding in the back seat of a 1999 S-10 Chevrolet Blazer\r\nwith her husband Clarence Rutland (Rutland) and their infant son when it hit\r\naccumulated water on the roadway. The driver of the Blazer, Joseph Bishop,\r\nlost control of the vehicle when it began to hydroplane, and it eventually\r\nflipped over into a nearby ditch. Tiffanie was partially ejected from the side\r\nwindow of the vehicle, which fell upon her when it overturned. Rutland was\r\ncompletely ejected through the back window of the Blazer, but he was able to\r\nwalk back over to the vehicle after the accident. When he got there, he saw\r\nTiffanie's head hanging out of the window. She made no noise and was cold\r\nand unresponsive, which lead him to believe she was already dead. Although\r\na bystander told Rutland that Tiffanie still had a pulse, he did not believe him\r\nand assumed he just wanted Rutland to get out of the way.\r\n\r\n      Rutland settled with Bishop's insurance company for $30,000 and filed\r\na wrongful death action against the South Carolina Department of\r\nTransportation (SCDOT) alleging negligent maintenance and repair of the\r\nstretch of highway where the accident occurred. He later amended his\r\ncomplaint to add General Motors (GM) as a defendant for its failure to equip\r\n\nthe Blazer's side windows with laminated glass instead of tempered glass.\r\nRutland subsequently settled with GM for $275,000. Including the $30,000\r\nfrom Bishop's insurance company, Rutland received a total of $305,000 in\r\nsettlement monies, which Rutland and GM agreed to allocate as follows:\r\n$138,000 to conscious pain and suffering under the potential (but not yet\r\nfiled) survival claim and $167,000 for wrongful death. Judge Diane\r\nGoodstein approved the settlement, noting that no survival action had ever\r\nbeen filed, but concluding \"without making any factual findings\" that \"there\r\nexists some evidence, however slight, that [Tiffanie] survived the crash and\r\nconsciously endured pain and suffering prior to her death.\" Judge\r\nGoodstein's order further clarified that SCDOT would still be allowed to\r\n\"argue against the allocation or apportionment of the wrongful death and\r\nsurvival proceeds or findings herein, to which SCDOT does not stipulate . . .\r\nfor purposes of setoff to which SCDOT may be entitled.\" Ultimately,\r\nRutland never filed a survival claim against any party.\r\n\r\n      In the trial against SCDOT for wrongful death, the jury returned a\r\nverdict in the amount of $300,000. SCDOT subsequently made a motion for\r\nset-off, alleging that the entire amount of the settlement should be equitably\r\nreapportioned to the wrongful death action because there was no evidence to\r\nsupport the putative survival claim for which settlement funds were allocated.\r\nThe trial court agreed and found that \"there is not sufficient evidence from\r\nwhich a jury could have concluded Tiffanie Rutland experienced conscious\r\npain and suffering of any kind before, during, or after the accident.\" This\r\neffectively rendered the verdict a zero dollar judgment.\r\n\r\n      Rutland appealed, arguing the trial court erred in failing to recognize\r\nTiffanie's pre-impact fear as damages supporting the survival action and in\r\nreallocating the full amount of the settlement toward SCDOT's judgment.\r\nRutland, 390 S.C. at 78, 700 S.E.2d at 451. The court of appeals affirmed,\r\nconcluding that South Carolina does not recognize pre-impact fear as an\r\nelement of damages and the reallocation of the settlement was proper. Id. at\r\n85, 700 S.E.2d at 455. We granted certiorari to review the court of appeals'\r\ndecision.\r\n\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\n\r\n\r\n    I.\t    Did the court of appeals err in failing to recognize damages for pre-\r\n           impact fear and in finding there was no evidence of conscious pain\r\n           and suffering?\r\n\r\n    II.\t   Did the court of appeals err in affirming the circuit court's equitable\r\n           reallocation of settlement proceeds?\r\n\r\n                               LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n    I.\t    CONSCIOUS PAIN AND SUFFERING\r\n\r\n      Rutland first argues the court of appeals erred in finding there was no\r\nevidence Tiffanie experienced conscious pain and suffering.1 In particular,\r\nRutland argues we should recognize pre-impact fright or fear as a cognizable\r\nelement of damages in a survival action.2 Because we find no evidence of\r\nconscious pain or suffering either prior to or after impact, we disagree and\r\nreserve the novel question3 of whether South Carolina should allow recovery\r\nfor pre-impact fear for another day.\r\n\r\n1  Because Rutland never brought a survival claim against any of the\r\ndefendants, any direct evidence to support that claim would have been\r\nirrelevant in a wrongful death action. Nevertheless, he contends the record\r\ncontains evidence to support a survival claim against GM sufficient to justify\r\nthe settlement allocations and limit SCDOT's set-off to the $167,000 as\r\nallotted by GM and Rutland to the wrongful death claim.\r\n2 In a survival action, damages may be recovered for a decedent's conscious\r\npain and suffering prior to death. Smalls v. S.C. Dep't of Educ., 339 S.C. 208,\r\n216, 528 S.E.2d 682, 686 (Ct. App. 2000). Rutland essentially argues that\r\n\"pre-impact fear\" should be incorporated as compensable \"suffering\" in a\r\nsurvival action.\r\n3 We clarify that to the extent the court of appeals concluded that the question\r\nof damages for pre-impact fear was resolved by Hoskins v. King, 676 F.\r\nSupp. 2d 441 (D.S.C. 2009), it was in error. The district court acknowledged\r\n\n        In urging us to recognize pre-impact fear damages, Rutland asserts the\r\nmajority of jurisdictions addressing the issue have found pre-impact fear\r\ncompensable and that South Carolina should follow suit. Generally speaking,\r\nthose courts have determined the timing of the impact should not determine\r\nthe availability of an award for damages pertaining to mental distress because\r\nit is illogical to bar recovery for pre-impact distress when one can recover for\r\npost-impact suffering. E.g. Solomon v. Warren, 540 F.2d 777, 793 (5th Cir.\r\n1976) (\"While in the garden variety of claims under survival statutes . . . fatal\r\ninjuries sustained in automobile accidents and the like[,] the usual sequence\r\nis impact followed by pain and suffering, we are unable to discern any reason\r\nbased on either law or logic for rejecting a claim because in this case as to at\r\nleast the part of the suffering, this sequence was reversed.\"); Lin v.\r\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 574 F. Supp. 1407, 1416 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (\"In\r\nseveral cases it has been held that a decedent's estate may recover for the\r\ndecedent's pain and suffering endured after the injury that led to his death.\r\nFrom this proposition, it is only a short step to the allowing of damages for a\r\ndecedent's pain and suffering before the mortal blow and resulting from the\r\napprehension of impending death.\") (internal citations omitted), rev'd in part\r\non other grounds, Lin v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 742 F.2d 45 (2d. Cir.\r\n1991); Monk v. Dial, 441 S.E.2d 857, 859 (Ga. Ct. App. 1994) (\"The fright,\r\nshock, and mental suffering experienced by an individual due to the wrongful\r\nacts of negligence will authorize a recovery where attended with physical\r\ninjury. . . . [W]e find no requirement that the physical injury precede the\r\nmental pain and suffering.\") (internal citations omitted); Nelson v. Dolan, 434\r\nN.W.2d 25, 31 (Neb. 1989) (\"[W]e are persuaded that there exists no sound\r\nlegal or logical distinction between permitting a decedent's estate to recover\r\nas an element of damages for a decedent's conscious postinjury pain and\r\nsuffering and mental anguish and permitting such an estate to recover for the\r\n\r\nthere was not direct support for this claim in South Carolina law and found\r\nthe cases from other jurisdictions recognizing pre-impact fear were factually\r\ndistinguishable. Id. at 451. Accordingly, this remains an open question in\r\nthis State.\r\n\nconscious prefatal-injury mental anguish resulting from the apprehension and\r\nfear of impending death.\").\r\n\r\n      We decline, however, to decide the issue of whether to recognize pre-\r\nimpact fear as an element of damages in a survival action given the lack of\r\nevidence in this record to support the claim. Rutland offers only a recount of\r\nhis personal fears and apprehensions prior to impact as proof that Tiffanie\r\nmust have felt them as well. The accident appears to have occurred quickly\r\nand the evidence suggests she died instantaneously. She therefore would\r\nhave had little if any time to contemplate her demise. Furthermore, Rutland\r\noffers no other evidence of Tiffanie's pain and suffering. He himself testified\r\nthat he knew Tiffanie was dead at the scene and that although he was told by\r\na bystander that she had a pulse, he did not believe him. Additionally, even\r\nassuming she had a pulse, that fact alone is not evidence of conscious pain\r\nand suffering. Rutland further stated she was not responsive when he called\r\nher name nor did she react when he rubbed her head. Based on this evidence,\r\na jury could not reasonably have concluded Tiffanie consciously experienced\r\nany pain or suffering prior to or after impact. Thus, Rutland has not adduced\r\nsufficient evidence even if we were to recognize pre-impact fear as an\r\nelement of damages in a survival action.\r\n\r\n   II.   EQUITABLE REALLOCATION\r\n\r\n      Rutland also argues that because there is sufficient evidence of\r\nconscious pain and suffering, the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial\r\ncourt's equitable reallocation of the settlement. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       A non-settling defendant is entitled to credit for the amount paid by\r\nanother defendant who settles for the same cause of action. Welch v. Epstein,\r\n342 S.C. 279, 312-13, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The trial\r\ncourt's jurisdiction to set off one judgment against another is equitable in\r\nnature and should be exercised when necessary to provide justice between the\r\nparties.\" Id. at 313, 536 S.E.2d at 425. Allowing this credit prevents an\r\ninjured person from obtaining a double recovery for the damage he sustained,\r\nfor it is \"almost universally held that there can be only one satisfaction for an\r\n\ninjury or wrong.\" Truesdale v. S.C. Highway Dept., 264 S.C. 221, 235, 213\r\nS.E.2d 740, 746 (1975), overruled on other grounds by McCall v. Batson,\r\n285 S.C. 243. 329, S.E.2d 741 (1985).\r\n\r\n       As previously discussed, we find no evidence that Tiffanie endured\r\nconscious pain and suffering, and we therefore agree with the court of\r\nappeals that the trial court acted within its discretion by reallocating the\r\nsettlement funds to the wrongful death claim. Furthermore, the allocation\r\nconsistently tracks our prior case law. The facts here closely resemble those\r\nof Welch.4 In Welch, the decedent—who was in the hospital for back\r\nsurgery—died of a massive pulmonary embolism following a respiratory\r\narrest allegedly due to a narcotics overdose under the supervision of Dr.\r\nEpstein. 342 S.C. at 294, 536 S.E.2d at 416. Welch's personal representative\r\nsettled with an unnamed defendant for $450,000 total, allocating $445,000 to\r\nthe survival action and $5,000 to the wrongful death claim. Id. at 312, 536\r\nS.E.2d at 425. The personal representative then proceeded to a jury trial\r\nagainst Dr. Epstein and received a verdict of $3,000,000 for wrongful death,\r\n$28,535.88 in the survival action—which was the amount of medical\r\nexpenses incurred—and $3,900,000 in punitive damages. Id. at 287, 536\r\nS.E.2d at 412. The trial court, however, granted Dr. Epstein's motion for set-\r\noff and reallocated the amount of the settlement to $28,535.88 for the\r\nsurvival action and $421,464.12 for the wrongful death claim. Id. at 312, 536\r\nS.E.2d at 425. The court of appeals affirmed, noting that the decedent had\r\nslipped into a coma at the time of his respiratory arrest and never awoke from\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The dissent advocates overruling Welch and disallowing the reallocation of\r\nsettlement proceeds between different causes of action. However, Rutland\r\nhas not asked us to do so, nor did he petition to argue against precedent as\r\nrequired by Rule 217, SCACR. We decline, as we must, to entertain\r\narguments not presented to us. See Langley v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 181, 325\r\nS.E.2d 550, 561 (Ct. App. 1984), quashed on other grounds, 286 S.C. 85, 332\r\nS.E.2d 100 (1985) (“[A]ppellate courts in this state, like well-behaved\r\nchildren, do not speak unless spoken to and do not answer questions they are\r\nnot asked.”).\r\n\nit; thus, there was no evidence he consciously suffered so the survival claim\r\nwas properly limited to medical expenses. Id. at 313, 536 S.E.2d at 426.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, here there is no evidence showing Tiffanie experienced\r\nconscious pain and suffering which would support a survival claim. Instead,\r\nshe appears to have died instantaneously. In the absence of any support for a\r\nsurvival action, we find the trial court properly reallocated that portion of the\r\nsettlement to the wrongful death claim.\r\n\r\n      The dissent contends this reallocation produces inequitable results by\r\neffectively reducing the judgment against SCDOT to zero, a view we do not\r\nshare. Compensatory damages are intended to make the plaintiff whole, not\r\nto punish the tortfeasor. See 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 27; see also\r\nHaselden v. Davis, 353 S.C. 481, 486, 579 S.E.2d 293, 296 (noting the\r\n\"central tenet of compensatory damages [that] awards are intended to make\r\nan injured person whole by placing him in the position enjoyed prior to the\r\ninjury and no more\"). Where reallocation of damages furthers that policy, we\r\ndo not believe the result is inequitable. Moreover, the fact that the amount\r\nawarded by the jury for the wrongful death action -- $300,000 -- essentially\r\nmirrors the settlement amount of $305,000 lends further support for our view\r\nthat Rutland has been duly compensated for his damages. Furthermore, we\r\nnote the court order approving the settlement expressly reserved the right for\r\nSCDOT to contest the allocation of the proceeds, indicating that both\r\nSCDOT and Rutland were aware that a reallocation may be made.\r\nTherefore, we find the trial court properly reallocated the settlement proceeds\r\nand set-off the judgment against SCDOT.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we affirm the court of appeals' opinion finding\r\nno evidence of conscious pain and suffering and upholding the equitable\r\nreallocation of the settlement. However, we modify it to clarify that the issue\r\nof whether \"pre-impact\" fear is a compensable element of damages remains\r\nan open question in South Carolina.\r\n\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in part and dissent in part. I agree with\r\nthe majority in declining on this record to recognize pre-impact fear as an\r\nelement of damages in a survival action. However, in my view, reallocation\r\nof a plaintiff’s settlement agreement from one cause of action to another is\r\nnot warranted. Thus, I would reverse the circuit court’s reallocation of the\r\nsettlement agreement that was set off in full against Rutland’s judgment\r\nagainst SCDOT on this wrongful death action.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrongful death and survival actions are different claims for different injuries.\r\nBennett v. Spartanburg Railway, Gas & Electric Co., 97 S.C. 27, 29-30, 81\r\nS.E. 189, 189-90 (1914). In a wrongful death action, damages are for the\r\nbenefit of the statutory heirs, and no damages are allowed for injuries to the\r\ndecedent. See id. Evidence going only to the issue of the decedent’s pain\r\nand suffering would be irrelevant and prejudicial and should not be admitted\r\nin an action only for wrongful death. In this case, Rutland sued SCDOT only\r\non a wrongful death claim. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the record\r\ncontains little evidence on the issue of the decedent’s pre-impact fear.5\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Rutland settled his claims against GM and the at-fault driver,\r\nallocating a greater proportion of the proceeds to the wrongful death than to\r\nthe survival action. Following trial, at which only a wrongful death action\r\nwas tried against the remaining defendant, SCDOT, the circuit court granted\r\nSCDOT’s motion to have the settlement proceeds reallocated wholly to the\r\nwrongful death action. The resulting setoff extinguished the entire judgment\r\nagainst SCDOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my view, reallocation of the settlement proceeds was improper. In\r\napproving reallocation, the majority relies on Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279,\r\n536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000). The Welch court recognized the rule that\r\n“the reduction in the [plaintiff’s] judgment must be from a settlement for the\r\n\r\n5 In Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000), discussed\r\ninfra, both the wrongful death and survival actions were tried.\r\n\nsame cause of action.” Welch, 342 S.C. at 313, 536 S.E.2d at 425. It\r\nnonetheless proceeded to expand this accepted setoff principle to allow a\r\ncourt to disregard a plaintiff’s pre-trial settlement agreement with a different\r\ntortfeasor and reallocate the settlement monies among various causes of\r\naction. Nothing in our precedents supports such a reallocation. I would\r\noverrule Welch to the extent it authorizes reallocation of settlement proceeds\r\namong different causes of action.6\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, in my view equity is not served by a court’s revision of a\r\nsettlement agreement between the plaintiff and another tortfeasor. First,\r\ndoing so essentially requires a plaintiff to defend to the court the viability of a\r\nclaim she has not made. In my view, such a procedure violates the settled\r\nrule that the plaintiff may choose her defendant. See Chester v. South\r\nCarolina Dept. of Public Safety, 388 S.C. 343, 345-46, 698 S.E.2d 559, 560\r\n(2010) (refusing to find the “firmly entrenched common law principle” of\r\nplaintiff’s sole right to choose her defendant abrogated by the Tort Claims\r\nAct even when the result was to make a nonsettling defendant liable for a\r\ngreater share of the damages).\r\n\r\n\r\nReallocating a settlement agreement may also inequitably reduce a plaintiff’s\r\nrecovery against at-fault defendants. See McDermott, Inc. v. AmClyde, 511\r\nU.S. 202, 212-21 (1994), and sources cited therein (discussing possible\r\ninequities of setting off judgment by full amount of settlement rather than\r\nrequiring a nonsettling defendant to pay its proportionate share of damages).\r\nThis case serves as an example, in that the jury’s verdict represented only its\r\ndetermination of the wrongful death damages to the decedent’s family and\r\nnot her own survival damages. It is impossible to divine from that verdict\r\n\r\n\r\n6 The majority places weight on the fact that Rutland and SCDOT were aware of\r\nthe possibility of reallocation. I find this fact both unsurprising in light of the\r\nexistence of Welch and irrelevant to my analysis. SCDOT was not a party to the\r\nsettlement agreement between Rutland and GM, and the circuit court properly\r\nemphasized that SCDOT was bound by none of its terms.\r\n\nwhat verdict a jury would have returned on the decedent’s own damages in a\r\nsurvival action, had one been brought.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court’s ex post analysis also benefits from hindsight and\r\ndisregards a variety of legitimate bases for the parties’ ex ante decisions. See\r\nMcDermott, supra. For example, the parties to the settlement agreement\r\nwere able to bargain on the settlement amount in light of the unsettled law\r\nregarding pre-impact fear as an element of damages in a survival action.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the result of reallocation in this case is that SCDOT, an at-fault\r\ndefendant, is exempted from any payment to the decedent’s statutory heirs. I\r\nsee no equity in this result. See Chester, supra; McDermott, 511 U.S. at 219\r\n(“The law contains no rigid rule against overcompensation [of the plaintiff].\r\nSeveral doctrines, such as the collateral benefits rule, recognize that making\r\ntortfeasors pay for the damage they cause can be more important than\r\npreventing overcompensation.”). Finally, the unfortunate effect of\r\nreallocation in a case such as this, where there is no suggestion of fraud or\r\nother wrongdoing by the plaintiff, is to discourage plaintiffs from settling and\r\nencourage joint tortfeasors to litigate, contrary to our strong public policy\r\nfavoring settlement. See Chester 388 S.C. at 346, 698 S.E.2d at 560.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, in my view, the trial court erred when it reallocated the settlement. I\r\ntherefore respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion\r\napproving reallocation of the settlement in favor of SCDOT.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27186","title":"Carson v.

We affirm the circuit court's evidentiary determinations and jury charge,\r\nbut reverse the circuit court's decision denying Appellant's request for a new trial\r\nnisi additur and remand the survival action for a new trial absolute.\r\n\r\n                        FACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On May 30, 2004, at approximately 7:05 p.m., Frances Harvey (Ms. Harvey)\r\nwas driving her son, Beryl Harvey (Decedent), to go fishing when she approached\r\na grade crossing on Honeyford Road in Denmark, South Carolina. The crossing\r\ndid not have lights or a crossbar, but was marked with crossbucks, a stop sign, and\r\nwhite stop lines and railroad markings on the pavement. Ms. Harvey testified that\r\nshe stopped, looked left, turned and looked right, and slowly proceeded across the\r\ntracks after not seeing or hearing a train. She does not remember anything after\r\nproceeding forward. The engineer trainee who was operating the train testified that\r\nhe noticed a tan van stop momentarily before pulling onto the crossing and\r\nstopping on the tracks. The train was travelling at approximately 46 miles per hour\r\nwhen it collided with Ms. Harvey's van. Decedent was a quadriplegic,1 and was\r\nsecured in his wheelchair in the rear of the van, facing the opposite direction of the\r\noncoming train, when the van was hit by the train. Decedent was ejected from the\r\nvan and was still alive when he landed in some briar and bushes near the train\r\ntrack. A witness to the scene testified he heard Decedent call out for his mother\r\nfrom the brush, and two other witnesses testified they heard Decedent moaning.\r\nDecedent died at the scene from blunt trauma to his head and chest.\r\n\r\n       Appellant filed a wrongful death action against both CSX and the South\r\nCarolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) on February 21, 2006,2 and then\r\nfiled a survival action against both parties on May 25, 2006.3 Appellant settled her\r\nclaims against SCDOT prior to trial.\r\n\r\n      Appellant and CSX continued to trial before a jury. Central to Appellant's\r\nclaim of negligence were the allegations that CSX failed to eliminate trees and\r\nvegetation that obstructed Ms. Harvey's view and that CSX failed to adequately\r\n\r\n1 Decedent lost use of his legs and arms as a result of a diving accident at the age \n\r\nof 16.\n\r\n2 Appellant filed amended complaints in the wrongful death and survival actions \n\r\nagainst both parties in August of 2008. \n\r\n3 These actions were consolidated for trial.\n\r\n\nsound its horn in compliance with South Carolina law and CSX's internal operating\r\nrules. Appellant offered evidence that at the time of the accident, the vegetation\r\nsurrounding the Honeyford Road crossing did not accord with the specifications\r\nprescribed by CSX's internal crossing clearing program. CSX offered into\r\nevidence pictures of the scene, taken by an investigator working for the law firm\r\nrepresenting Appellant days after the accident, which tended to show an\r\nunobstructed view of the tracks. CSX also offered the testimony of an eyewitness,\r\nwho was stopped on the opposite side of the tracks as the train approached, that he\r\ncould clearly see the train approaching.\r\n\r\n       Regarding the claim of an inadequate warning signal, Appellant argued that\r\nCSX was negligent per se for failing to comply with section 58-15-910 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code, which mandates that a train begin to sound its whistle or\r\nhorn at 1,500 feet from a road crossing and to continue whistling until the train\r\ncrosses the intersection. S.C. Code Ann. § 58-15-910 (1976). Appellant\r\nadditionally offered testimony regarding CSX's operating rule that the train horn\r\nmust be sounded at the whistle post and be blown in two long blasts, followed by a\r\nshort blast, followed by another long blast. The train that collided with Ms.\r\nHarvey's van was equipped with a data event recorder that revealed the train\r\noperator first sounded the horn at 1,347 feet from the crossing, and then blew the\r\nhorn three additional times before striking Ms. Harvey's van. There was testimony\r\nthat the duration of the horn blasts and the time between the horn blasts did not\r\ncomply with CSX's operating rules. CSX offered the testimony of the eyewitness\r\nthat the horn was very loud and that the engineer \"sat down\" on the horn as it\r\napproached the intersection and it did not stop until after the collision.\r\n\r\n        After seven days of trial before a jury, the jury returned a special verdict\r\nfinding CSX forty percent negligent and Ms. Harvey sixty percent negligent. This\r\nfault allocation gave rise to a defense verdict on the Appellant's wrongful death\r\nclaim. The jury found the damages in the survival action amounted to zero dollars.\r\nAppellant filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new\r\ntrial absolute, and new trial nisi additur. The circuit court denied each of these\r\nmotions. This action is before this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                      ISSUES\r\n\r\nI.\t   Whether the circuit court properly excluded all evidence related to\r\n      SCDOT's pre-accident recommendation to install gates and lights at\r\n      the crossing.\r\n\nII.\t   Whether the circuit court properly excluded all evidence related to\r\n       post-accident vegetation cutting by CSX.\r\n\r\nIII.\t Whether the circuit court properly omitted the \"particularly\r\n      dangerous\" language from section 56-5-2715 of the South Carolina\r\n      Code when charging the jury on a driver's duty to stop.\r\n\r\nIV.\t Whether Appellant is entitled to a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi\r\n     additur due to the jury's finding of zero dollars in damages in the\r\n     survival action.          STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of the\r\nappellate court extends merely to the correction of errors of law. Erickson v. Jones\r\nSt. Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 464, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663–64 (2006). The\r\nadmission or exclusion of evidence, the decision of the circuit court as to particular\r\njury instructions, and the denial of a motion for a new trial nisi additur are all\r\nactions within the sound discretion of the circuit court and will not be disturbed on\r\nappeal absent an abuse of discretion. See Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v.\r\nMallon, 381 S.C. 417, 434, 673 S.E.2d 448, 457 (2009) (admission of evidence);\r\nCole v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008) (jury charge); O'Neal v.\r\nBowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993) (nisi additur). An abuse of\r\ndiscretion occurs when the conclusions of the circuit court are either controlled by\r\nan error of law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions. Kiriakides v. Sch.\r\nDist. of Greenville Cty., 382 S.C. 8, 20, 675 S.E.2d 439, 445 (2009).\r\n\r\n                                      ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       I.\t   Exclusion of Evidence Related to SCDOT's Pre-Accident\r\n             Recommendation to Install Gates and Lights at the\r\n             Crossing\r\n\r\n       On April 26, 2004, roughly a month before the accident, a diagnostic team\r\nwith SCDOT evaluated the Honeyford Road crossing for the purpose of securing\r\nfederal funding pursuant to section 130 of Title 23 to the United States Code\r\n(section 130) and recommended that gates and lights be installed using those funds.\r\n23 U.S.C. § 130 (Supp. 2011). The circuit judge excluded from evidence any\r\nreference to this recommendation on three grounds: it was subject to the\r\nevidentiary privilege of section 409 of title 23 to the United States Code, 23 U.S.C.\r\n\n§ 409 (Supp. 2011) (section 409), it is a subsequent remedial measure and\r\ntherefore not admissible under Rule 407, SCRE, and its prejudicial value\r\noutweighed its probative value and should be excluded under Rule 403, SCRE.\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred on each of these grounds. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Appellant sought to call Darrell Munn, a research engineer on SCDOT's\r\ndiagnostic team that evaluated the Honeyford Road crossing, to testify about his\r\nobservations of the Honeyford Road crossing and the resulting recommendation by\r\nthe diagnostic team to install flashing lights and a crossbar. CSX objected to\r\nMunn's testimony on the ground it was inadmissible pursuant to section 409.\r\nSection 409 provides:\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, reports, surveys,\r\n      schedules, lists, or data compiled or collected for the purpose of\r\n      identifying, evaluating, or planning the safety enhancement of\r\n      potential accident sites, hazardous roadway conditions, or railway-\r\n      highway crossings, pursuant to sections 130, 144, and 148 of this title\r\n      or for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction\r\n      improvement project which may be implemented utilizing Federal-aid\r\n      highway funds shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into\r\n      evidence in a Federal or State court proceeding or considered for\r\n      other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence\r\n      at a location mentioned or addressed in such reports, surveys,\r\n      schedules, lists, or data.\r\n\r\n23 U.S.C. § 409 (emphasis added). The circuit judge sustained the objection,\r\nfinding that the admission of Munn's testimony was preempted by this federal law\r\nand additionally, that Munn’s testimony should be excluded on Rule 407 and 403,\r\nSCRE, grounds.\r\n\r\n       Appellant first argues that data collected for purposes of securing federal\r\nmoney under section 130 is not subject to evidentiary exclusion under section 409\r\nbecause the United States Supreme Court in Pierce County Washington v. Guillen,\r\n537 U.S. 129 (2003), held that section 409 only protects documents collected\r\nspecifically for 23 U.S.C. § 152 purposes.4 While the Supreme Court can be\r\nquoted as saying such, Appellant misconstrues the holding of Pierce County. In\r\nthat case, the Court was determining the scope of section 409 protection where\r\n\r\n4In 2005, Congress replaced section 409's cross-reference to 23 U.S.C. § 152 with\r\n23 U.S.C. § 148.\r\n\ndata compiled for purposes of receiving federal money under 23 U.S.C. § 152 was\r\nat issue and where petitioner urged the Court to apply section 409 broadly to\r\nexclude data generated for purposes other than securing section 152 funds. Pierce\r\nCnty., 537 U.S. at 143. The Supreme Court in no way intended to read out section\r\n409’s reference to section 130, at issue in this case.\r\n\r\n       Appellant alternatively argues that Munn’s testimony is not subject to\r\nsection 409’s evidentiary privilege because it protects only \"reports, surveys,\r\nschedules, lists, or data compiled\" during a safety planning evaluation and Munn’s\r\ntestimony about his observations and conclusions is not a document. We believe\r\nthis hyper-technical reading of section 409 would render the statute meaningless.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court, in Pierce County, noted that the purpose of establishing\r\nthe evidentiary privilege found in section 409 was to quell states’ fears that\r\n\"diligent efforts to identify roads eligible for aid under [federal highway safety\r\nprograms] would increase the risk of liability for accidents that took place at\r\nhazardous locations before improvements could be made.\" 537 U.S. at 133. The\r\nSupreme Court declined to adopt the narrow reading of section 409 urged by\r\nrespondents in that case, stating:\r\n\r\n      that reading would render the 1995 amendment to § 409 (changing the\r\n      language from \"compiled\" to \"compiled or collected\") an exercise in\r\n      futility. We have said before that, \"[w]hen Congress acts to amend a\r\n      statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and\r\n      substantial effect.\" . . . [Respondent’s] reading gives the amendment\r\n      no \"real and substantial effect\" and, accordingly, cannot be the proper\r\n      understanding of the statute.\r\n\r\nId. at 145 (internal citations omitted). The approach taken by the Supreme Court\r\ndoes not allow us to adopt Appellant’s argument that section 409 excludes the\r\ndocuments containing data collected for purposes of securing federal highway\r\nsafety funds, but not the testimony of mental impressions made when collecting\r\nthat data.\r\n\r\n      Appellant cites Bowman v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company, No. 94-\r\n1204, 1995 WL 550079 (4th Cir. Sept. 15, 1995), to support its contention that\r\nCSX failed to meet its burden for establishing the elements of section 409,\r\ndiscussed supra. Because this case more aptly supports Appellant's contention that\r\nMunn's testimony is admissible in the face of section 409, we discuss it here.\r\n\n       In Bowman, a South Carolina district court allowed a highway department\r\nofficial who had conducted a routine safety inspection of the railroad crossing at\r\nissue to testify about his findings, even though his written report was ruled\r\ninadmissible by the district court under section 409. Id. at *6. In evaluating the\r\npropriety of the district court's admission of the officer's testimony, the United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized the general proposition\r\nthat \"witnesses should not be allowed to circumvent § 409 by testifying regarding\r\nthe contents of an inadmissible report.\" Id. The Fourth Circuit noted that it\r\nreviews the court's admission of the testimony under an abuse of discretion\r\nstandard, and then affirmed the admission upon the belief that the highway\r\ndepartment official \"simply used portions of the document to refresh his\r\nrecollection about matters otherwise available to any lay witness who had observed\r\nthe scene.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       We believe the Fourth Circuit intended Bowman, an unpublished opinion, to\r\nbe a narrow holding. The bulk of national jurisprudence on this issue supports the\r\ncircuit court's decision in this case to exclude Munn's testimony under the ambit of\r\nsection 409. See Harrison v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., 965 F.2d 155, 160 (7th Cir.\r\n1992) (upholding the district court's exclusion of the testimony by the author of an\r\nexcluded report because allowing that testimony would circumvent the purposes of\r\nthe statute); Powers v. CSC Transp., Inc., 177 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1279–80 (S.D.\r\nAla. 2001) (\"It is well-settled that a plaintiff may not circumvent Section 409 by\r\nasking a witness to testify to matters the witness learned from documents protected\r\nby Section 409.\"); Rodenboeck v. Norfolk & Wester Ry. Co., 983 F. Supp. 620, 623\r\n(N.D. Ind. 1997) (\"§409 encompasses not only grade crossing safety enhancement\r\ndocuments, but also any testimony about those documents.\"). Recognizing the\r\npolicy underlying section 409, we find that any testimony about observations made\r\nwhile gathering data for purposes of securing the federal highway safety funds\r\nreferenced in section 409 falls within the evidentiary privilege of section 409.\r\n\r\n       Alternatively, Appellant contends that CSX did not satisfy its burden to\r\nestablish that the data compiled during the diagnostic team's site visit was for\r\npurpose of securing federal money under section 130. We disagree. Prior to trial,\r\nCSX filed a motion in limine arguing that any testimony regarding the\r\nrecommendation to install gates and lights was inadmissible under section 409.\r\nCSX supported that argument with the deposition testimony of Munn that in\r\nmaking the site visit, the team followed the criteria set forth in federal regulations\r\nfor purposes of receiving section 130 funds. Upon this showing, the judge invoked\r\nthe evidentiary privilege of section 409 to exclude Munn's testimony. We believe\r\nCSX satisfied its burden by showing that SCDOT's diagnostic team made the April\r\n\n26, 2004 site visit to evaluate its safety so that it could apply for federal funds\r\nunder section 130. Therefore, we find the circuit court properly excluded Munn's\r\ntestimony pursuant to section 409.\r\n\r\n       Appellant finally argues the circuit judge erred in excluding evidence of\r\nSCDOT's recommendation to install gates and lights on Rule 403 and 407, SCRE,\r\ngrounds. Because we find the circuit judge properly excluded this evidence under\r\nsection 409, we do not reach those issues. See Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v.\r\nPalmetto State Transp. Co, 382 S.C. 295, 307, 676 S.E.2d 700, 706 (2009)\r\n(appellate court need not discuss remaining issues when determination of prior\r\nissue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n      II.\t   Exclusion of Evidence Related to Post-Accident Vegetation\r\n             Cutting\r\n\r\n       At trial, Appellant provided evidence that the vegetation bordering the tracks\r\nwas not cut according to the specifications of CSX's internal crossing clearing\r\nprogram. CSX cut the vegetation according to this standard shortly after the\r\naccident, on July 19, 2004. The circuit judge's uniform directive throughout the\r\ntrial was to exclude any evidence of subsequent remedial measures on Rule 403\r\nand Rule 407, SCRE, grounds. Rule 407 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n      When, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously,\r\n      would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the\r\n      subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable\r\n      conduct in connection with the event. This rule does not require the\r\n      exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for\r\n      another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of\r\n      precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.\r\n\r\nRule 407, SCRE.\r\n\r\n      The rationale underlying Rule 407 \"rests on a social policy of encouraging\r\npeople to take, or at least not discouraging them from taking, steps in furtherance\r\nof added safety.\" Fed. R. Evid. 407 advisory committee's note.5 In Webb v. CSX\r\nTransportation, Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 653, 615 S.E.2d 440, 448 (2005), this Court\r\n\r\n5Although there are minor differences between Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of\r\nEvidence and Rule 407, SCRE, the underlying policy of each is the same.\r\n\nreversed and remanded a train collision case, in part, because of the erroneous\r\nadmission of evidence of post-accident vegetation cutting. The Webb court\r\nrejected the narrow application of Rule 407 used in Reiland v. Southland\r\nEquipment Service, Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1998), and held,\r\n\"Rule 407 bars the introduction of any change, repair, or precaution that under the\r\nplaintiff's theory would have made the accident less likely to happen, unless the\r\nevidence is offered for another purpose.\" Webb, 364 S.C. at 653, 615 S.E.2d at\r\n448.   Appellant argues the circuit judge should have recognized the impeachment\r\nexception to Rule 407 to admit the evidence of subsequent remedial measures, and\r\nadditionally argues that CSX waived its right to object to the admission of Exhibit\r\n134. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      A. Impeachment of CSX's Position that the Sight Distance was \n\r\n         Adequate \n\r\n\r\n       Appellant contends she should have been permitted to introduce evidence of\r\npost-accident cutting to impeach CSX’s position that the available sight distance\r\non May 30, 2004, was adequate and that the vegetation did not need to be cut. We\r\ndisagree. Allowing a party to invoke the impeachment exception to Rule 407 in\r\nresponse to the opposing party’s general defense against a negligence claim would\r\nswallow the rule. The Supreme Court of Illinois encountered a party propounding\r\nthis same logic and stated:\r\n\r\n      Just as evidence of subsequent remedial measures is not considered\r\n      sufficiently probative to be admissible to prove prior negligence, that\r\n      evidence is not admissible for impeachment where the sole value of\r\n      the impeachment rests on that same impermissible inference of prior\r\n      negligence.\r\n\r\nHerzog v. Lexington Twp., 657 N.E.2d 926, 933 (Ill. 1995). Accordingly, it was\r\nnot an abuse of discretion to exclude a photograph that depicted CSX’s post-\r\naccident clearing of the vegetation along the Honeyford Road crossing simply\r\nbecause CSX maintained that the sight distance at the time of the accident was\r\nadequate.\r\n\n      B. Impeachment of Jack Cowan's Testimony\r\n\r\n       Along similar lines, Appellant contends evidence of post-accident vegetation\r\nclearing should have been admitted to impeach the testimony of Jack Cowan, a\r\nCSX engineer, that CSX has always cut the vegetation at its crossings, even prior\r\nto CSX’s implementation of the crossing clearing program in 2001. Appellant\r\nsought to admit a photograph of the crossing taken after the vegetation was cleared\r\naccording to CSX’s updated policy to allow the jury to compare it to the\r\nphotograph of the crossing taken days after the accident.\r\n\r\n      During cross-examination of Cowan, Appellant asked whether Cowan would\r\nbe able to see a car approaching if vegetation had grown up around the crossing, to\r\nwhich Cowan replied that he had not encountered this problem since, in his forty\r\nyear career with CSX, CSX always kept vegetation cut back. Cowan admitted that\r\nthe way CSX cleared crossings had changed over the years, but that CSX had\r\nalways implemented a program of cutting back vegetation at crossings.\r\n\r\n       CSX’s general defense theory was that although the vegetation had not yet\r\nbeen cut in accord with the latest internal policies, the sight distance at the crossing\r\nwas nevertheless adequate to allow a driver sufficient opportunity to see an\r\napproaching train. Cowan’s testimony was consistent with this theory of defense.\r\nAdditionally, CSX conceded that the vegetation was not cut in accord with its own\r\npolicies. Evidence of subsequent remedial measures could not have impeached\r\nthis concession. Appellant could have properly used this photograph as\r\nimpeachment if, for example, Cowan had testified that at the time of the accident,\r\nthe vegetation surrounding the crossing was cleared in accordance with CSX’s\r\ninternal policies. However, upon these facts, the photograph depicting post-\r\naccident vegetation clearing had no impeachment value, and therefore was\r\nproperly excluded under Rule 407, SCRE.\r\n\r\n      C. Animation Expert's Handwritten Notes\r\n\r\n       On appeal, much has been made of the circuit judge's ruling that prohibited\r\nAppellant from referencing a portion of Gary Huett's notes during closing\r\narguments—an exhibit introduced into evidence by CSX. After a thorough reading\r\nof the Record and due consideration, we uphold the circuit judge's determination to\r\nexclude reference to the portion of the notes not used at trial because these notes\r\nwere not critical to refuting the negative cross-examination and arguments made by\r\nCSX's counsel. Additionally, reference to this portion of the notes would have\r\n\nundermined, at the eleventh hour of trial, the circuit judge's consistent goal of\r\nexcluding evidence of post-accident cutting.\r\n\r\n      CSX's Exhibit 134 originally consisted of five pages of hand-written notes\r\nthat Appellant's expert, Gary Huett, took for purposes of creating an accident\r\nanimation. Because the vegetation along the tracks was cut shortly after the\r\naccident, Huett relied, in part, on photogrammetry6 to re-enact the accident scene,\r\nusing photographs taken by Appellant's investigator, Donald Crews, days after the\r\naccident occurred. Exhibit 134 was introduced into evidence without objection.\r\nHowever, the exhibit was not seen by or published to the jury. The first page of\r\nHuett's notes stated,\r\n\r\n      \"DOA [date of accident]: . . . May 30, 2004\r\n      Survey 2006\r\n      Cut back since accident\r\n      Poor quality photos after accident\r\n\r\n       A central issue at trial was a determination of the sight distance Ms. Harvey\r\nwould have had at the point where she stopped behind the tracks. During CSX's\r\ncross-examination of Huett and another expert, Dr. Heathington, counsel made\r\nreference to the fourth page of Huett's notes that stated, \"Performed my\r\nphotogrammetric analysis . . . , then compared it to Don Crews' measurements at\r\nsite. They lined up very well. His 1014' [feet] visib[ility] @ 70' [inches] past stop\r\nbar is consistent.\" CSX read this portion of the notes into evidence to refute the\r\nexperts' claims that the sight distance may have been much less.\r\n\r\n       A key defense strategy of CSX was to undermine the reliability of the\r\nanimation created by Huett. At closing argument, Appellant sought to refute\r\nseveral of CSX's attacks on the animation by stating that it was only necessary to\r\ncreate the animation because the vegetation along the sight line of the tracks had\r\nsince been cut. Specifically, Appellant sought to introduce the first page of Huett's\r\nnotes that made reference to the post-accident cutting. During closing argument,\r\nAppellant's counsel stated, \"One thing I want to talk with you about is there was a\r\nlot of criticism of our deceptive animation. We had to do the animation. . . . This is\r\nDefendant's Exhibit 134.\" CSX promptly objected. In arguing against that\r\n\r\n6Photogrammetry is the process used to determine the geometric properties of an\r\nobject from two-dimensional photographs based on height and elevation of other\r\nknown points.\r\n\nobjection, Appellant's counsel stated, \"we wanted to use Exhibit 134 to show that,\r\nin fact, he had to do an animation to get the distances because they had cut the\r\ncrossing.\"7\r\n\r\n      The circuit judge sustained CSX's objection, stating:\r\n\r\n      . . . We have ruled consistently through the trial that any subsequent—\r\n      whether it's remedial or whatever it was—any subsequent cutting of\r\n      the trees I was keeping out. I found it not to be relevant. I found it to\r\n      violate 407 and 403, and when it was brought to our attention at the\r\n      side bar during argument that document or exhibit in its entirety\r\n      would have violated my prior rulings and that's the reason I precluded\r\n      argument on it at the time. You're protected, Mr. Parker.\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that CSX (1) waived its right to object to the use of Exhibit\r\n134 when it introduced it into evidence, and (2) \"opened the door\" to reference of\r\nthe full exhibit because it criticized Huett’s animation as being inaccurate.\r\nTherefore, Appellant argues that reference to Huett's notes was necessary to\r\nexplain that post-accident cutting necessitated Huett's reliance on photogrammetry.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n       Over the course of this long and complex trial, the circuit judge was careful\r\nto exclude any reference to subsequent remedial measures, pursuant to Rules 403\r\nand 407, SCRE.8 It is clear from the circuit judge's response to CSX's objection\r\nthat the admission of this portion of Huett's notes would have undermined this\r\nconsistent directive at the final hour of trial. Appellant argues that CSX's failure\r\n\"to make an objection at the time evidence is offered constitutes waiver of the right\r\nto object.\" Cogdill v. Watson, 289 S.C. 531, 538, 347 S.E.2d 126, 129 (Ct. App.\r\n1986). However, as we view the Record, it is unclear whether the entirety of\r\nHuett's notes was placed into evidence. Moreover, even if we assumed it was, a\r\ncourt always has discretion to exclude evidence sua sponte if it believes it will\r\nmislead a jury or is unduly prejudicial. See Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v.\r\n\r\n7 We note that even in the absence of post-accident clearing, it is common practice\r\nin train collision cases to create an animated re-enactment.\r\n8 For example, when Huett mentioned on the stand that some problematic bushes\r\nwere no longer there, the circuit judge dismissed the jury and warned, \"All right.\r\nMr. Huett, we have gone to great lengths to try this case based solely on how this\r\ncrossing scene appeared on the day in question . . . . Please do not make any\r\nadditional references to what was not there in your analysis.\"\r\n\nArmstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346, 357, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972) (\"A\r\nmotion to strike evidence admitted without objection is addressed to the sound\r\ndiscretion of the court.\"). In this instance, had CSX not objected to the admission\r\nof evidence of post-accident cutting, it is clear, based on the circuit judge’s\r\nadamant directive to exclude such evidence, that he would have prohibited\r\nAppellant from bringing the evidence in through the back door. Therefore, we find\r\nthat the circuit judge did not abuse his discretion in prohibiting Appellant from\r\nreferencing the page of Huett's notes that disclosed the exact evidence he had\r\nconsistently excluded at trial.\r\n\r\n       Further, we do not believe it was necessary to reveal information about the\r\npost-accident cutting to refute CSX's negative remarks about Huett's animation.\r\nAs a defense strategy, CSX attempted to undermine the reliability of Huett's\r\nanimation in several ways. During cross-examination, CSX questioned Huett\r\nabout the animation's portrayal of the outside lighting, which looked \"muddy,\" and\r\nthe dimness of the train's headlight. CSX also opined that because of the skewed\r\nangle at which the train was approaching, it was unnecessary for Ms. Harvey to\r\nturn her head to the left a full 45 degrees to see the train because her peripheral\r\nvision should have alerted her of the approaching train at 549 feet when the\r\nanimation depicted her looking straight ahead. CSX additionally questioned why\r\nthe animation did not provide the sound of the horn blowing, especially during the\r\nextended period when the animation depicted a view of the opposite side of the\r\ntracks from which the train was approaching.9 Also during cross-examination, and\r\nagain at closing argument, CSX raised questions about the animation's depiction of\r\nMs. Harvey's stop point and the time the animation devoted to her stopping and\r\nlooking left, right, and then proceeding forward (20 seconds). Finally, CSX\r\nquestioned why the animation did not allow a viewer to see when exactly the train\r\ncame into view, but rather focused on the other side of the tracks at the time when\r\nthe train should have become apparent. In sum, CSX's attacks focused on the\r\nanimation's portrayal of the outside lighting, its lack of sound, the duration that the\r\nvan stopped, the camera angle of the tracks as the train approached, and the\r\nmanner in which it portrayed Ms. Harvey turning her head. Notably, CSX did not\r\nquestion Huett's use of photogrammetry or the accuracy of Huett's depiction of the\r\nvegetation bordering the tracks. Therefore, it was not necessary to reveal evidence\r\nof post-accident cutting to the jury to refute the assertions made by CSX's counsel.\r\n\r\n9 Appellant has not provided her animation as an exhibit, and therefore our ability\r\nto understand the reliability claims made by CSX is limited to the words\r\nexchanged at trial.\r\n\nAccordingly, we find the circuit judge did not abuse his discretion in sustaining\r\nCSX's motion to limit reference to Huett's notes.\r\n\r\n      III.   Jury Charge\r\n\r\n      Appellant next argues that the circuit judge committed reversible error by\r\nexcluding the term \"particularly dangerous highway crossing\" when charging the\r\njury on the statute that establishes a driver’s duty to stop at railway crossings. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n      Section 56-5-2715 of the South Carolina Code reads:\r\n\r\n      The Department of Transportation . . . may designate particularly dangerous\r\n      highway grade crossings of railroads and erect stop sign thereat. When\r\n      such signs are erected, the driver of any vehicle shall stop within fifty feet,\r\n      but not less than fifteen feet, from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall\r\n      proceed only upon exercising due care.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2715 (2006). In explaining Ms. Harvey’s duty to stop\r\nunder section 56-5-2715, the circuit judge omitted any reference to the emphasized\r\nlanguage above. Although the colloquy during the charge conference does not\r\nelucidate the circuit judge’s reasoning for striking that language, it appears the\r\njudge was merely searching for a statute that outlined the duty of drivers to stop at\r\nrailway crossings, and the reference to a particularly dangerous railway crossing\r\nmay have unnecessarily misled the jury into believing the Honeyford Road\r\ncrossing was affirmatively designated as a particularly dangerous crossing.\r\n\r\n       We believe it was within the circuit judge's discretion to omit this particular\r\nstatutory language because of its perceived irrelevance to the issue of CSX’s\r\nnegligence and because of the risk of confusing or misleading the jury. Therefore,\r\nwe uphold the circuit judge’s charge on section 56-5-2715.\r\n\r\n      IV.    Survival Action Damages\r\n\r\n       Finally, Appellant argues she is entitled to a new trial absolute or a new trial\r\nnisi additur on the survival action because the circuit judge’s jury charge led the\r\njury to believe Ms. Harvey’s negligence in the wrongful death action should be\r\nimputed to survival action damages. Therefore, Appellant claims, the circuit judge\r\nerred in denying Appellant's post-trial motions for JNOV, new trial absolute, or\r\nnew trial nisi additur. We find that the jury's failure to award damages in the\r\n\nsurvival action was inconsistent with its liability allocation and demonstrated a\r\nlack of understanding or confusion among the jurors. Therefore, we reverse the\r\ncircuit court's denial of Appellant's motion for a new trial nisi additur and remand\r\nthe survival action for a new trial absolute with respect to liability and damages.10\r\n\r\n       This Court recognizes an abuse of discretion standard for reviewing a circuit\r\ncourt's decision to deny a new trial nisi additur. O'Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525,\r\n526–27, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993). It is within a trial judge's province to grant a\r\nnew trial nisi if he finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or\r\nexcessive. Bailey v. Peacock, 318 S.C. 13, 14, 455 S.E.2d 690, 691 (1995). In\r\nreviewing the trial court's decision regarding a new trial nisi, \"[t]his Court has the\r\nduty to review the record and determine whether there has been an abuse of\r\ndiscretion amounting to an error of law.\" Id. \"If the amount of the verdict is\r\ngrossly inadequate or excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice,\r\nor some other influence outside the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial\r\nabsolute.\" O'Neal, 314 S.C. at 527, 431 S.E.2d at 556 (citations omitted) (emphasis\r\nin original). Thus, \"on appeal of the denial of a motion for a new trial nisi, this\r\nCourt will reverse when the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive requiring the\r\ngranting of a new trial absolute.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       The evidence presented at trial established that Decedent experienced\r\nconscious pain and suffering before he died. A driver who witnessed the collision\r\nstated he saw Decedent lying in the brush and \"[h]e looked like he was in a knot,\"\r\nand that \"[h]e was hollering Mama[.]\" Another witness to the scene stated that\r\nDecedent was thrown into some shallow bushes and she \"could hear him you know\r\ngroaning, moaning, pain, of course . . . .\" A volunteer fireman who responded to\r\nthe accident testified, \"He was moaning and then I started—I heard him start\r\ngurgling some. I could tell he was in a lot of pain.\"\r\n\r\n        While charging the jury, the circuit judge initially stated that if the jury\r\nfound Ms. Harvey to be more than fifty percent negligent, \"that would be the end\r\nof it.\" Appellant objected and after some back and forth about whether Decedent's\r\nfather's share of survival damages abated at his death (in the presence of the jury),\r\n\r\n10 We note that section 15-33-125 of the South Carolina prohibits this Court from\r\ndirecting a new trial on damages under these circumstances. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n15-35-125 (Supp. 2011) (\"Unless the plaintiff is entitled to a directed verdict on the\r\nissue of liability, any new trial must include both issues of liability and damages.\");\r\nStokes v. Denmark Emerg. Med. Servs., 315 S.C. 263, 433 S.E.2d 850 (1993)\r\n(upholding the constitutionality of section 15-33-125).\r\n\nthe circuit judge amended the verdict form to instruct the jury to \"[m]ake no\r\nadjustment for the percentage of negligence assigned to Defendant or Frances\r\nHarvey.\" Still, the jury appeared to be unclear about the effect of finding Ms.\r\nHarvey's negligence to be greater than CSX's. During deliberation, the jury sent in\r\nthe question, \"If we answer yes to number six [Ms. Harvey’s negligence being\r\ngreater than fifty percent], do we have to award any amount on number eight?\r\nNumber eight being, of course, conscious pain—survival action.\" The circuit\r\njudge answered, \"The answer is, yes, if you find [Decedent] suffered conscious\r\npain and suffering, no, if you find that [Decedent] did not suffer any conscious\r\npain and suffering.\" Although the jury found CSX to be forty percent negligent in\r\ncausing the accident, the jury found the damages for conscious pain and suffering\r\nand funeral expenses amounted to zero dollars. It is evident to us that the jury was\r\nconfused in rendering its damages award. Aside from Appellant's clear showing at\r\ntrial that Decedent experienced conscious pain and suffering before his death,\r\nAppellant presented funeral and burial receipts representing expenses in excess of\r\n$7,000. Therefore, the award of zero dollars in damages was not \"merely\r\ninadequate,\" but was legally incorrect.\r\n\r\n       In South Carolina, a survival action is governed by statute. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 15-5-90 (1995). Unlike damages in a wrongful death action, which are for the\r\nbenefit of the decedent's family, damages in a survival action are for the benefit of\r\nthe decedent's estate. F. Patrick Hubbard & Robert L. Felix, The South Carolina\r\nLaw of Torts 706 (4th ed. 2011). Thus, a survival claim may only be filed by the\r\npersonal representative of the decedent's estate. Id. Accordingly, the personal\r\nrepresentative stands in the shoes of the decedent, and may bring any cause of\r\naction the decedent could have brought in his life. Id. at 705. Therefore, in\r\ndetermining survival action damages, a court or jury should only consider the\r\nentitlement of the estate, not the identification of its beneficiaries. Accordingly,\r\nwe note that Ms. Harvey's status as a beneficiary cannot be used to impute her\r\ncomparative negligence to the estate.\r\n\r\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court's exclusion of evidence\r\nand its jury charge, but reverse the denial of Appellant's motion for new trial nisi\r\nadditur on the survival action, and remand for a new trial absolute in the survival\r\naction.\r\n\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur but write separately to express my\r\ndifferent view on several issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, I agree that we may not reverse the trial court's ruling that witness\r\nMunn could not be called to testify to the SCDOT's April 2004\r\nrecommendation that active traffic devices be installed at the Honeyford\r\nRoad Crossing because such testimony is barred by 23 U.S.C. § 409 (Supp.\r\n2011). As I read the record, appellant called Munn solely to have him testify\r\nthat \"On April 24, a month prior to this collision, that SCDOT did an\r\nevaluation [and] recommended that gates and lights be installed at the\r\ncrossing.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority holds, however, not only that the SCDOT team's\r\nrecommendation was properly excluded, but also that Munn could not\r\n\"testify about his observations of the Honeyford Road Crossing . . . .\" In my\r\nopinion, no issue regarding Munn's ability to testify to his observations is\r\nproperly before the Court as appellant never sought to elicit this type of\r\nevidence from Munn at trial. It is well-settled that an appellant cannot\r\nchange or add to the arguments he made at trial on appeal. E.g., Morris v.\r\nAnderson County, 349 S.C. 607, 564 S.E.2d 649 (2002). Had appellant in\r\nfact called Munn to testify to his observations, I would find the trial judge's\r\ndenial of that request to be reversible error.\r\nIn my opinion, nothing in either 23 U.S.C. § 409 or Pierce County\r\nWashington v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129 (2003), prohibits an individual who\r\ncompiled or collected data or who participated in the creation of \"reports,\r\nsurveys, schedules, or lists\" for the purposes identified in § 409 from\r\ntestifying as a fact witness. I agree that testimony of the contents of such\r\nreports, surveys, schedules, lists, compilations, or collections or the\r\nadmission into evidence of these documents is prohibited. In Bowman v.\r\nNorfolk Southern Railway Co., 1995 WL 550079 (4th Cir. Sept. 15, 1995),\r\nthe official who had inspected the railroad crossing and produced a § 409\r\nreport was allowed to testify as a \"lay witness\" who had observed the scene,\r\neven being permitted to refresh his recollection by reference to the report. In\r\nHarrison v. Burlington Northern R. Co., 965 F.2d 155 (7th Cir. 1992), the\r\nactual investigative report and recommendations were excluded, as were\r\nwitnesses called to testify to the contents of these documents. In Powers v.\r\n\nCXS Transp., Inc., 177 F.Supp.2d 1276 (S.D. Ala. 2001), the court\r\nspecifically stated, \"It is well settled that a plaintiff may not circumvent\r\nSection 409 by asking a witness to testify to matters the witness learned from\r\ndocuments protected by Section 409 . . . on the other hand, knowledge gained\r\nby the witness independently of material protected by Section 409 is not\r\nprotected. E.g., Rodenbeck v. Norfolk & Western Railway Co., 982 F. Supp.\r\n620, 625 (N.D. Ind. 1997); Palacios v. Louisiana & Delta Railroad Inc., 740\r\nSo.2d 95, 102 (La. 1999).\" Id. at 1280. In short, I am unable to identify any\r\nauthority for the proposition that § 409 prevents an individual from testifying\r\nas a fact witness to his observations. Were this issue before us, I would find\r\nreversible error in this ruling.\r\nAs I read the record, it is clear that Exhibit 134 was admitted into evidence\r\nwithout objection. Insofar as I am aware, an attorney is permitted to argue\r\nthe evidence and its inferences in her closing argument, but I agree with the\r\nmajority that appellant did not show prejudice from this error. See, e.g.,\r\nO'Leary-Payne v. R.R. Hilton Head, II, Inc., 371 S.C. 340, 638 S.E.2d 96 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006).\r\nFurther, I would find no error in the trial judge's redaction of § 56-5-2715 in\r\nhis charge. Whether CSX was negligent in maintaining the sight lines at the\r\nHoneyford Road Crossing is independent of the DOT's determination of the\r\ntype of warning signal to be used at the crossing. Compare, e.g., Doremus v.\r\nAtlantic Coast Line R. Co., 242 S.C. 123, 130 S.E.2d 370 (1963) (common\r\nlaw duty of railroads to give such signals as may be reasonably necessary is\r\nindependent of statutorily required signals). Like the majority, I find no error\r\nin this statutory charge. E.g., Berberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 709 S.E.2d\r\n607 (2011) (reversible error to give confusing jury instructions).\r\n\r\nFinally, while it is unnecessary to address appellant's contention that the trial\r\ncourt erred in denying her request for a new trial nisi additur or new trial\r\nabsolute in the survival action in light of the holding that the confusing\r\nsurvival damages jury instruction mandates reversal, I would take this\r\nopportunity to remind the bench and bar that there is no procedure whereby\r\nan appellate court can order a nisi as a remedy. This is so since the denial of\r\na nisi motion is a matter wholly within the trial court's discretion, and its\r\nruling is not subject to appellate review. E.g., Zorn v. Crawford, 252 S.C.\r\n127, 165 S.E.2d 640 (1969). Where a nisi has been denied, the only new trial\r\n\nrelief an appellate court may grant is a new trial absolute, and then only if it\r\nfinds the jury's verdict is either grossly inadequate or so excessive as to\r\nindicate passion, prejudice, or caprice. Id.; see also O'Neal v. Bowles, 314\r\nS.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993).\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, I concur with the majority's decision to affirm\r\nthe wrongful death appeal and reverse and remand the survival appeal for a\r\nnew trial.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27187","title":"Oskin v.

Oskin, Glenn Small, and Freddie Kanos\r\n(collectively \"Appellants\" or individually by last name) contest the Master-in-\r\nEquity's ruling that the assignment of a note and mortgage on a Myrtle Beach\r\nproperty did not violate the South Carolina Fraudulent Conveyance Statute, S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 27-23-10 (2007) (hereinafter the Statute of Elizabeth), and that a\r\npayment made to South Carolina Bank & Trust (SCB&T) did not result in a pay-\r\noff of the amount due under the note and mortgage. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                         FACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On April 27, 2005, Oskin entered into a contract to broker the sale of Wild\r\nWing Plantation and Golf Course on behalf of Respondent Stephen Mark Johnson\r\n(Johnson). The contract obligated Johnson to pay Oskin a finder's fee in the\r\namount of $1 million upon closing. Oskin found a buyer for the property, and the\r\ndeal was closed on December 15, 2005. Johnson, however, failed to pay the\r\nfinder's fee, and Oskin brought suit successfully obtaining a judgment against\r\nJohnson on December 8, 2008, for breach of contract.\r\n\r\n       While the breach of contract action was pending, Johnson approached his\r\nuncle, Respondent Michael D. Brown (M. Brown), about jointly purchasing an\r\noceanfront lot and home located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. On November\r\n30, 2006, Johnson and M. Brown co-signed a $3.5 million promissory note to\r\njointly purchase the property. The term of the note was two years, and it provided\r\nfor interest-only payments for the first twenty-three months, with a final balloon\r\npayment of the entire amount due on November 30, 2008. Title to the property\r\nwas conveyed to M. Brown and Johnson as tenants in common. In addition to the\r\nSCB&T mortgage, the property was later encumbered in April 2007 by a second\r\nmortgage lien in favor of Ameris Bank in the amount of $500,000.1\r\n\r\n       Initially, Johnson made the monthly interest-only payments on the SCB&T\r\nnote until early 2008 when he could no longer afford to make the payments, at\r\nwhich time M. Brown paid the remaining monthly payments. With the due date on\r\nthe balloon payment approaching, in October 2008, M. Brown contacted Wachovia\r\nBank (Wachovia) to refinance the SCB&T loan. Because of the Myrtle Beach\r\nproperty's low appraisal value, Wachovia refused to issue the loan unless it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   The debt to Ameris Bank remained outstanding at the time of trial.\r\n\nsecured with marketable securities worth $3.5 million. In early November 2008,\r\nM. Brown approached SCB&T in an attempt to reduce the note balance, but the\r\neffort ended in failure.\r\n\r\n        M. Brown was faced with the following dilemma. M. Brown's nephew was\r\nfinancially unable to pay off the $3.5 million loan they had obtained to buy a house\r\nin Myrtle Beach. Because of the recession, the house was appraised at $2.5 to $2.6\r\nmillion, about $1 million less than the debt. M. Brown was a co-owner and co-\r\nobligor on this note. If the note was declared in default and the bank foreclosed,\r\nthe sale of the Myrtle Beach home would not be sufficient to satisfy the\r\noutstanding debt. M. Brown and his wife, Joan Conner Brown, each had extensive\r\nsecurity holdings. However, the stock market was also depressed by the economic\r\ncrisis, and a sale of securities would be at below-value prices.\r\n\r\n       On November 20, 2008, Joan Conner Brown formed J. Conner, LLC (J.\r\nConner). She used this LLC to obtain the Wachovia loan, which would be used to\r\npay off the debt owed to SCB&T without having to liquidate any of her and her\r\nhusband's assets. On December 18, 2009, Wachovia approved the loan to J.\r\nConner in the amount of $3.5 million. J. Conner, whose only member was Joan\r\nBrown, used the loan proceeds it obtained from Wachovia to purchase the note and\r\nmortgage from SCB&T. Wachovia's loan to J. Conner was personally guaranteed\r\nby Joan and M. Brown and secured by five investment accounts owned by M.\r\nBrown and one by Joan Brown. Joan Brown, on behalf of J. Conner, signed the\r\nCertificate of Resolution to Borrow and the Promissory Note. Both Joan and M.\r\nBrown jointly signed the Security Agreement. To complete the transaction,\r\nWachovia wired $3.5 million to SCB&T, and M. Brown paid the remaining\r\n$44,303.31 due to SCB&T by writing a personal check. After receiving full\r\npayment for the purchase of the note, SCB&T assigned the note and mortgage to J.\r\nConner on December 30, 2008.\r\n\n      The assignment of the SCB&T note and mortgage to J. Conner allowed J.\r\nConner to assume SCB&T's priority status as lien creditor. Ameris Bank's\r\n$500,000 lien on the property and Oskin's $1,036,000 judgments2 against Johnson\r\ncontinued to be subordinate to the first lien for $3.5 million obtained by J. Conner.\r\n\r\nThe parties dispute the motive for the formation of J. Conner and the subsequent\r\nassignment of the note. Respondents maintain that they formed J. Conner to\r\nenable Joan Brown and her husband to obtain the Wachovia loan and avoid\r\nforeclosure without having to liquidate any assets since the SCB&T note was\r\nbecoming due and the appraised value of the property was less than the amount\r\nborrowed. In contrast, Appellants assert that \"[t]he only reason J. Conner existed\r\nwas because [M. Brown] was obligated under the note and mortgage and wanted to\r\navoid the Oskin judgment against Johnson.\"3 Appellants claim the transfer\r\nbetween SCB&T and J. Conner was fraudulent under the Statute of Elizabeth.\r\nAdditionally, Appellants attempt to pierce the corporate veil by asserting that M.\r\nBrown is the alter-ego of J. Conner.\r\n\r\n       After a bench trial, the Horry County Master ruled against Appellants on all\r\nclaims, holding: (i) the Statute of Elizabeth did not apply to the assignment of the\r\nnote and mortgage because M. Brown and J. Conner were never indebted to\r\nAppellants, and (ii) even if applicable, the assignment of the note and mortgage did\r\nnot violate the Statute of Elizabeth because no injustice or fraud was perpetrated on\r\nAppellants as a result of the assignment. In addition, the Master held that (iii) the\r\n\r\n2 In addition, to the $1 million judgment, Oskin also became the holder of a\r\nConfession of Judgment in the amount of $36,000 executed by Johnson in favor of\r\nDavid B. O'Connell. Oskin purchased the Confession of Judgment from O'Connell\r\nfor $500 on November 4, 2009, approximately seven months after the Complaint\r\nwas filed.\r\n3 Appellants allege that J. Conner was formed \"as stated by Michael Brown, to\r\nprotect his property asset from the Oskin judgment.\" Going directly to the\r\ntestimony cited, the Record is unclear whether M. Brown actually stated this.\r\nWhen M. Brown was asked whether the \"SCB&T note [ ] prompted borrower to\r\nseek legal advice in dealing with the outstanding liens\" to protect his asset, M.\r\nBrown answered, \"yes.\" However, \"outstanding liens\" might refer to the mortgage\r\non the property owed to SCB&T rather than to the Oskin judgment as Appellants\r\nallege.\r\n\npayments to SCB&T for the assignment did not result in a pay-off of the note nor\r\nthe satisfaction of the mortgage because M. Brown was not the alter-ego of J.\r\nConner and due to a future advances clause, (iv) and even if the payments to\r\nSCB&T resulted in a pay-off of the note, M. Brown was equitably subrogated to\r\nJohnson's interest in the property to the extent of the monies paid by M. Brown in\r\nexcess of his one-half share of the obligations on the note. After the Master denied\r\nAppellants' Rule 59, SCRCP, motion, Appellants filed a timely appeal. This case\r\nis before this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                      ISSUES\r\n\r\n      I.\t    Whether the assignment of the note was a fraudulent \n\r\n             conveyance in violation of the Statute of Elizabeth. \n\r\n\r\n      II.\t   Whether the payment to SCB&T resulted in a pay-off of the\r\n             note and satisfaction of the mortgage.\r\n\r\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      A clear and convincing evidentiary standard governs fraudulent conveyance\r\nclaims brought under the Statute of Elizabeth.4 Windsor Props., Inc. v. Dolphin\r\nHead Constr. Co., 331 S.C. 466, 471, 498 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1998) (citations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Appellants and Respondents relied on dicta in Future Group, II v. Nationsbank,\r\n324 S.C. 89, 97 n.6, 478 S.E.2d 45, 49 n.6 (1996), to conclude the evidentiary\r\nstandard for a fraudulent conveyance under the Statute of Elizabeth is a\r\npreponderance of the evidence standard. Future Group stated in a footnote, \"This\r\ncause of action is an equitable one and on appeal this Court will find facts in\r\naccordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" Id.\r\nNevertheless, our decisions superseding and preceding Future Group have held\r\nthat a clear and convincing evidentiary standard applies to fraudulent conveyances\r\nunder the Statute of Elizabeth, and we reaffirm that standard here. Windsor Props.,\r\nInc. v. Dolphin Head Constr. Co., 331 S.C. 466, 471, 498 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1998)\r\n(citations omitted); Gardner v. Kirven, 184 S.C. 37, 41, 191 S.E. 814, 816 (1937)\r\n(\"The law imposes the burden on the transferee to establish both a valuable\r\nconsideration and the bona fides of the transaction by clear and convincing\r\ntestimony.\").\r\n\nomitted). An action to set aside a conveyance under the Statute of Elizabeth is an\r\nequitable action, and a de novo standard of review applies. Future Group, II, 324\r\nS.C. at 97 n.6, 478 S.E.2d at 49 n.6; S.C. Const. art. V, § 5.\r\n\r\n       An action to pierce the corporate veil under an alter-ego theory also lies in\r\nequity. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. Sherwood Dev. Corp., 374 S.C. 588, 596,\r\n649 S.E.2d 135, 140 (Ct. App. 2007) (citations omitted). Here, the appellate court\r\nhas jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\nof the evidence. Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623\r\n(2001). However, an appellate court is not required to disregard the findings of\r\nfact by the trial court nor ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better position\r\nto assess the credibility of the witnesses. Id.\r\n\r\n                                       ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n                                I. Statute of Elizabeth\r\n\r\n       Appellants claim the assignment of the note was a fraudulent conveyance in\r\nviolation of the Statute of Elizabeth. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The Statute of Elizabeth provides:\r\n\r\n       Every gift, grant, alienation, bargain, transfer, and conveyance of\r\n       lands . . . for any intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or defraud\r\n       creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts,\r\n       accounts, damages, penalties and forfeitures must be deemed and\r\n       taken . . . to be clearly and utterly void . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 27-23-10(A) (2007).\r\n\r\n       In interpreting this statute, this Court has held conveyances shall be set aside\r\nunder two conditions: First, where there was valuable consideration and the\r\ntransfer is made by the grantor with the actual intent to defraud; and, second,\r\nwhere a transfer is made without actual intent to defraud but without valuable\r\nconsideration. Future Group, II, 324 S.C. 89, 96, 478 S.E.2d 45, 48–49 (citations\r\nomitted); McDaniel v. Allen, 265 S.C. 237, 242-43, 217 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1975)\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n      It is undisputed that valuable consideration was paid for the transfer of the\r\nnote and mortgage in this case. Appellants contend that the purpose and the\r\n\nfraudulent intent of M. Brown was to \"structure a transaction relating to the\r\nSCB&T note mortgage in order to protect [M. Brown's] interest in the property\r\nfrom being affected by Oskin's judgments against Johnson and to preclude\r\nAppellants from executing against the property.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The Statute of Elizabeth is concerned with the intent of the grantor who\r\nconveys an interest in land.5 McDaniel, 265 S.C. at 242-43, 217 S.E.2d at 775-76\r\n(requiring that the grantor must have an intent to defraud). Here, the grantor who\r\ntransferred an equitable interest in land to J. Connor was SCB&T, not M. Brown.\r\nThere are no allegations that SCB&T intended to defraud appellants, and we see no\r\nbasis for applying the Statute of Elizabeth.6\r\n\r\n      Thus, we hold Appellants failed to establish by clear and convincing\r\nevidence that the grantor, SCB&T, transferred the note and mortgage with intent to\r\ndefraud Appellants.7 Windsor Props., 331 S.C. at 471, 498 S.E.2d at 860.\r\n\r\n5Even where it is shown that the grantor has fraudulent intent, to \"annul for fraud a\r\ndeed based upon value consideration [under the Statute of Elizabeth], it must not\r\nonly be shown that the grantor intended to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, but it\r\nmust also appear that the grantee participated in such fraudulent act.\" McDaniel,\r\n265 S.C. at 242-43, 217 S.E.2d at 775-76.\r\n6 Even assuming arguendo that we set aside the conveyance from SCB&T to J.\r\nConner as fraudulent under the Statute of Elizabeth, Appellants' priority would not\r\nchange. If this Court were to set aside the conveyance as fraudulent, then the\r\nconveyance would be treated as if it never occurred. Thus, SCB&T would\r\ncontinue to hold the note, and Appellants would remain in their position of third\r\npriority, behind Ameris Bank. See generally Windsor Properties, 331 S.C. at 471,\r\n498 S.E.2d at 860; Future Group, II, 324 S.C. at 98, 478 S.E.2d at 49; Gardner,\r\n184 S.C. at 41, 191 S.E. at 816. At oral argument, Appellants urged that if this\r\nCourt sets aside the conveyance, their priority would improve. Appellants reach\r\nthat end by arguing the SCB&T note would be paid off by the Wachovia loan—the\r\nsame loan that was lent solely for the purpose of the allegedly fraudulent\r\nconveyance. Appellants cite no authorities to support this Court rearranging the\r\npriorities of the parties in such a matter. We find Appellants' position is untenable\r\nbecause, in effect, Appellants want to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent, but\r\nalso benefit from the alleged fraud.\r\n7   Because this is not an intra-family transfer, the burden of proof is on Appellants\r\n\n                       II. Pay-off of Principal Amount Due\r\n\r\n        The Master found the mortgage was not satisfied because (1) J. Conner is\r\nnot the alter-ego of the mortgage guarantor, M. Brown; (2) that assuming arguendo\r\nthat J. Conner is the alter-ego of M. Brown, a future advances clause still precludes\r\na finding that the $3.5 million payment to SCB&T constitutes a pay-off of the note\r\nand satisfaction of the mortgage; (3) and even if the payments to SCB&T results in\r\na \"pay-off\" of the note, Brown's rights and priority would be the same as that of\r\nSCB&T before the assignment under equitable subrogation. We agree that the\r\nmortgage is not satisfied. J. Conner is not the alter-ego of M. Brown because\r\nAppellants have failed to prove that J. Conner was created by fraud, injustice, or in\r\ncontravention of public policy. Based on this finding, we deem it unnecessary to\r\nreach the issue of the future advances clause and equitable subrogation. See Futch\r\nv. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n(1999) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior\r\nissue is dispositive).8\r\n\r\nrather than Respondents. See n. 7, supra.\r\n8 We do not reach the issue of the future advances clause, and we do not decide\r\nwhether the mortgage here is a valid open-ended mortgage. However, in cases\r\ndealing with valid open-ended mortgages, lest our silence be taken for agreement,\r\nwe do not concur with the dissent's position that a future advances clause \"has no\r\npractical effect\" if \"SCB&T has made no future advances . . . . and there is nothing\r\nfor the future advances clause to secure.\" Central Production's statements that\r\n\"the mortgage did not die\" and that it remained \"dormant but viable\" means plainly\r\nthat the mortgage is not satisfied even if there is \"no debt for it to secure.\" Cent.\r\nProd. Credit Ass'n v. Page, 268 S.C. 1, 8, 231 S.E.2d 210, 214 (1977). To hold\r\notherwise would be contrary to section 29-3-50 of the South Carolina Code,\r\nlegislative intent, and the express language of Central Production. Id.; S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 29-3-50 (2007) (\"There is nothing express or implied, in the statute to infer\r\nthat it was the intent of the legislature that the mortgage be dead once there is no\r\ndebt momentarily existing . . . . A holding that an open-end mortgage dies when\r\nthere is currently no debt for it to secure, would severely limit its beneficial use\r\nand defeat the legislative intent.\") (emphasis added). Grounds available for lines\r\nof credit (future advances in modern parlance) are commonly secured by\r\nmortgages. Quite often, the line of credit will sit unused for a considerable period\r\nof time. The fact that there is no current credit balance does not discharge the\r\n\n                                       Alter-Ego\r\n\r\n       Appellants attempt to pierce the corporate veil by contending that J. Conner\r\nis the alter-ego of M. Brown, and any payments made by J. Conner to SCB&T, in\r\neffect, were payments made by M. Brown resulting in the payoff of the note and\r\nsatisfaction of the mortgage. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       An alter-ego theory requires a showing of (1) total domination and control of\r\none entity by another and (2) inequitable consequences caused thereby. Colleton\r\nCnty. Taxpayers Ass'n v. Sch. Dist. of Colleton Cnty., 371 S.C. 224, 237, 638\r\nS.E.2d 685, 692 (2006). Control may be shown where the subservient entity\r\nmanifests no separate interest of its own and functions solely to achieve the goals\r\nof the dominant entity. Id. (citation omitted). This theory does not apply,\r\nhowever, in the absence of fraud, injustice, or contravention of public policy. Id.\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n      We find that even under a preponderance of the evidence standard, the\r\nrecognition of J. Conner as an entity would not promote fraud, injustice, or\r\ncontravene public policy. Id. Appellants fail to satisfy the required elements of\r\nfraud. See First State Savings & Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 446–47, 385\r\nS.E.2d 821, 824 (1989) (listing nine elements of fraud). The evidence does not\r\ndemonstrate any false material representation on Respondents' part, and Joan\r\n\r\n\r\nmortgage or the right to draw on the line of credit. Consequently, if the mortgage\r\ndoes not die, then it is not satisfied and thus, has a \"practical effect\" when the issue\r\nof whether a mortgage is satisfied is at stake. Id. As to whether the rule stated in\r\nCentral Production promotes \"absurdity,\" we note that the rule has been a bedrock\r\nand standard of the mortgage industry for decades. There is no evidence that it has\r\nundermined consumer protection or destabilized the industry. To the contrary:\r\n\r\n      Mortgages to secure future advances serve a socially and\r\n      economically desirable purpose . . . . The mortgagor saves interest on\r\n      the surplus until ready to use it. He also avoids the expense and\r\n      inconvenience of refinancing the mortgage so as to include the\r\n      additional needed sum, or, in the alternative, of executing a second\r\n      and later mortgage for each new advance, with the attendant expenses.\r\n\r\nCent. Prod., 268 S.C. at 7, 231 S.E.2d at 213.\r\n\nBrown and her husband have no legal or fiduciary relationship with Appellants.\r\nId. In addition, no injustice or contravention of public policy resulted from Joan\r\nBrown's control of J. Conner. Joan Brown's purpose in creating J. Conner was to\r\nsecure her and her husband's bona fide claim rather than to defraud Appellants.\r\nIn the face of collapsing property prices, below-value prices for securities, and an\r\nimpending balloon payment, Joan Brown and her husband did what was natural to\r\nprotect their bona fide interest in their property without having to liquidate assets.9\r\nAs with any other wise consumers or investors, they are free to utilize a legal\r\nmechanism to protect their own financial interests. There is no inequity or fraud in\r\nthis instance where the priorities of Appellants do not change, and Appellants are\r\nleft no worse off than had SCB&T foreclosed on the property.10 We are cognizant\r\n\r\n9 The Record shows that M. Brown and his wife had other reasons beyond Oskin's\r\njudgment to structure the transaction as they did. The term of the note was two\r\nyears, and it provided for interest-only payments for the first twenty-three months,\r\nwith a final balloon payment due on November 30, 2008. As this due date\r\napproached, the value of the property plummeted from $3.5 million to $2.5–2.6\r\nmillion in the midst of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. Appellants claimed during\r\noral argument that foreclosure is a \"red herring,\" noting that M. Brown never\r\ncontemplated allowing the property to go into foreclosure. This misses the point.\r\nM. Brown had to pay the impending balloon payment somehow whether it was\r\nthrough liquidating assets he owned or through obtaining a loan from a financial\r\ninstitution, or he would face the prospect of foreclosure (whether he contemplated\r\nit or not). M. Brown chose not to liquidate any of his own assets and persuaded his\r\nwife to form J. Conner to obtain the Wachovia loan. As Jim Boyd and John Lee\r\nScott, respectively bankers from SCB&T and Wachovia Bank, testified, rather than\r\nconstituting fraud, it was \"common business practice\" to form an LLC for the\r\npurpose of purchasing, holding, and enforcing negotiable instruments.\r\n10Prior to the assignment, Appellants' judgments were subordinate to the $3.5\r\nmillion SCB&T first mortgage and the $500,000 second mortgage to Ameris Bank.\r\nDue to the low appraisal value and the large mortgage owed, Brown's property was\r\n\"under water.\" If the assignment had not occurred, the Browns chose not to\r\nliquidate any of their assets, and SCB&T had foreclosed on the note and mortgage,\r\nAppellants' interest in the property would have been extinguished because SCB&T\r\nhad priority. There is no inequity or fraud if the priorities of Appellants do not\r\nchange. In seeking to set aside the conveyance, we believe Appellants seek a\r\nsuperior priority that they were never guaranteed or necessarily entitled to.\r\n\nof the fact that entities can use legal mechanisms to achieve fraudulent ends,11 but\r\nweighing the totality of the evidence, we find the preponderance of the evidence\r\ndoes not support Appellants' allegations of fraud, injustice, or contravention of\r\npublic policy in the face of the Browns' action to protect their bona fide interest in\r\ntheir property.\r\n\r\n      Thus, we refuse to pierce the corporate veil, and Appellants' alter-ego claim\r\nnecessarily fails. See Baker v. Equitable Leasing Corp., 275 S.C. 359, 367, 271\r\nS.E.2d 596, 600 (1980) (Rejecting the alter-ego theory because \"'piercing the\r\ncorporate veil' is not a doctrine to be applied without substantial reflection.\").\r\n\r\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.

Montgomery, 193 S.C. 118, 131, 7 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1940).\r\n\n      JUSTICE HEARN: Respectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part.\r\nWhile I ultimately agree with the majority that the Statute of Elizabeth cannot be\r\ninvoked to set aside this assignment, I believe the majority adopts too narrow a\r\nview of the statute in the process. Furthermore, I disagree with the majority's\r\nconclusion that Robert Oskin, Glenn Small, and Freddie Kanos (collectively,\r\nAppellants), have not shown that J. Conner, LLC was the alter-ego of Michael\r\nBrown. I would therefore hold that J. Conner's payment to South Carolina Bank\r\nand Trust (SCB&T) satisfied the note and mortgage.\r\n\r\n                                         I\r\n\r\n       I first turn to the facts and structure of the transaction under review.\r\nAppellants are various holders of judgments against Stephen Mark Johnson.\r\nBefore Appellants reduced their claims to judgments, Johnson purchased ocean-\r\nfront property in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for $3.5 million. Because Johnson\r\nwas unable to obtain the necessary financing to purchase the property on his own,\r\nBrown, who is Johnson's uncle, agreed to co-sign a note from SCB&T and\r\npurchase the property jointly. The term of the note was two years, and the note\r\nprovided for interest-only payments for the first twenty-three months followed by a\r\nfinal balloon payment. In connection with the note, Brown and Johnson granted\r\nSCB&T a first mortgage.12\r\n\r\n       Shortly before the final balloon payment became due, Brown approached\r\nSCB&T to inquire about assigning the note and mortgage to him. SCB&T\r\ninformed Brown that such a transaction was not possible because it would amount\r\nto a payoff of the note and nothing would remain to assign. SCB&T also refused\r\nto extend the note's term. Out of options, Brown's wife, Joan Conner Brown,\r\nformed J. Conner, a limited liability company of which she is the only member, for\r\nthe sole purpose of acquiring and holding SCB&T's note and mortgage. To\r\naccomplish this, J. Conner obtained a $3.5 million loan from Wachovia Bank and\r\nused the proceeds to purchase the note and mortgage from SCB&T; title to the\r\nproperty remained in Johnson and Brown. By virtue of this transaction, J. Conner\r\nstepped into the shoes of SCB&T and assumed its superior priority position with\r\nrespect to the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n12The property was later encumbered by a $500,000 second mortgage in favor of\r\nAmeris Bank, which also attached prior to Appellants' judgments. This debt\r\nremained outstanding at the time of trial.\r\n\n       By the time Appellants obtained judgments against Johnson, he was\r\ninsolvent save for this property. However, so long as J. Conner has priority over\r\nAppellants, they effectively are precluded from forcing a judicial sale of the\r\nproperty to satisfy their judgments.13 Seeking a set-aside of the assignment, or a\r\nfinding that J. Conner was Brown's alter-ego and J. Conner's payment to SCB&T\r\ntherefore satisfied the note and mortgage, Appellants filed the instant declaratory\r\njudgment action against Brown, Joan Conner Brown, Johnson, and J. Conner\r\n(collectively, Respondents).             II\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, the majority errs by holding we can look only to the intent of\r\na grantor when determining whether the Statue of Elizabeth would set aside a\r\nconveyance. While I agree that the vast majority of cases will involve an\r\nunscrupulous grantor, I do not believe that we are required to only examine his\r\nintent. Instead, I would review the transaction as a whole for whether it was\r\ndesigned to defraud another. Nevertheless, even under this standard I do not\r\nbelieve Appellants have met their burden.\r\n\r\n       As a threshold matter, I will quickly dispense with Respondents' first\r\nargument that the Statute of Elizabeth is inapplicable because it only concerns\r\nthose in a debtor-creditor relationship. Our codification of the Statute of Elizabeth\r\nprovides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      Every gift, grant, alienation, bargain, transfer, and conveyance of\r\n      lands . . . or other profit or charge14 out of the same . . . which may be\r\n      had or made to or for any intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or\r\n      defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful . . . debts . . .\r\n      must be deemed and taken . . . to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate\r\n\r\n13 This is a matter of simple mathematics. At the time of the assignment, the\r\nproperty's value was between $2.5 and $2.6 million. The principal on the note,\r\nhowever, was approximately $3.5 million when it was assigned to J. Conner, and\r\nBrown and Johnson have made no payments on it. Thus, even assuming the\r\nproperty fetched its full market value at a judgment sale, every penny of the\r\nproceeds would go towards paying off this note and a deficiency would still\r\nremain. Nothing would be left for Appellants.\r\n14 A \"charge\" in this context means \"[a]n encumbrance, lien, or claim.\" Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary 97 (3d pocket ed. 2006).\r\n\n      and of no effect, any pretense, color, feigned consideration,\r\n      expressing of use, or any other matter or thing to the contrary\r\n      notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 27-23-10 (2007) (footnote and emphasis added). In Lebowitz v.\r\nMudd, 293 S.C. 49, 358 S.E.2d 698 (1987), we expressly held that a debtor-\r\ncreditor relationship is not necessary to trigger the statute based on the language\r\nthat it applies to \"creditors [and] others.\" Id. at 52, 358 S.E.2d at 700. Although I\r\nacknowledge that some of our other cases have referred to a debtor-creditor\r\nrelationship, they are unremarkable because they actually did involve a debtor and\r\na creditor. Nothing in our jurisprudence undermines the validity of Lebowitz, and\r\nthe plain statutory language underpinning that decision has not changed.\r\nRespondents' argument therefore is meritless.\r\n\r\n        The majority holds that the applicability of the Statute of Elizabeth turns on\r\nthe grantor's intent and not the general intent behind the transaction. This holding,\r\nhowever, suffers from the same flaws as Respondents' first argument. First, the\r\nstatute contains no such limitation. Instead, it only refers to the intent of the\r\ntransaction itself, not the specific intent of the grantor. See S.C. Code Ann. § 27-\r\n23-10 (\"Every gift, grant, alienation, bargain, transfer, and conveyance of lands . . .\r\nor other profit or charge out of the same . . . which may be had or made to or for\r\nany intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors and others of their just\r\nand lawful . . . debts . . . .\"). Second, just as with Lebowitz, the fact that some of\r\nour cases discuss the intent of the grantor does not mean his intent controls. Those\r\ncases merely demonstrate that the grantor's intent was an issue in them. Instead, it\r\nis the language of the statute which controls.\r\n\r\n       I am wary of judicially engrafting a limitation onto a statute rather than\r\naccording the statute its plain meaning, especially when doing so has the very real\r\npotential to thwart its purpose. See Gay v. Ariail, 381 S.C. 341, 344, 673 S.E.2d\r\n418, 420 (2009) (\"In interpreting statutes, the Court looks to the plain meaning of\r\nthe statute and the intent of the Legislature.\"). It has long been the rule that \"[t]he\r\nstatute 13th of Elizabeth,15 protecting creditors and others from fraudulent\r\nconveyances, is to be construed liberally in favor of the class of persons designed\r\nto be protected from fraud.\" Gibson v. Love, 4 Fla. 217, 217 (1851) (emphasis\r\n\r\n15This particular Statute of Elizabeth is commonly referred to as the Statute of 13\r\n(or 13th) Elizabeth because it was enacted during the thirteenth year of Queen\r\nElizabeth I's reign. 13 Eliz. 1, c 5.\r\n\nremoved, footnote added); see also Duncan v. Freeman, 110 S.E. 5, 6 (Ga. 1921)\r\n(\"Although the statute is strict, and even penal, the courts have given a liberal\r\nconstruction to its provisions.\"). Under the majority's interpretation, an individual\r\ncan goad an innocent grantor into conveying an interest in property to defraud\r\nanother with impunity. Despite being the sort of transaction the Statute of\r\nElizabeth was designed to remedy, the majority sanctions it simply because the\r\nperson perpetrating the fraud was not the grantor. I can see no defensible reason\r\nwhy the very ill sought to be prevented by the Statute of Elizabeth should be\r\nperpetuated by virtue of such an unsupported technicality.\r\n\r\n      I am also not persuaded by Respondents' assertion that Appellants' claim is\r\nnot viable because the assignment in question was accomplished by legal means\r\nand is a common business practice. The facial legality of the conveyance should\r\nhave no bearing on whether it was intended to defraud another. Suggesting\r\notherwise ignores the reality that entities can use perfectly legal transactions to\r\nachieve nefarious ends. Indeed, we have already rejected this very argument:\r\n\r\n      If the elements necessary to set aside a transfer for fraud are shown,\r\n      the legality in other respects of the means by which the design is\r\n      accomplished affords no defence [sic]. It is the fraudulent purpose\r\n      and the injurious result, not the form of the transaction nor the\r\n      illegality or irregularity of the instrument, or the means used for its\r\n      accomplishment, which render such transactions voidable at the\r\n      instance of a person injured thereby.\r\n\r\nMatthews v. Montgomery, 193 S.C. 118, 131, 7 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1940). I\r\naccordingly would place no weight on the fact that, on its face, the assignment may\r\nhave been common business practice and legal.\r\n\r\n       As to whether Brown actually intended to defraud Appellants or hinder the\r\ncollection of their judgments, I agree with the majority that Appellants have not\r\nmet their burden. The heart of Appellants' contention is that Respondents\r\nstructured the transaction in such a way that a $3.5 million lien with priority over\r\nAppellants' judgments would remain on the property. If this result was\r\naccomplished, Appellants would, for all intents and purposes, be precluded from\r\ncollecting. Conversely, if this lien was extinguished and Appellants forced a sale\r\nof the property, Brown would lose most of his investment in a multi-million dollar\r\nasset. Thus, the only way Brown could secure his own interest in the property was\r\nto ensure Appellants could not execute.\r\n\n       Respondents counter by contending the assignment was done to secure J.\r\nConner's \"[b]ona fide claims . . . as purchaser of the $3.5 million note and\r\nmortgage from SCB&T.\" This position is untenable, however, because J. Conner\r\nonly obtained its interest in the note and mortgage through the allegedly fraudulent\r\nassignment. In other words, J. Conner had no interest to protect until the\r\nassignment took place.       Respondents' reliance on McDaniel v. Allen, 265 S.C.\r\n237, 217 S.E.2d 773 (1975), to support their contention therefore is unavailing. In\r\nMcDaniel, we found the conveyance of property from husband to wife was not\r\ndone to defraud the husband's creditors but instead to protect the wife's bona fide\r\ninterest in the subject property because she already had one. See id. at 241-44, 217\r\nS.E.2d at 775-76. J. Conner, in contrast, had no interest it could protect prior to the\r\nassignment.\r\n\r\n       Yet there is evidence that the note and mortgage were assigned to J. Conner\r\nin order to protect Brown's investment in the face of a slumping real estate market,\r\nnot to defraud Appellants. The thrust of the argument is that it is not fiscally\r\nresponsible to make the SCB&T balloon payment of approximately $3.5 million\r\nfor an asset worth $2.5-$2.6 million, particularly when Brown would have to suffer\r\nfurther losses when liquidating the assets necessary to complete the payoff. Thus,\r\nextending the term of the note by assigning it to a holder simply insulates Brown\r\nfrom the drop in the property's value precipitated by the general decline in the real\r\nestate market. However, the transaction undeniably had the concomitant effect of\r\npreventing Appellants from collecting on their judgments, and the distinction\r\nbetween protecting one's interest in property in a down market and insulating it\r\nfrom a judgment is tenuous and fraught with precarious implications for judgment\r\nholders like Appellants. Still, while I am troubled by many aspects of the\r\nassignment, I cannot conclude that Appellants have shown the requisite intent by\r\nclear and convincing evidence.16 I therefore concur in the result reached by the\r\nmajority on this issue.\r\n\r\n16 The majority indicates that even if the conveyance was set aside under the\r\nStatute of Elizabeth, the error would be harmless because Appellants' priority\r\nwould not change. I respectfully disagree because while SCB&T would now be\r\nthe holder of the note, the majority ignores Brown's unequivocal testimony that\r\nforeclosure \"was never an option\" and he was \"going to make sure [SCB&T] got\r\npaid.\" Hence, Brown would not suffer foreclosure and the SCB&T note would be\r\npaid off in full. With the $3.5 million lien with first priority out of the picture,\r\nAppellants would be in a position to realistically recover. Thus, any error in our\r\ndecision cannot possibly be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Wells v.\r\n\n                                        III\n\r\n\r\n       However, I do not join in the majority's conclusion that J. Conner was not\r\nBrown's alter-ego.17 An alter-ego claim \"requires a showing of total domination\r\nand control of one entity by another.\" Colleton Cnty. Taxpayers Ass'n v. Sch. Dist.\r\nof Colleton Cnty., 371 S.C. 224, 237, 638 S.E.2d 685, 692 (2006). \"Control may\r\nbe shown where the subservient entity manifests no separate interest of its own and\r\nfunctions solely to achieve the goals of the dominant entity.\" Id. Regardless, \"this\r\ntheory does not apply in the absence of fraud or misuse of control by the dominant\r\nentity which results in some injustice.\" Id.; see also Baker v. Equitable Leasing\r\nCorp., 275 S.C. 359, 367-68, 271 S.E.2d 596, 600 (1980) (holding that the alter-\r\nego theory should be used only when retaining separate \"personalities would\r\npromote fraud, wrong, or injustice or contravene public policy\").\r\n\r\n       Turning to the first part of the analysis, J. Conner's operating agreement\r\nexpressly states its purpose is \"to acquire that certain note and mortgage currently\r\nheld by South Carolina Bank and Trust, N.A. from Michael D[.] Brown and\r\nStephen Mark Johnson and secured by that certain mortgage of the same date.\"\r\nTrue to this purpose, the note and mortgage are the only assets of J. Conner.\r\nMoreover, Brown testified that J. Conner never would have been organized but for\r\nthe need to assign the note away from SCB&T. In fact, J. Conner was created right\r\nafter SCB&T rebuffed Brown's attempt to assign the note to himself. J. Conner\r\ntherefore exists solely to do what Brown himself could not do: hold the note.18\r\n\r\nHalyard, 341 S.C. 234, 237, 533 S.E.2d 341, 343 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"An alleged \n\r\nerror is harmless if the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that \n\r\nthe alleged error did not contribute to the verdict.\"). \n\r\n17 The alter-ego theory is a means of piercing the corporate veil. Drury Dev. Corp. \n\r\nv. Found. Ins. Co., 380 S.C. 97, 101 n.1, 668 S.E.2d 798, 800 n.1 (2008). Piercing\r\nthe corporate veil of an LLC has not yet been recognized in this State, however.\r\nNevertheless, because neither the majority, the parties, nor the master raise this\r\nquestion, I will discuss Appellants' alter-ego claim assuming arguendo it applies.\r\n18 Respondents also argue Appellants' alter-ego claim fails because J. Conner's\r\nonly member is Brown's wife and, incredibly, she is \"an independent woman.\"\r\nRespondents' ascription of relevance to any independence Joan Conner Brown may\r\nhave had is specious. Even if she did have the financial and personal wherewithal\r\nto be independent, that is irrelevant because J. Conner was formed solely to protect\r\none of Brown's assets, not one of hers. Moreover, it completely ignores the fact\r\n\n       As to whether this arrangement would promote fraud or injustice, the fact\r\nthat Appellants may have failed to prove intent to defraud or hinder by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence has no bearing on whether they have shown fraud or injustice\r\nby a preponderance of the evidence, as required here. See Mid-S. Mgmt. Co. v.\r\nSherwood Dev. Corp, 374 S.C. 588, 596, 649 S.E.2d 135, 140 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n(applying preponderance of the evidence standard to veil piercing claim).\r\nAlthough the evidence may not be clear and convincing, I believe the\r\npreponderance of the evidence shows J. Conner was formed to ensure a $3.5\r\nmillion lien retained first priority on the property. This would keep Appellants\r\nfrom forcing a sale of it and thereby prevent Brown from losing his investment.\r\nThis orchestrated effort to prevent the collection of valid judgments is a clear\r\ninjustice. Moreover, as explained above, Appellants' priority was affected by the\r\nassignment and it is of no moment that the means used were facially legal or a\r\ncommon business practice.\r\n\r\n       For those reasons, I would hold that J. Conner was the alter-ego of Brown.\r\nThus, J. Conner's payment to SCB&T was, in actuality, a payment by Brown. As a\r\nco-obligor of the note, this payment should have satisfied it. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n36-3-602(b) (Supp. 2011). There still remains a question, however, of whether\r\nBrown also would have been able to satisfy the mortgage due to a future advances\r\nclause in it. The mortgage Brown and Johnson granted SCB&T provides, \"The\r\nlien of this Security Instrument shall secure the existing indebtedness under the\r\nNote and any future advances made under this Security Instrument.\" Relying on\r\nour decision in Central Production Credit Ass'n v. Page, 268 S.C. 1, 231 S.E.2d\r\n210 (1977), Respondents argue the mere presence of a future advances clause\r\nprecludes a finding that the mortgage is satisfied and prevents Appellants from\r\ncollecting on their debts. I do not believe the future advances clause has any\r\nbearing on this case.\r\n\r\n       In Central Production, we held that a future advances clause meant \"the\r\nmortgage did not die\" once the initial debt was discharged, and thus it remains\r\n\"dormant but viable.\" Id. at 8, 231 S.E.2d at 214. Accordingly, the mortgage in\r\nquestion was able to secure funds loaned after the debtor paid off the original debt\r\nin full. Id. Here, SCB&T has made no future advances. Hence, at this point in\r\ntime, there is nothing for the future advances clause to secure. Unless and until\r\n\r\nthat a wife, irrespective of her own assets, has an interest in her husband's financial\r\nwell-being.\r\n\nSCB&T loans additional funds, the clause simply has no practical effect even\r\nthough the mortgage technically is not satisfied. This is so because while SCB&T\r\nmay have first priority, it is entitled to no money and therefore just steps out of\r\nAppellants' way if they foreclose on their judgment liens. A future advances\r\nclause can only reduce the amount available for other creditors when a lender\r\nactually loans money under the clause and there is an outstanding balance at the\r\ntime of sale. Because that has yet to happen here, any failure to satisfy the\r\nmortgage due to the future advances clause has no bearing on the present case.\r\n\r\n       Although the majority professes to not reach this question, it strenuously\r\ndisagrees that such a mortgage has no effect. The majority's theme is that my\r\nconclusion is contrary to Central Production and the statute specifically permitting\r\nthese clauses, Section 29-3-50 of the South Carolina Code (2007). However, in\r\nmy opinion, Central Production was correctly decided and remains good law, and\r\nthese clauses are an essential tool for many business and individuals. However,\r\nthat does not change the fact that a dormant-yet-viable mortgage which secures\r\nnothing has no practical effect when the property is sold. Nothing in either Central\r\nProduction or section 29-3-50 says otherwise. By giving the clause efficacy in\r\nthese situations, a debtor can maintain a zero-balance mortgage with a future\r\nadvances clause on property in order to completely prevent junior lienholders from\r\never collecting.19 In my view, the absurdity of concluding a dormant mortgage\r\nwhich secures no debt reduces the amount available for junior creditors is obvious.\r\nI cannot in good conscience join in such a result, especially under our equity\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n     In any event, the majority erroneously overlooks the fact that the future\r\nadvances clause cannot apply here due to the terms of the agreement. SCB&T's\r\nmortgage secures \"the existing indebtedness under the Note and any future\r\nadvances made under this Security Instrument.\" The agreement further provides,\r\n\r\n19 For example, take the majority's illustration of an unused line of credit,\r\npresumably secured by a first lien on certain property. If the debtor owes no\r\nmoney under it and it sits unused, then there is nothing to collect. Heretofore,\r\nupon foreclosure of a junior lien this secured party would step up to the plate, take\r\nnothing (because that is what he is owed), and then move aside for the other\r\ncreditors. Beginning today, however, that same secured party who is entitled to\r\nabsolutely nothing can stand in the way of everyone else. An astute debtor\r\ntherefore can simply take out a line of credit, never draw on it, and shut out all\r\njunior lienors.\r\n\nhowever, that \"[u]pon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument,\r\nthis Security Instrument shall become null and void. Lender shall release this\r\nSecurity Instrument.\" The parties therefore have contractually limited the scope of\r\nthe future advances clause, and it is not the open-ended agreement examined in\r\nCentral Production. See id. at 6, 231 S.E.2d at 212–13 (reciting mortgage\r\nprovisions examined). Because J. Conner was Brown's alter-ego, Brown paid the\r\nexisting indebtedness in full. Additionally, no evidence exists of any future\r\nadvances made under the mortgage by SCB&T. Thus, all sums secured by the\r\nmortgage have been paid and the mortgage by its terms has been satisfied.\r\n\r\n                                        IV\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, although I disagree with the majority's limitation\r\non the Statute of Elizabeth, I agree that we should not set aside the assignment\r\nbecause Appellants have not shown intent to defraud or hinder by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence. However, I would find J. Conner was the alter-ego of\r\nBrown, and therefore J. Conner's payment to SCB&T satisfied the note and the\r\nmortgage. I accordingly would affirm as modified in part and reverse in part.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I join section II of Justice Hearn's part concurrence,\r\npart dissent.

Appellant argues that he\r\nshould not be held liable for a loan closed by a person acting on his behalf under a\r\npower of attorney. Appellant alleges, inter alia, that Bank did not conduct\r\nreasonable due diligence and did not verify Appellant's ability to pay. He filed a\r\nmotion seeking additional time for discovery. The master-in-equity (the master)\r\ndenied the motion and ruled in Bank's favor. Appellant now appeals this decision\r\n\narguing that summary judgment was improper and that the master should have\r\npermitted additional time for discovery. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                       FACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      Appellant, a New York investor, was 26 years old when he purchased\r\nproperty located at 10 Indigo Plantation Drive in Beaufort County, South Carolina\r\n(the Hilton Head Property) to \"build a house, sell a house, make a profit.\"\r\n\r\n       Appellant's ill-fated investment began when a friend introduced him to Steve\r\nCorba. Corba informed Appellant about real estate opportunities in Hilton Head,\r\nSouth Carolina, and convinced Appellant to borrow money to invest in\r\ndevelopment of such properties. Through Corba, Appellant hired Sally Gardocki,\r\nan attorney in Hilton Head, and gave her a power of attorney to obtain financing\r\nfor the Hilton Head Property. On August 23, 2007, Gardocki executed and\r\ndelivered a written promissory note on Appellant's behalf to obtain a $1.6 million\r\nloan from Bank. Appellant would later claim that Gardocki acted beyond the\r\nscope of her power of attorney in obtaining the loan. However, Appellant\r\nacknowledged that when he signed a document entitled, \"Limited Power of\r\nAttorney,\" he understood that Gardocki \"would proceed with the closing on the\r\nproperty.\" He also admitted that Gardocki sent him the file containing relevant\r\nloan documents after the closing, and that he reviewed the files without raising any\r\nobjections. In addition, Gardocki testified that she made Appellant \"aware of the\r\nform and content of the closing documents . . ., and he approved the same and\r\nauthorized the closing. Appellant only raised concerns about the transaction when\r\nhe realized the \"the property wouldn't sell.\" He now claims that the income and\r\ntax information provided on his loan application were false, and Bank should have\r\ndenied him the loan.\r\n\r\n       After closing the loan, Appellant used the proceeds to construct a residence\r\non the Hilton Head Property. Blair Witkowski, who was also introduced to\r\nAppellant through Corba, coordinated the construction of the house with\r\nAppellant's apparent knowledge and approval. Once built, the Hilton Head\r\nProperty failed to sell, and Appellant sought a loan modification because he could\r\nnot afford his monthly mortgage payments.\r\n\r\n      On May 6, 2008, Appellant executed and delivered a loan modification,\r\nwhich was recorded on June 27, 2008. Appellant defaulted on his obligations\r\nunder the loan modification, and Bank provided Appellant with a notice of default\r\nand the right to cure. Appellant did not cure the default, and on August 24, 2009,\r\n\nBank sought to enforce the note and foreclose on the mortgage. On May 14, 2010,\r\na consent order was entered that bifurcated the trial of the mortgage foreclosure\r\naction and Bank's claim for a deficiency judgment. The trial of the foreclosure was\r\nheld on June 25, 2010, and resulted in an Order of Judgment and Foreclosure in the\r\namount of $1,834,504.41. On August 2, 2010, the subject property was thereafter\r\nsold to Bank at a foreclosure sale for $650,000.\r\n\r\n       On November 10, 2010, the parties entered into a consent scheduling order,\r\nrequiring Appellant and Bank to complete discovery by February 15, 2011. On\r\nMarch 15, 2011, Bank filed its motion for summary judgment. On May 2, 2011,\r\nafter the deadline for discovery had passed, Appellant filed a motion seeking\r\nadditional time for discovery and continuance of bank's motion. The master denied\r\nAppellant's request, and on June 2, 2011, granted summary judgment to Bank.\r\nAppellant filed a timely appeal, and this Court certified this case pursuant to Rule\r\n204(b), SCACR.                         ISSUES\r\n\r\n      I.\t    Whether the master correctly granted summary judgment in\r\n             determining whether Bank was negligent in processing\r\n             Appellant's loan application and verifying his ability to pay.\r\n\r\n      II.\t   Whether the master correctly denied Appellant's motion seeking\r\n             to extend the time for discovery and to continue Bank's motion\r\n             for summary judgment\r\n\r\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"When reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\napplies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP.\" Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002)\r\n(citation omitted). \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\r\nissue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.\"\r\nId. To withstand a motion for summary judgment \"in cases applying the\r\npreponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\nrequired to submit a mere scintilla of evidence.\" Hancock v. Mid–South Mgmt.\r\nCo., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009). In cases requiring a\r\nheightened burden of proof, the non-moving party must submit more than a mere\r\nscintilla of evidence. Id. at 330–31, 673 S.E.2d at 803.\r\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n                                   I. Negligence\r\n\r\n       Appellant claims summary judgment was inappropriate because the bank\r\nwas negligent in processing and discovering false information about Appellant's\r\nincome contained in the loan application, which would have made Appellant\r\nineligible for a loan. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Negligence is the breach of a duty of care owed to the plaintiff by the\r\ndefendant. Bell v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 202 S.C. 160, 181, 24 S.E.2d 177, 186\r\n(1943); Crawford v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 179 S.C. 264, 270, 184 S.E. 569, 571\r\n(1936). To state a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must allege facts\r\nwhich demonstrate: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant; (2) a breach of that\r\nduty by a negligent act or omission; (3) a negligent act or omission resulted in\r\ndamages to the plaintiff; and (4) that damages proximately resulted from the\r\nbreach of duty. Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002);\r\nKleckley v. Nw. Nat'l Cas. Co., 338 S.C. 131, 138, 526 S.E.2d 218, 221 (2000). In\r\ndetermining whether a particular act is negligent, the test depends on what a person\r\nof ordinary reason and prudence would do under those circumstances at that time\r\nand place. Berberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 287, 709 S.E.2d 607, 612 (2011).\r\n\r\n        As an initial matter, we must determine whether Bank owes Appellant a duty\r\nof care in the processing of a loan application. We find Bank does not owe\r\nAppellant a duty of care under these facts. In Citizens & Southern National Bank\r\nof South Carolina v. Lanford, 313 S.C. 540, 545, 443 S.E.2d 549, 551 (1994), this\r\nCourt held the bank did not owe a duty to tell the guarantor of a loan that his\r\nliability was for the entire loan amount. We explained, \"The law does not impose a\r\nduty on the bank to explain to an individual what [she] could learn from simply\r\nreading the document.\" Similarly in Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648,\r\n668–70, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442–44 (Ct. App. 2003), the court of appeals upheld the\r\ndismissal of a negligence claim against the bank because the appellant in that case\r\nhad the opportunity to read the documents she signed, and in not doing so, failed to\r\nexercise reasonable diligence in protecting her own interests.\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, Appellant admitted that Gardocki, his attorney, sent him\r\nthe file containing the relevant loan documents, and that he reviewed the files\r\nwithout raising objections. Appellant's admission was corroborated by Gardocki\r\nwho testified:\r\n\n      Mr. Stalliard was made aware of the form and content of the closing\r\n      documents, including but not limited to the Note, Mortgage and HUD-\r\n      1 Closing Statement, and Alphonse Stalliard approved the same and\r\n      authorized the closing.\r\n      ....  At no time since then has Alphonse Stalliard ever contacted me\r\n      and raised any question, issue or complaint concerning the form or\r\n      content of the closing documents . . . or the mortgage loan through\r\n      [Bank].\r\n\r\n       Indeed, Appellant only perceived problems with the transaction when he\r\nrealized the \"the property wouldn't sell.\" Furthermore, the master found that\r\nAppellant expressly ratified the loan he obtained on August 23, 2007, by executing\r\nand delivering the loan modification agreement on May 6, 2008.1 Appellant had\r\nmany opportunities to correct false information submitted to Bank by persons he\r\nauthorized, and he failed to do so. We find under these factual circumstances,\r\nBank does not owe Appellant a duty of care.2 Lanford, 313 S.C. at 545, 443\r\nS.E.2d at 551; Regions Bank, 354 S.C. at 668–70, 582 S.E.2d at 442–44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The loan modification contains the following express affirmation of the validity\r\nof the debt owing from Appellant to Bank:\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, Borrower is justly indebted unto lender as evidenced by a\r\n      Promissory Note dated AUGUST 23, 2007, in the original principal\r\n      sum of ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100\r\n      Dollars ($1,600,000.00), which Note bears interest at the original rate\r\n      of SIX AND SEVEN TENTHS percent (6.700%) per annum and which\r\n      Note provides for payment in full on SEPTEMBER 1, 2031 . . . .\r\n2 Even if we had held that Bank owed Appellant a duty of care, it would be\r\nquestionable whether Appellant can prove causation under these circumstances.\r\nThe Record demonstrates that Appellant had many opportunities to correct false\r\ninformation submitted on his behalf by persons authorized by him under a valid\r\npower of attorney, and he failed to do so. Consequently, Appellant, rather than\r\nBank, appears to be the cause-in-fact and proximate cause of his own harm.\r\n\n      Thus, the master properly granted summary judgment on the issue of\r\nnegligence.3               II. Denial of Motion to Enlarge\r\n\r\n      Appellant argues that the master should have granted Appellant's motion to\r\nenlarge the time for discovery and continue Bank's summary judgment motion. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n      In this case, the deadline for discovery was February 15, 2011. On March\r\n15, 2011, Bank filed and served its Motion for Summary Judgment. On May 2,\r\n2011, more than two months after the discovery deadline had passed, Appellant\r\nmoved to extend the time for discovery and to continue Bank's summary judgment\r\nmotion.The Record indicates that Appellant had ample time during discovery to\r\nuncover evidence and speak with any potential witnesses from Bank. If Appellant\r\nbelieved he did not have sufficient time, Appellant should have promptly filed a\r\nmotion seeking additional discovery time. Instead, Appellant waited until after\r\nBank filed a summary judgment motion and two months after the deadline for\r\ndiscovery expired to request an extension. In addition, Appellant did not provide\r\naffidavits to support allegations he made in requesting a discovery extension or\r\nsubmit an affidavit stating why he was unable to obtain such affidavits. See Rule\r\n56(e), (f), SCRCP.4\r\n\r\n3 When discussing negligence, Appellant also accused Bank in a conclusory\r\nmanner of having unclean hands and behaving unconscionably. We deem such\r\nconclusory and unsupported claims abandoned. See In the Matter of the Care and\r\nTreatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (holding an\r\nissue is deemed abandoned if the argument in the brief is not supported by\r\nauthority or is only conclusory). Furthermore, even if the issues are preserved, the\r\nRecord does not support Appellant's allegations that the Bank had unclean hands or\r\nacted unconscionably.\r\n4   Rule 56(e), SCRCP provides:\r\n\r\n        When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as\r\n        provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere\r\n        allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or\r\n\n      Thus, we hold that the master properly denied Appellant's motion.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the master's grant of summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts\r\n      showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so\r\n      respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). If the party opposing the motion for summary judgment cannot\r\nprovide affidavits to justify his opposition, he must submit an affidavit providing\r\nreasons why such affidavit cannot be obtained. Rule 56(f), SCRCP. In opposing\r\nsummary judgment and requesting an extension, Appellant presented allegations\r\nunsupported by an affidavit. Specifically, Appellant claims his counsel contacted\r\nan unidentified material witness, said to be previously unavailable. Based on a\r\ntelephone interview with this material witness, Appellant's counsel learned of\r\nadditional information and potential witnesses who worked for Bank, who might\r\nbe useful in testifying about what Bank did to verify information contained on the\r\nloan application.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27189","title":"Harleysville Mutual v.

Act No. 26, 2011 S.C.\r\nActs 88 [hereinafter Act. No. 26]. We hold that the retroactivity clause of Act No.\r\n261 violates the Contract Clauses of the state and federal Constitutions, and that the\r\nstatute may only apply prospectively to CGL insurance contracts executed on or\r\nafter its effective date of May 17, 2011.           FACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       On January 7, 2011, this Court issued an initial opinion in Crossmann\r\nCommunities of North Carolina, Inc. v. Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company,\r\nOp. No. 26909 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 7, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 32)\r\n(Crossmann I), wherein it addressed the definition of \"occurrence\" in a CGL\r\npolicy. In Crossman I, the Court held where \"occurrence\" is defined as \"an\r\naccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same\r\ngeneral harmful conditions,\" the term is unambiguous and retains its inherent\r\nfortuity requirement. Crossmann I at 46. Based on this determination, this Court\r\nfound that Respondents Crossmann Communities of North Carolina, Inc. and\r\nBeazer Homes Investment Corporation (collectively Crossmann) were not entitled\r\n                                                            \r\n1 Act. No. 26 is codified at S.C. Code Ann. § 38-61-70 (Supp. 2011). The\r\nretroactivity clause of Act No. 26 provides, \"This section applies to any pending or\r\nfuture dispute over coverage that would otherwise be affected by this section as to\r\nall commercial general liability policies issued in the past, currently in existence,\r\nor issued in the future.\" Id.\r\n\nto coverage under Petitioner's CGL policy for claims arising out of damage to\r\ncondominiums caused by faulty workmanship. Id. at 47.\r\n      Specifically, this Court reasoned that because \"the damage to the insured's\r\nproperty [was] no more than the natural and probable consequences of faulty\r\nworkmanship,\" there was \"no fortuity element present under this factual scenario.\"\r\nId. The Court elaborated that, \"[f]or faulty workmanship to give rise to potential\r\ncoverage, the faulty workmanship must result in an occurrence, that is, an\r\nunintended, unforeseen, fortuitous, or injurious event.\" Id. at 49. In so ruling, this\r\nCourt overruled its earlier decision in Auto-Owners Insurance Company v.\r\nNewman, 385 S.C. 187, 684 S.E.2d 541 (2009), on the ground that the Newman\r\nopinion \"permitted coverage for faulty workmanship that directly causes further\r\ndamage to property in the absence of an 'occurrence' with its fortuity\r\nunderpinnings.\" Id.\r\n      On January 26, 2011, the General Assembly introduced Senate Bill 431,\r\nwhich was subsequently passed as Act No. 26 of the South Carolina Acts and Joint\r\nResolutions and ratified on May 17, 2011 upon the Governor's signature. Act No.\r\n26 was codified as section 38-61-70 of the South Carolina Code and provides in\r\nrelevant parts:\r\n      (B) Commercial general liability insurance policies shall contain or be\r\n      deemed to contain a definition of \"occurrence\" that includes:\r\n             (1) an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to\r\n             substantially the same general harmful conditions; and\r\n             (2) property damage or bodily injury resulting from faulty\r\n             workmanship, exclusive of the faulty workmanship itself.\r\n      ....\r\n      (E) This section applies to any pending or future dispute over\r\n      coverage that would otherwise be affected by this section as to all\r\n      commercial general liability insurance policies issued in the past,\r\n      currently in existence, or issued in the future.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-61-70 (Supp. 2011).\r\n      On May 23, 2011, this Court heard arguments on the petition for rehearing\r\nin Crossmann I. That same day, Petitioner filed a Petition for Original Jurisdiction\r\nin which it sought a declaration by this Court that Act No. 26 is unconstitutional.\r\nThis Court granted the petition on July 7, 2011.\r\n\n        On August 22, 2011, this Court changed its initial position in Crossmann I\r\nand found in favor of coverage based on an \"occurrence.\" See Crossmann Cmtys.\r\nof N.C., Inc. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 395 S.C. 40, 717 S.E.2d 589 (2011)\r\n(Crossmann II).2 In doing so, the Court reaffirmed its decision in Newman and\r\nclarified that \"negligent or defective construction resulting in damage to otherwise\r\nnon-defective components may constitute 'property damage,' but defective\r\nconstruction would not.\" Id. at 50, 717 S.E.2d at 594. The Court further found\r\nthat, \"the expanded definition of 'occurrence' is ambiguous and must be construed\r\nin favor of the insured, and the facts of the instant case trigger the insuring\r\nlanguage of Harleysville's policies.\" Id.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"This Court has a very limited scope of review in cases involving a\r\nconstitutional challenge to a statute.\" Joytime Distribs. & Amusement Co. v. State,\r\n                                                            \r\n2 We use the abbreviations Crossman I and Crossman II for ease of reference in\r\nreferring to the procedural history of this case. In doing so, we do not suggest that\r\nCrossman II reverses Crossman I or that there are two separate opinions from this\r\nCourt. An opinion of an appellate court is not final until the remittitur is filed in\r\nthe lower court. See, e.g., Brackenbrook North Charleston, LP v. Cnty. of\r\nCharleston, 366 S.C. 503, 623 S.E.2d 91 (2005). The timely filing of a petition for\r\nrehearing stays the sending of the remittitur, thereby depriving the decision of\r\nfinality. See State v. Hallock, 277 S.C. 413, 288 S.E.2d 398 (1982). Crossman I\r\nwas neither final nor enforceable because the remittitur was stayed. After this\r\nCourt granted rehearing and the parties reargued the case, we filed Crossman II\r\nand sent the remittitur. Consequently, Crossman II is the only decision of this\r\nCourt.\r\n\n338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999). \"All statutes are presumed\r\nconstitutional and will, if possible, be construed so as to render them valid.\" Id.\r\n\"A legislative enactment will be declared unconstitutional only when its invalidity\r\nappears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it violates a\r\nprovision of the constitution.\" Id.  ANALYSIS\r\n                         I. Separation of Powers Doctrine\r\n\r\n       Petitioner implores this Court to \"strike down\" Act No. 26 on the ground the\r\nGeneral Assembly was without authority to create legislation which attempts to\r\noverturn and directly control this Court's ultimate decision in Crossmann II.\r\nPetitioner contends that in adopting the current version of Act No. 26, the General\r\nAssembly violated the doctrine of separation of powers.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of separation of powers is succinctly stated in our constitution:\r\n\r\n      In the government of this State, the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\n      powers of the government shall be forever separate and distinct from\r\n      each other, and no person or persons exercising the functions of one\r\n      of said departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. I, § 8. The operational effect of this doctrine is to prevent one\r\nbranch of government from usurping the power and authority of another. Knotts v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 348 S.C. 1, 7, 558 S.E.2d 511, 514 (2002).\r\n\r\n       In explaining this constitutional provision in the context of statutory\r\ninterpretation, the Court has stated, \"The construction of a statute is a judicial\r\nfunction and responsibility.\" Lindsay v. Nat'l Old Line Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 621, 628,\r\n207 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1974). \"Subject to constitutional limitations, the legislature has\r\nplenary power to amend a statute. However, a judicial [interpretation] of a statute\r\nis determinative of its meaning and effect, and any subsequent legislative\r\namendment to the contrary will only be effective from the date of its enactment\r\nand cannot be applied retroactively.\" Id. at 629, 207 S.E.2d at 78; see Steinke v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing, & Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999)\r\n(concluding the General Assembly could not retroactively overrule this Court's\r\ninterpretation of a statute, but noting that the General Assembly may resolve\r\nstatutory conflict in future cases).\r\n\n       We find that the General Assembly did not violate the doctrine of separation\r\nof powers by enacting Act No. 26. As evidenced by the procedural and legislative\r\nhistory, it is clear the General Assembly wrote and ratified Act No. 26 in direct\r\nresponse to this Court's decision in Crossmann I. Had Crossmann I been this\r\nCourt's final opinion, the doctrine might have been implicated. However, given\r\nthat in Crossmann II we revised our initial decision in Crossman I, we do not find\r\nthat the General Assembly, in this instance, retroactively overruled this Court's\r\ninterpretation of a statute. Any concern about Act No. 26's retroactive provision is\r\nbest analyzed under a Contract Clause framework, which we address in Part III of\r\nthis opinion.                              II. Special Legislation and Equal Protection\r\n\r\n       Petitioner next contends this Court should invalidate Act No. 26 as \"special\r\nlegislation\" because it \"is narrowly drafted to favor only a small section of one\r\nparticular industry.\" Specifically, Petitioner claims Act No. 26 expands coverage\r\nfor \"construction professionals\" performing \"construction related work\" under a\r\nCGL insurance policy, \"but would not provide the same for a non-construction\r\nprofessional under an identical CGL insurance contract.\"\r\n\r\n       In a related argument, Petitioner asserts that Act No. 26 violates the Equal\r\nProtection Clause by \"classifying and treating issuers of CGL policies differently\r\nthan issuers of other types of insurance policies that make an 'occurrence' a\r\nprerequisite to coverage.\" Additionally, Petitioner argues that the \"newly imposed\r\ndefinition of 'occurrence' applies only to certain CGL policies that insure a\r\nconstruction professional for liability arising from construction-related work.\"\r\nUltimately, Petitioner claims there is no rational basis to warrant this differential\r\ntreatment.3\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n3 In support of this position, Petitioner relies on Broome v. Truluck, 270 S.C. 227,\r\n241 S.E.2d 739 (1978). In Broome, this Court found a statute violated equal\r\nprotection as it granted immunity from suit after ten years to \"architects, engineers,\r\nand contractors\" engaged in the improvement of real property but not to owners\r\nand manufacturers of the components that went into the construction. We find\r\nBroome distinguishable as the statute in that case provided immunity from suit to\r\nan exclusive group of individuals involved in the same property. Here, the General\r\nAssembly did not single out a particular group for preferential treatment but,\r\ninstead, broadly covered the entire construction industry and construction\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\n       With respect to the prohibition against special legislation, our state\r\nconstitution provides, \"The General Assembly of this State shall not enact local or\r\nspecial laws . . . where a general law can be made applicable.\" S.C. Const. art. III,\r\n§ 34, cl. IX. \"The purpose of the prohibition on special legislation is to make\r\nuniform where possible the statutory laws of this State in order to avoid duplicative\r\nor conflicting laws on the same subject.\" Med. Soc'y of S.C. v. Med. Univ. of S.C.,\r\n334 S.C. 270, 279, 513 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1999).\r\n       Similarly, the Equal Protection Clauses of our federal and state constitutions\r\ndeclare that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const.\r\namend. XIV, § 1; S.C. Const. art. I, § 3. \"Courts generally analyze equal\r\nprotection challenges under one of three standards: (1) rational basis; (2)\r\nintermediate scrutiny; or, (3) strict scrutiny.\" Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston,\r\n359 S.C. 85, 91, 596 S.E.2d 917, 920 (2004). \"If the classification does not\r\nimplicate a suspect class or abridge a fundamental right, the rational basis test is\r\nused.\" Id. \"Under the rational basis test, the requirements of equal protection are\r\nsatisfied when: (1) the classification bears a reasonable relation to the legislative\r\npurpose sought to be affected; (2) the members of the class are treated alike under\r\nsimilar circumstances and conditions; and, (3) the classification rests on some\r\nreasonable basis.\" Id.\r\n      Recently, this Court reiterated the framework established in Kizer v. Clark,\r\n360 S.C. 86, 600 S.E.2d 529 (2004), to determine whether special legislation exists\r\nand to assess potential equal protection violations. Cabiness v. Town of James\r\nIsland, 393 S.C. 176, 712 S.E.2d 416 (2011). In Cabiness, this Court explained:\r\n\r\n              When a statute is challenged on the ground that it is special\r\n      legislation, the first step is to identify the class of persons to whom the\r\n      legislation applies. Kizer, 360 S.C. at 92–93, 600 S.E.2d at 532. In\r\n      this regard, our special legislation framework largely tracts that for\r\n      determining whether a statute violates one's right to equal protection.\r\n      Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 533. If the statute treats all class members\r\n      equally, then the law is general legislation and permissible. Id. at 92–\r\n      93, 600 S.E.2d at 532. The law must be general both in form and in\r\n      operation. Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 532.\r\n\r\n             If the legislation does not apply uniformly, the second step is to\r\n      determine the basis for that classification. Id. It is well-settled that\r\n      the mere fact a statute creates a classification does not render it\r\n      unconstitutional special legislation. Id. Rather, it is only arbitrary\r\n      classifications with no reasonable hypothesis to support them that are\r\n\n      prohibited. Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 533. Again, this parallels our\r\n      analysis under the rational basis test for equal protection challenges.\r\n      A classification is constitutional \"if some intrinsic reason exists why\r\n      the law should operate upon some and not upon all, or should affect\r\n      some differently than others,\" or the special law \"best meet[s] the\r\n      exigencies of a particular situation.\" Id.\r\nCabiness, 393 S.C. at 189, 712 S.E.2d at 423. \"The General Assembly must have a\r\nlogical basis and sound reason for resorting to special legislation.\" Med. Soc'y of\r\nS.C., 334 S.C. at 279, 513 S.E.2d at 357. \"We will not declare a statute\r\nunconstitutional as a special law unless its repugnance to the Constitution is clear\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id.\r\n       As a threshold matter, we question whether a special legislation analysis is\r\napplicable given Act No. 26 appears to be a general law in that it uniformly\r\napplies to all construction CGL insurance policies issued in South Carolina and,\r\nthus, is not \"special\" in the prohibited sense. Based on our review of the legislative\r\nhistory, it appears Act No. 26 was drafted as the result of lobbyists' efforts to\r\ncombat the effects of Crossmann I. This, however, did not transform Act No. 26\r\ninto special legislation. See Kizer, 360 S.C. at 93 n.1, 600 S.E.2d at 532 n.1\r\n(\"[T]he fact that a law was enacted as a result of lobbying does not transform it\r\ninto special legislation.\"). Nevertheless, to the extent that Act No. 26 can plausibly\r\nbe construed as special legislation, we have included a discussion of Petitioner's\r\nclaim in conjunction with the equal protection issue.\r\n       Initially, we disagree with Petitioner's bare assertion that the Court should\r\nemploy a \"strict scrutiny\" analysis. We conclude a \"rational basis\" test is\r\napplicable for a determination of whether Act No. 26 constitutes special legislation\r\nor violates the Equal Protection Clauses. We find that Act No. 26 withstands this\r\nminimal level of scrutiny as we believe the General Assembly had a logical reason\r\nand sound basis for enacting this provision.\r\n       It is well-established that the insurance industry is highly regulated by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. As evidenced by this Court's discussion in Crossmann II,\r\ninsurance coverage for construction liability lacks clarity and has been the subject\r\nof significant litigation, particularly with respect to whether construction defects\r\nconstitute \"occurrences\" under CGL insurance policies. By ratifying Act No. 26,\r\nthe General Assembly properly exercised its authority in an attempt to definitively\r\nresolve or at least minimize this frequently-litigated issue.\r\n     In order to address this limited area of insurance law, our state General\r\nAssembly promulgated a law that meets the exigencies of this situation and is\r\n\nconsistent with prior and recent decisions of this Court. Thus, in this instance, we\r\nfind that Act No. 26 does not constitute special legislation or violate equal\r\nprotection.                     III. Contract Clause\r\n\r\n      Finally, Petitioner argues that the retroactive application of Act No. 26 is\r\nunconstitutional in that such application violates the state and federal Contract\r\nClauses. We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina's constitution provides:\r\n      No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, law impairing the obligation\r\n      of contracts, nor law granting any title of nobility or hereditary\r\n      emolument, shall be passed, and no conviction shall work corruption\r\n      of blood or forfeiture of estate.\r\nS.C. Const. art. I, § 4 (emphasis added); see also U.S. Const. art. I § 10 (also\r\nprohibiting the impairment of contracts). To establish a Contract Clause violation,\r\nthe Court must examine \"(1) whether there is a contractual relationship; (2)\r\nwhether the change in the law impairs that contractual relationship; and whether\r\nthe impairment is substantial.\" Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 93, 533 S.E.2d 578,\r\n585 (2000) (citing Gen. Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181 (1992)).\r\n       It is undisputed a contractual relationship existed. Thus, we must ask\r\nwhether the statute, as applied retroactively, substantially impairs insurance\r\ncontracts. We hold that Act No. 26 substantially impairs the contractual\r\nrelationship by mandating that all CGL policies be legislatively amended to\r\ninclude a new statutory definition of occurrence and by applying this mandate\r\nretroactively. While the dissent believes the new provision merely clarifies\r\nexisting law, we find the statute fundamentally changes the definition of\r\noccurrence.\r\n      In Newman, this Court suggested \"that a CGL policy may provide coverage\r\nwhere faulty workmanship causes third party bodily injury or damage to other\r\nproperty besides the defective work product\" leaving open the possibility there\r\nmay be instances where coverage might not be provided. 385 S.C. at 193, 684\r\nS.E.2d at 544 (emphasis added); see also Crossmann, 395 S.C. at 50 n.6, 717\r\nS.E.2d at 594 n.6 (holding \"we elect to adhere to our precedent in Newman\"). In\r\ndoing so, Newman examined the interaction of the traditional definition of\r\noccurrence with the faulty workmanship exclusion in the insurance contract.\r\nOccurrence, as we confirmed in Crossmann II, traditionally means an \"accident\" or\r\n\na \"continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful\r\nconditions.\" Crossmann, 395 S.C. at 47, 717 S.E.2d at 592; Newman, 385 S.C. at\r\n192, 684 S.E.2d at 543. Here, however, the legislature has rewritten and expanded\r\nthe traditional definition of occurrence to also mandate the inclusion of faulty\r\nworkmanship:\r\n      Commercial general liability insurance policies shall contain or be\r\n      deemed to contain a definition of \"occurrence\" that includes:\r\n      ….\r\n      (2) property damage or bodily injury resulting from faulty \n\r\n      workmanship, exclusive of the faulty workmanship itself. \n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-61-70 (emphasis added). While we hold that it is within the\r\nlegislature's power to statutorily define the meaning of \"occurrence,\" it violates the\r\nContract Clause to apply this new definition retroactively as it substantially impairs\r\npre-existing contracts by materially changing their terms. Hodges, 341 S.C. at 94,\r\n533 S.E.2d at 585–86 (holding \"[f]or purposes of Contract Clause analysis, a\r\nstatute can be said to impair a contract when it alters the reasonable expectations of\r\nthe contracting parties\"); Henry v. Alexander, 186 S.C. 17, 194 S.E. 649 (1937)\r\n(holding a deviation from the terms of a contract constitutes an impairment of\r\ncontract); Superior Motors, Inc. v. Winnebago Indus., Inc., 359 F. Supp. 773, 777\r\n(D.S.C. 1973) (stating impairment of contract occurs when legislation \"attempts to\r\nmake material alterations in the character, terms or the legal effect of an existing\r\ncontract\").\r\n        Because we hold that Act No. 26 substantially impairs Petitioner's\r\ncontractual rights, the next question is whether the Act is reasonable and necessary\r\nto effectuate a legitimate legislative purpose. Ken Moorhead Oil Co. v. Federated\r\nMut. Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 532, 545, 476 S.E.2d 481, 488–89 (1996). \"Traditional\r\nanalysis of reasonableness and necessity focuses on such issues as (1) whether an\r\nemergency exists justifying the impairment; (2) whether the law was enacted to\r\nprotect a basic societal interest, rather than a favored group; (3) whether the law is\r\nnarrowly tailored to the emergency at hand; (4) whether the imposed conditions are\r\nreasonable; and (5) whether the law is limited to the duration of the emergency.\"\r\nId. Considering these factors and given the lengthy and drawn out history of\r\nlitigation in this area, we cannot conclude that the General Assembly needed to\r\nenact Act No. 26 in order to address a pressing emergency. Consequently, the\r\nretroactivity provision is neither necessary nor reasonable, and therefore, we hold it\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\n       As a result of our holding above, we sever the unconstitutional portion from\r\nthe body of the statute, which \"remains complete in itself, wholly independent of\r\nthat which is rejected, and is of such a character that it may fairly be presumed the\r\nlegislature would have passed it independent of that which conflicts with the\r\nconstitution.\"4 Joytime Distribs. & Amusement Co., 338 S.C. 634, 648–49, 528\r\nS.E.2d 647, 654 (1999).                                        CONCLUSION\r\n       Thus, while we find that Act No. 26 of the South Carolina Acts and Joint\r\nResolutions does not violate the separation of powers doctrine, is not\r\nunconstitutional special legislation and does not deprive Petitioner of equal\r\nprotection, we hold the retroactivity provision of Act No. 26 unconstitutional in\r\nviolation of the state and federal Contract Clauses. Act No. 26 may only apply\r\nprospectively to contracts executed on or after its effective date of May 17, 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ACT DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n      KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in\r\npart and dissenting in part in a separate opinion. PLEICONES, J., has filed a\r\nseparate opinion concurring with the opinion of Justice Beatty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n4 The Amici Curiae also assert that Act No. 26 violates the principles of federalism\r\nand the Commerce Clause. Specifically, they contend that Act No. 26 may affect\r\nessential terms of insurance agreements entered in other states. To the extent that\r\nAct No. 26 is not limited to South Carolina, they claim the General Assembly\r\nimproperly imposed its \"public policy objections to the application of traditional\r\noccurrence definitions to construction cases involving faulty workmanship, on\r\nsister states.\" We find several procedural barriers prevent the Amici from\r\npresenting this argument. The Amici lack standing to assert their challenge, and\r\ntheir claim is not ripe for review as they posit a hypothetical scenario, which\r\nPetitioner does not raise and which may not come to fruition. See James v. Anne's\r\nInc., 390 S.C. 188, 193, 701 S.E.2d 730, 732 (2010) (recognizing that\r\n\"[j]usticiability encompasses several doctrines, including ripeness, mootness, and\r\nstanding,\" and precluding amici from raising an issue not raised by the named\r\nparty under Rule 213, SCACR).\r\n\n       JUSTICE BEATTY (concurring in part and dissenting in part): I agree\r\nwith the majority's findings that Act No. 26 does not violate the separation of\r\npowers doctrine, is not unconstitutional special legislation, and does not deprive\r\nPetitioner of equal protection. Furthermore, I agree with the majority's resolution\r\nof Petitioner's arguments regarding the principles of federalism and the Commerce\r\nClause. I, however, respectfully dissent as to the majority's holding that the\r\nretroactivity provision of Act No. 26 violates the state and federal Contract\r\nClauses. I find no violation and would declare Act No. 26 constitutional in both\r\nsubstance and application.    I.    Contract Clauses\r\n\r\n      Petitioner urges this Court to declare Act No. 26 invalid as the state and\r\nfederal Contract Clauses render it unconstitutional. Petitioner is primarily\r\nconcerned with the provision of the statute that states, \"This section applies to any\r\npending or future dispute over coverage that would otherwise be affected by this\r\nsection as to all commercial general liability insurance policies issued in the past,\r\ncurrently in existence, or issued in the future.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 38-61-70(E)\r\n(Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n        Petitioner asserts the Act substantially impairs the contractual rights of the\r\nparties to existing contracts because Act No. 26 expands the meaning of the term\r\n\"occurrence\" and increases the risk that insurers previously agreed to insure.\r\nPetitioner further contends this interference with private contracts was not a\r\njustified exercise of legislative authority as there was no legitimate public purpose\r\nfor the Act. Instead, Petitioner avers that Act No. 26 was \"passed merely to suit\r\nthe needs of a particularized sub-section of an industry by retroactively changing\r\nthe bargain for which those particular insureds originally contracted.\"\r\n\r\n       At least facially, Petitioner's claim seems meritorious as Act No. 26\r\nexpressly provides for its retroactive application, which is generally disfavored due\r\nto the potential unfairness to the contracting parties. However, as will be\r\ndiscussed, I find that Act No. 26 is not an unconstitutional \"retrospective law\" as it\r\nconstitutes a clarification, through codification, of extant law.\r\n\n                         a.    Retrospective Legislation\r\n\r\n      Retrospective laws have been analyzed as follows:\r\n\r\n             One modern definition of a \"retrospective law,\" often cited, is\r\n      that every statute which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired\r\n      under existing laws or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty,\r\n      or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations\r\n      already passed is a retrospective statute. Legislation is considered\r\n      retroactive if its application determines the legal significance of acts\r\n      or events that occurred prior to the statute's effective date. A statute\r\n      does not operate \"retrospectively\" merely because it is applied in a\r\n      case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment or upsets\r\n      expectations based in prior law; instead, a court must ask whether the\r\n      new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed\r\n      before its enactment.\r\n\r\n             The mere fact that a statute has a retrospective application does\r\n      not necessarily render it unconstitutional. For instance, a statute that\r\n      merely clarifies rather than changes existing law does not operate\r\n      retrospectively even if it is applied to transactions predating its\r\n      enactment. The retroactive nature of clarifying legislation has limits\r\n      and must not operate in a manner that would unjustly abrogate \"vested\r\n      rights.\" However, retroactive legislation presents problems of\r\n      unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective\r\n      legislation because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations\r\n      and upset settled transactions.\r\n\r\n16B Am. Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 735 (2009) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis\r\nadded).Applying the above-definitions, I find that Act No. 26 merely: (1) clarified\r\nthis Court's decisions in L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire and Marine Insurance\r\nCompany, 366 S.C. 117, 621 S.E.2d 33 (2005) and Auto-Owners Insurance\r\nCompany v. Newman, 385 S.C. 187, 684 S.E.2d 541 (2009); and (2) preemptively\r\ncodified Crossmann.\r\n\n       In analyzing the definition of \"occurrence\" in a CGL policy, this Court in L-\r\nJ adhered to the majority rule that \"faulty workmanship standing alone, resulting in\r\ndamage only to the work product itself, does not constitute an occurrence under a\r\nCGL policy.\" L-J, Inc., 366 S.C. at 121, 621 S.E.2d at 35. The Court reasoned\r\nthat \"faulty workmanship is not something that is typically caused by an accident\r\nor by exposure to the same general harmful conditions.\" Id. at 123, 621 S.E.2d at\r\n36. The Court noted that a \"CGL policy may, however, provide coverage in cases\r\nwhere faulty workmanship causes a third party bodily injury or damage to other\r\nproperty, not in cases where faulty workmanship damages the work product\r\nalone.\" Id. at 123 n.4, 621 S.E.2d at 36 n.4.\r\n\r\n       Four years later, the Court decided Newman wherein it relied on the analysis\r\nin L-J and found that a \"subcontractor's negligence resulted in an 'occurrence'\r\nfalling within the CGL policy's initial grant of coverage for the resulting 'property\r\ndamage' to the [home].\" Newman, 385 S.C. at 194, 684 S.E.2d at 545. In so\r\nruling, the Court gave effect to the subcontractor exception to the \"your work\"\r\nexclusion in the standard CGL policy and recognized that this exclusion did not\r\napply \"if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was\r\nperformed on [policyholder's behalf] by a subcontractor.\" Id. at 195, 684 S.E.2d at\r\n545.  As noted by the majority, the Court in Crossmann reaffirmed its decision in\r\nNewman and clarified that \"negligent or defective construction resulting in damage\r\nto otherwise non-defective components may constitute 'property damage,' but the\r\ndefective construction would not.\" Crossmann, 395 S.C. at 50, 717 S.E.2d at 594.\r\n\r\n       In comparison, Act No. 26 defines \"occurrence,\" to include \"property\r\ndamage or bodily injury resulting from faulty workmanship, exclusive of the faulty\r\nworkmanship itself.\" Thus, I find the definition in Act No. 26 is indistinguishable\r\nfrom those espoused by this Court in L-J, Newman, and Crossmann. Because Act\r\nNo. 26 merely clarifies rather than changes existing law, it does not operate\r\nretrospectively even though it is applied to transactions predating its enactment.\r\nThus, I conclude the retroactive application of the Act does not render it\r\nunconstitutional as a retrospective law. See Segars v. Gomez, 360 F. Supp. 50, 53\r\n(D.S.C. 1972) (discussing retroactivity and recognizing that the General Assembly\r\n\"may ratify and validate any past act which it could originally have authorized\r\nprovided it still has the power to authorize it, and its authorization does not impair\r\nvested rights\"); Moore v. Stills, 307 S.W.3d 71, 81 (Ky. 2010) (recognizing that\r\nstatutory amendments that clarify existing law or codify judicial precedent do not\r\ncome within the rule against retroactive legislation as \"such amendments do not\r\n\nimpair rights a party possessed when he or she acted or give past conduct or\r\ntransactions new substantive legal consequences\").5            b.   Existing Contracts\r\n\r\n       Even if Act No. 26 is deemed clarifying legislation, Petitioner claims the\r\nexpress retroactivity provision of Act No. 26 operates to abrogate the parties'\r\nvested rights. Thus, Petitioner advocates for this Court to sever the provision from\r\nthe Act. In analyzing Petitioner's argument that Act No. 26 impermissibly impairs\r\nexisting contracts, I turn to a discussion of our state and federal Contract Clauses.\r\n\r\n       In restricting powers of the states, the United States Constitution provides\r\nthat, \"No state shall . . . pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts.\"\r\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1. Our state constitution contains a similar provision.\r\nS.C. Const. art. I. § 4. Accordingly, this Court has followed federal precedent\r\nconstruing the federal Contract Clause in analyzing the Contract Clause of the\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution. Ken Moorhead Oil Co. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co.,\r\n323 S.C. 532, 476 S.E.2d 481 (1996).\r\n\r\n      \"The general purpose of the Contract Clause is to encourage trade and credit\r\nby promoting confidence in the stability of contractual obligations. While the\r\nClause prohibits the government from arbitrarily impairing the obligations of\r\n                                                            \r\n5 Because the definition of \"occurrence\" in section 38-61-70 clearly gives effect to\r\nour decisions in L-J and Newman and preemptively codified our decision in\r\nCrossmann, I believe the majority mischaracterizes the General Assembly's\r\nenactment of section 38-61-70 as a \"fundamental change\" in the definition of\r\noccurrence in standard CGL policies as there is no evidence to support such a\r\nconclusion. It is evident the General Assembly was cognizant of the litigious\r\nhistory surrounding standard CGL policies and sought to rectify these problems\r\nthrough a statutory pronouncement that was entirely consistent with this Court's\r\ninterpretation of these policies. Interestingly, Newman chronicled the history of\r\nCGL policies and stated that \"interpreting 'occurrence' as we do in this case gives\r\neffect to the subcontractor exception to the 'your work' exclusion in the standard\r\nCGL policy.\" Newman, 385 S.C. at 195, 684 S.E.2d at 545. Thus, section 38-61-\r\n70 precisely codifies what Chief Justice Toal espoused in Newman. Simply stated,\r\nsection 38-61-70 does nothing more than define occurrence without any\r\ndiscernable distinction from this Court's prior decisions, particularly Newman. In\r\nmy opinion, the majority ignores the visible overlay of this Court's decisions with\r\nthe statutory language of section 38-61-70.\r\n\ncontract, there must be a careful balancing of the competing interests involved.\"\r\nCitizens for Lee County, Inc. v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 30, 416 S.E.2d 641, 645\r\n(1992).In discussing the Contract Clause, the United States Supreme Court stated,\r\n\"Although the Contract Clause appears literally to proscribe 'any' impairment, . . .\r\n'the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness\r\nlike a mathematical formula.'\" U.S. Trust Co. of N.Y. v. N.J., 431 U.S. 1, 21 (1977)\r\n(quoting Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 428 (1934)). \"As\r\nwith laws impairing the obligations of private contracts, an impairment may be\r\nconstitutional if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public\r\npurpose.\" Id. at 25.\r\n\r\n      However, \"[b]y attaching new and perhaps unanticipated legal consequences\r\nto past conduct, retroactive legislation threatens to 'deprive citizens of legitimate\r\nexpectations and upset settled transactions.'\" Ward v. Dixie Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 595\r\nF.3d 164, 176 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Gen. Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S.\r\n181, 191 (1992)).\r\n\r\n      To establish a Contract Clause violation, Petitioner must show: (1) the\r\nexistence of a contract; (2) the law changed actually impaired the contract and the\r\nimpairment was substantial; and (3) the law was not reasonable and necessary to\r\ncarry out a legitimate government purpose. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 93,\r\n533 S.E.2d 578, 585 (2000).\r\n\r\n       In view of my conclusion that Act No. 26 merely clarifies existing law, I\r\nwould find that Petitioner has failed to satisfy the second prong of the above-\r\noutlined test as Petitioner cannot establish that Act No. 26 impaired existing CGL\r\ninsurance contracts. Because the implicated term \"occurrence\" is part of the\r\nstandard-form CGL policy, these contracts have not been impermissibly impaired\r\nas this term has been consistently defined and interpreted by this state's appellate\r\ncourts and now codified by the General Assembly.6 Accordingly, I would decline\r\nto sever the express retroactivity provision of Act No. 26.7\r\n                                                            \r\n6  Furthermore, given that insurance is a highly-regulated industry, Petitioner's\r\ncontractual rights could not have been substantially impaired as Petitioner was\r\nundoubtedly aware of the existing case law and the potential for regulation. See\r\nKen Moorhead Oil Co. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 532, 540, 476 S.E.2d\r\n481, 486 (1996) (\"In determining the extent of impairment to a contract, one must\r\n'consider whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been\r\n\n                                                                          II.           Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Although Petitioner raises multiple challenges attacking the constitutionality\r\nof Act No. 26, I find that none warrant the invalidation of the enacted statute. In\r\ncontrast to the majority, I do not believe Act No. 26 violates the state and federal\r\nContract Clauses as the General Assembly enacted this provision to clarify existing\r\nlaw. Accordingly, I would declare Act No. 26 and, in turn, section 38-61-70\r\nconstitutional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nregulated in the past.'\" (quoting Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power &\r\nLight Co., 459 U.S. 400, 411 (1983)).\r\n7  The only contracts that could arguably be impaired would be those that were\r\naltered after January 7, 2011 in response to Crossmann and entered into prior to\r\nMay 17, 2011, the effective date of Act No. 26. The existence of such contracts\r\nappears unlikely as Petitioner notes that \"[s]ince 1966, CGL insurance contracts,\r\nincluding contracts issued by Harleysville, have defined 'occurrence' as 'an\r\naccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same\r\ngeneral harmful conditions.'\" Thus, the existing CGL contracts would have\r\nretained the standard-form definition of \"occurrence.\"\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I agree with Justice Beatty who rightly points out, in\r\nmy opinion, that Act 26 merely codifies this Court’s definition of occurrence. The\r\nmajority relies on a statement in Newman8 that a CGL policy may provide\r\ncoverage where faulty workmanship causes third party bodily injury or damage to\r\nother property, contrasts it with the “shall” language of the statute, and concludes\r\nthat the statute rewrites and expands the judicial definition of occurrence. I\r\nbelieve the majority misreads the Newman “may.” At this juncture, the Newman\r\ncourt is discussing the facts of L-J, a case where there was no occurrence because\r\nthe negligent construction of the roadway only caused damage to the road itself.9\r\nThe Newman opinion then relates that the L-J court “went on to explain” that there\r\nmay be coverage where the faulty workmanship causes third party injury or\r\ndamage to other property. The L-J court was suggesting hypothetically that there\r\nwould be coverage where the damaged property is not the defective work product\r\nbut only if the other prong of occurrence is met, that is, if there were an accident. 10\r\nIn this context, the “may” suggests merely that a different set of circumstances\r\nmay lead to a different result, not that where there is an occurrence, the decision to\r\nfind coverage is optional.\r\n\r\nI agree with Justice Beatty that there is no constitutional infirmity in Act 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n8 Auto-Owners Ins.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the second-degree arson\r\nconviction, but reversed and remanded as to the LWOP sentence finding the use of\r\na 1979 burning conviction was inappropriate for sentence enhancement purposes.\r\nState v. Phillips, 393 S.C. 407, 712 S.E.2d 457 (Ct. App. 2011). The State now\r\nseeks review of the Court of Appeals' decision.\r\n\r\n                                   DISCUSSION\r\nUpon conviction of a serious offense, a person must be sentenced to LWOP if the\r\nperson has two or more prior convictions for a serious offense. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n17-25-45(B) (Supp. 2008). When a prior conviction is for an offense not found in\r\n§17-25-45, trial judges can look to the elements of the prior offense to determine if\r\nthey are equivalent to the elements of an offense found in the statute for purposes\r\nof sentence enhancement. See State v. Lindsey, 355 S.C. 15, 583 S.E.2d 740\r\n(2003); State v. Washington, 338 S.C. 392, 526 S.E.2d 709 (2000).\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nlegislative intent whenever possible. State v. Baucom, 340 S.C. 339, 342, 531\r\nS.E.2d 922, 923 (2000). The Court should give words \"their plain and ordinary\r\nmeaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the\r\nstatute's operation.\" State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575\r\n(2010).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found respondent's 1979 conviction for burning did not\r\ncontain the same elements as the second-degree arson statute and thus did not\r\nqualify as a serious offense for LWOP purposes. The Court of Appeals determined\r\nthe two statutes contained many of the same elements but differed in identifying\r\nthe type of building harmed. Specifically, the Court of Appeals found the 1979\r\nburning statute applied to \"any building other than a dwelling,\" whereas the\r\nsecond-degree arson statute only applied to \"any structure designed for human\r\n\noccupancy.\" Thus, the Court of Appeals reasoned that in order for the 1979\r\nburning conviction to be used for LWOP purposes, the burning must have been of\r\na structure designed for human occupancy.1\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals further determined the State failed to present evidence\r\nrespondent burned any of the structures delineated in the second-degree arson\r\nstatute; thus, the Court of Appeals found respondent's 1979 conviction did not\r\nsufficiently mirror the second-degree arson statute for sentence enhancement\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWe find that the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting the second-degree arson\r\nstatute to be limited to structures designed for human occupancy. Under the plain\r\nreading of the statute, the phrase \"or any structure designed for human occupancy\"\r\ndoes not contain language indicating that it applies to the subsection as a whole.\r\nWhile the other categories of structures listed may be considered buildings\r\ndesigned for human occupancy, this phrase should not be considered all\r\nencompassing. Sweat, supra (stating courts should give words their ordinary\r\nmeaning and should not resort to forced construction to limit or expand a statute).\r\n\r\nHowever, while the structure respondent burned in 1979 need not have been\r\ndesigned for human occupancy to be considered second-degree arson, it must fall\r\ninto one of the categories delineated in the statute. The only category it could\r\npossibly fall into is \"a public or private school facility.\" The Court of Appeals did\r\nnot err in determining the State failed to meet its burden of proving respondent\r\nburned a school facility. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly concluded\r\nthe 1979 conviction should not have been used for sentence enhancement purposes\r\nunder § 17-25-45.\r\n\r\nMoreover, although the Court of Appeals erroneously interpreted former § 16-11-\r\n110(B), we note that the impact of this erroneous interpretation has been limited by\r\nthe 2010 amendment to the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The Court of Appeals erroneously states former § 16-11-110(B) provides that \"schools,\r\nchurches, businesses, and any other 'structure designed for human occupancy'\" receive the same\r\nprotection as dwellings. (Emphasis added). The statute does not contain the word \"other,\"\r\nwhich leads to the Court of Appeals' flawed interpretation of the statute.\r\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\nThe portion of the Court of Appeals' opinion reversing respondent's sentence is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27191","title":"Priester v.

Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 131 S.Ct. 1311 (2011). In our\r\nprevious decision,1 we concluded Appellant's state-law products liability claims\r\nagainst Ford Motor Company were preempted by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety\r\nStandard (\"FMVSS\") 205. We reaffirm our previous decision.\r\n\r\nAppellant filed a products liability claim against Respondent Ford Motor Company\r\npremised on the allegation that its 1997 Ford F-150 pick-up truck was defective\r\nand unreasonably dangerous because it did not incorporate laminated glass in the\r\nvehicle's side and rear windows. As was true with virtually all passenger vehicles\r\n\r\n1Priester v. Cromer, 388 S.C. 425, 697 S.E.2d 567 (2010), vacated, 131 S.Ct.\r\n1570 (2011).\r\n\nmanufactured at the time,2 Respondent utilized tempered glass in vehicle side\r\nwindows.3 In connection with implied conflict preemption, Williamson revisited\r\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S.\r\n861 (2000).\r\n\r\nWe construe the key language in Williamson to hold that manufacturer choice\r\namong alternatives operates to preempt a state law claim only where the state law\r\nstands as an obstacle to a significant federal regulatory objective. Similarly, our\r\nprevious decision was not based upon the notion that the mere presence of\r\nmanufacturer choices in FMVSS 205 preempted Appellant's state tort suit. We\r\nadhere to the view that the manifest purpose of the federal regulatory scheme\r\nunderlying FMVSS 205 would be frustrated if these state claims were allowed to\r\nproceed. Assuming implied conflict preemption remains a viable part of\r\npreemption, we believe it applies here to preclude Appellant's state law claims.\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\n\r\nThe case arises from a single-vehicle accident. On August 17, 2002 at 3:45 a.m.,\r\nPreston Cromer was driving a 1997 Ford F-150 pick-up truck at an excessive speed\r\nnear St. George, South Carolina, when he drove off the road and rolled the truck\r\nseveral times. Appellant's son, James Lloyd Priester, who was in the rear seat of\r\nthe truck and not wearing his seatbelt, was ejected through the rear window and\r\n\r\n2In response to increased seatbelt usage and mandatory seatbelt laws, vehicle\r\nmanufacturers generally elected to utilize tempered glass in side windows.\r\nAccording to the amicus brief of the Center for Auto Safety, as of 2007, more than\r\n90% of all vehicles sold in North America incorporated tempered glass in side\r\nwindows, while perhaps 5 to 9% utilized laminated glass.\r\n3 We note that the case came to us from the grant of summary judgment based on\r\npreemption. Accordingly, we do not address the substantial threshold question of\r\nwhether the absence of laminated glass in the side and rear windows rendered the\r\nvehicle defective and unreasonably dangerous as a matter of state law. In other\r\nwords, as a matter of state law, did a vehicle manufacturer have a duty at the time\r\nthe 1997 Ford F-150 pick-up truck was manufactured to utilize laminated glass in\r\nthe side and rear windows? By focusing solely on preemption, we are answering a\r\nquestion that presupposes (without deciding) Appellant's claim would not be\r\nbarred as a matter of state law. In essence, we are putting the cart before the horse.\r\n\ndied at the scene. Cromer and Priester, both of whom were under twenty-one years\r\nold, were apparently intoxicated after they had allegedly been served alcohol at\r\nShowgirls(z), a strip club located in Santee, South Carolina.4\r\n\r\nAppellant filed a products liability claim against Ford, alleging causes of action for\r\nstrict liability and breach of warranty for failing to use laminated glass in the\r\nvehicle's side and rear windows, which Appellant claimed would have retained\r\noccupants inside the vehicle during the crash. Ford denied the allegations and\r\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing FMVSS 205 impliedly preempted\r\nAppellant's state law claims. The trial court found FMVSS 205 preempted\r\nAppellant's claims and granted Ford's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\r\nIn our initial opinion, we affirmed summary judgment and held FMVSS 205\r\npreempted Appellant's state law products liability claim. In doing so, we relied on\r\nGeier, in which the USSC found an earlier version of a similar federal regulation—\r\nFMVSS 208 dealing with passive restraint systems (e.g., airbags, automatic\r\nseatbelts, ignition interlock devices, etc.)—impliedly preempted a state tort suit.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in February 2011, the USSC decided Williamson, which also involved\r\nthe preemptive effect of FMVSS 208. In Williamson, the USSC found that, even\r\nthough FMVSS 208 was structured to provide manufacturers with a choice\r\nbetween two different kinds of seatbelts for rear inner seats, the regulation did not\r\npreempt a state tort suit premised upon a manufacturer's failure to install the lap-\r\nand-shoulder seatbelt, one of the two permitted kinds. Shortly after its decision in\r\nWilliamson, the USSC vacated the judgment of this Court, and remanded for our\r\nfurther consideration in light of its decision. See Priester v. Ford Motor Co., 131\r\nS.Ct. 1570 (2011).5\r\n\r\n4   The record also includes other allegations of drug use.\r\n5 While a grant-vacate-remand (\"GVR\") order may call into question the\r\ncorrectness of a lower court's judgment, it is not a definitive determination that the\r\njudgment was improper. Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S. 163, 168 (1996) (\"[T]he\r\nGVR order can improve the fairness and accuracy of judicial outcomes while at the\r\nsame time serving as a cautious and deferential alternative to summary reversal in\r\ncases whose precedential significance does not merit our plenary review.\"). The\r\nUSSC has stated, \"[i]ndeed, it is precisely because we are uncertain, without\r\nundertaking plenary analysis, of the legal impact of a new development, especially\r\n\n                                           II. \n\r\n\r\nThe preemption doctrine is rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the United States\r\nConstitution and provides that any state law that conflicts with federal law is\r\n\"without effect.\" Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992).\r\n\"'[T]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone' of pre-emption analysis.\"\r\nId. (quoting Malone v. White Motor Co., 435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978)). \"To discern\r\nCongress' intent we examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and\r\npurpose of the statute.\" Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 138\r\n(1990). Preemption \"is compelled whether Congress' command is explicitly stated\r\nin the statute's language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.\" Jones\r\nv. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977). Moreover, \"[f]ederal regulations\r\nhave no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes.\" Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan\r\nAss'n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153 (1982).\r\n\r\nA federal law may either expressly or impliedly preempt a state law. Congress\r\nmay expressly preempt state law through specific language clearly stating its\r\nintent. On the other hand, implied preemption occurs through \"field preemption\"6\r\nor \"implied conflict preemption.\" Implied conflict preemption occurs in one of\r\ntwo ways—either where compliance with both federal and state regulations is\r\nphysically impossible or where the state law \"stands as an obstacle to the\r\naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\r\nHines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941). It is this latter type of implied\r\nconflict preemption, sometimes called \"obstacle\" or \"frustration-of-purpose\"\r\npreemption, which is implicated in Geier, Williamson, and the present case.\r\n\r\nThe issue in Williamson was whether federal law preempted a state tort suit\r\npremised on a manufacturer's decision not to install lap-and-shoulder seatbelts at\r\ncertain rear interior seats, which were permitted, but not required, by the 1989\r\nversion of FMVSS 208. In 1984, the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\")\r\n\r\none, such as the present, which the lower court has had no opportunity to consider,\r\nthat we GVR.\" Id. at 174. Accordingly, we must consider whether our previous\r\ndecision is affected by Williamson.\r\n6 Field preemption occurs when the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive\r\nthat it is reasonable to infer that Congress left no room for the states to regulate.\r\nBoth sides agree field preemption is not implicated in this case.\r\n\nrejected a regulation that would have required the use of shoulder seatbelts in rear\r\nseats. However, by 1989, DOT concluded that several factors had changed. DOT\r\nopted to require installation of shoulder seatbelts for rear outer seats but permitted\r\na choice between lap belts and shoulder belts for rear inner seats. At that time,\r\nDOT was convinced shoulder belts were safer regardless of seating position;\r\nhowever, due to concerns about additional costs, DOT elected to permit\r\nmanufacturers to choose which type of belt to install in rear inner seats.\r\nNevertheless, DOT actively encouraged manufacturers to install shoulder belts\r\nwhere feasible. Williamson, 131 S.Ct. at 1137-38. Essentially, the question before\r\nthe USSC was whether the preservation of options was a deliberate policy\r\njudgment in furtherance of a \"significant federal regulatory objective,\" which\r\nwould be frustrated by a state tort suit. Id. at 1136.\r\n\r\nA critical factor in the USSC's analysis in Williamson was its view of the scope of\r\nits earlier Geier decision, in which it found that a state tort suit imposing a duty\r\nupon a manufacturer to equip all cars with airbags would conflict with the purpose\r\nof an earlier version of the same federal safety standard—FMVSS 208. In Geier,\r\nthe USSC rejected the idea that FMVSS 208 set a minimum safety standard for\r\nairbag installation based on the DOT's accompanying comments, which made clear\r\nthat a range of choices was deliberately sought.7 The USSC noted the DOT's\r\npolicy judgment that safety would be best promoted if manufacturers installed\r\nalternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in\r\nevery car. Id. at 881. Thus, the rule of state law created by the tort suit would\r\nhave presented an obstacle8 to important means-related federal objectives served\r\n\r\n7In Geier, DOT identified five reasons why its decision to maintain manufacturer\r\nchoice would promote FMVSS 208's safety objectives: (1) DOT desired to\r\npromote consumer acceptance of emerging airbag technology; (2) none of the\r\noptions offered superior safety under all circumstances; (3) at the time, airbag\r\ndesigns posed potential additional safety risks; (4) DOT was interested in spurring\r\nadditional technological developments; and (5) implementing airbag technology\r\nwould increase costs. See Geier, 529 U.S. at 875-76.\r\n8 The members of the USSC disputed the extent to which the term \"state law\"\r\nencompasses the common law, as well as positive enactments, such as statutes and\r\nregulations. The majority in the 5-4 Geier decision stated:\r\n\r\n      In effect, petitioners' tort action depends upon its claim that\r\n\nby the manufacturer options provided in FMVSS 208—namely the safety objective\r\nachieved through the variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought\r\nand the gradual passive restraint phase-in that was deliberately imposed.9 Id. at\r\n880-81.\r\n\r\nIn Williamson, the Solicitor General, on behalf of DOT, argued FMVSS 208 did\r\nnot preempt the state tort suit and urged the USSC to sustain DOT's assessment\r\nthat petitioners' tort action was not only consistent with but actually furthered the\r\npurposes and objectives of both the Motor Vehicle Safety Act (\"the Safety Act\")\r\nand its implementing safety-standard regulations promulgated by NHTSA. 131\r\nS.Ct. at 1139. Accordingly, it was logical to conclude the state tort suit was not\r\npreempted because retaining the lap-only belt option was not designed to further\r\nsafety goals of the federal regulatory scheme.\r\n\r\nIn Williamson, the USSC noted that, like Geier, the regulation left manufacturers\r\nwith a choice and the state tort suit would restrict that choice. But unlike Geier,\r\nthe Court did not believe that choice furthered a significant regulatory objective.\r\n\r\n      manufacturers had a duty to install an airbag when they manufactured\r\n      the 1987 Honda Accord. Such a state law – i.e., a rule of state tort law\r\n      imposing such a duty – by its terms would have required\r\n      manufacturers of all similar cars to install airbags rather than other\r\n      passive restraint systems, such as automatic belts or passive interiors.\r\n      It thereby would have presented an obstacle to the variety and mix of\r\n      devices that the federal regulation sought.\r\n\r\nId. at 881, 896-99. Notwithstanding the heated debate in Geier, the majority in\r\nWilliamson apparently accepted rather unceremoniously the premise that the term\r\n\"state law\" encompassed common law tort claims, even in the presence of a\r\nstatutory savings clause. Williamson, 131 S.Ct. at 1137, 1139-40. (\"[L]ike the tort\r\nsuit in Geier, the tort suit here would restrict [manufacturer] choice. . . . We\r\nconsequently conclude that, even though the tort suit may restrict the\r\nmanufacturer's choice, it does not 'stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of\r\nthe full purposes and objectives' of federal law.\") (quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at 67).\r\n9In Geier, the USSC also noted a regulation requiring airbag installation could\r\nhave made the adoption of a mandatory state buckle-up law less likely. Geier, 529\r\nU.S. at 880-81.\r\n\nThe Court emphasized that the reason DOT did not mandate shoulder belts was not\r\ndue to safety concerns, but because of concerns over costs. Id.\r\n\r\nA central point of the USSC's analysis was the government's position and how\r\nmuch deference to afford it. The Court noted the government's consistent position\r\nthat \"state tort law does not conflict with a federal minimum standard merely\r\nbecause state law imposes a more stringent requirement,\" and the Solicitor\r\nGeneral's explanation that \"a standard giving manufacturers multiple options for\r\nthe design of a device would not pre-empt a state suit claiming that a manufacturer\r\nshould have chosen one particular option, where 'the Secretary [of Transportation]\r\ndid not determine that the availability of options was necessary to promote safety.'\"\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe USSC concluded that consideration of the regulation's history, the agency's\r\ncontemporaneous explanation, the agency's advocacy for shoulder belts\r\n(notwithstanding the lap-only belt option), and the agency's interpretive views\r\nindicated that, unlike Geier, the decision to maintain manufacturer choice was not\r\nbased on a deliberate policy decision designed to further significant regulatory or\r\nsafety objectives. Thus, even though the state tort suit restricted manufacturer\r\nchoice, it did not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes and\r\nobjectives of the federal law and was, therefore, not preempted. Id. at 1139-40.\r\n\r\nJustice Sotomayor authored a concurring opinion, in order \"to emphasize the\r\nCourt's rejection of an overreading of Geier that has developed since that opinion\r\nwas issued.\" Id. at 1140. Justice Sotomayor wrote:\r\n\r\n      [T]he mere fact that an agency regulation allows manufacturers a\r\n      choice between options is insufficient to justify implied pre-emption;\r\n      courts should only find pre-emption where evidence exists that an\r\n      agency has a regulatory objective–e.g., obtaining a mix of passive\r\n      restraint mechanisms, as in Geier–whose achievement depends on\r\n      manufacturers having a choice between options.\r\n\r\nId. at 1140. Justice Sotomayor also emphasized that Mazda failed to carry its\r\nburden of establishing that DOT \"deliberately sought variety to achieve greater\r\nsafety.\" Id. at 1141. Thus, in our view, Justice Sotomayor's concurrence clarified\r\n\nthat, in terms of key regulatory features, variety for its own sake is not a\r\n\"significant\" regulatory objective. Rather, variety becomes a significant federal\r\nobjective when it is employed as a deliberate means to achieve greater safety.\r\n\r\nIn sum, we believe Williamson did not eviscerate Geier or relegate it to outlier\r\nstatus. Rather, Williamson clarified that a deliberate decision to retain\r\nmanufacturer choice is, in and of itself, insufficient to establish preemption.\r\nRather, the party claiming preemption has the burden of proving that an agency\r\ndeliberately sought a variety of means to achieve a \"significant\" federal purpose.\r\nThe significant federal purpose here is, of course, safety. Several other courts have\r\ninterpreted Williamson similarly. See Morris v. Mitsubishi Motors North America,\r\nInc., 782 F.Supp. 2d. 1149, 1158 (E.D. Wash. 2011) (\"A tort claim may proceed,\r\neven if it may have the effect of restricting the manufacturer's choice, when a Court\r\nfinds that the choice allotted to manufacturers by a regulation is not intended to\r\nfurther a significant regulatory objective.\"); Lake v. Memphis Landsmen L.L.C.,\r\nW2011-00660-COA-RM-CV, 2011 WL 5022790, *10-11 (Tenn. Ct. App. filed\r\nOct. 21, 2011) (\"Williamson merely clarifies that manufacturer choice alone is not\r\nsufficient to find implied pre-emption of state tort claims. Rather, the inclusion of\r\nmanufacturer choice must be in furtherance of a specific regulatory objective in\r\norder to form the basis of implied pre-emption of the state suit.\").10\r\n\r\nWith these concepts in mind, we address our previous opinion finding Appellant's\r\nclaims were preempted.                  III.\r\n\r\nA review of our earlier decision reveals that this Court's determination did not\r\ndepend solely on the presence of a choice between laminated and tempered glass in\r\nFMVSS 205. Rather, in determining Appellant's claims were preempted, this\r\nCourt considered the text of FMVSS 205, its history, and the reasons given by the\r\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") for its regulatory\r\ndecisions. Accordingly, we conclude our previous decision is consistent with the\r\nWilliamson framework and is therefore undisturbed by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10We note the Supreme Court of Tennessee granted the Lakes' application for\r\npermission to appeal on March 6, 2012.\r\n\nAlthough we recited the text, history, and purpose of FMVSS 205 in our previous\r\nopinion, without the benefit of Williamson, we did not explicitly incorporate each\r\nof those factors in our discussion of whether Appellant's tort suit was preempted.\r\nThus, in light of Williamson, we take this opportunity to clarify the underpinnings\r\nof our previous decision.      A.     Regulation 205\r\n\r\nThe Safety Act was promulgated to improve highway safety, specifically \"to\r\nreduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents.\"\r\n49 U.S.C. § 30101 (2006).11 Under the authority of the Safety Act, DOT through\r\n\r\n11 The Motor Vehicle Safety Act, contains an express preemption clause which\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n      When a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter, a\r\n      State or political subdivision of a State may prescribe or continue in\r\n      effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a\r\n      motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment only if the standard is\r\n      identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter.\r\n\r\n49 U.S.C. § 30103(b)(1). That section also states \"Compliance with a motor\r\nvehicle safety standard does not exempt a person from liability at common law.\"\r\n49 U.S.C. § 30103(e). In Geier, a majority of the USSC found the presence of a\r\nstatutory savings clause made clear Congress intended state tort suits to fall outside\r\nthe scope of the express preemption clause; however, the savings clause did not\r\nforeclose or limit the operation of \"ordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in\r\nlongstanding precedent.\" Geier, 529 U.S. at 868. This finding was hotly contested\r\nby the four-member dissent in Geier, which felt the statutory savings clause \"was\r\nobviously intended to limit the pre-emptive effect of the Secretary's safety\r\nstandards.\" Id. at 894-99. However, the majority in Williamson did not revisit the\r\nwisdom in this step of the Geier framework and simply applied it without further\r\nanalysis. Williamson, 131 S.Ct. at 1136-37 (\"In light of Geier, the statute's express\r\npre-emption clause cannot pre-empt the common-law tort action; but neither can\r\nthe statute's saving[s] clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict\r\npre-emption principles. We consequently turn our attention to Geier's third\r\nsubsidiary question, whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the federal\r\nregulation.\"). We are constrained to honor the USSC's view that the presence of a\r\n\nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") promulgated\r\nFMVSS 205, which specifies requirements for glazing materials used in motor\r\nvehicles and motor vehicle equipment.12 The stated purpose of FMVSS 205 is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce injuries\r\n      resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary\r\n      degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility,\r\n      and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through the\r\n      vehicle windows in collisions.\r\n\r\n49 C.F.R. § 571.205 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSince its adoption in the 1960s, FMVSS 205 has provided that laminated glass may\r\nbe used anywhere in the vehicle including the windshield and that tempered glass\r\nmay be used anywhere in the vehicle except the windshield. The American\r\nNational Standard Institute (ANSI) defines the two types as:\r\n\r\n   1.\t Laminated Glass. This consists of two or more sheets of glass held \n\r\n       together by an intervening layer or layers of plastic material. It will \n\r\n       crack and break under sufficient impact, but the pieces of glass tend to \n\r\n       adhere to the plastic and not to fly. If a hole is produced, the edges \n\r\n       are likely to be less jagged than would be the case with ordinary glass. \n\r\n\r\n   2.\t Tempered Glass. . . . This consists of a single sheet of specially \n\r\n       treated plate, sheet, or float glass. . . . When broken at any point, the \n\r\n       entire piece immediately breaks into innumerable small pieces, which \n\r\n       may be described as granular, usually with no large jagged edges. \n\r\n\r\nThe word \"glazing\" refers to glass in general, and the term \"advanced glazing\" is\r\nfrequently used to refer to laminated glass and other glass-plastic glazing materials,\r\nall of which are constructed, treated, or combined with other materials as to\r\nwithstand more impact before shattering as compared to tempered glass. Thus, we\r\n\r\nsavings clause does not foreclose ordinary preemption principles.\r\n12 The regulation incorporates by reference ANS Z26, which is a safety code\r\nadopted by the American National Standard Institute and the Society of\r\nAutomotive Engineers. 49 C.F.R. § 571.205.\r\n\nuse the term \"advanced glazing\" to refer to laminated glass as opposed to tempered\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAs this Court observed in our initial Priester opinion, \"it can be stated generally\r\nthat tempered glass is safer for vehicle occupants wearing seatbelts, where the risk\r\nof ejection is reduced, because it provides less risk of additional\r\ninjuries. Laminated glass is safer for unbelted passengers, where the risk of\r\nejection is increased, because it is likely to keep a passenger inside the vehicle due\r\nto the 'adhering' quality of the glass.\" See National Highway Traffic Safety\r\nAdmin., Ejection Mitigation Using Advanced Glazing: Final Report 53-54 (Aug.\r\n2001).                          B.    NHTSA Study\r\n\r\nBeginning in the late 1980s, NHTSA became concerned with the significant\r\nnumber of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from rollover accidents. NHTSA\r\nexplored two different approaches to determine the safety enhancement potential\r\nof each: preventing rollover accidents from occurring and protecting vehicle\r\noccupants during a rollover, including reducing the likelihood of ejections.13 As a\r\nresult, NHTSA published two Advanced Notices of Proposed Rulemaking\r\n(\"ANPRM\") in 1988 announcing the agency's intent to reduce the risk of ejections\r\nin crashes. NHTSA believed new side window designs incorporating different\r\nconfigurations and advanced glazing could potentially reduce the risk of ejection\r\nand sought public comments on its approach. See Side Impact Protection—\r\nPassenger Cars, 53 Fed. Reg. 31712 (proposed Aug. 19, 1988); Side Impact\r\nProtection—Light Trucks, Vans, and Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles, 53 Fed.\r\nReg. 31716 (proposed Aug. 19, 1988).\r\n\r\nIn November 1995, NHTSA published a status report regarding its research into\r\nejection mitigation using advanced glazing (hereinafter \"1995 Report\"). See\r\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Ejection Mitigation Using Advanced\r\nGlazing: A Status Report (Nov. 1995). The 1995 Report documented the problem\r\n\r\n13NHTSA reported that, based on 1982-1985 statistics, 19.5% of all vehicle\r\nfatalities each year were the result of an occupant's complete ejection from the\r\nvehicle and 4.3% were from partial ejection of an occupant through glazing.\r\nFurther data showed that, of the fatalities involving ejection, 34% were ejected\r\nthrough the side windows.\r\n\nof vehicle occupants being ejected through side glazing and described the research\r\nNHTSA had performed with prototype glazing systems. The 1995 Report noted\r\nthe need to address concerns about potential increased risk of head, neck and\r\nlaceration injury; however, no adequate technology existed at that time to allow\r\nNHTSA to develop reliable testing procedures and to measure the test results of\r\nvarious glazing materials. The 1995 Report concluded that preliminary research\r\nsuggested advanced glazing systems may offer \"significant safety potential\" by\r\nreducing the likelihood of occupant ejection but that research \"should be continued\r\nto more fully evaluate the safety implications of alternative glazing systems.\" Id.\r\nat 11-1 to -3.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Congress directed NHTSA to complete its study of glazing materials. In\r\nAugust 2001, NHTSA complied and issued a final report (\"Final Report\") on its\r\ntwelve-year research program on whether ejection mitigation could be\r\naccomplished by using advanced glazing. See National Highway Traffic Safety\r\nAdmin., Ejection Mitigation Using Advanced Glazing: Final Report (Aug. 2001).\r\nWithin the Final Report, there was much discussion of the costs, risks and benefits\r\nof advanced glazing, including NHTSA's recognition that no one type of safety\r\nglazing material was shown to possess the maximum degree of safety under all\r\nconditions. Noting \"98 percent of occupants completely ejected and killed during\r\nrollover crashes were unbelted,\" and that \"seatbelts currently provide excellent\r\nprotection against ejection,\" the Final Report reiterated the federal policy of\r\npromoting seatbelt use14 and stated that \"[a]ny safety countermeasure to prevent\r\nejection would be a supplement to the primary protection provided by the seat\r\nbelt.\" Id. at 53. NHTSA reported that its research indicated advanced glazing\r\nsystems would lead to better occupant retention in crashes but went on to note that\r\nthe number of fatalities prevented by advanced side glazing would diminish with\r\nan increased rate of seatbelt use. Id. at 37-47.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Final Report similarly noted that \"[s]ince the benefits of ejection\r\nmitigation occur primarily for unbelted occupants, a critical factor in this research\r\nprogram was to investigate any possible injury risk, particularly for belted\r\n\r\n14 Although it is not specifically cited in the Final Report, Congress has enacted a\r\nstatute finding that mandatory seatbelt use is in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. §\r\n30127(d). (\"Seat belt use laws – Congress finds that it is in the public interest for\r\neach state to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use laws and for the United\r\nStates government to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use regulations.\").\r\n\noccupants.\" Id. at 26, 53-54 (\"Knowing the [scope of] potential head injury is\r\nparticularly important since ejection almost exclusively occurs for unbelted\r\noccupants, while any potential for increased injuries would occur for all occupants,\r\nbelted and unbelted.\"). Ultimately, NHTSA indicated it was \"extremely reluctant\r\nto pursue a [glazing] requirement that may increase injury risk for belted occupants\r\nto provide safety benefits primarily for unbelted occupants, by preventing their\r\nejection from the vehicle,\" and thus, \"the agency will not continue to examine\r\npotential regulatory requirement for advanced side glazing.\" Id. at 54. (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\r\nThereafter, NHTSA withdrew the ANPRMs and abandoned any effort to require\r\nadvanced glazing in vehicle side windows. See Withdrawal of Advance Notices of\r\nProposed Rulemaking, 67 Fed. Reg. 41365, 41367 (June 18, 2002). NHTSA cited\r\nsafety and cost concerns and explained the \"two primary reasons\" for its decision\r\nwere \"the advent of other ejection mitigation systems, such as side air curtains and\r\nthe need to develop performance standards for them, and the fact that advanced\r\nside glazing in some cases appears to increase the risk of neck injury.\" 67 Fed.\r\nReg. 41365, 41367 (June 18, 2002). The agency concluded \"[g]iven these\r\nconcerns, NHTSA believes it would be more appropriate to devote its research and\r\nrulemaking efforts with respect to ejection mitigation to projects other than\r\nadvanced glazing. . . . The focus will shift from advanced glazing to the\r\ndevelopment of more comprehensive, performance-based test procedures. . . .\r\nestablishing the safety performance that must be achieved.\" Id. at 41367 (emphasis\r\nadded).              C.     Discerning the Federal Purpose\r\n\r\nConsidering the text and history of FMVSS 205 and NHTSA's stated desire to\r\nreduce passenger ejection through \"comprehensive\" safety performance, we\r\nbelieve the regulation embodies two separate and equally compelling purposes:\r\nreducing injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces and minimizing the\r\npossibility of occupants being ejected through vehicle windows. The objective of\r\npromoting safety was at the core of NHTSA's deliberate decision not to require\r\nadvanced glazing in side windows. We believe it is significant that NHTSA\r\nindicated a desire to pursue a \"comprehensive\" approach15 that would provide\r\n\r\n15In our opinion, NHTSA's subsequent regulatory action further demonstrates its\r\ndesire to find a \"comprehensive\" solution to prevent occupant ejection. On\r\n\nsafety benefits to both belted and unbelted passengers and specifically declined to\r\nrequire a particular option that would be safer for only one category of pasengers.\r\nIndeed, as the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, \"[i]t appears that the NHTSA\r\nleft the options for glass open so that the manufacturers could choose the safety\r\nfeatures that best accomplished both purposes.\" Lake, 2011 WL 5022790 at *14.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we find the Final Report demonstrates that the collateral federal goal\r\nof promoting seatbelt use is a key component of any motor vehicle safety\r\nobjective, including FMVSS 205. The regulation's history demonstrates NHTSA\r\nwas understandably reluctant to choose between promoting safety for belted\r\noccupants or for unbelted occupants, particularly where requiring advanced side\r\nglazing would likely result in an increased risk of injury, primarily for belted\r\noccupants.                      D.    Agency View\r\n\r\nHaving considered the text and history of FMVSS 205, in accordance with Geier\r\nand Williamson, the next analytical step would be to examine NHTSA's position on\r\nthe preemptive effect, if any, of FMVSS 205. However, this Court does not have\r\nthe benefit of an express agency position on this issue. Thus, our conclusion must\r\nbe drawn from the record before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 19, 2011, NHTSA promulgated FMVSS 226 regarding ejection mitigation\r\nmeasures such as side air curtains. This standard requires ejection countermeasure\r\nsystems to be in place in the side windows (but not back windows or sunroofs) of\r\ncertain vehicles. FMVSS 226 does not specify particular systems or options\r\nmanufacturers must use; rather, NHTSA expects that manufacturers will meet the\r\nstandard's performance requirements by modifying existing side impact air bag\r\ncurtains, which may be supplemented with the use of advanced glazing. 76\r\nFed.Reg. 3212 (January 19, 2011). Notably, in the Final Rule, NHTSA stated that\r\nit did not adopt previously proposed standards requiring the \"use of advanced side\r\nglazing in side windows because [it] did not find a safety need supporting the\r\napproaches.\" Id. at 3219.\r\n\n              E.     Minimum Safety Standard Counterargument\r\n\r\nIn our previous opinion, we considered O'Hara v. General Motors Corp., 508 F.3d\r\n753 (5th Cir. 2007) (finding FMVSS 205 was a minimum safety standard and did\r\nnot preempt a state tort suit). However, we ultimately rejected the minimum safety\r\nstandard argument adopted by O'Hara and advocated by Appellant. Upon remand,\r\nAppellant still contends FMVSS 205, through its incorporation of ANSI Z26,\r\nsimply lists various performance tests qualifying window materials must meet and\r\nthereby establishes only a safety floor while permitting manufacturers to install\r\nadditional or better protections. Therefore, Appellant asserts, FMVSS 205 does\r\nnot preempt a state tort claim that would hold a manufacturer liable for using\r\ntempered glass in vehicle side windows. In support of this contention, Appellant\r\ncites Williamson, O'Hara, and MCI Sales and Service, Inc. v. Hinton, 329 S.W.3d\r\n475 (Tex. 2010),16 all of which find the federal safety regulation does not preempt\r\n\r\n16 In its Amicus Brief, the Center for Auto Safety suggests that the fact that the\r\nUSSC issued a GVR order in the present case but denied certiorari in MCI Sales &\r\nService, Inc. v. Hinton, 329 S.W.3d 475 (Tex. 2010), in which the Supreme Court\r\nof Texas found a state tort claim that a company should have installed laminated\r\nglass windows was not preempted by FMVSS 205, is a clear indication that this\r\nCourt should reverse its previous decision. While that argument may have\r\nostensible merit, we do not view the denial of certiorari in Hinton as dispositive.\r\nIn Hinton, the jury found the plaintiffs' injuries were caused by a lack of seatbelts\r\nwithout regard to the plaintiffs' glass claims. However, because the case was\r\nremanded for a new trial, the Texas Supreme Court opted to rule on the preemptive\r\neffect of FMVSS 205 in anticipation that it would be a prominent issue upon\r\nretrial. Id. at 495 n.19 (\"[O]ur conclusion that the seatbelt claim is not preempted\r\nis sufficient to uphold the jury's verdict. Even so, we discuss the preemptive effect\r\nof FMVSS 205 because, in light of the remand for a new trial, the issue of glazing\r\nmaterials will feature prominently on retrial. Accordingly, we address it to provide\r\nguidance to the trial court.\"). Accordingly, the portion of the Hinton opinion\r\ndealing with FMVSS 205 was not a final decision and, therefore, was not within\r\nthe scope of the USSC's review. See Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U.S. 75, 81\r\n(1997) (\"To be reviewable by this Court, a state-court judgment must be final in\r\ntwo senses: it must be subject to no further review or correction in any other\r\ntribunal; it must also be final as an effective determination of the litigation and not\r\nmerely interlocutory or intermediate steps therein.\") (internal quotations omitted).\r\n\na state tort suit. In light of Williamson, we take this opportunity to discuss more\r\nfully our reasoning for rejecting Appellant's argument.\r\n\r\nThe Motor Safety Vehicle Act indeed directs the DOT to establish \"minimum\r\nstandard[s] for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment.\" 49\r\nU.S.C. § 30102 (emphasis added).17 Furthermore, ANSI Z26 states that the\r\nstandard \"is intended to provide minimum requirements\" for safety glazing\r\nmaterials. 49 C.F.R. § 571.205 (incorporating by reference ANSI Z26) (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\r\nWe are also cognizant Williamson makes clear that the mere presence of choice\r\namong various alternatives does not necessarily mean that a regulation is\r\nsomething other than a minimum safety standard. 131 S.Ct. at 1139 (\"[T]o infer\r\nfrom the mere existence of [choice] that the federal agency intends to bar States\r\nfrom imposing stricter standards would treat all such federal standards as if they\r\nwere maximum standards, eliminating the possibility that the federal agency seeks\r\nonly to set forth a minimum standard potentially supplemented through state tort\r\nlaw.\"); see also Hinton, 329 S.W.3d at 497 (\"[W]hen Geier's reasoning is\r\noversimplified to find preemption based on a choice between two safety options\r\nand then exported to other safety standards where the unique text and history of\r\nFMVSS 208's passive restraint requirements are not relevant, we must respectfully\r\ndisagree.\").\r\n\r\nFurther, in O'Hara, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the text and\r\nhistory of FMVSS 205 and determined \"it is best understood as a minimum safety\r\nstandard.\" 508 F.3d at 763; see also Hinton, 329 S.W.3d at 498 (\"We find nothing\r\nin the standard's text, history, or NHTSA's comments to indicate that FMVSS 205\r\nis anything other than a minimum standard.\"). Specifically, the O'Hara court\r\nnoted that NHTSA's 2003 Final Rule commentary contained no language that\r\npreserving the option of tempered glass would \"serve the safety goals of [FMVSS\r\n205].\" 508 F.3d at 761. Both the Hinton and O'Hara courts also considered what\r\nthey characterized as NHTSA's silence regarding a \"positive desire to preserve the\r\nuse of tempered glass\" as instructive in finding FMVSS 205 is simply a minimum\r\n\r\n\r\n17Section 30101 authorizes Congress \"to prescribe motor vehicle safety standards\r\nfor motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in interstate commerce.\" 49\r\nU.S.C. § 30101. Section 30102 defines \"motor vehicle safety standard.\"\r\n\nstandard. Hinton, 329 S.W.3d at 497; see also O'Hara, 508 F.3d at 761.\r\nAdditionally, those courts examined NHTSA's Notice of Withdrawal and\r\nconcluded it did not expressly reject advanced glazing as unsafe; rather, the courts\r\nnoted cost concerns and what they characterized as \"minor safety issues\" to justify\r\nNHTSA's discontinuance of advanced glazing research. O'Hara, 508 F.3d at 761-\r\n62, Hinton, 329 S.W.3d at 497. Thus, the courts concluded that \"[n]othing in the\r\ntext of FMVSS 205 indicates that it is anything other than a minimum materials\r\nstandard. . . . [T]he standard simply limits the range of available choices.\" Hinton,\r\n329 S.W.3d at 495; see O'Hara, 508 F.3d at 763 (\"[N]othing in the Notice of\r\nWithdrawal undermines the conclusion, drawn from the text and Final Rule\r\ncommentary, that FMVSS 205 is a minimum safety standard.\").\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that Appellant's \"minimum safety standard\" argument has appeal.\r\nHowever, we find the concept of a \"minimum standard\" difficult to apply in this\r\ncontext because neither glass option (tempered or laminated) is safer overall, under\r\nevery set of circumstances; rather, we believe the choice of glazing material can\r\nbest be characterized as a safety tradeoff, depending on whether the desire is to\r\nmaximize safety for belted or unbelted passengers.18 NHTSA's findings regarding\r\nFMVSS 205 make clear that advanced glazing is a safer choice when a passenger\r\nis unbelted because it is more likely to prevent ejection from the vehicle.\r\nHowever, those findings also make clear that tempered glass is the safer choice\r\nwhen a passenger complies with the law and is belted because tempered glass is\r\nless likely to injure occupants upon impact. Because each type of glass has both\r\nbenefits and drawbacks, it is therefore virtually impossible to posit which option is\r\n\"less safe\" and which is \"more safe.\" Thus, it is difficult to reconcile this\r\nunavoidable tradeoff with a conclusion that either option results in an overall\r\ngreater level of safety than the other, as contemplated in Geier. 529 U.S. at 870\r\n(referring to \"actions that seek to establish greater safety than the minimum safety\r\nachieved by a federal regulation intended to provide a floor\").\r\n\r\nBy contrast, in Williamson, the safety benefits of lap-and-shoulder seatbelts were\r\nclearly known and quantified, and it was firmly established that those seatbelts are\r\n\r\n18 See ANSI/SAE Z26.1—1996 § 2.2 (\"One safety glazing material may be\r\nsuperior for protection against one type of hazard, whereas another may be\r\nsuperior against another type. Since accident conditions are not standardized, no\r\none type of material can be shown to possess the maximum degree of safety under\r\nall conditions, against all conceivable hazards.\").\r\n\nobviously the safer choice in all situations. See Williamson, 131 S.Ct. at 1138\r\n(\"[DOT] was convinced that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety; it did\r\nnot fear additional safety risks arising from use of those belts; [and] it had no\r\ninterest in assuring a mix of devices . . . .\"). Moreover, NHTSA affirmatively\r\nencouraged the use of the lap-and-shoulder seatbelt over the use of the lap belt\r\nalone where it was feasible to do so and declined to make lap-and-shoulder belts an\r\nimmediate requirement only due to cost concerns. See id. The Court found that,\r\nwhile the state tort suit potentially restricted the manufacturer's choice, it did not\r\n\"'stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment . . . of the full purposes and\r\nobjectives' of federal law.\" Id. at 1139-40 (quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at 67)\r\n(alteration in original). In fact, quite the opposite was true—the state tort suit\r\nactually furthered NHTSA's goal of promoting lap-and-shoulder seatbelts.\r\n\r\nWe also think that, in misconstruing FMVSS 205 as a minimum safety standard,\r\nO'Hara too casually dismisses the additional risk of neck injury that advanced\r\nglazing imposes upon belted passengers. See O'Hara, 508 F.3d at 761-62 (stating\r\n\"some data indicated that advanced glazing might slightly increase the likelihood\r\nof minor neck injuries when compared to tempered glass\"); Hinton, 329 S.W.3d at\r\n498 (stating NHTSA's decision to abandon further advanced glazing research was\r\ndue to \"cost concerns and minor safety issues\"). We do not believe NHTSA's view\r\non the increased risk of injury to belted passengers can fairly be characterized as a\r\n\"minor safety issue.\" Rather, NHTSA explicitly cited this safety concern as one of\r\ntwo \"primary reasons\" for abandoning its proposed rulemaking. We believe a tort\r\naction mandating advanced glazing in side windows, which serves to increase\r\nprotection for unbelted passengers while increasing risk of injury to belted\r\npassengers, would directly frustrate the purpose of FMVSS 205.\r\n\r\nFinally, we think that O'Hara and Hinton overstate the significance of NHTSA's\r\nsilence regarding \"preserving the option\" of tempered glass in its 2003 amendment\r\nof FMVSS 205.19 We disagree this amendment demonstrates the agency intended\r\n\r\n19In 2003, NHTSA adopted a final rule updating the version of the ANSI standards\r\nincorporated by reference in FMVSS 205 from the 1977 version (as amended by\r\nthe 1980 supplement) to the 1996 version of the industry standards. See Federal\r\nMotor Vehicle Standards; Glazing Materials; Low Speed Vehicles, 68 Fed. Reg.\r\n43964 (July 25, 2003). No part of this Final Rule was focused on ejection\r\nmitigation using advanced glazing.\r\n\n205 to be a minimum standard. Rather, we believe NHTSA deliberately chose to\r\nretain the option of tempered glass by abandoning the proposed rule requiring\r\nadvanced glazing.20        F.     Preemption Analysis\r\n\r\nBased on Geier and Williamson, Appellant's common law products liability claims\r\nwould restrict a manufacturer's choice of glass and would constitute a \"state law\"\r\nimposing a duty upon manufacturers of all similar vehicles to install laminated\r\nglass in side and rear windows. We believe such a state law would frustrate two\r\nsignificant federal purposes underlying FMVSS 205—namely Congress'\r\nfundamental desire to promote safety and the collateral goal of increasing seatbelt\r\nuse. We believe NHTSA's deliberate decision not to require laminated glass in all\r\nvehicle windows demonstrates a determination that safety is best served where\r\nmanufacturers may choose the safer choice for each vehicle. Further, a state law\r\nwhich increases safety for unbelted passengers while simultaneously decreasing\r\nsafety for lawfully belted passengers would frustrate the collateral federal purpose\r\nof increasing seatbelt use. Accordingly, we find Appellant's state tort suit\r\nrequiring laminated glass would stand as an obstacle to significant federal safety\r\nobjectives and is therefore preempted.  IV.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons and having considered Williamson, this Court's previous\r\ndecision is reaffirmed.\r\n\r\n20 Both Hinton and O'Hara found NHTSA's 2002 Withdrawal of Proposed\r\nRulemaking was parallel to the Coast Guard's statements in Sprietsma v. Mercury\r\nMarine, 537 U.S. 51 (2002). In Sprietsma, the USSC considered whether a claim\r\nthat a motor boat should have been equipped with a propeller guard was preempted\r\nby the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1972, 46 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4311. In our view,\r\nSprietsma is inapposite because it involved the government's decision not to\r\nregulate in an area devoid of federal regulation. Any such attempt to assign\r\npreemptive effect to nonexistent federal law is, in our judgment, meritless. In\r\ncontrast, here, FMVSS 205 is a federal regulation from which a federal purpose\r\nmay be gleaned. Thus, we are persuaded that Sprietsma is distinguishable from the\r\nline of cases dealing with FMVSS 205 and does not impact our analysis.\r\n\nREAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting\r\nin a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: This case is before us on remand from the United\r\nStates Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of Williamson v. Mazda Motor of\r\nAmerica, Inc., 131 S.Ct. 1131 (2011). Although I previously joined in the result\r\nthat the majority reaches now for a second time, my reconsideration in light of\r\nWilliamson leads me to the opposite conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn Williamson, the Court discussed Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S.\r\n861 (2000). In doing so, it made clear that state tort suits are preempted only when\r\nthe evidence shows that retaining manufacturer choice is “a significant objective of\r\nthe federal regulation.” Williamson, 131 S.Ct. at 1136 (emphasis in original). The\r\nCourt’s language emphasizes the clear evidence it relied on in Geier to support a\r\nfinding of preemption. Id. at 1137. (“DOT’s contemporaneous explanation of its\r\n1984 regulation [found to preempt state tort suits in Geier] made clear that\r\nmanufacturer choice was an important means for achieving its basic objectives.”)\r\n(emphasis added). The Court then lists four specific reasons that had been\r\narticulated by the agency itself in that contemporaneous explanation for\r\ndetermining that manufacturer choice was needed. Id. (citing agency explanation\r\nthat phase-in period for requiring airbags was needed because doing so would\r\n“give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and develop other, better\r\npassive restraint systems”; avoid a public backlash; avoid potential injuries to\r\nunbelted occupants, particularly children; and avoid possibility that airbags would\r\nnot be replaced when needed because of the high cost of doing so). The Court\r\nfurther explained that the history of the regulation at issue in Geier and the\r\nGovernment’s understanding of it also supported the conclusion that tort liability\r\nwas preempted. Id. at 1136-37.\r\n\r\nTurning to the regulation at issue in Williamson, the Court found that it, unlike the\r\nregulation at issue in Geier, did not reflect a significant objective of preserving\r\nmanufacturer choice. The Williamson Court took the time to note each of the\r\nspecific reasons given by the agency for the need to preserve manufacturer choice\r\nin Geier and their absence from the agency explanation in Williamson. Id. at 1138.\r\nThe Court then turned to the reasons cited by the agency in Williamson for\r\ndeclining to require a single standard, and, despite some references to minor safety\r\nconcerns, found that the agency had declined to require a particular safety measure\r\nbecause of cost-effectiveness concerns. Id. at 1138-39. Thus, although the agency\r\nclearly chose to maintain manufacturer choice, the Court found that it did not do so\r\nas an affirmative, significant objective.\r\n\nTurning then to this case and the evidence regarding the NHTSA’s decision not to\r\nimpose in FMVSS 205 a requirement that advanced glazing be used in side\r\nwindows, as I read the relevant agency documents, they fail to demonstrate that the\r\nNHTSA had any objective of maintaining manufacturer choice, much less a\r\nsignificant objective in doing so. The NHTSA discontinued its study of the\r\nbenefits of advanced glazing and withdrew its proposal to require it in side\r\nwindows because it believed its resources would be better devoted to developing\r\nregulations related to other ejection mitigation devices and because of cost and\r\nminor safety concerns. See Notice of Withdrawal, 67 Fed. Reg. 41,365 (June 18,\r\n2002). The NHTSA had explained in its Ejection Mitigation Using Advanced\r\nGlazing Final Report (Aug. 2001) (Final Report) that it encountered difficulty in\r\nquantifying the neck injuries that should be attributed to the use of advanced\r\nglazing in place of tempered glass. See Final Report at 36 (“No assessment of\r\nactual neck injury levels due to shear loads or moments was made since no\r\naccepted lateral neck injury criteria exist.”). The agency further noted extreme\r\nvariability in test results aimed at collecting data on neck loads. See id. (stating\r\nthat both the lowest and second highest measurements of axial neck load were\r\nobtained in replicate tests on tempered glass impacts). None of these reasons\r\nexpress the agency’s belief that manufacturer choice is needed in order to achieve\r\nan agency objective and therefore is a significant objective in and of itself.\r\n\r\nThe NHTSA’s explanation of its decision not to pursue study of advanced glazing\r\nparallels that of the Coast Guard in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51\r\n(2002). In Sprietsma, the United States Supreme Court found that a state tort\r\naction was not preempted when the Coast Guard declined to require installation of\r\npropeller guards on all boats. The Sprietsma Court characterized the Coast\r\nGuard’s explanation for its decision as “reveal[ing] only a judgment that the\r\navailable data did not meet the . . . ‘stringent’ criteria for federal regulation.” Id. at\r\n66-67. Moreover, the Coast Guard’s decision not to mandate propeller guards was\r\ndue in part to concerns that “feasible propeller guards might prevent penetrating\r\ninjuries but increase the potential for blunt trauma caused by collision with the\r\nguard.” Id. at 61. Nonetheless, the Sprietsma Court found that the Coast Guard\r\n“most definitively did not reject propeller guards as unsafe[,]” citing the Coast\r\nGuard’s indication that it might promote propeller guard use as a means of\r\nreducing propeller strike accidents. Id. at 67 & n.11. Advanced glazing is much\r\nthe same. It prevents ejection but might increase the risk of comparatively minor\r\ninjury. In addition, the NHTSA has most definitively not rejected advanced\r\n\nglazing as unsafe, continuing to require its use in windshields. See FMVSS 205;\r\nO’Hara v. General Motors Corp., 508 F.3d 753, 761-63 (5th Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nThe Sprietsma Court also noted that the Coast Guard focused on the lack of a\r\nuniversally appropriate propeller guard for all types of boat operation; it reasoned\r\nthat “nothing in [the Coast Guard’s] official explanation would be inconsistent\r\nwith a tort verdict premised on a jury’s finding that some type of propeller guard\r\nshould have been installed on this particular kind of boat equipped with\r\nrespondent’s particular type of motor.” Id. at 67. Although the NHTSA has made\r\nno comparable statement to the effect that no single standard might be universally\r\nappropriate for side window glazing, it is also clear that the NHTSA did not make\r\nvehicle-specific determinations or formulate an objective that manufacturers’ fleets\r\ncontain a mixture of devices, as the DOT did in Geier. See Geier, 529 U.S. at 878-\r\n81. Indeed, if, as the majority finds, the NHTSA’s regulation was designed to\r\nmaintain manufacturer choice so that they would install the safer choice for each\r\nvehicle, the regulation is entirely consistent with a tort verdict premised on a jury’s\r\nfinding that advanced glazing should have been used in a particular window of a\r\nparticular vehicle model. See Sprietsma at 67.\r\n\r\nFinally, I do not read the NHTSA explanation as finding that use of advanced\r\nglazing would “decreas[e] safety for lawfully belted passengers” as the majority\r\nconcludes.21 Therefore, I find no basis for concluding that requiring advanced\r\nglazing would frustrate what the majority acknowledges is merely a collateral\r\nfederal purpose of increasing seatbelt use. Williamson, supra.\r\n\r\nThus, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21Indeed, the Final Report implies that advanced glazing would provide some\r\nsafety benefits to belted as well as unbelted occupants. The report indicates that\r\nbelted occupants may occasionally be ejected from vehicles. See Final Report at\r\n15. It also indicates that a substantial portion of ejection injuries result from partial\r\nejections, though without noting whether belted occupants may be partially\r\nejected. Id. at 9. The Final Report does not indicate whether estimates of the\r\noverall costs and benefits of advanced glazing for belted occupants are available.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27192","title":"Sulton v.

Sulton and his wife,\r\nWillie Mae Scott (Scott), sued HealthSouth and several of its nurses, alleging that\r\nSulton had been injured by the defendants’ negligent provision of nursing care.\r\nScott alleged a cause of action for loss of consortium. Sulton died of unrelated\r\ncauses prior to trial. In the survival action, a jury found against all defendants and\r\nawarded $306,693.25 in economic damages but no non-economic damages. In the\r\nloss of consortium action, the jury found HealthSouth alone liable to Scott for four\r\nmillion dollars in non-economic damages. The jury also found that HealthSouth\r\nhad been willful, wanton, or reckless. In the punitive damages phase of the\r\nbifurcated proceedings, the jury awarded eight million dollars in punitive damages.\r\nHealthSouth moved for JNOV, new trial absolute, and new trial nisi remittitur.\r\nThese motions were denied. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\nI.\t    Did the trial court err when it instructed the jury that heightened risk creates\r\n       a greater duty of care in a medical malpractice case?\r\n\r\nII.\t   Was the verdict form flawed such that Appellants were prejudiced?\r\n\nIII.\t   Did the trial court err when it permitted Respondents to refer to\r\n        HealthSouth's net operating revenue?\r\n\r\n                                     DISCUSSION\r\nI. Heightened duty of care in jury charge\r\n\r\nAppellants argue they are entitled to a new trial because the trial court improperly\r\ninstructed the jury that they owed a heightened duty of care to Sulton and Scott.\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nA jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the\r\ncorrect definition and adequately covers the law. Keaton ex rel. Foster v.\r\nGreenville Hosp. System, 334 S.C. 488, 495-96, 514 S.E.2d 570, 574 (1999). An\r\nerroneous jury instruction constitutes grounds for reversal only if the appellant can\r\nshow prejudice from the erroneous instruction. Ellison v. Simmons, 238 S.C. 364,\r\n372, 120 S.E.2d 209, 213 (1961).\r\n\r\nIn a medical malpractice action, the duty of care under South Carolina law is “that\r\nof an average, competent practitioner acting in the same or similar circumstances.”\r\nKing v. Williams, 276 S.C. 478, 482, 279 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1981) (citation\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court instructed the jury over Appellants’ objection that\r\n\r\n        [I]t is the general law applicable to all persons that if there is a great\r\n        degree of danger present then there is a greater duty of care to percent\r\n        [prevent] injuries to other persons. A similar rule applies to\r\n        physicians or healthcare providers in their treatment of their patients.\r\n        When there’s a risk of substantial danger present and the symptoms of\r\n        the patient are consistent with such a risk then the healthcare provider\r\n        has a duty to respond in proportion to the risk. The greater the risk of\r\n        the condition to the patient the greater the duty of the healthcare\r\n        provider to respond appropriately and to provide appropriate\r\n        treatment.\r\n\r\nAppellants contend that this charge wrongly heightened their duty and that they\r\nwere prejudiced thereby. We agree.\r\n\nIn Pittman v. Stevens, 364 S.C. 337, 613 S.E.2d 378 (2005), this Court addressed a\r\nnearly identical jury instruction.1 In Pittman, the trial court failed to use this\r\ncharge when requested to do so. Id. at 340, 613 S.E.2d at 379. After finding that\r\nthe trial court did not err since the jury charge as a whole correctly stated South\r\nCarolina law, the Court explained that \"there is no South Carolina case law\r\nsupporting [the heightened duty instruction's] application in a medical malpractice\r\naction.\" Id. at 342, 613 S.E.2d at 380-81. Such a charge is likely to confuse or\r\nmislead a jury into believing that the duty is something greater than \"ordinary care\r\nunder the circumstances.\" Id. at 343, 613 S.E.2d at 381. The Court concluded by\r\nstating that \"this instruction is even more inappropriate in a medical\r\nmalpractice case\" because \"[e]very medical decision encompasses varying\r\ndegrees of danger.\" Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nRespondents argue that Pittman is distinguishable from the present case because\r\nthe Pittman Court merely refused to reverse the trial court after it declined to give\r\nthis requested instruction, while the present case considers the question whether it\r\nwas error to give the instruction. Although this distinction is accurate, Pittman\r\ndoes not merely hold that the instruction was superfluous but also criticizes it as\r\nimproper, especially in a medical malpractice case. We hold that it was error for\r\nthe trial court to give the instruction.\r\n\r\nRespondents argue that Appellants were not prejudiced despite the improper\r\ninstruction because the trial court also advised the jury of the proper standard at\r\nseveral points. Conversely, Appellants urge us to hold, as did a North Carolina\r\ncourt, that as a rule \"an erroneous instruction upon a material aspect of the case is\r\nnot cured by the fact that in other portions of the charge the law is correctly stated.\"\r\nCrow v. Ballard, 263 N.C. 475, 478, 139 S.E.2d 624, 627 (N.C. 1965). The North\r\nCarolina standard does not comport with South Carolina jurisprudence regarding\r\njury instructions, which analyzes jury instructions as a whole and emphasizes\r\nprejudice analysis. See, e.g., Ardis v. Sessions, 383 S.C. 528, 682 S.E.2d 249, 251\r\n(2009). Nevertheless, we agree that, in this case, the erroneous instruction went to\r\nthe heart of the case and was \"not cured by the fact that in other portions of the\r\ncharge the law [was] correctly stated\" because Appellants introduced evidence to\r\ndemonstrate that they did exercise reasonable care in relation to the pressure ulcer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1This charge is apparently taken from Judge Ralph King Anderson Jr.’s book,\r\nSouth Carolina Request to Charge.\r\n\nMoreover, if the jurors believed that the law imposed a heightened duty on\r\nAppellants as a result of Sulton's vulnerability, their perception of the\r\negregiousness of Appellants’ breach of that duty would likely have been\r\ncorrespondingly exaggerated. Thus, the fact that the jurors also found HealthSouth\r\nreckless, willful, and wanton and awarded substantial punitive damages\r\ndemonstrates the pervasive potential impact of the improper charge.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find that Appellants are entitled to a new trial.\r\n\r\nAlthough not necessary to our decision, we address two additional issues raised by\r\nHealthSouth that may arise upon retrial.\r\n\r\nII. Verdict form\r\n\r\nHealthSouth argues that flaws in the verdict form entitle it to a new trial. We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n“[A] special verdict question may be so defective in its formulation that its\r\nsubmission results in a prejudicial effect which constitutes reversible error. . . . The\r\nprejudicial effect of a defective verdict form may be cured where the trial court\r\nprovides clear and cogent jury instructions.” South Carolina Dept. of Transp. v.\r\nFirst Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 303, 641 S.E.2d 903, 908-09 (2007)\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn the liability stage of the proceedings in this case, both the Appellants and\r\nRespondents submitted proposed verdict forms. Over Appellants' objection, the\r\ntrial court provided the jury with the verdict form that had been submitted by\r\nRespondents. The first question on the verdict form was designed to permit a\r\nfinding of liability on the survival action, the second question on the consortium\r\naction. Each question began with a textual portion that read, \"We the jury find for\r\nthe Plaintiff . . . and against the Defendant HealthSouth Corporation . . . and the\r\nfollowing:\" This introductory text was followed by a list of the names of the\r\nindividual nurses, from which the jury could select any or all or, alternatively,\r\nselect \"NONE OF THE ABOVE.\" An additional portion of each question allowed\r\nthe jury to determine the related damages. The third question asked the jury\r\nwhether it found that \"HealthSouth Corporation . . . by and through its employees\r\nwas reckless, willful, or wanton and that their conduct was proximate cause of\r\ninjury to Plaintiff[.]\"\r\n\nHealthSouth argues that the verdict form failed to give the jury a way to find\r\nagainst some or all of the individual nurse defendants while simultaneously finding\r\nin favor of HealthSouth Corporation. We agree and find the form's overall\r\nstructure both confusing and prejudicial, since it strongly suggests that\r\nHealthSouth was necessarily more culpable than the individual defendants despite\r\nthe fact that Respondents' theory at trial was based on HealthSouth's vicarious\r\nrather than direct liability.\r\n\r\nIII. Punitive damages award\r\n\r\nAfter the jury returned a verdict finding HealthSouth reckless, willful, and wanton,\r\nthe court proceeded to a punitive damages phase of trial in which the jury returned\r\nan $8 million verdict against HealthSouth. HealthSouth argues that the trial court\r\nerred when it permitted Respondents to refer to HealthSouth's net operating\r\nrevenue. We agree.\r\n\r\nIn assessing punitive damages, “the wealth of a defendant is a relevant factor” in\r\ndetermining the defendant’s ability to pay, but only evidence of net worth and\r\nextrapolations from net worth may be introduced on the issue. Branham v. Ford\r\nMotor Co., 390 S.C. 203, 239-40, 701 S.E.2d 5, 24-25 (2010). In addition, such\r\nevidence must be handled cautiously, since “the presentation of evidence of a\r\ndefendant’s net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to\r\nexpress biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local\r\npresences.” Id. at 239, 701 S.E.2d at 24 (quoting Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512\r\nU.S. 415, 432 (1994)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court properly declined to admit HealthSouth's 10-K financial\r\nform, the only evidence offered by Respondents at the punitive damages phase.\r\nHowever, the trial court proceeded to permit Respondents' counsel, over\r\nHealthSouth's objection, to inform the jury that HealthSouth's 2009 net operating\r\nrevenue as shown on the 10-K was $1.911 billion.2\r\n\r\nThis was improper for two reasons. First, HealthSouth's financial information was\r\npresented to the jury through counsel's arguments without supporting evidence.\r\nSee South Carolina Dept. of Transp. v. Thompson, 357 S.C. 101, 105, 590 S.E.2d\r\n511, 513 (Ct. App. 2003) (“Arguments made by counsel are not evidence.”);\r\n\r\n2The record reflects that this phase was irregular, consisting solely of arguments.\r\nOnly the 10-K form was offered in evidence, and no evidence of any kind was\r\nactually admitted.\r\n\nO’Leary-Payne v. R.R. Hilton Head, II, Inc., 371 S.C. 340, 352, 638 S.E.2d 96,\r\n102 (Ct. App. 2006) (“Closing arguments must be confined to evidence in the\r\nrecord and reasonable inferences therefrom.”).3\r\n\r\nSecond, informing the jury of a corporation's net operating revenue is improper\r\nunder Branham, and the prejudicial effect of doing so is self-evident. Net revenue\r\nhas no necessary relation to net worth and it could be, as HealthSouth contends,\r\nthat shareholder equity was actually negative (i.e., the corporation had no net\r\nworth). Putting this huge sum of money into the minds of the jury, reflecting the\r\ncompany’s net income but accounting for none of its expenses and obligations, was\r\nalmost certainly misleading and very likely to have stirred any jury bias against big\r\nbusinesses. Branham, supra.      CONCLUSION\r\nBecause the trial court improperly instructed the jury that Appellants owed\r\nRespondents a heightened duty of care, we\r\n\r\nREVERSE AND REMAND for a new trial on all issues as to all Appellants.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3We do not suggest that the 10-K form should have been submitted into evidence.\r\nNeither do we preclude reliance on such financial data by an expert witness under\r\nRule 703, SCRE.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27193","title":"In the Matter of Michael D.

The\r\nfacts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                        Facts\r\n\r\nOn August 24, 2010, after the issuance of an indictment, respondent entered a plea\r\nagreement and pled guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (2000) admitting he made a false\r\nstatement to a governmental agency, that he acted willfully and knowingly, and\r\nthat the false statement was material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the\r\ngovernmental agency. On May 17, 2011, respondent was sentenced to five (5)\r\nyears of probation.

Cravens Ravenel, of Columbia, for Respondent Frank\r\n            L. Valenta, Jr..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent\r\n(Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a letter of caution, confidential admonition, or public reprimand.\r\nWe accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand. The facts, as set forth in\r\nthe Agreement, are as follows.         Facts\r\nRespondent is the General Counsel at the South Carolina Department of Motor\r\nVehicles (SCDMV). When a case brought as the result of a uniform traffic ticket\r\nis disposed of in court, the ticket is forwarded to SCDMV for processing. If the\r\nunderlying case is reopened by a judge, the judge issues an order requiring the\r\nSCDMV to return the ticket.\r\n\nIn respondent's opinion, the SCDMV was receiving orders to return tickets on\r\nreopened matters in which the court did not have jurisdiction. As a result,\r\nrespondent was concerned that his agency's return of the tickets assisted judges in\r\nviolating the law and that defense attorneys might have been encouraging judges to\r\noverlook jurisdictional issues.\r\n\r\nIn light of his concerns, between 2007 and 2009, respondent presented sessions on\r\ncriminal appeals at the Magistrate's Mandatory School. Issues related to the return\r\nof tickets in reopened cases were addressed during these presentations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, after consultation with other lawyers, at least one of whom had\r\nexperience in disciplinary matters, respondent began sending letters to judges who\r\nordered the SCDMV to return a ticket when respondent believed the order violated\r\nthe law. The letter advised the judge of respondent's view of the applicable law\r\nand requested the judge sign and return his letter if the judge wished the SCDMV\r\nto proceed with returning the ticket. Consequently, between September 2009 and\r\nJuly 2010, respondent willfully refused to comply with twenty-one magistrate\r\ncourt orders to return tickets. Instead of filing a motion to have the legal issue\r\njudicially resolved, respondent sent each magistrate a letter explaining his view of\r\nthe law, purportedly as a justification for his unilateral decision to disobey a court\r\ndirective.1\r\n\r\nIn November 2009, a judge who received one of respondent's letters instructed\r\nrespondent, once again, to return the ticket. Rather than complying with the\r\njudge's instruction, respondent sent a complaint against the judge to the\r\nCommission on Judicial Conduct. In March 2010, the Commission on Judicial\r\nConduct dismissed the complaint and, shortly thereafter, respondent ceased the\r\npractice of sending the letters, as well as unilaterally deciding what court orders he\r\nwould follow based on his own view of the law.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which respondent knew the defendant was represented by counsel,\r\nrespondent sent copies of his letter to counsel because he suspected that some of\r\nthe attorneys were not aware of the statutes and case law. However, in cases of pro\r\nse defendants, respondent did not provide a copy of his letter to the defendants. At\r\nthe time, respondent did not consider his letters to be ex parte communications\r\nbecause the SCDMV was not a party to the cases. Respondent acknowledges that,\r\n\r\n We do not reach the merits of the underlying dispute as it relates to the authority\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nof a judge to recall a ticket.\r\n\nalthough the SCDMV was not technically a party to the orders, it was the custodian\r\nof the tickets.                        Law\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provision of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.5(b) (lawyer shall\r\nnot communicate ex parte with a judge during a proceeding unless authorized to do\r\nso by law or court order). Respondent also admits he has violated the following\r\nRules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27195","title":"State v.

In 1980, we recognized that \"[t]he authority\r\nof the court to grant continuances and to determine the order in which cases shall\r\nbe heard is derived from its power to hear and decide cases.\" Williams v. Bordon's,\r\nInc., 274 S.C. 275, 279, 262 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1980). \"This adjudicative power of\r\nthe court carries with it the inherent power to control the order of its business to\r\nsafeguard the rights of litigants.\" Id. The time has now come for us to\r\nacknowledge that section 1-7-330 is at odds with this intrinsically judicial power.\r\nWe therefore hold that section 1-7-330 violates the separation of powers and\r\ntherefore is unconstitutional. However, because K.C. Langford, III, the Appellant\r\nherein, suffered no prejudice as a result of section 1-7-330, we affirm his\r\nconvictions.     FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On August 14, 2008, Ji Quing Chen, along with his son, Li Guan Xin, and\r\nwife, Li Ai Ming, left the Chinese restaurant they own in Johnston, South Carolina,\r\nshortly after 10:00 p.m. and headed home. With them was a black bag containing\r\nthe day's earnings. When they arrived home, Ji Quing stayed outside to water\r\nsome plants while his wife and son entered the house. As he was tending to his\r\ngarden, three men wearing masks came out from the bushes, forced him to the\r\nground, hit him, and took his wallet. Concerned that his father had not yet come\r\ninside, Li Guan stepped out onto the porch to check on him. Once he was outside,\r\nthe men forced Li Guan to the ground and asked where the restaurant's money was.\r\nHe told them it was in the house, and one of the men went inside to find it. That\r\nman returned shortly with the black bag, and all three of them ran off. Because the\r\nmen wore masks, the victims were unable to provide a useful description to law\r\nenforcement. Moreover, it does not appear the men left any forensic evidence\r\nduring the commission of these crimes.\r\n\r\n      Investigators eventually met with Alvin Phillips, who in a statement dated\r\nSeptember 28, 2008, confessed that he was one of the men who robbed the family.\r\nHe further identified his cousin and Langford as the two remaining suspects. In the\r\nabsence of an eye-witness identification and forensic evidence, Phillips' statement\r\n\nwas the only evidence implicating the other men. Langford was arrested shortly\r\nthereafter on October 3, and he was indicted for criminal conspiracy a few months\r\nlater in December 2008. However, he was not indicted for armed robbery, first\r\ndegree burglary, and kidnapping until May 5, 2010, nineteen months following his\r\narrest. He would remain incarcerated until his trial.\r\n\r\n       The State attributed the delay in procuring these indictments to difficulties in\r\nfinding Chinese interpreters to translate what Ji Quing and his family, none of\r\nwhom spoke English well, were relaying to investigators. Furthermore, Phillips\r\nretracted his statement implicating Langford while the two of them were housed in\r\nthe same detention facility. He did so first in a signed statement dated January 29,\r\n2009. On March 31, 2009, he signed another statement wherein he attested that the\r\noriginal statement he made to police in September 2008 was not true and he was\r\nnot in the \"right state of mind\" when he made it. According to the State, Langford\r\nand his co-defendant pressured Phillips into recanting. In fact, Phillips testified\r\nLangford even brought him these later statements to sign. To avoid further\r\nintimidation, Phillips was moved to another facility. At some point thereafter,\r\nalthough it is not clear when, Phillips again agreed to testify against Langford.\r\n\r\n       On June 29, 2009, nearly nine months after he was taken into custody,\r\nLangford made what appears to be a pro se motion for a speedy trial. A hearing\r\nwas held on May 17, 2010, and Langford renewed his motion at that time and\r\njoined it with a motion to dismiss.1 This was the date on which the State originally\r\nplanned to try Langford and his co-defendant, with Phillips serving as a\r\ncooperating witness who would testify against them. But the State received word\r\nthat morning that Phillips decided to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination\r\nand would not testify at the trial. Allegedly, this was due to pressure Langford and\r\nPhillips' cousin continued to exert on him even after his transfer. Phillips now\r\nwould not be available for cross-examination at trial, and the State therefore could\r\nnot use his prior statement implicating Langford.2 Because the State's case against\r\n\r\n\r\n1 It does not appear the court ever ruled on Langford's ostensibly pro se motion\r\nprior to this hearing. Moreover, the record suggests that the hearing was held upon\r\nthe motion of Langford's co-defendant, Phillips' cousin. This motion was styled as\r\na motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for a speedy trial.\r\n2 See Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 126 (1968) (holding the Confrontation\r\nClause bars the admission of a statement of a co-defendant who remains silent\r\nwhich is to be used against the other defendant at trial).\r\n\nLangford rested almost exclusively on Phillips' statement, without it the State\r\neffectively was prevented from going forward.\r\n\r\n       To remedy the situation, the State needed to try Phillips first or, presumably,\r\nobtain a guilty plea with the attendant waiver of his right to remain silent.\r\nHowever, Phillips had retained new counsel just eight days prior to the hearing\r\nwho understandably was not ready to move forward during that term of court. The\r\nState therefore requested a continuance so it could proceed against Phillips at the\r\nnext available opportunity, at which point it would then be able to try Langford.\r\nAlthough the court was \"deeply concerned\" by the twenty-month delay in the case,\r\nit found that \"[n]one of this delay was occasioned by any impropriety on the part of\r\nthe State.\" It also recognized that, for all intents and purposes, the State could not\r\nproceed in the absence of Phillips' testimony. The court accordingly denied\r\nLangford's motion to dismiss and granted the State a continuance. However,\r\ncognizant of the delays which had already accrued, the court ordered the State to\r\ntry Langford within nine months, and it further directed that Langford could renew\r\nhis motion at that time if the State failed to do so.3\r\n\r\n       Phillips pled guilty in August 2010 and once again agreed to testify for the\r\nState. Langford's case was then called for trial on September 7, 2010, nearly two\r\nyears after his arrest.4 The jury convicted Langford on all four charges, and the\r\ncourt sentenced him to twenty years' imprisonment on the armed robbery,\r\nkidnapping, and first degree burglary charges, and five years' imprisonment on the\r\ncivil conspiracy charges, all to run concurrently. This appeal followed. After the\r\nappeal was perfected, the court of appeals granted permission for the South\r\nCarolina Public Defender Association to file an amicus curiae brief challenging the\r\nconstitutionality of section 1-7-330. This case subsequently was certified to us\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The court would have set an earlier deadline, but there were scheduling conflicts \n\r\nwith a pending death penalty trial and a visiting judge. Additionally, while \n\r\nLangford did file what seems to be another pro se motion to dismiss on May 25, \n\r\n2010, it does not appear the court ruled on it.\n\r\n4 This was only the second General Sessions term of court for Edgefield County \n\r\nafter May 17, 2010, the term in which the State received the continuance. \n\r\n\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED \n\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Is section 1-7-330 constitutional?\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Did Langford suffer any prejudice as a result of the solicitor controlling\r\n          when his case would be called for trial?\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t    SECTION 1-7-330\r\n\r\n        We agree with the Public Defender Association that section 1-7-330 is\r\nunconstitutional. Before we reach the merits of this question, however, we must\r\nfirst address the State's position that it is not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n       Constitutional questions must be preserved like any other issue on appeal. In\r\nre McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001). As the State\r\ncorrectly notes, this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the circuit court. See\r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (stating an\r\nissue must have been raised to and ruled upon to be preserved for review).\r\nMoreover, Langford's statements of the issue on appeal do not raise this question.\r\nSee Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is\r\nnot set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.\"). Indeed, this issue is only\r\nbefore us by way of the amicus brief filed by the Public Defender Association, and\r\nour rules provide that an amicus brief \"shall be limited to argument of the issues on\r\nappeal as presented by the parties.\" Rule 213, SCACR (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, we previously have considered arguments raised only by an\r\namicus when they concern a \"matter of significant public interest.\" Ex parte\r\nBrown, 393 S.C. 214, 216, 711 S.E.2d 899, 900 (2011). We stress that this\r\nexception to Rule 213 must be applied narrowly and only under the appropriate\r\ncircumstances so as not to eviscerate the long-standing preservation requirements\r\nin our jurisprudence. However, we have little trouble concluding that who decides\r\nwhen criminal defendants in this State should be tried is a matter of significant\r\n\n                                            5\r\npublic interest as envisioned by Brown.         We therefore proceed to analyze the\r\nconstitutionality of section 1-7-330.\r\n\r\n      Section 1-7-330 states in full:\r\n\r\n      The solicitors shall attend the courts of general sessions for their\r\n      respective circuits. Preparation of the dockets for general sessions\r\n      courts shall be exclusively vested in the circuit solicitor and the\r\n      solicitor shall determine the order in which cases on the docket are\r\n      called for trial. Provided, however, that no later than seven days prior\r\n      to the beginning of each term of general sessions court, the solicitor in\r\n      each circuit shall prepare and publish a docket setting forth the cases\r\n      to be called for trial during the term.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the validity of this statute, we are reluctant to find it unconstitutional.\r\nSee In re Treatment and Care of Luckbaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 134, 568 S.E.2d 338,\r\n344 (2002). We will therefore make every presumption in favor of its validity. Id.\r\nThe party challenging the statute bears the heavy burden of proving that \"its\r\nrepugnance to the constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at 134-\r\n35, 568 S.E.2d at 344.\r\n\r\n        The Public Defender Association contends section 1-7-330 violates the\r\nseparation of powers by impermissibly conferring judicial responsibilities upon a\r\nmember of the executive branch. Our constitution mandates that \"the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial powers of the government shall be forever separate and\r\ndistinct from each other, and no person or persons exercising the functions of one\r\nof said departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\" S.C. Const.\r\nart. I, § 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 We do not take lightly the dissent's concern that by addressing the merits of the\r\nPublic Defender Association's argument we offend our rules of preservation, but\r\nremain convinced this issue falls easily within our exception. Moreover, if the\r\nissue is truly unpreserved, as the dissent contends, we are at a loss to understand\r\nwhy the dissent addresses the merits. Preservation in South Carolina is a threshold\r\nissue and if an issue is unpreserved, it is not properly before the court and the\r\nmerits should not be reached. See State v. Roach, 377 S.C. 2, 3, 659 S.E.2d 107,\r\n107 (2008) (noting that issues not preserved for review should not be addressed);\r\nState v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (same).\r\n\n      One of the prime reasons for separation of powers is the desirability of\r\n      spreading out the authority for the operation of the government. It\r\n      prevents the concentration of power in the hands of too few, and\r\n      provides a system of checks and balances. The legislative department\r\n      makes the laws; the executive department carries the laws into effect;\r\n      and the judicial department interprets and declares the laws.\r\n\r\nState ex rel. McLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1982).\r\n\r\n       We begin by ascertaining where in our system of government solicitors fall.\r\nWe note the only reference to solicitors in the constitution is in the article creating\r\nthe judicial department. See S.C. Const. art. V, § 24. However, this section also\r\nprovides that \"[t]he General Assembly shall provide by law for their duties.\" Id.\r\nTo that end, Section 1-1-110 of the South Carolina Code (2005) squarely places\r\nsolicitors in the executive branch. Moreover, the Solicitors' Association of South\r\nCarolina unequivocally states in its own amicus brief defending section 1-7-330,\r\n\"The Office of Solicitor is part of the Executive Branch of our state government.\"\r\nAccordingly, we conclude solicitors are members of the executive branch.\r\n\r\n       We must next determine whether vesting solicitors with the exclusive\r\nauthority to prepare the dockets for General Sessions is an infringement on the\r\ncourt's powers. \"[A] usurpation of powers exists, for purposes of [the]\r\nconstitutional separation of powers doctrine, when there is a significant\r\ninterference by one branch of government with the operations of another branch.\"\r\n16A Am. Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 246. This rule is not fixed and immutable,\r\nhowever, as there are grey areas which are \"tolerated in complex areas of\r\ngovernment.\" McInnis, 278 S.C. at 313, 295 S.E.2d at 636 (1982). There\r\nconsequently is \"some overlap of authority and some encroachment to a limited\r\ndegree.\" Id.; see also 16A Am. Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 244 (\"Separation of\r\npowers does not require that the branches of government be hermetically sealed;\r\nthe doctrine of separation requires a cooperative accommodation among the three\r\nbranches of government; a rigid and inflexible classification of powers would\r\nrender government unworkable.\"). At its core, the doctrine therefore \"is directed\r\nonly to those powers which belong exclusively to a single branch of government.\"\r\n16A Am. Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 246.\r\n\r\n      As we noted at the outset of this opinion, a court's power to hear and decide\r\ncases \"carries with it the inherent power to control the order of its business.\"\r\nWilliams, 274 S.C. at 279, 262 S.E.2d at 883. Setting the trial docket therefore is\r\nthe prerogative of the court. Section 1-7-330, on the other hand, states,\r\n\n\"Preparation of the dockets for general sessions courts shall be exclusively vested\r\nin the circuit solicitor and the solicitor shall determine the order in which cases on\r\nthe docket are called for trial.\" (emphasis added). Vesting a member of the\r\nexecutive branch with the exclusive authority to perform an inherently judicial\r\nfunction unquestionably is a violation of separation of powers. See Hagy v. Pruitt,\r\n331 S.C. 213, 222, 500 S.E.2d 168, 173 (Ct. App. 1998) (Howard, J., concurring)\r\n(\"[A] statute which attempts to exercise ultimate authority over the inherent power\r\nof the court is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers doctrine\r\n. . . .\"), aff'd, 339 S.C. 425, 529 S.E.2d 714 (2000). This is not a grey area where\r\nsome encroachment can be tolerated, but rather a complete invasion into the court's\r\ndomain. The dissent, however, takes a different approach and contends that finding\r\nthe statute unconstitutional will somehow permit courts to infringe upon the\r\npowers of the solicitor.6 Nevertheless, the dissent correctly acknowledges that the\r\ndiscretion afforded the solicitor \"does not mean that the solicitor's authority is\r\nunrestrained by judicial oversight. The trial judge has the ultimate authority to\r\ndetermine whether a case called by the solicitor will be tried at a particular\r\njuncture.\" Thus, it appears the dissent truly believes the court has always had the\r\nauthority to control the docket. In light of that position, we are at a loss as to why\r\nit believes our holding today infringes on the solicitor's power.\r\n\r\n       In fact, we believe our holding is consistent with the dissent's support for the\r\nimportance of judicial restraint on prosecutorial power. However, unlike the\r\ndissent, we recognize that by providing that the \"[p]reparation of the dockets for\r\ngeneral sessions courts shall be exclusively vested in the circuit solicitor and the\r\nsolicitor shall determine the order in which cases on the docket are called for trial\"\r\n(emphasis added), the plain and unambiguous language of section 1-7-330 cannot\r\nbe squared with this oversight. The statute must therefore yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Undoubtedly, the solicitor has discretion in choosing how to proceed with a case,\r\nincluding whether to prosecute in the first place and whether he brings it to trial or\r\noffers a plea bargain. True too is the fact that he must grapple with marshaling\r\nwitnesses, ranging from victims, to police officers, to experts. Because the State\r\nbears the burden of proof, the solicitor also does not want to call the case before he\r\nhimself is ready. Moreover, he is the person most knowledgeable about the status\r\nof the case. These are all truisms we cannot dispute, and they are prerogatives of\r\nthe solicitor (and, to a large degree, of defense counsel as well) and are unaffected\r\nby our decision.\r\n\n      Accordingly, we hold section 1-7-330 is unconstitutional beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\r\n\r\n   II.   PREJUDICE\r\n\r\n       Our determination that section 1-7-330 violates separation of powers is not\r\ndispositive of Langford's appeal. To warrant reversal, Langford must demonstrate\r\nthat he sustained prejudice as a result of the solicitor setting when his case was\r\ncalled for trial. As this case comes to us, two different forms of prejudice are\r\nalleged: (1) Langford was denied his right to due process because section 1-7-330\r\npermitted the solicitor to judge shop, and (2) Langford was denied his right to a\r\nspeedy trial. We disagree that Langford's trial suffered from any infirmities as a\r\nresult of section 1-7-330 and therefore affirm his convictions.\r\n\r\n         A. Due Process\r\n\r\n       We consider first whether the power impermissibly granted to the solicitor\r\nby section 1-7-330 enabled him to violate Langford's due process rights. Although\r\nmany different violations are discussed anecdotally, the only due process violation\r\nsaid to have occurred in this case is that section 1-7-330 permitted the solicitor to\r\nselect the judge who would preside over Langford's trial. Although we question\r\nthe extent to which section 1-7-330 actually permitted judge shopping, we proceed\r\nassuming arguendo that it did so.\r\n\r\n       A criminal defendant has a due process right to have his case heard by a fair\r\nand impartial judge. See Schweiker v. McClure, 456 U.S. 188, 195 (1982) (\"[D]ue\r\nprocess demands impartiality on the part of those who function in judicial or quasi-\r\njudicial capacities.\"). Similarly, he has the right to have a judge assigned to his\r\ncase \"in a manner free from bias or the desire to influence the outcome of the\r\nproceedings.\" Cruz v. Abbate, 812 F.2d 571, 574 (9th Cir. 1987) (Kozinksi, J.). On\r\nthe other hand, he does not have a right to \"any particular procedure for the\r\nselection of the judge.\" Id. Thus, there is no right to have one's judge selected\r\nrandomly, nor is there one to have a case heard by any particular judge. Sinito v.\r\nUnited States, 750 F.2d 512, 515 (6th Cir. 1984). Moreover, a defendant has \"no\r\nvested right in the order in which cases are assigned for trial.\" Levine v. United\r\nStates, 182 F.2d 556, 559 (8th Cir. 1950).\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, a state may use any method to select judges so long as it is\r\nimpartial and not geared towards influencing the trial's outcome. Without a doubt,\r\npermitting solicitors—who represent a party in the case—to select the judge raises\r\n\nthe specter of partiality and calls the validity of the entire system into question. See\r\nUnited States v. Pearson, 203 F.3d 1243, 1257 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"In our view, if\r\nthe assignment of a case to an individual judge should not be based on 'the desire\r\nto influence the outcome of the proceedings,' then allowing a prosecutor to perform\r\nthat task raises substantial due process concerns.\" (quoting Cruz, 812 F.2d at 574));\r\nTyson v. Trigg, 50 F.3d 436, 442 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, J.) (\"The practice of\r\nallowing the prosecutor to choose the . . . trial judge is certainly unsightly, as the\r\nIndiana court of appeals opined; it does lack the appearance of impartiality . . . .\");\r\nCruz, 812 F.2d at 574 (\"The suggestion that the case assignment process is being\r\nmanipulated for motives other than the efficient administration of justice casts a\r\nvery long shadow, touching the entire criminal justice system . . . .\"). Some courts\r\nhave therefore struck down their systems of permitting prosecutors to select\r\njudges. State v. Simpson, 551 So. 2d 1303, 1304 (La. 1989) (doing so on due\r\nprocess grounds); McDonald v. Goodstein, 83 N.Y.S.2d 620, 625 (Sup. Ct. 1948)\r\n(holding that granting prosecutors control over choosing the judge threatens the\r\nindependence of the judiciary); see also Rosemond v. Catoe, 383 S.C. 320, 326 n.1,\r\n680 S.E.2d 5, 8 n.1 (2009) (\"We acknowledge the practice of the prosecutor\r\nselecting the trial judge is inappropriate and troubling.\").\r\n\r\n       However, as Judge Posner wrote, \"[t]he presumption that judges are\r\nunbiased is more than a pious hope.\" Tyson, 50 F.3d at 439. Furthermore, \"[t]he\r\nright to a judge who is free from the mere appearance of partiality is not part of\r\ndue process at all.\" Id. at 442. Hence, we will not presume the judge is partial\r\nsimply because he was selected by the prosecutor, for adopting such a rule would\r\n\"conflate[] the appearance of partiality with actual partiality.\" Francolino v.\r\nKuhlman, 224 F. Supp. 2d 615, 636 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), aff'd, 365 F.3d 137 (2d Cir.\r\n2004); see also Pearson, 203 F.3d at 1262 (\"[W]e cannot presume that a federal\r\njudge selected by the prosecutor will be his agent or henchman.\"). In order to be\r\nentitled to relief, a defendant therefore must establish actual partiality and\r\nprejudice on the part of the judge. Pearson, 203 F.3d at 1263 (finding prosecutorial\r\nselection of judge harmless error because there was no evidence the judge decided\r\nany issue in a manner more favorable to the prosecution than other judges would\r\nhave); Tyson, 50 F.3d at 442 (holding permitting the prosecutor to choose the judge\r\n\"does lack the appearance of impartiality[,] but that is all, so far as the record of\r\nthis case discloses, and it is not enough\"); Sinito, 750 F.2d at 515 (\"Even when\r\nthere is an error in the process by which the trial judge is selected . . . the defendant\r\nis not denied due process as a result of the error unless he can point to some\r\nresulting prejudice.\"); Francolino, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 636 (\"While the Court agrees\r\nthat the former system gave the appearance of partiality, maintaining that Justice\r\n\nSnyder was in fact partial is a separate matter.\"); State v. Huls, 676 So. 2d 160, 167\r\n(La. Ct. App. 1996) (noting a showing of prejudice was required even after the\r\nLouisiana Supreme Court struck down the practice of prosecutorial selection of\r\njudges on due process grounds).\r\n\r\n       The only support offered for the allegation of bias by the presiding judge in\r\nthis case, Judge Keesley, is the simple fact that he ruled in favor of the State on\r\nprevious issues that arose. Yet, there is not a shred of evidence that he did so out\r\nof any animus towards Langford or allegiance to the State. The contention that a\r\njudge was biased solely because he ruled against a defendant is untenable and\r\ninsulting towards the court, and it would set a dangerous precedent were we to\r\nsanction it. Moreover, Judge Keesley ordered in May 2010 that the State try the\r\ncase within nine months, and he would have ordered the State to do so sooner but\r\nfor scheduling conflicts. Simply put, there is no suggestion that Judge Keesley\r\nconducted Langford's trial in anything but a fair and impartial fashion. We\r\ntherefore find no evidence of actual prejudice in the record.\r\n\r\n       Undoubtedly, section 1-7-330 leaves room for abuses which can deny a\r\ndefendant due process. Not only can the State theoretically pick a judge to preside\r\nbecause he will favor the prosecution, but the Public Defender Association's brief\r\ncontains very troubling examples of abuses occurring in other cases and in other\r\nforms. Andrew M. Siegel, When Prosecutors Control Criminal Court Dockets:\r\nDispatches on History and Policy from a Land Time Forgot, 32 Am. J. Crim. L.\r\n325, 351-69 (2005) (detailing the potential ills of prosecutorial control of the\r\ndocket). Perhaps this is why South Carolina until today has stood alone amongst\r\nour sister states in permitting the prosecutor to control the docket. See id. at 327\r\n(noting that South Carolina is the only state with such a system). Of course, the\r\nvast majority of solicitors operate the criminal courts in a fair and even-handed\r\nmanner, and the abuses cited generally are not associated with any nefarious intent.\r\nThey do, however, inevitably stem from the nature of a system that allows the\r\nprosecution to control the criminal docket.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, we cannot equate the potential for abuse with it actually\r\noccurring in this case. Indeed, whether the statute may be unconstitutional in other\r\ncircumstances has no bearing on whether it has been unconstitutionally applied in\r\nthe case at hand. See Simeon v. Hardin, 451 S.E.2d 858, 871 (N.C. 1994) (holding\r\nprosecutorial control of the docket is facially constitutional and must be attacked\r\non an as-applied basis). We must therefore determine whether Langford's rights\r\nwere infringed based on the record before us. Under the lens of the only\r\n\ndeprivation alleged to have occurred in this case, we find no evidence that\r\nLangford's due process rights were violated even if the State was able to select\r\nJudge Keesley to preside.\r\n\r\n          B. Speedy Trial\r\n       Langford also contends the State's dilatory practices in calling his case\r\ndeprived him of his right to a speedy trial.7 The Sixth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution provides, in part, \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused\r\nshall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. Similarly, the\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution guarantees that \"[a]ny person charged with an offense\r\nshall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial.\" S.C. Const. art. I, § 14. The main goals\r\nof this right are to prevent undue pretrial incarceration, minimize the anxiety\r\nstemming from public accusation of a crime, and limit the possibility of long\r\ndelays impairing an accused's defense. State v. Waites, 270 S.C. 104, 107, 240\r\nS.E.2d 651, 653 (1978).\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court of the United States has deemed this right \"generically\r\ndifferent from any of the other rights enshrined in the Constitution for the\r\nprotection of the accused.\" Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 519 (1972). This is due\r\nin large part to the reality that \"[d]elay is not an uncommon defense tactic\" and\r\n\"deprivation of the right to a speedy trial does not per se prejudice the accused's\r\nability to defend himself.\" Id. at 521. More important, however, is the vagueness\r\nof this right, which makes it nearly impossible to determine when it has been\r\nviolated. Id. Indeed, the various procedural safeguards built into the criminal\r\nprocess require that it \"move at a deliberate pace.\" United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S.\r\n116, 120 (1966). Thus, \"there is no fixed point . . . when the State can put the\r\ndefendant to the choice of either exercising or waiving the right to a speedy trial.\"\r\nBarker, 407 U.S. at 521.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 We reject the State's argument that this issue is not preserved for review due to\r\nLangford's failure to renew his motion to dismiss when his case was called for trial.\r\nIn its May 2010 order denying Langford's original motions, the court required the\r\nState to try the case within nine months. It then said Langford could renew his\r\nmotion to dismiss at that time if the State failed to do so. Because nine months had\r\nnot yet passed when the case was tried, it would have been futile for Langford to\r\nraise the issue again. See State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 74, 447 S.E.2d 186, 187\r\n(1994) (finding appellant did not waive an objection by not presenting it to circuit\r\ncourt because it would have been futile to do so).\r\n\n       Accordingly, \"[t]he right to a speedy trial is necessarily relative. It is\r\nconsistent with delays and depends upon circumstances.\" Beavers v. Haubert, 198\r\nU.S. 77, 87 (1905). Stated differently, \"[a] speedy trial does not mean an\r\nimmediate one; it does not imply undue haste, for the [S]tate, too, is entitled to a\r\nreasonable time in which to prepare its case; it simply means a trial without\r\nunreasonable and unnecessary delay.\" Wheeler v. State, 247 S.C. 393, 400, 147\r\nS.E.2d 627, 630 (1966). Because of the vagaries of this unavoidably ad hoc\r\ninquiry, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that it \"can do little more than\r\nidentify some of the factors\" for courts to examine. Barker, 407 U.S. at 530. These\r\nfactors include the length of the delay, the reason for it, the defendant's assertion of\r\nhis right to a speedy trial, and any prejudice he suffered.8 Id.; see also Waites, 270\r\nS.C. at 107, 240 S.E.2d at 653 (recognizing the same factors apply under South\r\nCarolina law).\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has counseled further that none of these factors is \"either\r\na necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of\r\nspeedy trial.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 533. Instead, they are all related and must be\r\nconsidered along \"with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\" Id. Thus,\r\nthe Supreme Court created a balancing test which is a rejection of \"inflexible\r\napproaches\" and weighs \"the conduct of both the prosecution and the defense.\" Id.\r\nat 529-30. If a court concludes that this right has been violated, dismissal of the\r\ncharges \"is the only possible remedy.\" Id. at 522. A court's decision on whether to\r\ndismiss on speedy trial grounds is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See State v.\r\nEdwards, 374 S.C. 543, 571, 649 S.E.2d 112, 126 (Ct. App. 2007) (applying abuse\r\nof discretion standard to speedy trial claim), rev'd on other grounds, 384 S.C. 504,\r\n682 S.E.2d 820 (2009); see also State v. Redding, 561 S.E.2d 79, 80 (Ga. 2002)\r\n(noting the inquiry is whether court abused its discretion under Barker). \"An abuse\r\nof discretion occurs when the trial court's decision is based upon an error of law or\r\nupon factual findings that are without evidentiary support.\" Fields v. J. Haynes\r\nWaters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 555, 658 S.E.2d 80, 85 (2008)\r\n\r\n      We begin our analysis with the \"triggering mechanism\" of a speedy trial\r\nclaim, which is the length of the delay. Barker, 407 U.S. at 530. We should not\r\neven examine the remaining factors \"[u]ntil there is some delay which is\r\n\r\n8The circuit court did not cite to Barker or explicitly apply any of these factors.\r\nHowever, the court's analysis largely tracks the substance of the test, and no party\r\nhas contended the court did not use the proper legal framework when ruling on\r\nLangford's motions.\r\n\npresumptively prejudicial.\" Id. The clock starts running on a defendant's speedy\r\ntrial right when he is \"indicted, arrested, or otherwise officially accused,\" and\r\ntherefore we are to include the time between arrest and indictment. United States v.\r\nMacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6 (1982). The Supreme Court was quick to remind in\r\nBarker, however, that even the length of time necessary to trigger the full inquiry\r\n\"is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case.\" 407 U.S. at\r\n530-31. Thus, a simple prosecution for ordinary street crime may have a lower\r\nthreshold for a presumptively prejudicial delay than a more complex conspiracy\r\ncase. Id. at 531; see also id. at 531 n.31 (suggesting that a delay of nine months\r\ncould have been presumptively prejudicial in a case that depended on eyewitness\r\ntestimony (citing United States v. Butler, 426 F.2d 1275, 1277 (1st Cir. 1970))).\r\n\r\n       In the case before us, Langford's speedy trial clock began when he was\r\narrested on October 3, 2008, and ran until he was tried twenty-three months later\r\non September 7, 2010. Moreover, while the charges against him were serious, the\r\nfactual proof was not complicated. Thus, this length of time is presumptively\r\nprejudicial and triggers the remaining Barker inquiry. See Waites, 270 S.C. at 108,\r\n204 S.E.2d at 653 (holding a two-year-and-four-month delay in a prosecution for\r\nassault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and for pointing and presenting\r\na firearm implicated the rest of the Barker analysis); see also Doggett v. United\r\nStates, 505 U.S. 647, 652 n.1 (1992) (\"Depending on the nature of the charges, the\r\nlower courts have generally found postaccusation delay 'presumptively prejudicial'\r\nat least as it approaches one year.\"); Brooks v. State, 674 S.E.2d 871, 873-74 (Ga.\r\n2009) (finding a nineteen-month delay presumptively prejudicial in trial for\r\nmurder, aggravated assault, and firearms offenses).\r\n\r\n       Turning to the second element, the Supreme Court has stated that \"different\r\nweights should be assigned to different reasons\" for the delay. Barker, 407 U.S. at\r\n531. A deliberate attempt by the State to delay the trial as a means of impairing\r\nthe accused's ability to defend himself \"should be weighted heavily against the\r\ngovernment.\" Id. Neutral reasons, which could include overcrowded dockets or\r\nnegligence, are \"weighted less heavily\" but still count against the State because it\r\nbears the ultimate responsibility for these circumstances. Id.; see also State v.\r\nPittman, 373 S.C. 527, 549, 647 S.E.2d 144, 155 (2007) (\"The ultimate\r\nresponsibility for the trial of a criminal defendant rests with the State.\"). Delays\r\noccasioned by the defendant, however, weigh against him. Vermont v. Brillon, 129\r\nS. Ct. 1283, 1290 (2009). This is not only in accord with the reality that delay may\r\nbe a defense tactic, but it is also a recognition that a defendant should not be able\r\nto procure a dismissal of the charges against him due to delays he caused. See id.\r\n\n       The State advances two different reasons for the delays in Langford's\r\nprosecution. First, it argues that the initial twenty-month delay in indicting him\r\nwas due to its inability to have a \"meaningful\" conversation with the victims\r\nbecause it could not find an interpreter. Although we are not persuaded the State\r\nused its best efforts to secure an interpreter, there is no evidence that it\r\nintentionally tarried in finding one. At most, the State was negligent, and this is a\r\nneutral reason for delay which does not weigh heavily against it.\r\n\r\n       Next, the State contends the final four-month delay in trying Langford,\r\nrunning from May 2010 to September 2010, was the result of Langford coercing\r\nPhillips to not testify. From our review of the record, there is evidence that\r\nLangford and his co-defendant persuaded Phillips to remain silent. So long as he\r\ndid so, he would be unavailable for cross-examination. Thus, the State would be\r\nunable to use Phillips' original statement as evidence against Langford. See Bruton,\r\n391 U.S. at 126. The loss of this crucial piece of evidence therefore effectively\r\ngutted the State's case on the day of trial.\r\n\r\n       The State consequently needed to first procure a waiver of Phillips' right to\r\nremain silent, and then it could try Langford using the statement. Because Phillips'\r\nattorney was not ready to proceed during that term of court, however, a\r\ncontinuance was required for this to happen.9 From that point on, the State moved\r\nwith reasonable haste given the few General Sessions terms scheduled for\r\nEdgefield County during that time. We agree with the circuit court that the delays\r\nalready incurred are troubling, but we cannot ignore the fact that this additional\r\ndelay is the product of Langford's efforts to spoil the State's evidence. Therefore,\r\nwe will not count it against the State. See United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S.\r\n302, 316 (1986) (holding a defendant who causes delays in his trial \"should not be\r\nable upon return to the district court to reap the reward of dismissal for failure to\r\nreceive a speedy trial\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 Langford's argument that the State simply could have redacted Phillips' references\r\nto him in the statement to avoid Bruton misses the point. Phillips was the key\r\nprosecution witness, and his testimony was essential to the State's case. Holding\r\nthat the State was required to forego the use of Phillips' statement against Langford\r\nwithout consideration of why Phillips changed his mind would allow Langford to\r\nbenefit from his tampering with the State's star witness.\r\n\n        The third factor in the Barker analysis is the defendant's assertion of his\r\nright to a speedy trial. While Langford first filed what seems to be a pro se speedy\r\ntrial motion in June 2009, the record suggests that he never sought a ruling on it\r\nuntil the May 2010 hearing. Moreover, while Langford did file a pro se motion for\r\na speedy trial/motion to dismiss days after the court issued its May 2010 order, it\r\nwas never ruled upon and he never renewed his motion when the case was called\r\nfor trial. Although it may have been futile for him to raise the issue again from an\r\nerror preservation standpoint, the \"failure to assert the right will make it difficult\r\nfor a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.\" See Barker, 407 U.S. at\r\n532.   Finally, we must consider the prejudice Langford suffered. The Supreme\r\nCourt has identified three different types of prejudice the right to a speedy trial\r\nseeks to prevent: (1) oppressive pre-trial incarceration; (2) anxiety stemming from\r\nbeing publicly accused of a crime; and (3) the possibility that the accused's defense\r\nwill be impaired due to the death or disappearance of witnesses or the loss of\r\nmemory with the passage of time. Id. \"Of these, the most serious is the last,\r\nbecause the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the\r\nfairness of the entire system.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Langford was in jail for nearly two years pending trial. \"The time spent in\r\njail awaiting trial has a detrimental impact on the individual\" through its attendant\r\njob loss, disruption of family life, and encouragement of \"idleness.\" Id. While we\r\nare cognizant of not minimizing the deleterious effects of lengthy pre-trial\r\nincarceration, the two-year delay in bringing this case to trial does not amount to a\r\nconstitutional violation in the absence of any actual prejudice to Langford's case.10\r\nSee State v. Kennedy, 339 S.C. 243, 250, 528 S.E.2d 700, 704 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n(\"While Kennedy may have been slightly prejudiced by the twenty-six month\r\npretrial incarceration, the more important question is whether he was prejudiced\r\nbecause the delay impaired his defense.\"). To that end, Langford has not\r\ndemonstrated how his own defense was prejudiced by the delay. Although he does\r\nargue the final delay enabled the State to secure Phillips' testimony and thereby\r\nbolster its case against him, he fails to recognize that the State only had to do so\r\n\r\n\r\n10 While extreme delays may warrant relief based solely on pre-trial incarceration,\r\nthis case has not crossed that threshold. See Doggett, 505 U.S. at 657 (\"[T]o\r\nwarrant granting relief, negligence unaccompanied by particularized trial prejudice\r\nmust have lasted longer than negligence demonstrably causing such prejudice.\").\r\n\nbecause of his interference. Moreover, he cannot point to any evidence of anxiety\r\ncaused by the stigma of being accused of these crimes.\r\n\r\n       Looking at these factors and the case as a whole, and taking into account the\r\nbalance of the State's interests and Langford's, we do not believe the circuit court\r\nabused its discretion in finding Langford was not denied a speedy trial in the\r\nconstitutional sense.             CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, we hold section 1-7-330 is unconstitutional under\r\nthe separation of powers clause of our constitution. The General Sessions docket\r\nwill henceforth be managed pursuant to the administrative order issued in\r\nconjunction with this opinion. Nevertheless, we affirm Langford's convictions\r\nbecause he has not shown he was prejudiced by the solicitor's control over calling\r\nhis case for trial. In particular, we find no due process violation or a denial of his\r\nright to a speedy trial.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.                    PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent from that part of the opinion that\r\nfinds S.C. Code Ann. § 1-7-330 (2005) unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nAs explained below, the constitutionality of the statute is not before us. It is\r\naxiomatic that this Court will not address a constitutional issue unless it is\r\nnecessary to a resolution of the case. E.g., S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran,\r\n356 S.C. 413, 589 S.E.2d 753 (2003). It is also axiomatic that we sit to review the\r\nlower court's order based upon the issues properly presented by the parties for our\r\nconsideration. E.g., Herron v. Century BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 719 S.E.2d 640\r\n(2011). Constitutional issues are not exempt from issue preservation requirements.\r\nId. Further, our rule restricts amicus to the issues presented by the parties, Rule\r\n213, SCACR: to strike down a statute as unconstitutional based upon an amicus\r\nbrief is tantamount to a sua sponte declaration. Unless a statute infringes upon our\r\njurisdiction, we may not sua sponte declare it unconstitutional. See State v.\r\nKeenan, 278 S.C. 361, 296 S.E.2d 676 (1982). We should not decide the\r\nconstitutionality of § 1-7-330 on this record.\r\n\r\nEven if the constitutionality of § 1-7-330 were before us, under our existing\r\nprecedents I find that the statute does not offend the separation of powers doctrine.\r\nI agree that solicitors are executive officers. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-1-110 (2005).\r\nFurther, I agree that § 1-7-330 vests the exclusive authority to prepare the general\r\nsessions docket in the solicitor, and also authorizes her to determine the order in\r\nwhich the docketed cases are called. Finally, I do not disagree with the majority\r\nthat by vesting exclusive authority in the solicitor to prepare the general sessions\r\ndocket, and by permitting the solicitor to call cases from that docket in his desired\r\norder, § 1-7-330 could lead to unnecessary delay, oppressive haste, and other\r\nabuses. As I interpret the statute, however, I do not believe that it violates the\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution.\r\n\r\nWe have recently addressed a separation of powers challenge to prosecutorial\r\nauthority:   Under the separation of powers doctrine, which is the basis for\r\n             our form of government, the Executive Branch is vested with\r\n             the power to decide when and how to prosecute a case. Both\r\n             the South Carolina Constitution [footnote 5 citing S.C. Const.\r\n             art. V, § 24] and South Carolina case law [footnote 6 citing\r\n             McLeod v. Snipes, 266 S.C. 415, 223 S.E.2d 853 (1976)] place\r\n\n             the unfettered discretion to prosecute solely in the prosecutor's\r\n             hands. The Attorney General as the State's chief prosecutor\r\n             may decide when and where to present an indictment, and may\r\n             even decide whether an indictment should be sought.\r\n             Prosecutors may pursue a case to trial, or they may plea bargain\r\n             it down to a lesser offense, or they can simply decide not to\r\n             prosecute the offense in its entirety. The Judicial Branch is not\r\n             empowered to infringe on the exercise of this prosecutorial\r\n             discretion . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 291-292, 440 S.E.2d 341, 346-347\r\n             (1994) cited with approval in State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 146,\r\n             508 S.E.2d 857, 863 (1998); State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 40,\r\n             515 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1999).\r\n\r\nFurther, \"[a]ll the authorities agree that, in the exercise of a discretionary official\r\nact, an executive officer cannot be restrained, coerced, or controlled by the judicial\r\ndepartment.\" State v. Ansel, 76 S.C. 395, 57 S.E. 185 (1907).\r\n\r\nSubject to the limitations discussed below, the solicitor has the discretion to decide\r\nwhen to prosecute and how to prosecute a case. This does not mean that the\r\nsolicitor's authority is unrestrained by judicial oversight. The trial judge has the\r\nultimate authority to determine whether a case called by the solicitor will be tried\r\nat a particular juncture. See State v. Mikell, 257 S.C. 315, 185 S.E.2d 814 (1971)\r\n(\"In the calling of cases for trial the solicitor has a broad discretion in the first\r\ninstance, and the trail [sic] judge has a broad discretion in the final analysis.\").\r\nThis is so because the trial judge has \"the inherent power to control the order of\r\n[the court's] business to safeguard the rights of litigants\" through her discretion to\r\ngrant a continuance. Williams v. Bordon's Inc., 274 S.C. 275, 262 S.E.2d 881\r\n(1980). In Williams, the Court held the General Assembly violated the separation\r\nof powers doctrine by enacting a statute which purported to limit the court's\r\ndiscretion to grant a continuance in any case which involved an attorney-legislator\r\nas \"attorney of record, witness, or otherwise.\" If we read § 1-7-330 as preventing a\r\ntrial judge from exercising her discretion to require a solicitor to place a case upon\r\na future docket if necessary to safeguard the rights of the defendant, then we would\r\nrender the statute unconstitutional. Such an interpretation would create a\r\nseparation of powers issue, not between the executive and the judiciary, but\r\nbetween the legislative branch and the judicial branch since we would find the\r\n\nstatute unconstitutionally infringes upon judicial authority. Williams, supra.\r\nNothing in § 1-7-330 affects the court's inherent authority to safeguard litigants'\r\nrights; rather, the statute represents the reasonable delegation of preparing the\r\ngeneral sessions docket to the solicitor.\r\n\r\nThe solicitor is a party to every general sessions proceeding, and has the\r\ninformation and resources necessary to determine when a case is ready to be\r\ncalled. If the solicitor is perceived to be unlawfully delaying the call of a case, the\r\ndefendant has available the remedy of a speedy trial motion: If it is called with\r\nundue haste, the defendant may seek a continuance. It is only logical to have the\r\nsolicitor initially set the docket since he knows the status of the law enforcement\r\ninvestigation, of the examination of the forensic evidence, of any codefendant's\r\ncase, and of the defendant's other charges. See State v. Mikell, supra (\"A\r\nprosecuting attorney normally has many cases for disposition. He must plan ahead\r\nto expedite the work of the court . . . .\"). The solicitor bears the burden of proof in\r\nevery case and should not ordinarily be compelled to call his case before he is\r\nready. Id.(\"solicitor has authority to call cases in such order and in such manner as\r\nwill facilitate the efficient administration of his official duties, subject to the\r\nbroad discretion of the trial judge.\")(emphasis supplied). In my opinion, there is\r\nno separation of powers problem with § 1-7-330. E.g., State v. Thrift, supra.\r\n\r\nFinally, I disagree with the premise of the majority's opinion, \"that section 1-7-330\r\nis at odds with [the courts'] intrinsically judicial power.\" Even if one were to grant\r\nthat the statute creates some overlap of executive and judicial authority, it cannot\r\nbe said that preparing a docket and calling cases from that docket usurps the\r\njudicial power vested in the unified judicial system under S.C. Const. art. V, §1\r\n(1977). See Carolina Glass Co. v. Murray, 87 S.C. 270, 291-292, 69 S.E. 391,\r\n399 (1910) overruled in part on other grounds McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243,\r\n329 S.E.2d 741 (1985).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, however, we cannot reach the constitutionality of that statute in this\r\ncase. Were we to reach the issue, I would interpret the statute in a way that does\r\nnot offend the separation of powers doctrine. If the Court is nonetheless\r\ndetermined to declare § 1-7-330 unconstitutional, then we must both deal with our\r\nprecedents and describe the new system in sufficient detail that the parties most\r\nintimately involved in the process can implement the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nI concur in the majority's decision to affirm this appeal and in the sentiment that\r\nour General Sessions docketing system needs reform, but dissent from so much of\r\nthat opinion as reaches and decides the constitutionality of § 1-7-330.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n         RE: DISPOSITION OF CASES IN GENERAL SESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to the provisions of S.C. CONST. Art. V §4, and in furtherance of\r\nthis Court's decision in State v. Langford,\r\n\r\n      IT IS ORDERED that:\r\n\r\n   Cases in General Sessions Court shall proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n         (A) All cases shall be assigned to a 180 day track consistent with the\r\n         Uniform Differentiated Case Management Order which is incorporated\r\n         herein and made a part hereof by reference. The Chief Judge for\r\n         Administrative Purposes (CJAP) may entertain motions to remove any\r\n         case from the track and establish a scheduling order where appropriate.\r\n\r\n         (B) Cases within the 180 day track or cases that have exceeded the 180\r\n         day track by less than one (1) year, shall remain under the control of the\r\n         Solicitor, subject to the provisions set forth below:\r\n\r\n            (1)\t General Docket. The General Docket consists of all pending\r\n                 General Sessions matters. Absent the grant of a speedy trial\r\n                 motion, the Solicitor shall have the initial responsibility for\r\n                 designating when a case is ready for trial. Upon determining that\r\n                 a case is ready for trial, the Solicitor shall file with the Clerk of\r\n                 Court a “NOTICE OF COURT DOCKETING” on a form\r\n                 prescribed by the Supreme Court and shall serve all parties and\r\n                 counsel of record. Upon receiving such notice, the Clerk shall\r\n                 place the case on the Court Docket and the matter may be called\r\n                 for trial any time after thirty (30) days from the filing of the\r\n                 NOTICE OF COURT DOCKETING. The Court Docket consists\r\n                 of all matters that the Solicitor has deemed ready for trial. Once\r\n\n          the case is placed on the Court Docket, the Court assumes the\r\n          responsibility for setting a trial date and the Clerk, under the\r\n          direction and supervision of the CJAP, shall publish a trial roster\r\n          from the Court Docket of cases subject for trial at least twenty-\r\n          one (21) days before each term of court. Publication shall be\r\n          effected once the Clerk makes the trial roster available in the\r\n          Clerk’s office or on the Clerk’s internet site. The Clerk shall also\r\n          distribute the trial roster to those attorneys listed upon it by Fax,\r\n          US Mail, hand delivery, or electronic delivery. Cases on the trial\r\n          roster not reached for trial will be subject to being called for the\r\n          next two terms of court before being republished. It is the\r\n          responsibility of each defense attorney to notify the defendant\r\n          that the case is scheduled for trial and to remind the defendant of\r\n          the right and obligation to be present at trial. Motions for\r\n          continuance or other relief from a published trial roster shall be\r\n          made in accordance with Rule 7, SCRCrimP. The CJAP or\r\n          presiding judge shall rule on the motion.\r\n\r\n   (2) \t Nothing herein shall affect the Court’s ability to schedule\r\n         motions or other pretrial proceedings as may be appropriate, or\r\n         the right of the CJAP to add cases to any trial roster or\r\n         designate cases for a day certain as the CJAP deems\r\n         appropriate, subject to the notification requirements set forth in\r\n         paragraph B(1), above.\r\n\r\n(C) Cases more than one year beyond their 180 day track will be\r\nautomatically transferred to the CJAP’s supervision as follows:\r\n\r\n   (1)\t     Judicial Docket. If the Solicitor has not filed a NOTICE OF\r\n           COURT DOCKETING in accordance with Paragraph (B) (1)\r\n           above for any case more than one (1) year beyond its assigned\r\n           track, it will be automatically transferred to the Judicial Docket,\r\n           which the Clerk shall maintain separate and apart from the\r\n           regular Court Docket. The CJAP will administer and supervise\r\n           the Judicial Docket. The Solicitor must notify the Clerk within\r\n           fifteen (15) days after expiration of this period of time of all\r\n           cases that are in this category and furnish the following\r\n           information: (1) Indictment number; (2) Defendant’s name; (3)\r\n           Date of Arrest; (4) Assigned Assistant Solicitor; (5) Defense\r\n           Counsel; (6) Date of Indictment (True Bill); (7) Track\r\n\n          expiration date; (8) Prior request(s) for continuance. The Clerk\r\n          will maintain the Judicial Docket which will include this\r\n          information.\r\n(2)\t      Upon placement on the Judicial Docket, the CJAP shall arrange\r\n          for the scheduling of trial or other disposition of the case.\r\n          Additionally, the CJAP may upon the request of any party\r\n          transfer the case to the trial roster in accordance with\r\n          Paragraphs (B) (1) and (2).\r\n\r\n(3) \t     If the case has not been disposed of more than one (1) year\r\n          following its transfer to the Judicial Docket, the CJAP will\r\n          dismiss the case, absent the Solicitor establishing good cause.\r\n          Both the Solicitor and the defendant shall be notified of the\r\n          pending dismissal and be given an opportunity to be heard.\r\n          Cases dismissed pursuant to this provision will be without\r\n          prejudice, unless otherwise specified by the CJAP. The\r\n          Solicitor will notify the victim(s) of cases dismissed pursuant to\r\n          this provision.\r\n\r\n (D)    Non-Track Cases:\r\n\r\nThe Solicitor shall furnish to the CJAP a quarterly status report of all\r\nnon-track cases. The report shall contain information regarding the\r\nprogress of the case and the expected disposition date.\r\n\r\n (E)    Old Case Disposition:\r\n\r\nAny case, including non-track cases, pending four (4) or more years from\r\nthe date of indictment by the Grand Jury shall be dismissed by the CJAP,\r\nunless the Solicitor shall show good cause why it should not be\r\ndismissed. Such dismissal is without prejudice, unless otherwise\r\nspecified by the CJAP and the Solicitor shall have the right to re-present\r\nthe matter to the Grand Jury. Before ordering dismissal, the Clerk of\r\nCourt shall notify the Solicitor and the defendant of the Court’s intention\r\nto dismiss the case. The Solicitor shall: (1) within ten (10) days of\r\nreceiving the notice from the Court, notify the victim(s) in writing of the\r\nCourt’s intended disposition and invite the victim(s) to file a written\r\nresponse with the Solicitor within ten (10) days; and (2) within thirty (30)\r\ndays file a written response with the Court setting forth in detail the\r\nreasons, including the response(s) of the victim(s), why the case should\r\n\n         not be dismissed and advising the court of the expected time of\r\n         disposition. The defendant may submit a written response within thirty\r\n         days of the Solicitor's filing. The CJAP may schedule a hearing, dismiss\r\n         the case without a hearing, or take such further action as may be\r\n         appropriate. Failure to respond as set forth herein will result in the matter\r\n         being dismissed pursuant to this provision. If the Solicitor shows good\r\n         cause, the case shall automatically be transferred to the Judicial Docket.\r\n\r\nThis order shall be effective February 4, 2013.\r\n\r\n                                      s/ Jean H.

Miller, and William S.F.\r\n             Freeman, all of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: William E. Terry, Jr., appeals from a family court\r\norder holding him in contempt for failing to vacate the parties' marital residence as\r\nrequired under the temporary order. The appeal is manifestly without merit, and\r\nwe affirm pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR. Because Appellant erroneously believed\r\nthat the filing and service of a notice of appeal from the family court's temporary\r\norder divested the family court of jurisdiction from considering the contempt\r\nmatter, we elect to address and clarify the effect of an attempted appeal from a\r\nfamily court temporary order.\r\n\n                                          I.\r\n\r\nRespondent Linda E. Terry (Wife) filed an action for separate support and\r\nmaintenance against Appellant William E. Terry, Jr. (Husband). Wife sought\r\ntemporary relief, including exclusive possession of the marital residence. At the\r\ntemporary hearing, the family court awarded Wife exclusive possession of the\r\nmarital residence and ordered Husband to vacate the residence. Husband failed to\r\ndo so, which prompted Wife to file a rule to show cause to hold Husband in\r\ncontempt. Prior to the contempt hearing, Husband filed a notice of appeal from the\r\ntemporary order. At the contempt hearing, Husband argued the filing of the notice\r\nof appeal stayed the temporary order and thus divested the family court of\r\njurisdiction to proceed with the contempt hearing. The able family court judge\r\nsummarily and correctly rejected Husband's argument. Husband was properly held\r\nin contempt and sanctioned.\r\n\r\nAlthough Husband ultimately vacated the marital residence, he appealed from the\r\ncontempt order asserting that his filing of the notice of appeal from the temporary\r\norder stayed the temporary order and divested the family court of jurisdiction to\r\nenforce its order. Regarding the matter of appealability, Husband advanced two\r\narguments in the family court and on appeal: (1) the filing of the notice of appeal\r\nfrom the temporary order \"automatically stayed\" the effect and enforcement of the\r\ntemporary order, and; (2) the temporary order was immediately appealable because\r\nit affected a \"substantial right\" within S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330(2) (Supp.\r\n2011).1 Husband nevertheless withdrew his appeal from the temporary order and\r\nproceeded on his appeal from the contempt order.\r\n\r\n1 The dissent would reverse on grounds never raised. By \"analogiz[ing] the grant\r\nor denial of temporary relief in a domestic action to . . . [an] injunction issued by\r\nthe court of common pleas in a law case[,]\" the dissent would hold that a family\r\ncourt temporary order is immediately appealable under S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-\r\n330(4) (1977 and Supp. 2011). We find no support in either the text of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. section 14-3-330, including subsection (4), or our jurisprudence for the\r\nproposition that a family court temporary order is immediately appealable as a\r\nmatter of right. Even the dissent \"readily admit[s] that [family court temporary\r\norders] do not fit neatly within any category of appealable intermediate orders\r\nunder S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330 (1977 and Supp. 2011).\" The dissent further\r\nattempts to create an ambiguity in the temporary order by claiming the temporary\r\norder is unclear whether Wife \"was awarded possession of the home as a\r\ncomponent of support or as or as temporary equitable division.\" As noted, neither\r\n\n                                          II. \n\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the bench and bar, we take this opportunity to clarify the effect\r\nof filing a notice of appeal from a temporary, pendente lite family court order. A\r\nnotice of appeal from a temporary order does not, standing alone, operate to stay\r\nthe effect or enforcement of the order.2 A temporary order of the family court is\r\nwithout prejudice to the rights of the parties. Such orders are, by definition,\r\ntemporary—they neither decide any issue with finality nor affect a substantial right\r\nwithin the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Section 14-3-330(2) (Supp. 2011).3 The\r\nfamily court at the final hearing has the authority to redress any error from the\r\ntemporary order. See Watson v. Watson, 291 S.C. 13, 24, 351 S.E.2d 883, 890 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1986) (affirming family court's authority at trial to adjust adulterous wife's\r\nequitable division share to recoup temporary support to which she was not\r\nentitled).\r\n\r\n\r\nargument has ever been made in this case. Thus, the dissent would reverse the\r\nfamily court on grounds raised for the first time in the dissenting opinion. See\r\nState v. Langford, Op. 27195 (SC Supreme Court filed November 21, 2012)\r\n(Pleicones, J., dissenting) (\"It is also axiomatic that we sit to review the lower\r\ncourt's order based upon the issues properly presented by the parties for our\r\nconsideration.\").\r\n2 We, of course, recognize that the law does not leave parties without an immediate\r\nremedy from a temporary order in those circumstances where warranted. See,\r\ne.g., Rule 241(c), SCACR (holding any party may move for an order imposing a\r\nsupersedeas of matters decided in the order, judgment, decree or decision on\r\nappeal after service of the notice of appeal). Moreover, this Court has authority to\r\nentertain a common law petition for a writ of certiorari. There was no effort in this\r\ncase to seek either a supersedeas or a writ of certiorari, nor would such requests\r\nhave been justified here. The award of temporary possession of the marital\r\nresidence, while clearly important to the parties, neither constitutes a \"substantial\r\nright\" within the meaning of section 14-3-330(2) nor generally raises an issue\r\nwarranting immediate appellate court intervention.\r\n3 Section 14-3-330(2) provides that this Court shall have appellate jurisdiction over\r\nan order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order effectively\r\ndetermines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be\r\ntaken.\r\n\nIn Neville v. Neville, we acknowledged the infrequent practice of parties filing a\r\nnotice of appeal from a temporary family court order, and we held that \"the\r\ninterests of justice will be served best if appeals from pendente lite orders are held\r\nin abeyance until the final order is entered in the family court.\" 278 S.C. 411, 411,\r\n297 S.E.2d 423, 423 (1982). The filing of a notice of appeal from a temporary\r\norder pursuant to Neville has never been construed to stay the effect and\r\nenforcement of the temporary order. In the thirty years following Neville, the\r\npractice of filing a notice of appeal from a temporary order remains rarely utilized.\r\n\r\nPerceived errors in family court temporary orders are to be redressed as they\r\nalways have, at the final hearing. For issue preservation purposes, any such\r\nchallenge must be placed on the record at the commencement of the final hearing.\r\nThe family court has wide discretion in fashioning equitable relief, including the\r\nauthority to make adjustments in the equitable distribution and otherwise to\r\nremedy an error in the temporary order. If a party desires to challenge the family\r\ncourt's final resolution of the matter, the aggrieved party may appeal from final\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J. and BEATTY, J., concur. HEARN, J., concurring in a separate\r\nopinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE HEARN: I concur in the majority’s excellent opinion and write\r\nseparately only to address my concern with the dissent’s use of the term\r\n“temporary equitable division.” The majority quite correctly notes that the nature\r\nof the relief ordered was not argued by Husband in his effort to avoid compliance\r\nwith the temporary order, and that it would contravene settled appellate principles\r\nfor us to consider an issue not raised to us. In addition to that, I would note that by\r\nits very nature and pursuant to the statute which authorizes it, equitable division is\r\na permanent remedy employed by the family court in the final order. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 20-3-620(C) (Supp. 2011) (\"The court's order as it affects distribution\r\nof marital property shall be a final order not subject to modification except by\r\nappeal or remand following proper appeal.\"). Neither Section 20-3-620 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code nor case law provides that equitable division can be effected\r\ntemporarily. Id. In my view, the family court judge here simply granted\r\ntemporary possession of the marital home to Wife. It was not, nor could it have\r\nbeen, a “temporary equitable division” of the marital home because no such\r\nremedy exists.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I write separately as I understand the rules governing\r\nautomatic stays following the appeal of a pendente lite family court order\r\nsomewhat differently than does the majority. As explained below, I would reverse\r\nthe contempt order.\r\n\r\nIn Neville v. Neville, 278 S.C. 411, 297 S.E.2d 423 (1982), this Court stated that\r\nappeals from temporary family court orders are to be held in abeyance pending the\r\nfinal order. Implicit in Neville is the holding that such orders are immediately\r\nappealable. I readily admit that such orders do not fit neatly within any category of\r\nappealable intermediate orders under S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330 (1977 and Supp.\r\n2011). However, I note that § 14-3-330(4) permits the immediate appeal of a\r\ntemporary injunction issued by the court of common pleas in a law case and I\r\nwould analogize the grant or denial of temporary relief in a domestic action to such\r\nan injunction, and hold it is immediately appealable under S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-\r\n320 (Supp. 2011) (appeals in equity matters). See also S.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-\r\n630(A) (2010) (right to appeal family court orders \"governed by the same rules,\r\npractices, and procedures that govern appeals from the circuit court\"). In any case,\r\nthe policy reasons for permitting such immediate appeals are clear: if no direct\r\nappeal lies, then these orders are reviewable only upon a common law petition for\r\na writ of certiorari. Since the Court of Appeals does not have original jurisdiction\r\nto entertain common law writs,4 it would fall to this Court to decide all such\r\nmatters. Moreover, it cannot be denied that, for example, final custody\r\ndeterminations can be influenced by the status quo during the litigation, especially\r\nif that process is lengthy. Thus, allowing an immediate appeal and supersedeas in\r\nappropriate custody cases can result in fairness to both parties at the final hearing.\r\n\r\nAccepting that pendente lite family court orders are immediately appealable, the\r\nquestion then becomes whether that appeal acts as an automatic stay of the relief\r\ngranted in that order. As a general rule, an appeal acts as a stay. Rule 241(a),\r\nSCACR. Exceptions to the automatic stay rule are found in Rule 241(b), in\r\nstatutes, court rules, and case law. For example, no family court order regarding a\r\nchild, child support, or alimony is stayed, Rule 241(b)(6), nor are family court\r\norders awarding temporary attorneys' fees or costs. Rule 241(b)(9).\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether appellant's appeal of the temporary order awarding\r\nrespondent exclusive possession of the marital home and requiring appellant to\r\nvacate acted as a stay, it is necessary to determine the nature of that order. If it was\r\nin the nature of support, then appellant's appeal did not act to automatically stay the\r\n\r\n    S.C. Const. art. V, § 9; S.C. Code Ann. §§ 14-8-200(a); 14-8-220 (Supp. 2011).\r\n4\r\n\nrequirement that he leave the home. Bochette v. Bochette, 300 S.C. 109, 386\r\nS.E.2d 475 (Ct. App. 1989). If, however, that order was in the nature of equitable\r\ndivision, then the appeal acted as an automatic stay. Id.; see also Chris v. Chris,\r\n287 S.C. 161, 337 S.E.2d 209 (1985) (appeal from a final order automatically\r\nstayed requirement that appellant vacate the marital home and execute a deed\r\nconveying the property to the respondent).\r\n\r\nAs I read the family court's order of November 24, 2010, it is unclear whether\r\nrespondent was awarded possession of the home as a component of support or as\r\ntemporary equitable division.5 Thus, it is unclear whether appellant’s appeal of\r\nthat order acted as a stay of the requirement that respondent receive exclusive\r\npossession of the marital home pendente lite. It is well settled that an individual\r\nmay not be held in contempt for failing to comply with an ambiguous order. E.g.\r\nCounty of Greenville v. Mann, 347 S.C. 427, 556 S.E.2d 383 (2001).\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, I would reverse the contempt citation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although the term “temporary equitable division” is not commonly used, it\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\ndescribes a situation where, for example, each spouse is awarded use of the vehicle\r\nthey ordinarily drive pendente lite, but those vehicles are subsequently considered\r\npart of the marital property when the court decides the final equitable division of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhile I realize that it is unusual to award possession of the marital home as\r\n\"temporary equitable division,\" I believe it is at least arguable that is what the\r\nfamily court intended here. In his January 24, 2011 order, the judge stated\r\n\"[Respondent] has not been awarded the marital home. This case is still pending\r\nand the question of the final possession of the marital home and the division of all\r\nequity in the marital home has not yet been determined by this Court.\"\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27197","title":"Town of Mount Pleasant v.

Code Ann. § 16-19-40(a) (2003) which makes it unlawful to “play . .\r\n. in any house used as a place of gaming . . . any game with cards. . . .” after they\r\nwere found playing Texas Hold’em and gambling in a residence leased by Nathan\r\nStallings.1 On appeal, the circuit court reversed respondents’ convictions finding\r\nthey were entitled to directed verdicts or, alternatively, that § 16-19-40(a) is\r\nunconstitutional. We reverse.          FACTS\r\n\r\nStallings leased a home in Mt. Pleasant where he lived with his fiancé and a\r\nroommate. He used an internet social networking site2 to meet other poker players,\r\nand established a regular Sunday night game at his home. He added a regular\r\nWednesday night game after another friend3 could no longer host those games.\r\nPeople Stallings \"met\" on this site and their friends were welcome at the games.\r\n\r\nStallings testified that players would buy in to the game for a minimum of $5 and a\r\nmaximum of $20. They could purchase more chips as needed. Stallings took a\r\n“rake” out of the pot in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the food and drink\r\nhe provided. If the rake did not cover his expenses, then others (most often the\r\nnight's winners) would contribute money.\r\n\r\nThe municipal judge found, based on expert testimony presented by the\r\nrespondents, that Texas Hold’em is a game of skill. The municipal judge also held\r\nthat if a game of skill were without the ambit of gaming, then he would acquit the\r\nrespondents, but that there was no clear indication whether the legislature intended\r\nto criminalize only gambling on games of chance. At the hearing, the municipal\r\njudge declined to find § 16-19-40 unconstitutional. The circuit court reversed, and\r\nthe Town appeals that order.\r\n\r\nBefore this Court, as they did before the lower courts, respondents freely admit\r\nthey were playing Texas Hold’em, a card game, and do not deny they were betting\r\n\r\n1  Stallings pled guilty to keeping a house used as a place of gaming in violation of \n\r\n§ 16-19-40 in a separate proceeding.\n\r\n2 Identified as charlestonpokermeetups.com in the transcript.\n\r\n3  Respondent John Willis.\n\r\n\non this game. All parties agree that the term \"gaming\" as used in § 16-19-40 is\r\nsynonymous with gambling.              ISSUES\r\n\r\n             1) Whether respondents were entitled to directed verdicts\r\n                because betting money on a game of skill at a residence is\r\n                not prohibited by § 16-19-40?\r\n\r\n             2) If respondents are not entitled to directed verdicts, should\r\n                their convictions have been set aside because § 16-19-40(a)\r\n                is unconstitutional?\r\n\r\n                                 ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA. Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held that respondents were entitled to directed verdicts\r\nbecause it is not unlawful to gamble on a game of skill in a residence. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nSection 16-19-40 is the \"modern\" version of a statute first enacted in 1802. In its\r\npresent form, it reads:\r\n\r\n             § 16-19-40. Unlawful games and betting.\r\n\r\n             If any person shall play at any tavern, inn, store for the retailing\r\n             of spirituous liquors or in any house used as a place of gaming,\r\n             barn, kitchen, stable or other outhouse, street, highway, open\r\n             wood, race field or open space at (a) any game with cards or\r\n             dice, (b) any gaming table, commonly called A, B, C, or E, O,\r\n             or any gaming table known or distinguished by any other letters\r\n             or by any figures, (c) any roley-poley table, (d) rouge et noir,\r\n             (e) any faro bank (f) any other table or bank of the same or the\r\n             like kind under any denomination whatsoever or (g) any\r\n             machine or device licensed pursuant to Section 12-21-2720 and\r\n             used for gambling purposes, except the games of billiards,\r\n             bowls, backgammon, chess, draughts, or whist when there is no\r\n\n               betting on any such game of billiards, bowls, backgammon,\r\n               chess, draughts, or whist or shall bet on the sides or hands of\r\n               such as do game, upon being convicted thereof, before any\r\n               magistrate, shall be imprisoned for a period of not over thirty\r\n               days or fined not over one hundred dollars, and every person so\r\n               keeping such tavern, inn, retail store, public place, or house\r\n               used as a place for gaming or such other house shall, upon\r\n               being convicted thereof, upon indictment, be imprisoned for a\r\n               period not exceeding twelve months and forfeit a sum not\r\n               exceeding two thousand dollars, for each and every offense.\r\n\r\nSubsection (g) referencing video games was added in 1999. Prior to that\r\namendment, the statute was last amended in 1909 when the penalty section was\r\nchanged.4 The only other major substantive alteration occurred in 1816, and is\r\ndiscussed in more detail infra.\r\n\r\n        The statute, with its modern punctuation, provides:\r\n\r\n               (1) Any person who plays or shall bet on the sides or hands of\r\n                  such as do game at any\r\n\r\n                        tavern\r\n                        inn\r\n                        store for the retailing of spirituous liquors\r\n                        house used as a place of gaming\r\n                        barn\r\n                        kitchen\r\n                        stable\r\n                        other outhouse\r\n                        street\r\n                        highway\r\n                        open wood\r\n                        race field\r\n                        open place\r\n\r\n\r\n4   1909 S.C.

AN ADDITIONAL ACT for the more effectual\r\n             prevention of gaming.\r\n\r\n                    In order the more effectually to prevent gaming at\r\n             taverns, inns, stores for the retailing spirituous liquors, and\r\n             other public houses; and also in streets, high-ways, woods and        Preamble\r\n             race-fields, which must often be attended with quarrels and\r\n             controversies, the impoverishment of many people and their\r\n             families, and the ruin of the health and corruption of the morals\r\n             and manners of youth, who in such places frequently fall in\r\n             company with lewd, idle, disorderly and dissolute persons, who\r\n             have no other way of maintaining themselves but by gaming:\r\n\r\n                    I. Be it therefore enacted, by the honorable the Senate\r\n             and House of Representatives, now met and sitting in the\r\n             General Assembly, and by the authority of the same, That if any\r\n             person or persons shall, at any time after the passing of this Act,\r\n             play at any tavern, inn, store for the retailing [sic] spirituous     Games not to\r\n             liquors, or in any other public house, or in any street, high-way,    be played at.\r\n             or in any open wood, high-way, race-field or open place, at any\r\n             game or games, with cards or dice, or at any gaming table,\r\n             commonly called A B C or E O, or any gaming table known or\r\n             distinguished by any other letters or by any figures, or rowley\r\n             powley table, or at rouge et noir, or at any faro bank, or at any\r\n             other gaming table or bank of the same or the like and under\r\n             any denomination whatsoever; except the games of billiards,\r\n             bowls, backgammon, chess or draughts; or shall bet on the sides\r\n             or hands of such as do game; any justice of the peace or of the\r\n             quorum may, upon view, or information upon oath made before           Games that\r\n                                                                                   may be\r\n             him, bind over to appear at the next court of sessions of the         played at.\r\n             district in which such play shall be carried on, all and singular\r\n\n                                                                                 played at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            the said persons who shall so play or bet; and shall require him\r\n            or them to give security for his or their appearance thereat; and\r\n            on his or their failure to give such security, shall commit him or\r\n            them to the common gaol of the said district; and shall also bind\r\n            over the keeper or keepers of such taverns, inns, retail stores or\r\n            public places, to appear at the said ensuing court of sessions;        Penalty for\r\n                                                                                   betting or\r\n            and every person so playing, upon being convicted thereof upon         playing, or\r\n            indictment, shall forfeit the sum of twenty-five dollars; and          keeping a\r\n            every person so keeping such tavern, inn, retail store or public       gaming place.\r\n            place, shall, upon being convicted thereof upon indictment,\r\n            forfeit the sum of fifty dollars for each and every offense.\r\n\r\n                   II.

Acts No. 1786.\r\n\r\n      1. Residence as Place of Gaming\r\n\r\nThe circuit court agreed with respondents that a residence could not qualify\r\nas a \"house used as a place of gaming\" under § 16-19-40. We disagree.\r\n\nIn 1806, a defendant was convicted of violating the statute after he was indicted for\r\npermitting and encouraging persons to play at prohibited games in his dwelling\r\nhouse. On appeal, the sufficiency of the indictment was challenged on the ground\r\nthe statute did not use the words “permit and encourage,” nor did the indictment\r\nallege that the defendant kept his dwelling for gaming purposes or that he allowed\r\ngambling on the premises. The appeal was affirmed without a full opinion, but\r\nJustice Brevard dissented. It appears that all members of the Court were in\r\nagreement that a dwelling house could qualify as a “place kept to accommodate\r\ngamesters,” with Justice Brevard expressing his opinion in dicta that the legislature\r\ncould not have intended the statute to apply to “a casual game being played in a\r\nman’s home.” State v. Brice, 4 S.C.L. (2 Brev.) 66 (1806). Thus, a residence used\r\nas a place for gambling could be a “public house” under the original language of\r\nthe statute.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, the gaming statute was amended to “more effectively . . . prevent the\r\npernicious practice of gaming” by adding to the places where the playing of the\r\ngames and/or gambling were prohibited. Specifically, after the term “store for the\r\nretailing [of] spirituous liquors,” the phrase “or in any other public house” was\r\nstricken and the phrase “or in any house used as a place of gaming, or in any barn,\r\nkitchen, stable or other outhouse” substituted. 1816 S.C. Acts No. 2096 p. 26.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, the Court explained that the legislature’s intent in adopting this 1816\r\namendment was to ensure that gaming in buildings separate from, even if attached\r\nto, the “principal or mansion house” were covered by the statute. State v.\r\nFaulkener, 13 S.C.L. (2 McCord) 438 (1823). A residence could qualify as a\r\nprohibited place under the 1802 version of the statute, Brice, supra, and the 1816\r\namendment preserved the inclusion of a residence or \"mansion-house\" as a\r\nprohibited location while expanding the definition to include outbuildings typically\r\nfound on residential property. Faulkener, supra.\r\n\r\nIn addition to expanding the list of prohibited places, there was another\r\nconsequence of the 1816 amendment. By altering the prohibition on playing\r\nprohibited games from “public house” to “house used as a place of gaming,” the\r\nlegislature effectively adopted the view of Justice Brevard in his Brice dissent.\r\nWhat was originally a ban on merely playing these games “in a public house”\r\nbecame a ban on playing on these games in a residence or mansion house only\r\nwhen that house was “used as a place of gaming.” Thus, individuals gambling on a\r\n\ncasual game in a person's home were no longer subject to prosecution under this\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a dwelling house is being used “as a place of gaming,” then all those\r\nplaying the game, whether or not they are betting on it, and those present and\r\nbetting, even if not playing, are guilty of violating § 16-19-40. To the extent that\r\nrespondents argue that a residence or dwelling cannot be a house within the\r\nmeaning of this statute, their contention is refuted by Faulkener, supra, and the\r\nplain language of the statute.\r\n\r\nGiven that the parties agree that gaming and gambling are synonyms, then\r\nStallings’s house was undeniably being used for gambling on the night of the raid.\r\nMoreover, there was sufficient evidence to withstand a directed verdict motion in\r\nlight of Stallings’s own testimony regarding the regular Sunday/Wednesday games\r\nthat his dwelling was “a house used as a place of gaming.” See State v. Lane, 82\r\nS.C. 144, 63 S.E. 612 (1909) (State need not prove by direct evidence that\r\ngambling took place on more than one occasion to prove a house is a “gambling\r\nden”).2. Gambling\r\n\r\nThe circuit court, however, adopted the so-called \"American Rule\" or \"dominant\r\nfactor doctrine,\" holding that \"gaming\" as used in § 16-19-40 applies only to\r\nbetting on games of chance, and not to betting on games where skill, rather than\r\nchance, is the predominant factor. In so doing, the court relied primarily on cases\r\ndeciding whether a particular scheme was a lottery. E.g., Johnson v. Phinney, 218\r\nF.2d 303 (5th Cir. 1955); Opinion of the Justices, 795 So.2d 630 (Ala. 2001);\r\nMorrow v. State, 511 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1973).5 Reliance on the “American Rule”\r\n\r\n5Other cases relied upon by respondents are also easily distinguishable. E.g.,\r\nPeople v. Hua, 885 N.Y.S.2d 380 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2009) (relying on statutory\r\ndefinition); Town of Centerville v. Burns, 126 S.W.2d 322 (Tenn. 1939) (British\r\nRule rather than American Rule). Respondents also cite five cases in brief for the\r\nproposition that the test for “gambling” is the American Rule. None of the five\r\ncases actually hold this. Indoor Rec. Enterprises, Inc. v. Douglas, 235 N.W.2d\r\n398 (Neb. 1975) (statute and constitution prohibited gambling on games of\r\nchance); In re Allen, 377 P.2d 280 (Cal. 1962) (ordinance prohibited betting on\r\ngame of chance); Las Vegas Hacienda, Inc. v. Gibson, 359 P.2d 85 (Nev. 1961)\r\n\nand lottery cases is misplaced, however, as § 16-19-40 criminalizes the playing of\r\ncertain games and gambling, not a lottery. Compare § 16-19-30 (2003) (making it\r\nunlawful to sell lottery tickets).\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a lottery is a specific form of gambling, one “in which a large\r\nnumber of tickets are sold and a drawing is held for certain prizes.” Johnson v.\r\nCollins Entertainment Co., Inc., 333 S.C. 96, 508 S.E.2d 575 (1998). In Collins,\r\nthe dissenters would have adopted a much broader definition of lottery, and thus\r\nwould have reached the issue of the role of “chance versus skill” in determining\r\nwhether a particular scheme was a lottery. The Collins dissenters would have held\r\nthat the “American Rule” applied to distinguish lotteries from non-prohibited\r\ngames. The fact that most courts hold that a scheme is not a lottery if skill rather\r\nthan chance predominates does not resolve the question whether, in South\r\nCarolina, betting on a card game in which skill rather than chance is the dominant\r\nfactor is unlawful gaming. Compare § 16-19-30 (criminalizing lotteries) with §\r\n16-19-40 (criminalizing gaming).\r\n\r\nUnder the plain language of § 16-19-40, gambling on a game of skill is a violation\r\nif that gambling is being done in a prohibited location. The statute specifically lists\r\nseveral games that are exempt from the absolute ban on playing games in\r\nprohibited locations: billiards, bowls, backgammon, chess, draughts, and whist.\r\nThese games all involve skill, yet betting on these games is a crime under the\r\nstatute. § 16-19-40; see State v. Yoe, 76 S.C. 46, 56 S.E. 542 (1907) (statute made\r\nit unlawful to play certain games without respect to whether there is betting or not,\r\nbut other games (i.e. billiards, etc.) are unlawful at those places only if bet upon);\r\ncf. State v. Robinson, 40 S.C. 553, 18 S.E. 891 (1894) (no error in defining\r\ngambling in jury instruction by charging not a crime to throw dice unless betting is\r\ninvolved). A violation of the gaming prohibition of § 16-19-40 does not depend on\r\nwhether the particular game involves more skill than chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(offering a prize for winning a contest is not gambling); State v. Stroupe, 76 S.E.2d\r\n313 (N.C. 1953) (statute defines gambling as betting on a game of chance); D’Orio\r\nv. Startup Candy Co., 266 P.2d 1037 (Utah 1928) (statute/constitution prohibit\r\nlotteries, games of chance, and gift enterprises); and Harris v. Missouri Gaming\r\nComm’n, 869 S.W.2d 58 (Mo. 1994) (lotteries forbidden).\r\n\nThe statutory meaning of the word \"gambling\" in South Carolina includes games in\r\nwhich skill outweighs chance. For example, S.C. Code Ann. § 32-1-10 (2007),\r\nfound in an article captioned “Gambling Contracts,” permits persons who have lost\r\nmoney or other thing(s) of value in an amount equal to at least $50 at cards, at a\r\ndice table, or “at any other game whatsoever,” or by betting on those games, to\r\nrecover their losses under certain circumstances. The plaintiffs in such a suit are\r\nalmost uniformly referred to as “gamblers” regardless whether the enterprise was\r\nunlawful. See Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 426 S.E.2d 760 (1993). Gambling\r\nas defined in South Carolina includes betting money on the outcome of any \"game\"\r\nwhatsoever, regardless of the amount of skill involved in the game. § 32-1-10.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is precedent that indicates § 16-19-40 is concerned with wagering\r\nregardless of the skill involved in the game wagered upon. In State v. Red, 41\r\nS.C.L. (7 Rich.) 8 (1853), the court rejected appellant’s argument that his conduct\r\nin running a betting game of “Thimble” or “Thimbles and Balls” was not within §\r\n16-19-40 because he was a “juggler” and his “game” was an exhibition of his\r\ndexterity. The Court held appellant’s conduct was within the statute’s terms\r\n“because he kept a bank, and a wager depended on his success or failure.” The\r\nopinion concluded:\r\n\r\n             If the prohibited games be confined to those alone in which the\r\n             stake is won or lost by chance, the result would follow, that the\r\n             gambler who relied on the practiced legerdemain of a juggler,\r\n             whilst he professed that the stake depended on fortune, will\r\n             escape punishment by playing falsely.\r\n\r\nIn other words, gambling/gaming depends not on the skill/chance ratio, but on the\r\nwager.\r\n\r\nWe hold that one \"games\" within the meaning of § 16-19-40 when money is\r\nwagered on Texas Hold’em, even though it is a game in which skill predominates.\r\nSee Atchison v. Gee, 15 S.C.L. (4 McCord) 211 (1827) (betting on horse racing is\r\ngaming); State v. O’Neal, 210 S.C. 305, 42 S.E.2d 523 (1947) (poker is gaming);\r\nState v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 61 S.E.2d 754 (1950) (room where poker played for\r\nmoney is gambling room); cf. Allendale County Sheriff’s Office v. Two Chess\r\nChallenge II, 361 S.C. 581, 606 S.E.2d 471 (2004) (video game in which player’s\r\nskill could alter outcome not a “game of chance” within the meaning of that term\r\nin § 12-21-2712).\r\n\nWhether an activity is gaming/gambling is not dependent upon the relative roles of\r\nchance and skill, but whether there is money or something of value wagered on the\r\ngame’s outcome. The circuit court erred in holding that respondents were entitled\r\nto directed verdicts because they were not gaming within the meaning of § 16-19­\r\n40.\r\n\r\nB. Constitutionality\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held that if respondents were not entitled to directed verdicts,\r\ntheir convictions must be set aside because § 16-19-40 was either\r\nunconstitutionally overbroad or void for vagueness. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held § 16-19-40(a) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it\r\ncriminalizes all games played with cards or dice “regardless of whether the\r\ndominant factor in a particular game is skill or chance.” The judge cited\r\nPapachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972), for the proposition that\r\na legislative enactment which “makes criminal activities which by modern\r\nstandards are normally innocent” is overbroad. In Papachristou, the United States\r\nSupreme Court struck down an archaic vagrancy ordinance because it was void for\r\nvagueness, and thus offended due process, and not because it was overbroad.\r\nOverbreadth is a challenge predicated on the First Amendment, and cannot be used\r\nexcept where the statute arguably suppresses protected speech or conduct. State v.\r\nNeuman, 384 S.C. 395, 683 S.E.2d 268 (2008). Section 16-19-40 does not offend\r\nthe First Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court also held that § 16-19-40(a) is void for vagueness because it\r\nprovides no definition of the term “house used as a place of gaming.” As the\r\nparties concede, gaming and gambling are synonymous. The term of art \"house\r\nused as a place of gaming\" is meant to distinguish the prohibited place from \"a\r\nhouse where people are gaming.\" As the Court said in 1909, the evidence of\r\nkeeping a gaming house is determined by the facts and circumstances. State v.\r\nLane, supra. In deciding a void-for-vagueness challenge to a statute, the Court\r\nmust look first to see whether the allegedly unconstitutional statute has been\r\ninterpreted or limited by prior judicial decisions. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.\r\n352 (1983), citing Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, 455\r\nU.S. 489 (1982). Here, we have our earlier decisions in State v. Brice, supra; State\r\nv. Faulkener, supra; State v. Lane, supra; see also Stardancer Casino, Inc. v.\r\n\nStewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001) (boat not a public place within\r\nmeaning of § 16-19-40), all interpreting the statute's allegedly vague terms. Even\r\nif we had not heretofore construed the statute so as to answer respondents'\r\nvagueness challenge, we could do so here and uphold their convictions. See, e.g.,\r\nState v. Watkins, 262 S.C. 178, 203 S.E.2d 429 (1974) (construing obscenity\r\nstatute on remand from the United States Supreme Court and affirming\r\nconviction). The circuit court erred in finding § 16-19-40(a) unconstitutionally\r\nvague.6\r\n\r\nMoreover, the evidence showed that Stallings’s house was used regularly twice a\r\nweek for poker games at which there was gambling, and that the games were\r\nadvertised to interested persons on the website, and open to those individuals and\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nOne whose conduct clearly falls within the statutory proscription does not have\r\nstanding to raise a void-for-vagueness challenge. E.g., State v. Neuman, supra.\r\nWe find respondents lack standing to challenge § 16-19-40,7 but also note that a\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Both the circuit judge and the dissent rely upon the arresting officer's testimony\r\nas proof of the statute's vagueness. A statute's constitutionality is judged on an\r\nobjective, not subjective, basis. E.g., City of Greenville v. Bane, 390 S.C. 303,\r\n308, 702 S.E.2d 112, 114 (2010) (issues are whether the statute's terms are\r\n\"sufficiently defined to give reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct to those\r\nwho wish to avoid its penalties and to apprise Judge and jury of standards for the\r\ndetermination of guilt\"). Moreover, in many cases, it is \"up to the police . . . to\r\ndetermine just where [a statutory] line is drawn,\" for example, where the issue is\r\nobscenity, loitering, disturbing the peace, or driving under the influence. The fact\r\nthat an officer must make a judgment call does not render a statute\r\nunconstitutionally vague, any more than does the fact that a determination of guilt\r\nultimately turns on the evidence (i.e., facts and circumstances) adduced at trial.\r\n7 \"The constitutionality of a statute must be considered in light of the standing of\r\nthe party who seeks to raise the question and of its particular application . . . .\"\r\nSchneider v. State, 255 S.C. 594, 596, 180 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1971) (internal citation\r\nomitted). Standing is not a separate issue when the constitutionality of a statute is\r\nchallenged under the due process clause, but is instead the foundation of the\r\ninquiry. Since the trial court admittedly ruled on § 16-19-40's constitutionality, it\r\nnecessarily did so in light of respondents' standing. Schneider, supra. Lack of\r\n\nperson of reasonable intelligence would understand the statute to prohibit gambling\r\non a card game at a house where players were invited on a regular basis to engage\r\nin this activity, especially where, while not a profit-making commercial activity,\r\nthe players were required to contribute money to cover the host’s expenses.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find that the circuit court erred in reversing respondents' convictions, and\r\ntherefore the order on appeal is itself\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nHEARN, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstanding ends the inquiry into a criminal statute's vagueness. E.g., United State v.\r\nWilliams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008).\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:             While I agree wholeheartedly with the\r\nconstitutional analysis contained in the excellently researched and beautifully\r\nwritten dissenting opinion, because of the unique circumstances of this case, I\r\ncannot join in that opinion. For the reasons stated infra, I concur in the result\r\nreached by the majority that these defendants' convictions must stand, and the\r\ncircuit court must be reversed.\r\n\r\n       The dissent is completely correct in its conclusion that section 16-19-40 is\r\nvoid for vagueness because that section fails to give adequate notice of the\r\nprohibited conduct and fails to provide law enforcement with the requisite\r\nguidance to ensure its fair administration. However, I agree with the majority that\r\nthese Appellants are foreclosed from challenging the constitutionality of this\r\nsection because they were engaged in conduct that fell so clearly within the\r\nstatutory proscription. This was not your penny ante game of poker organized in\r\nsomeone's home, but a regular card game hosted in Stallings's home after\r\nadvertisements were posted on the Internet to recruit players who paid to\r\nparticipate. Thus, they do not have standing to challenge the statute as vague. See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008) (stating \"ordinarily '[a]\r\nplaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain\r\nof the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others'\" (quoting Hoffman\r\nEstates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494–495, and nn. 6 and 7\r\n(1982)) (alteration in orginal)); State v. Neuman, 384 S.C. 395, 403, 683 S.E.2d\r\n268, 272 (2008) (\"One to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have\r\nstanding to challenge it for vagueness.\" (quoting Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 572,\r\n549 S.E.2d 591, 598 (2001))).\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, we cannot sever the language,\r\n\"a house used as a place of gaming,\" from section 16-19-40 without striking the\r\nprovision in its entirety. \"The test for severability is whether the constitutional\r\nportion of the statute remains complete in itself, wholly independent of that which\r\nis rejected, and if of such a character that it may fairly be presumed the legislature\r\nwould have passed it independent of that which conflicts with the constitution.\"\r\nJoytime Distrib. & Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 648–49, 528 S.E.2d\r\n647, 654 (1999) (citations omitted). On the other hand, \"[w]hen the residue of an\r\nAct, sans that portion found to be unconstitutional, is capable of being executed in\r\naccordance with the Legislative intent, independent of the rejected portion, the Act\r\nas a whole should not be stricken as being in violation of a Constitutional\r\nProvision.\" Id. (quoting Dean v. Timmerman, 234 S.C. 35, 43, 106 S.E.2d 665,\r\n\n669 (1959)). Striking \"house used as a place of gaming\" would render the\r\nremaining provisions incomplete, leaving the State powerless to regulate gambling\r\nin locations other than those explicitly listed in the statute. Moreover, it is highly\r\nunlikely that the legislature would have enacted this statute absent the stricken\r\nlanguage, as the legislature amended section 16-19-40 in 1816 to specifically\r\ninclude this language.\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, striking this language would also open the door wide to all\r\nheretofore illegal gaming practices in this state, including video poker. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 16-19-40(g) (proscribing the playing of \"any machine or device . . .\r\nused for gambling purposes\"). Because of this very real consequence, I am\r\nconcerned that striking this critical language from the statute would beget, as\r\nelucidated by the General Assembly in 1816 when amending section 16-191-40,\r\nthe \"impoverishment of many people, corruption of the morals and manners of\r\nyouth, . . . the tendency which is vice, misery and crime, as examples in this state\r\nhave abundantly proven.\" These dire concerns resonate as much today as they did\r\nnearly 200 years ago. I do not need to remind any person of the havoc wreaked\r\nupon this State as a result of the \"pernicious\" practice of video poker. Although\r\nthere are other sound provisions outlawing video poker, see S.C. Code Ann. §§ 12­\r\n21-2710, 2712 (2000), I am loathe to strike the critical language from the general\r\nban on gaming in the event that it guts these provisions, and consequently, South\r\nCarolina's longstanding prohibition against gambling.\r\n\r\n       Section 16-19-40 is hopelessly outdated, as it applies to any gaming activity\r\n(including all card games) played in a residential home whether wagering occurs\r\nor not. This section expired in usefulness long ago and should not form the basis\r\nof a modern anti-gambling statute. Thus, I now charge the legislature to modernize\r\nsection 16-19-40, as I am inclined to agree with the dissent that this provision is\r\nconstitutionally infirm. However, for the aforementioned reasons, I join the\r\nmajority in result only, and would reverse the circuit court under these\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\n      JUSTICE HEARN: \"Poker, n. A game said to be played with cards for\r\nsome purpose to this lexicographer unknown.\" Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's\r\nDictionary. In pursuit of this unknown purpose, Nathan Stallings organized\r\nregular semi-weekly poker games at his home in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.\r\nRobert Chimento, Scott Richards, Michael Williamson, Jeremy Brestel, and John\r\nWillis (collectively, Respondents) participated in these games and were\r\nsubsequently arrested during a raid on Stallings' home. Respondents were then\r\nconvicted of violating Section 16-19-40(a) of the South Carolina Code (2003),\r\nwhich makes it unlawful to \"play . . . in any house used as a place of gaming . . .\r\nany game with cards.\"\r\n\r\n       Respondents argue the term \"any house used as a place of gaming\" is\r\nunconstitutionally vague. A majority of this Court fails to give adequate\r\nconsideration to Respondents' challenge and instead disposes of the issues with\r\narguments which are neither preserved for review nor meritorious. There is\r\nnothing unique about this case that would justify doing so. For these reasons and\r\nthe reasons stated below, I dissent.\r\n\r\n                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Stallings used an internet social networking website to meet other poker\r\nplayers in and around Charleston, South Carolina. Eventually, he established a\r\nregular Sunday night game held at his house in neighboring Mount Pleasant and\r\nlater added Wednesday night games as well. Stallings advertised these games8 on\r\nthe same networking website, and all members of the website could view the\r\nadvertisement. Although Stallings maintained that these games were not open to\r\nthe public, anyone who was a member of the website or a friend of a member could\r\nattend.\r\n\r\n\r\n8These were relatively low-stakes games. The buy-in was between $5 and $20,\r\nand the small and big blinds were twenty-five and fifty cents, respectively.\r\nAlthough the total pot at the table could be as high as $200, the average pot was\r\nbetween $5 and $10. Stallings would take a small rake to cover the cost of food\r\nand beverages, but he did not make a profit from the games.\r\n\n       Acting on a tip from a confidential informant, Officer Justin Hembree of the\r\nMount Pleasant Police Department set-up surveillance of Stallings' home on a\r\ngame night. Officer Hembree observed a large number of cars parked outside the\r\nhouse, and participants used the parking lot of a nearby CVS for overflow. Armed\r\nwith this information, he secured permission to send someone into the house\r\nundercover with audio and video recording capabilities and money to gamble. The\r\nresulting video revealed exactly what officers expected: a group of people playing\r\npoker for money.\r\n\r\n       Police accordingly secured a search warrant, and seven officers entered\r\nStallings' house during one of the games. Officer Hembree testified that within the\r\nhome, the officers found approximately twenty people, including Respondents,\r\nwith cards and money on the table. Based on these observations and Officer\r\nHembree's experience, he believed Stallings' residence was a \"house used as a\r\nplace of gaming.\" However, he testified that \"it has never been the practice of the\r\nMount Pleasant Police Department to focus on four or five guys playing poker.\"\r\nFurthermore, Officer Hembree testified that it was his understanding that \"if it's a\r\ngroup of people that randomly meet once every six months or whatever they meet\r\nand play a game of poker, that's not a house of gaming. My understanding of the\r\nstatute is a constant use of one location for the purpose of gaming.\" He also\r\nbelieved the game needed to be for-profit in order to be gambling. In the end,\r\nhowever, Office Hembree conceded that whether or not a location is a house used\r\nas a place of gaming depends on the person investigating the claim.\r\n\r\n       In accordance with his understanding of section 16-19-40(a), Officer\r\nHembree issued citations to Respondents for gambling. The municipal court\r\nconvicted Respondents of violating the statute,9 but it declined to find any\r\nconstitutional defects in section 16-19-40. On appeal to the circuit court, the court\r\nreversed the municipal court's application of the statute to Respondents, and\r\nalternatively held section 16-19-40 unconstitutionally vague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9Stallings pled guilty to keeping a house used as a place of gaming in violation of\r\nsection 16-19-40 in a separate proceeding.\r\n\n                                   LAW/ANALYSIS \n\r\n\r\n      Section 16-19-40(a) criminalizes the \"play[ing] . . . in any house used as a\r\nplace of gaming . . . any game with cards or dice.\"10 I agree with the circuit court\r\nthat the statutory language \"any house used as a place of gaming\" is\r\nunconstitutionally vague. Because this issue would be dispositive, I need not reach\r\nthe remaining arguments raised on appeal and addressed by the majority.\r\n\r\n       We possess a very limited scope of review in cases involving a\r\nconstitutional challenge to a statute. Joytime Distribs. & Amusement Co. v. State,\r\n338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999) (per curiam). \"All statutes are\r\npresumed constitutional and will, if possible, be construed so as to render them\r\n\r\n10   Section 16-19-40 provides in full,\r\n\r\n         If any person shall play at any tavern, inn, store for the retailing of\r\n         spirituous liquors or in any house used as a place of gaming, barn,\r\n         kitchen, stable or other outhouse, street, highway, open wood, race\r\n         field or open place at (a) any game with cards or dice, (b) any gaming\r\n         table, commonly called A, B, C, or E, O, or any gaming table known\r\n         or distinguished by any other letters or by any figures, (c) any roley­\r\n         poley table, (d) rouge et noir, (e) any faro bank (f) any other table or\r\n         bank of the same or the like kind under any denomination whatsoever\r\n         or (g) any machine or device licensed pursuant to Section 12-21-2720\r\n         and used for gambling purposes, except the games of billiards, bowls,\r\n         backgammon, chess, draughts, or whist when there is no betting on\r\n         any such game of billiards, bowls, backgammon, chess, draughts, or\r\n         whist or shall bet on the sides or hands of such as do game, upon\r\n         being convicted thereof, before any magistrate, shall be imprisoned\r\n         for a period of not over thirty days or fined not over one hundred\r\n         dollars, and every person so keeping such tavern, inn, retail store,\r\n         public place, or house used as a place for gaming or such other house\r\n         shall, upon being convicted thereof, upon indictment, be imprisoned\r\n         for a period not exceeding twelve months and forfeit a sum not\r\n         exceeding two thousand dollars, for each and every offense.\r\n\r\n         (emphasis added). Only the italicized words are at issue in this case.\r\n\nvalid.\" Last v. MSI Constr. Co., 305 S.C. 349, 352, 409 S.E.2d 334, 336 (1991)\r\n(citations omitted). \"This Court is directed by the constitution, and our precedent,\r\nto make every effort to find acts of the General Assembly constitutional.\" Joytime\r\nDistribs., 338 S.C. at 653, 528 S.E.2d at 657. The party seeking to invalidate the\r\nstatute has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute\r\nviolates some provision of the constitution. State v. White, 348 S.C. 532, 537, 560\r\nS.E.2d 420, 422 (2002).\r\n\r\n      \"The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional\r\nprinciple that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for\r\nadjudication.\" Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 571, 549 S.E.2d 591, 598 (2001).\r\nWhen entertaining a challenge to a criminal statute on the ground that it is void for\r\nvagueness, we have less tolerance for vagueness than in the civil context because\r\n\"the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe\" in the latter. Vill. of\r\nHoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982). To\r\nsurvive a vagueness challenge, a statute must satisfy two criteria. First, the statute\r\nmust provide sufficient notice of the conduct prohibited. Kolender v. Lawson, 461\r\nU.S. 352, 357 (1983); see also State v. Houey, 375 S.C. 106, 119, 651 S.E.2d 314,\r\n321 (Waller, J., concurring). Second, the statute must also not be written in such a\r\nmanner as to permit or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\r\nKolender, 461 U.S. at 357; see also Houey, 375 S.C. at 119, 651 S.E.2d at 321. If\r\na challenger sufficiently proves the statute fails either prong, then the statute is\r\nimpermissibly vague. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000).\r\n\r\n       The rationale underpinning the first requirement of sufficient notice is \"that\r\nno man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not\r\nreasonably understand to be proscribed.\" United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612,\r\n617 (1954); see also Huber v. S.C. State Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 316\r\nS.C. 24, 26, 446 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1994) (\"The constitutional standard for\r\nvagueness is the practical criterion of fair notice to those to whom the law\r\napplies.\"). Due process therefore requires that a penal statute be sufficiently\r\ndefinite in its terms \"to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his\r\ncontemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute.\" Harriss, 347 U.S. at 617; see\r\nalso City of Beaufort v. Baker, 315 S.C. 146, 152, 432 S.E.2d 470, 473-74 (1993)\r\n(\"The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional principle\r\nthat procedural due process requires fair notice . . . .\").\r\n\r\n      The second requirement—that the statute provide officials with clear\r\nstandards for enforcement—is closely related to the first requirement. If a would­\r\n\nbe offender cannot reasonably understand the conduct to be proscribed, then\r\nneither would a police officer. People v. Stuart, 797 N.E.2d 28, 34-35 (N.Y.\r\n2003). However, the second requirement is considered a more important aspect of\r\nthe vagueness doctrine. Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358. \"Where the legislature fails to\r\nprovide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit 'a standardless\r\nsweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal\r\npredilections.'\" Id. (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 575 (1974)). A vague\r\nstatute would, therefore, allow police to be \"guided not by clear language, but by\r\nwhim.\" Stuart, 797 N.E.2d at 35.            Stated differently, if \"arbitrary and\r\ndiscriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit\r\nstandards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic\r\npolicy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and\r\nsubjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory\r\napplications.\" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972).\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, the mere fact that it may be difficult to determine whether\r\ncertain conduct falls within the statute does not render it unconstitutionally vague.\r\nUnited States v. Nat'l Dairy Prods. Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 32 (1963). Furthermore,\r\nsimply because a statute contains an undefined term does not automatically make\r\nthe statute vague, Lansdell v. State, 25 So. 3d 1169, 1176 (Ala. Crim. App. 2007),\r\nand words in the statute may be \"measured by common understanding and\r\npractices,\" see Curtis, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d at 599.\r\n\r\n       A statute can be challenged as vague on its face or as applied. An as-applied\r\nchallenge requires the moving party to show that the statute cannot be\r\nconstitutionally applied to the defendant under the particular facts of the case.\r\nChapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 467-468 (1991). A facial challenge, on\r\nthe other hand, is \"the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the\r\nchallenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act\r\nwould be valid.\" United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). Thus, if the\r\nmoving party fails to show that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him,\r\nany facial challenge must necessarily fail because there is at least one circumstance\r\nwhere the statute would constitutionally apply. Stuart, 797 N.E.2d at 36; see also\r\nCity of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 78 n.1 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting)\r\n(\"[A] facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances,\r\nnecessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to\r\nsustain an as-applied challenge.\").\r\n\n       I note that there is much confusion as to whether the Salerno test for a facial\r\nchallenge—i.e., the challenger must show the act is unconstitutional in all its\r\napplications—is still the proper standard. See Janklow v. Planned Parenthood,\r\nSioux Falls Clinic, 517 U.S. 1174, 1178 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting from the\r\ndenial of certiorari) (stating the question of Salerno's viability \"cries out for our\r\nreview\"). Compare Morales, 527 U.S. at 55 n.22 (plurality) (\"To the extent we\r\nhave consistently articulated a clear standard for facial challenges, it is not the\r\nSalerno formulation, which has never been the decisive factor in any decision of\r\nthis Court, including Salerno . . . .\"), with id. at 80 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\r\n(\"Unsurprisingly, given the clarity of our general jurisprudence on this point, the\r\nFederal Courts of Appeals all apply the Salerno standard in adjudicating facial\r\nchallenges.\"). In fact, the plurality in Morales opined the Salerno formulation is\r\nreally one of third-party standing that cannot be imposed on state courts\r\nentertaining facial challenges. Morales, 527 U.S. at 55 n.22 (plurality). Although\r\nvarious members of the Supreme Court have called the Salerno test into question,\r\nit appears that Salerno is the appropriate framework to use when the challenged\r\nlaw does not infringe upon any constitutionally protected conduct.11 See Roark &\r\nHardee LP v. City of Austin, 522 F.3d 533, 546 (5th Cir. 2008); see also Stevens,\r\n130 S. Ct. at 1587 (\"To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have to\r\nestablish 'that no set of circumstances exist under which [the statute] would be\r\nvalid.'\" (emphasis added)). Because neither party, nor the amicus, argues that\r\ngambling is a constitutionally protected activity,12 Salerno's standard applies.\r\n\r\n\r\n11 In two recent First Amendment cases, the Supreme Court arguably suggested a\r\ndifferent standard for a successful facial challenge, stating that facial challenges\r\nwill fail if the statute has \"'a plainly legitimate sweep.'\" United States v. Stevens,\r\n130 S. Ct. 1577, 1587 (2010) (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\r\n740 n.7 (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring)); Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State\r\nRepublican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449 (2008) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 740\r\nn.7)). Stevens, however, was not a \"typical\" case and noted that \"which standard\r\napplies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that we need not and do not address.\"\r\n130 S. Ct. at 1587. Washington State Grange recognized the dispute regarding the\r\nSalerno test but believed the challenged act would survive either standard. 552\r\nU.S. at 449. Until a majority of the Supreme Court definitively says otherwise, I\r\nbelieve the Salerno standard is the correct one to apply in these situations.\r\n12 And rightfully so:\r\n\n       In my opinion, Respondents' challenge fails the first prong of our vagueness\r\nanalysis. As reasonable, intelligent people, Respondents should have understood\r\nthe statute prohibited their conduct. It banned playing cards, with betting involved,\r\nin a house used as a place of gaming; Respondents participated in bi-weekly,\r\norganized poker games at someone's home with strangers that responded to\r\nadvertisements on the internet, with a buy-in and the house taking a rake. While I\r\nquestion whether other individuals under different circumstances would have\r\nsufficient notice of whether their conduct is proscribed, such as four individuals\r\nwho play a penny-ante poker or bridge game once per month, it is clear that\r\nRespondents were on notice their gambling fell within the ambit of the statute.\r\n\r\n       A majority of the Court extrapolates from this that Respondents lack\r\nstanding to raise this issue.13 While I do not disagree with the majority's view that\r\nstanding is a threshold determination in any appeal, it is not the province of this\r\nCourt to inject an entirely new issue into a case after briefing and oral argument\r\nhave long since been completed. The issue of Respondents' standing to make this\r\nconstitutional argument was never presented to the circuit court judge, let alone\r\nruled on, and was neither raised in Appellant's brief nor mentioned during oral\r\nargument. For the majority to now make this argument for the Appellant and to\r\n\r\n      Of course every activity, even scratching one's head, can be called a\r\n      \"constitutional right\" if one means by that term nothing more than the\r\n      fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection\r\n      Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without\r\n      \"rational basis.\" But using the term in that sense utterly impoverishes\r\n      our constitutional discourse.\r\n\r\nMorales, 527 U.S. at 84 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\r\n13 I also believe it is somewhat of a misnomer to deem this question one of\r\n\"standing.\" When an individual lacks standing to assert a claim, a court cannot\r\nreview its merits. Here, however, a determination that a party lacks standing to\r\nchallenge a vague statute necessarily involves an examination of the merits of his\r\nclaim. Compare Harriss, 347 U.S. at 615 (\"The constitutional requirement of\r\ndefiniteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary\r\nintelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute.\"),\r\nwith Curtis, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d at 598 (\"One to whose conduct the law\r\nclearly applies does not have standing to challenge it for vagueness.\"). It therefore\r\nis not so much that he lacks standing, but that he loses.\r\n\nuse it as the foundation for a decision in its favor is not only manifestly unfair to\r\nRespondents, it is contrary to longstanding principles of appellate\r\njurisprudence. Georgetown League of Women Voters v. Smith, 393 S.C. 350, 354\r\nn.2, 713 S.E.2d 287, 289 n.2 (2011) (Pleicones) (finding the issue of standing was\r\nnot before the Court because \"this issue was neither raised nor ruled upon below,\r\nnor do the parties mention it in their briefs.\"); State v. Austin, 306 S.C. 9, 19, 409\r\nS.E.2d 811, 817 (Ct. App. 1991) (\"[A]ppellate courts in this state, like well-\r\nbehaved children, do not speak unless spoken to and do not answer questions they\r\nare not asked.\"). The case relied upon by the majority as supplying an avenue to\r\nsua sponte reach Respondents' lack of standing merely states a party must, of\r\ncourse, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute; it does not\r\nstand for the proposition that cases involving constitutional questions are an\r\nexception to our preservation rules for standing. Cf. In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87,\r\n92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (\"A constitutional claim must be raised and ruled\r\nupon to be preserved for review.\"). Even assuming the issue of standing appears\r\nsomewhere in the record, I know of nothing in our precedents that would permit us\r\nto reverse on a ground that was not properly argued to us. See I'On, LLC v. Town\r\nof Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (holding that an\r\nappellate court can rely on any reason \"appearing in the record to affirm the lower\r\ncourt's judgment\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, even if Respondents do not have standing to claim they lacked\r\nnotice, the Supreme Court has expressly held that the second prong of the\r\nvagueness test is an independent ground on which a statute can be found invalid.\r\nHill, 530 U.S. at 732. If notice to the individual always precluded a vagueness\r\nchallenge, then the second prong could never be independent. It therefore must be\r\nanalyzed outside of Respondents' own expectations. Thus, any notice they may\r\nhave had does not bear on whether they are permitted to also claim the statute fails\r\nto provide clear standards for enforcement. That they knew they were committing\r\na crime does not lessen the fact their prosecution could have been the result of\r\narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Such notice would be of little comfort\r\nto Respondents if others who equally should have known they were illegally\r\ngambling were not cited because police interpreted the statute differently. See\r\nMorales, 527 U.S. at 63 (majority opinion) (stating that the fact \"police have\r\nadopted internal rules limiting their enforcement to certain designated areas in the\r\ncity would not provide a defense to a loiterer who might be arrested elsewhere\"). I\r\ntherefore believe there are no impediments to us considering this alternative\r\n\nargument, which the Supreme Court has deemed the more important of the two.\r\nKolender, 461 U.S. at 358.\r\n\r\n      Even though Respondents should \"have known they had it coming,\"\r\nMorales, 527 U.S. at 82 (Scalia, J., dissenting), the record shows they were cited\r\nfor violating section 16-19-40 only because they satisfied the additional criteria\r\nimposed by the Mount Pleasant police. In other words, the use of the language\r\n\"any house used as a place of gaming\" in section 16-19-40 fails to establish\r\nminimum guidelines to govern law enforcement, thereby permitting arbitrary and\r\ndiscriminatory enforcement. I would accordingly hold that statutory language is\r\nunconstitutionally vague.\r\n\r\n      Turning to the merits of Respondents' challenge, it is necessary to first\r\ndetermine exactly what is prohibited by the challenged language in section 16-19­\r\n40. Based on my review of the statute, a view with which a majority of this Court\r\nagrees, it is not a blanket prohibition of all gaming in the home. When the act was\r\noriginally passed, it sought to address the many evils that commonly accompany\r\ngambling:\r\n\r\n      quarrels and controversies, the impoverishment of many people and\r\n      their families, and the ruin of the health and corruption of the morals\r\n      and manners of youth, who in such places frequently fall in company\r\n      with lewd, idle, disorderly and dissolute persons, who have no other\r\n      way of maintaining themselves but by gaming . . . .\r\n\r\n1802 Act No. 1786. The General Assembly used nearly identical language when it\r\namended the statute to cover gambling occurring in the home by adding the \"any\r\nhouse used as a place of gaming\" language. See 1816 Act No. 2096. The General\r\nAssembly therefore sought to prohibit something far more pernicious and insidious\r\nthan a penny-ante bridge or poker game on a Tuesday night, even when it\r\nexpanded enforcement of the ban into the home. Accordingly, a strict reading of\r\nthe statute encompasses more conduct than the General Assembly originally\r\nenvisioned and is contrary to its intent. See McClanahan v. Richland Cnty.\r\nCouncil, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002) (\"All rules of statutory\r\nconstruction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can\r\nbe reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be\r\nconstrued in light of the intended purpose of the statute.\").\r\n\n       Thus, whether a person violates this portion of the statute hinges on whether\r\nhe is actually gambling in a \"house used as place of gaming.\" As the record amply\r\ndemonstrates, there is much confusion as to what a \"house used as a place of\r\ngaming\" actually is. Because the statute does not provide any additional language\r\nregarding its scope, we are left to divine what is proscribed from these seven words\r\nalone. In entertaining a vagueness challenge, we are to give the words in a statute\r\ntheir common meaning. See Curtis, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d at 599. Here,\r\nhowever, I do not believe the phrase \"house used as a place of gaming\" has a\r\ncommon understanding that lends itself to consistent enforcement. The words\r\n\"used as a place of gaming\" (emphasis added) connote something more than just a\r\nhouse where people happen to be gaming. Indeed, the arresting officer testified\r\nbefore the municipal judge that \"it has never been the practice of Mount Pleasant\r\npolice to focus on four or five guys playing poker.\"14 He further testified, \"Based\r\non my understanding of the statute, if it's a group of people that randomly meet\r\nonce every six months or whatever they meet and they play a game of poker, that's\r\nnot a house of gaming.\" The State, which represented the Town on appeal, also\r\nconceded at oral argument that the \"statute does not encompass the Friday night\r\nfriendly poker game or the penny-ante bridge game conducted at your house.\"\r\n\r\n       Because the statute itself provides no guidance, it was up to police and local\r\ngovernments to determine just where this line is drawn. To that end, Officer\r\nHembree believed that the frequency of the games, the number of players involved,\r\nand whether the game was run for a profit all factored into whether individuals\r\nwere playing in a \"house used as a place of gaming.\" However, none of these\r\ncriteria appears in the statute, and Officer Hembree's decision to issue Respondents\r\na citation was based on these additional elements imposed simply to ferret out\r\nconduct he truly believed violated the statute. Officer Hembree therefore had to\r\ntake it upon himself to make a policy decision based on his own personal opinions\r\nas to what should be covered by the statute. It is also clear from Officer Hembree's\r\ntestimony that had another officer entered Stallings' home, the officer could have\r\ncome to a different conclusion.\r\n\r\n14 I mean no disrespect whatsoever to Officer Hembree. He executed a well-\r\nplanned operation and truthfully testified as to what he and the Town honestly\r\nbelieved the statute covered. His equivocation and inability to definitively state the\r\ncriteria to prosecute under section 16-19-40 is not the result of his own intent to\r\nbend the requirements of the statute, but rather emanates from the statute's own\r\nlack of guidance as to what conduct is prohibited.\r\n\n       As the Supreme Court noted long ago, \"[i]t would certainly be dangerous if\r\nthe legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and\r\nleave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and\r\nwho should be set at large.\" United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 221 (1875). But\r\nthat is precisely what was done here. The General Assembly's use of broad\r\nlanguage to proscribe a more narrow course of conduct demonstrates the very\r\nconstitutional infirmity the Supreme Court recognized in Reese, where it is now\r\nleft to the courts and law enforcement personnel to separate prohibited gaming\r\nfrom innocuous conduct without any standards but their own.\r\n\r\n       The plurality's construction of \"any house used as a place of gaming\" amply\r\nproves this point. In opining this portion of section 16-19-40 does not cover a\r\ncasual game of poker, the plurality writes, \"What was originally a ban on merely\r\nplaying these games 'in a public house' became a ban on playing these games in a\r\nresidence or mansion house only when that house was 'used as a place of gaming.'\"\r\n(emphasis added). Thus, it later writes that \"[t]he term of art a 'house used as a\r\nplace of gaming' is meant to distinguish the prohibited place from 'a house where\r\npeople are gaming.'\" I completely agree. However, instead of providing any\r\ncriteria to aid law enforcement in determining just when a residence is elevated\r\nfrom a \"house where people are gaming\" to a \"house used as a place of gaming,\" it\r\nis able to do no more than simply state it depends on the \"facts and circumstances.\"\r\nI do not believe that merely resting this distinction on the particular facts and\r\ncircumstances cures the infirmities of section 16-19-40. Rather, it only\r\nunderscores the impermissible vagueness in a statute which leaves the\r\ndetermination of what constitutes a house used as a place of gaming up \"'to the\r\nmoment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat.'\" See Kolender, 461\r\nU.S. at 360 (quoting Smith, 415 U.S. at 575).\r\n\r\n       \"Condemned to the use of words, we can never expect mathematical\r\ncertainty from our language.\" Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110. However, \"[w]hat renders\r\na statute vague is not the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine\r\nwhether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved; but rather the\r\nindeterminacy of precisely what that fact is.\" United States v. Williams, 553 U.S.\r\n285, 306 (2008). What is left undetermined by this text of section 16-19-40 is\r\nwhat constitutes a house used as a place of gaming, and police and local\r\ngovernments had to fill this gap themselves. This will not do, and the decision to\r\nprosecute some individuals as opposed to others cannot emanate from law\r\n\nenforcement's imposition of its own additional criteria. Here, Respondents were\r\ncited not just for playing poker and betting inside someone's home; they were cited\r\nbecause the meetings were regular, attended by up to twenty people each time, and\r\nthe house allegedly made a profit. The challenged portion of section 16-19-40 is\r\ntherefore unconstitutionally vague as applied to Respondents because their arrest\r\nand conviction was the result of an ad hoc and subjective application of additional\r\ncriteria designed to give the guidance section 16-19-40 left wanting.\r\n\r\n       Turning next to whether the phrase \"any house used as a place of gaming\" is\r\nfacially vague, I find persuasive the following passage from Justice Breyer's\r\nconcurrence in Morales concluding an ordinance was facially invalid because it\r\nlaid too much discretion on police officers:\r\n\r\n      The reason why the ordinance is invalid explains how that is so. As I\r\n      have said, I believe the ordinance violates the Constitution because it\r\n      delegates too much discretion to a police officer to decide whom to\r\n      order to move on, and in what circumstances. And I see no way to\r\n      distinguish in the ordinance's terms between one application of that\r\n      discretion and another. The ordinance is unconstitutional, not because\r\n      a policeman applied this discretion wisely or poorly in a particular\r\n      case, but rather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in\r\n      every case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an\r\n      exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinance is invalid in all its\r\n      applications.\r\n\r\n527 U.S. at 71 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in the result).\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, when a statute such as section 16-19-40 or the one at issue in\r\nMorales grants officers too much discretion, the decision to target a certain\r\nindividual is based upon the officer's own understanding of what the statute\r\nproscribes and not solely upon the language of the statute itself. Therefore, every\r\narrest or citation is the result of the officer's personal exercise of discretion; the\r\nindividuals he lets be are only granted that relief because he has decided their\r\nconduct does not fall within the proscription as he understands it. I agree with\r\nJustice Breyer that the inescapable conclusion accordingly is that the statute's\r\napplication is invalid in every case, rendering it facially unconstitutional. A\r\ncriminal statute is the place for setting forth with precision what conduct\r\nconstitutes a crime, and our law does not sanction the idea that police and the\r\n\nprosecution can subjectively vary from the statutory elements and impose their\r\nseparate criteria. If part of a statute permits such variance, as the one before us\r\ntoday does, that language is unconstitutionally vague.\r\n\r\n       In writing to hold section 16-19-40 facially void by prohibiting gambling in\r\n\"any house used as a place of gaming,\" I am not unmindful of the Supreme Court's\r\nadmonition that \"[f]acial challenges are disfavored.\" See Wash. State Grange, 552\r\nU.S. at 450; see also Jansen v. State ex rel. Downing, 137 So. 2d 47, 50 (Ala.\r\n1962) (\"[S]uch power should be exercised only when a statute is so incomplete, so\r\nirreconcilably conflicting, or so vague or indefinite, that it cannot be executed, and\r\nthe court is unable, by the application of known and accepted rules of construction,\r\nto determine, with any reasonable degree of certainty, what the legislature\r\nintended.\"). In my opinion, however, this is one of the rare cases where a statute\r\nprovides too little guidance to police officers and thereby accords them too much\r\ndiscretion in the statute's enforcement. Therefore, I would find section 16-19-40\r\n\"is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it encourages arbitrary\r\nenforcement by failing to describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must\r\ndo in order to satisfy the statute.\" See Kolender, 461 U.S. at 361.\r\n\r\n       I close by responding to two points made in the Chief Justice's separate\r\nconcurrence, which ostensibly are why she believes this case is \"unique.\" I\r\ndisagree that any uncertainty concerning the statute's severability impacts its\r\nconstitutionality. I know of no authority for this position, and the Chief Justice\r\ncites none. To the contrary, we have long held that when an unconstitutional\r\nportion of a statute cannot be severed from the rest, the statute as a whole falls.\r\nSee, e.g., Fairway Ford, Inc. v. Timmons, 281 S.C. 57, 314 S.E.2d 322 (1984)\r\n(\"The rule is that where a part of a statute is unconstitutional, if such part is so\r\nconnected with the other parts as that they mutually depend upon each other as\r\nconditions and considerations for each other, so as to warrant the belief that the\r\nLegislature intended them as a whole, and if they cannot be carried into effect, the\r\nLegislature would not have passed the residue independently of that which is void,\r\nthe whole act is void.\" (quoting Townsend v. Richland Cnty., 190 S.C. 270, ___, 2\r\nS.E.2d 777, 781 (1930))). I also disagree that we may not strike as\r\nunconstitutionally vague only that portion of the statute—\"any house used as a\r\nplace of gaming\"—which was challenged in this case without impacting the\r\nbalance of the statute.\r\n\n       Finally, I cannot comprehend her concern that if any part of the statute is\r\nheld unconstitutional, a parade of horribles will ensue, including the resurrection of\r\nvideo poker. The prohibition of video poker is found in Section 12-21-2710 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2000). This is a completely separate section (and title) of\r\nthe code and makes no reference at all to section 16-19-40. In fact, it is entirely\r\nindependent and separate from the general gambling prohibitions involved here.\r\nStriking section 16-19-40 in whole or in part would have no impact on section 12­\r\n21-2710.\r\n\r\n      The Chief Justice's fear that gambling and all its attendant vices would\r\nreturn unabated if we strike down a portion of this statute has no place in the\r\nexecution of our duty to declare law unconstitutional. The decision to ban\r\ngambling and prevent the ills that accompany it rests solely with the General\r\nAssembly; but it must do so in a constitutional manner. In my view, we abandon\r\nour role as the neutral arbiter of a statute's constitutionality the very moment we\r\ndecide to save a statute because we like what it does.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the circuit court's holding that the\r\nportion of section 16-19-40 prohibiting gambling in \"any house used as a place of\r\ngaming\" is unconstitutionally vague as applied and on its face. While I recognize\r\nthat doing so would upset the law as it has existed for almost 200 years, when a\r\nlaw is unconstitutional it is our duty to so declare.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William Jones Rivers, III","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2012-11-20-01","description":"","date":"2012-11-21","type":"order","text":"\r\n  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\ntd {\r\n\tfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n\tfont-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n\r\n  In the Matter of William Jones Rivers, III, Respondent.\r\n\r\n  Appellate Case No. 2012-213416\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel asks this Court to place respondent on \r\n  interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(b) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court \r\n  Rules (SCACR).  The petition also seeks appointment of an attorney to protect \r\n  the interests of respondent's clients pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.  Respondent consents to being placed on interim suspension and to the \r\n  appointment of an attorney to protect his clients' interests.   \r\nIT IS ORDERED that respondent's license to practice \r\n  law in this state is suspended until further order of this Court. \r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Nicholas W.
