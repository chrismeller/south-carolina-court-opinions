Conner (Employee) appeals a jury verdict in favor of the City of Forest Acres (City) in this wrongful discharge action.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEmployee brought this wrongful discharge action, grounded in breach of contract, in what is commonly known as a â€œemployee handbook claim,â€ against City in 1994.Â  We reversed a grant of summary judgment to City and remanded the case for trial.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002) (affirming in part and reversing in part the unpublished opinion of the Court of Appeals).\r\nEmployee was a police dispatcher and office worker in Cityâ€™s police department for nine years.Â  From November 1992 to June 1993, six written reprimands were issued to Employee for violating the dress code, tardiness, performing poor work, leaving work without permission, and using abusive language.\r\nIn July 1993, Employee was evaluated as unsatisfactory and placed on a ninety-day probation.Â  She received written reprimands twice in August 1993 and her October 1993 evaluation reflected only slight improvement.Â  Police Chief J.C. Rowe notified Employee by letter dated October 7, 1993, that she was terminated from her job.\r\nVarious witnesses for both parties, including Chief Rowe, testified that until her last year or so in the job, Employee was a competent, motivated employee who excelled as a dispatcher - â€œamong the best,â€ â€œfantastic,â€ â€œconsistent and effective,â€ and â€œtop of the line.â€Â  Witnesses presented by Employee testified they had a good working relationship with her in 1992-93, although some were patrol officers who had limited contact with office staff.Â  Employee, then age 50, admitted she made some mistakes and sometimes even described herself to other staff members as a â€œb----.â€Â  But she denied most of the allegations of wrongdoing as well as Cityâ€™s effort to portray her as a troublemaker who enjoyed disrupting the office staff. \r\nIn contrast, witnesses presented by City, most of whom worked in police and municipal court offices, testified Employeeâ€™s attitude, behavior, and work habits deteriorated severely in 1992-93.Â  Employee belittled or berated co-workers for no reason, took excessive smoking and bathroom breaks, purposely misplaced or disorganized facsimile messages and arrest paperwork, showed disrespect toward police supervisors in the presence of private citizens, ignored the requests of disliked co-workers, used excessive profanity, and generally refused to work cooperatively with other office staff.Â  \r\nThe jury rendered a verdict for City at the conclusion of a four-day trial.Â  This appeal was certified for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and the trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Pike v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000); Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.Â  Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1991); Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987).Â  To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the wrongly admitted or excluded evidence.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997); Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commn., 254 S.C. 378, 405, 175 S.E.2d 805, 819 (1970); Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 160, 156 S.E.2d 759, 764 (1967).\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nDid the trial court err by prohibiting Employee from introducing evidence about the grievance process, which occurred after Employeeâ€™s initial termination date, and in instructing the jury to disregard all such evidence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nEmployee contends the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to allow Employee to introduce evidence about events which occurred after Employeeâ€™s initial termination on October 7, 1993, and in instructing the jury to disregard subsequent events.Â  Employee argues that evidence of the disciplinary process followed in Employeeâ€™s case, the vote and recommendation of the grievance committee which heard her case, and the actions of city council which reviewed her case were admissible.Â  Such evidence was necessary to establish the existence of a contract and lack of the evidence allowed the jury to draw an inference that the procedure was not binding and thus no contract existed.Â  Employee asserts the evidence also was admissible on the issue of whether City acted in good faith and had a sufficient and reasonable basis to terminate Employee.Â  We agree in part.\r\nCity moved in limine to prohibit admission of any evidence of events occurring after October 7, including the actions of the grievance committee and city council.Â  City argued that Employee in her complaint had not alleged City had failed to follow the grievance procedure.Â  City asserted it had fully complied with the County and Municipal Employees Grievance Procedure Act,[1] which City contended provides for nothing more than a review of a decision already made and does not limit Cityâ€™s power to terminate at-will employees.\r\nThe trial court ruled this Court in Conner, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606, had conclusively established October 7 as Employeeâ€™s effective, final termination date.Â  Therefore, Employee would not be allowed to introduce evidence of grievance proceedings occurring after that date because such events were irrelevant and likely to cause unfair prejudice to City or confuse the jury.Â  See Rules 401-403, SCRE.Â  The trial court ruled Employee would be required to prove her case - i.e., the existence of a contract which modified her at-will employment status by virtue of mandatory language in the handbook and, if a contract existed, the lack of a reasonable, good-faith belief that City had sufficient cause to terminate her - based solely on evidence of events occurring on or before October 7.\r\nThe trial court erred in interpreting Conner to effectively establish October 7, which was mentioned in the recitation of the facts, as the final termination date.Â  We further conclude the trial court erred in relying in its ruling on section 15-2 of Cityâ€™s municipal code, which states the police chief â€œshall have complete authority to appoint, suspend and remove all police personnel and employees of the police department.â€Â  The disciplinary and grievance policies contained within the various handbooks, combined with the particular facts of this case revealing City followed those policies, demonstrate city council made the final decision to terminate Employee when it voted to reject the committeeâ€™s recommendation and uphold the police chiefâ€™s decision. \r\nWe disagree with City that the ordinance somehow supercedes established City policies and practices by vesting sole and final termination authority in the police chief.Â  â€œHowever plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.â€Â  Kiriakides v. United Artists Commun., Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).\r\nThe entire grievance process would be a meaningless exercise in futility if we were to adopt Cityâ€™s interpretation of the ordinance.Â  Instead, we interpret the ordinance to mean simply the police chief has the final termination authority within the department, subject to established grievance policies and review as set forth in Cityâ€™s personnel manuals and the Grievance Procedure Act.[2]  \r\nCity presented as evidence the written disciplinary and grievance procedures contained in Cityâ€™s personnel manuals issued in 1987 and 1993 and in the police departmentâ€™s personnel manual.Â  The manuals were discussed at length in general terms by Cityâ€™s witnesses, who also emphasized language in the manuals which disclaimed any contract of employment, as well as statements signed by Employee acknowledging the manuals were not contracts of employment.Â  Thus, City repeatedly presented evidence the handbook did not modify Employeeâ€™s at-will status.\r\nThe trial court barred evidence City actually followed its handbook policies in Employeeâ€™s case, i.e., that a grievance committee heard the matter, the committee voted 2-1 to reinstate Employee, and city council voted to reject the grievance committeeâ€™s recommendation and uphold the termination.Â  Specifically, the trial court excluded testimony from W.D. Morris, chairman of the grievance committee appointed to hear Employeeâ€™s case, about the hearing.Â  The trial court also excluded testimony from Ron Garbinsky, city administrator, about the grievance hearing or city councilâ€™s actions.Â  Employee testified she filed a grievance and a hearing was held, but the trial court excluded further testimony about the hearing.\r\nDespite the trial courtâ€™s rulings, the jury heard Employee testify she filed a grievance and a grievance hearing was held.Â  Employeeâ€™s vocational rehabilitation expert mentioned Employeeâ€™s grievance proceeding.Â Â  The city administrator testified the grievance committee held a hearing and issued a written decision to city council.Â  Cityâ€™s former mayor testified the grievance committee held a hearing, issued a report recommending Employee â€œshouldnâ€™t be fired,â€ and city council voted on the report.Â  \r\nIn keeping with its evidentiary rulings, the trial court instructed the jury \r\n\r\nI want you to remember one thing particularly in the course of your deliberations.Â  The City terminated [Employee] on October the 7th, 1993.Â  October the 7th, 1993.Â  You are not to consider anything beyond that date.Â  Thereâ€™s been some evidence or some discussion in this case about a grievance procedure and a procedure thatâ€™s outlined in the manual and a Grievance Committee which may have acted after October the 7th.Â  Youâ€™re not to concern yourselves with that.Â  The law says that you must judge the Cityâ€™s actions through Chief Rowe as of October the 7th.Â  In effect, in effect, you are now the Grievance Committee and you are the judge of the Cityâ€™s actions.\r\n\r\nWe analyze this case in light of the presumption the jury followed the trial courtâ€™s instructions to ignore any evidence it heard about post-October 7 events.Â  See Buff v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 342 S.C. 416, 426 n.3, 537 S.E.2d 279, 284 n.3 (2000) (â€œJuries are presumed and bound to follow the instructions of the trial judge.â€) (Pleicones, J., dissenting); Kennedy v. Kennedy, 86 S.C. 483, 68 S.E. 664 (1910) (appellate court will presume the jury heeded the admonition of the trial court regarding the effect or consideration of certain evidence).\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the doctrine of at-will employment.Â  This doctrine provides that a contract for employment may be immediately terminated by either employer or employee when unsupported by consideration other than the employerâ€™s duty to provide compensation in exchange for the employeeâ€™s duty to perform a service or obligation.Â  Such a termination may occur at any time and for any reason or no reason at all, subject to certain limited exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine and subject to certain prohibitions against illegal discrimination which are not at issue in this case.Â  E.g. Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., 360 S.C. 58, 66-68, 599 S.E.2d 456, 460-61 (2004); Conner, 348 S.C. at 463-64, 560 S.E.2d 610-11; Stiles v. American Gen. Life Ins. Co., 335 S.C. 222, 224-25, 516 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1999); Baril v. Aiken Regl. Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 281-82, 573 S.E.2d 830, 836 (Ct. App. 2002); Burns v. Universal Health Servs., Inc., 361 S.C. 221, 233-34, 603 S.E.2d 605, 611-12 (Ct. App. 2004) (discussing exceptions).\r\nIn the exception to the at-will employment doctrine, an employee handbook containing mandatory statements regarding disciplinary and grievance policies may be enforced against an employer as contractual obligations in a wrongful discharge action, despite the presence of a disclaimer in the handbook which asserts it is not intended to create a contract of employment.Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 463-64, 560 S.E.2d at 610-11; Fleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 460-63, 450 S.E.2d 589, 594-96 (1994); Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987).[3]\r\nA jury initially must determine whether an employment contract exists, such that an employee may be fired only for sufficient cause.Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 463-65, 560 S.E.2d at 610-12.Â  â€œ[T]he disclaimer is merely one factor to consider in ascertaining whether the handbook as a whole conveys credible promises that should be enforced. . . . The entire handbook, including any disclaimer, should be considered in determining whether the handbook gives rise to a promise, an expectation, and a benefit.â€Â  Fleming, 316 S.C. at 463, 450 S.E.2d at 596.\r\nFurthermore, it is proper to consider events occurring after an employeeâ€™s initial termination date and during the grievance process when deciding whether the employeeâ€™s at-will status was modified by promises contained in a handbook.Â  See Burns, 361 S.C. at 236, 603 S.E.2d at 615 (employerâ€™s handling of employeeâ€™s termination, such as issuing a written warning in compliance with its handbook, inferentially demonstrates an employment contract); Oâ€™Brien v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 664 N.E.2d 843, 847 (Mass. 1996) (employerâ€™s adherence to grievance procedure in personnel manual was some evidence of existence of contract based on manualâ€™s terms); Warner v. Federal Express Corp., 174 F. Supp. 2d 215, 228 (D.N.J. 2001) (considering whether employer followed established grievance policies after termination of employee in deciding whether employee had established breach of alleged contract); Stephenson v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., 924 F. Supp. 1258, 1280 (D. Mass. 1996) (employerâ€™s dissemination of an employment manual and its adherence to grievance procedure may constitute evidence of employment contract); Marrs v. Marriott Corp., 830 F. Supp. 274, 280 (D. Md. 1992) (considering evidence of partiesâ€™ compliance with employerâ€™sÂ  grievance policies in determining whether employer had met contractual obligation allegedly bestowed on employee by handbook); Plummer v. Humana of Kansas, Inc., 715 F. Supp. 302, 304 (D. Kan. 1988) (considering terminated employeeâ€™s failure to follow grievance procedures in granting summary judgment to employer on handbook-based claim).\r\nIf the jury finds the existence of a contract, i.e., that the handbookâ€™s mandatory policies and procedures modified the employeeâ€™s at-will employment status, the jury next must determine whether the contract was breached.Â  When an employment contract only permits termination for cause, the appropriate test on the issue of breach focuses on whether the employer had â€œa reasonable good faith belief that sufficient cause existed for termination.â€Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 464-65, 560 S.E.2d at 611 (emphasis in original).Â  â€œ[T]he fact finder must not focus on whether the employee actually committed misconduct; instead, the focus must be on whether the employer reasonably determined it had cause to terminate.â€Â  Id. at 464-65, 560 S.E.2d at 611.\r\nThe trial court erred in excluding evidence of events occurring after Employeeâ€™s initial termination date and in instructing the jury to disregard such events.Â  Employee should have been allowed to submit testimony and evidence about the grievance proceeding in her case, in the limited manner further explained below, for two reasons. \r\nFirst, when the existence of a contract is disputed or its terms are ambiguous, evidence that a party complied with the terms of the alleged contract or acted in conformity therewith is relevant and admissible on the issues of the contractâ€™s existence, the meaning of its terms, and whether the contract was breached.Â  Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 303, 468 S.E.2d 292, 300 (1996) (contract may be based on verbal understanding to which both parties have mutually assented and upon which both are acting); Gaskins v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of S.C., 271 S.C. 101, 105, 245 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1978) (â€œagreementâ€ does not necessarily import any direct or express stipulation, nor is it necessary that it should be in writing; if there is verbal understanding to which both parties have assented, and upon which both are acting, it is an agreement); Baylor v. Bath, 189 S.C. 269, 1 S.E.2d 139 (1938) (in lawsuit to enforce specific performance of an alleged oral agreement by elderly bachelor to make a will in consideration of care and nursing, it was proper to admit evidence that plaintiffs provided care and nursing for three years until bachelorâ€™s death to prove existence of the contract and performance under its terms).Â  A contract may arise from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct.Â  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Co-op., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 335, 516 S.E.2d 923, 926 (1999) ) (emphasis added); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 439 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nThese cases demonstrate courts have applied rudimentary contract principles in handbook cases.Â  Consequently, evidence of whether City adhered to its disciplinary and grievance policies is relevant and admissible on the issues of whether Employeeâ€™s at-will status had been modified, i.e., the existence of a contract, the meaning of the terms of the contract, and whether either party breached the contract by failing to comply with its terms.\r\nSecond, if the jury were to conclude a contract existed, the actions or omissions of Cityâ€™s supervisors and agents during the post-termination grievance proceedings may in some instances be relevant and admissible in determining whether those agents had a reasonable, good faith belief that sufficient cause existed to terminate Employee.Â  Circumstances surrounding a grievance proceeding, or the lack thereof, may reveal whether an employerâ€™s reasons for termination were pretextual, did not constitute sufficient cause, or were not done in good faith.\r\nWe emphasize that detailed or extensive testimony about grievance proceedings which occurred after the initial termination date ordinarily should not be admitted.Â  The aggrieved employee should have the opportunity to present evidence focusing on the policies and procedures allegedly required by the employee handbook, and whether the employer adhered to those policies and procedures.Â  Such evidence generally should be limited to the fact and duration of a grievance proceeding, a general description of the purpose and substance of the proceeding, and the identity and relationship of participants in the proceeding.Â  Such evidence usually should not include extensive references to or repetition of particular testimony or evidence in the grievance proceeding, although a party is free to use prior, sworn testimony for impeachment purposes when permissible under evidentiary rules.\r\nWe further emphasize that the specific recommendation or vote of the grievance committee or the individual or body vested with employment and discharge authority generally is not admissible evidence.Â  We have not found nor has either party cited any controlling authority on this point.Â  We agree with Cityâ€™s contention the vote of a grievance committee or other body vested with employment and discharge authority is akin to the finding of a prior jury or administrative agency, which usually is not admissible at trial.Â  See Nohrden v. Northeastern R.R. Co., 59 S.C. 87, 101, 37 S.E. 228, 237 (1900) (â€œ[I]t would be improper to allow any reference to the action of the former jury calculated to influence the jury then trying the case.Â  Each jury must act upon [its] own responsibility, and according to [its] own view of the testimony submitted to [it], entirely uninfluenced by the action of any other jury.â€); Shelton v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., 325 S.C. 248, 252, 481 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1997) (public policy dictates that findings made by Employment Security Commission on narrow issue of unemployment benefits will not be given collateral estoppel effect in subsequent wrongful termination lawsuit).\r\nMoreover, admission of evidence of a grievance committeeâ€™s specific recommendation or vote is likely to cause unfair prejudice and confusion, and constitutes an unwarranted intrusion into the juryâ€™s role as factfinder.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE; Barfield v. Orange County, 911 F.2d 644, 651 (11th Cir. 1990) (admission of a report by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on whether reasonable cause exists to believe employment discrimination occurred â€œmay be much more likely to present the danger of creating unfair prejudice in the minds of the jury than in the mind of the trial judge, who is well aware of the limits and vagaries of administrative determinations and better able to assign the report appropriate weight and no moreâ€); Cammer v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 214 S.C. 71, 81, 51 S.E.2d 174, 178 (1948) (tasks of resolving contradictions in evidence, determining witnessesâ€™ credibility, and deciding what testimony to accept when resolving a case are all left to the jury as factfinder; and these propositions are such elementary observations there is no need to cite supporting authority).\r\nWhile we find error in the trial courtâ€™s rulings excluding evidence of the grievance proceeding, as well as the charge requiring the jury to ignore evidence of events occurring after Employeeâ€™s initial termination date, we find the errors were harmless in this case.Â  An error may be harmless when the aggrieved party fails to establish a claim or defense even when both the admitted and excluded evidence are considered.Â  See Triple â€œF,â€ Inc. v. Gerrard, 298 S.C. 44, 378 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1989) (even if trial court wrongly excluded extension agentâ€™s testimony university had not endorsed feed program for area dairy farmers, the error was harmless because only testimony on record did not establish feed suppliersâ€™ claim that feed program marketer had committed fraud).\r\nThe jury in this case returned a general verdict.Â  The jury may have determined no employment contract existed due to the handbook or, if there was a contract, City proved it had a reasonable, good faith belief sufficient cause existed to terminate Employee.Â  If we assume, for purposes of argument, Employee would have been able to establish the existence of a contract had she been allowed to present the wrongly excluded evidence, we, nonetheless, are persuaded the jury would not have found in her favor.Â  The record is replete with compelling evidence Employeeâ€™s attitude, behavior, and work habits deteriorated severely in 1992-93.Â  Thus, City had a reasonable, good faith belief sufficient cause existed for Employeeâ€™s termination.Â  Employee has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the lack of the wrongly excluded evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the grievance proceedings which occurred after Employeeâ€™s initial termination date and in instructing the jury to ignore such evidence.Â  Such evidence may be presented in a wrongful discharge action based on mandatory policies and procedures contained in an employee handbook for the reasons and within the limitations we have described.Â  We further conclude Employee has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the lack of the wrongly excluded evidence.Â  Accordingly, the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of City is affirmed.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 8-17-110 to -160 (1996 &amp; Supp. 2004).Â  The Act allows a county or municipality to adopt a plan for the resolution of employee grievances.Â  The employee may submit her grievance to a committee, which conducts a hearing and has the authority to request pertinent documents and witnesses.Â  The committee must report its findings to the individual or body vested with employment and discharge authority, which approves or rejects the committeeâ€™s decision without further hearing.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The Grievance Procedure Act indicates a supervisorâ€™s initial termination of a government employee entitled to a grievance process is not the final decision.Â  The Act provides that the â€œcommittee shall . . . make its findings and decision and report the findings and decision to the individual or body vested with employment and discharge authority.Â  If the individual or body vested with employment and discharge authority approves, the decision of the grievance committee is final. . . . If, however, the individual or body vested with the employment and discharge authority rejects the decision of the committee, it shall make its own decision without further hearing, and that decision is final. . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-17-140 (Supp. 2004).Â  Therefore, the police chief in this case did not have the sole and final authority to terminate Employee, who would have been reinstated if city council had approved the grievance committeeâ€™s decision.\r\n[3]Â  The Legislature has enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-1-110 (Supp. 2004), which took effect March 15, 2004.Â  This statute provides a handbook shall not create an employment contract if it is conspicuously disclaimed.Â  This statute does not apply in Employeeâ€™s case because it only applies to handbooks issued after June 30, 2004.Â  Employeeâ€™s handbooks were issued in 1993 and earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25962","title":"Evening Post Publishing v.

City of North Charleston, 357 S.C. 59, 591 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 2003), in which the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s decision that Respondent City of North Charleston (the City) properly denied the FOIA request of Petitioner Evening Post Publishing Company (the Post).Â  We reverse and remand to the circuit court.\r\nFACTS\r\nFour Caucasian men attacked an African-American man (the victim) in front of a store, and the store owner called 911.Â  When police officers arrived, the victim was inside the store and holding a gun.Â  The officers shot and killed him.Â  \r\nThe four attackers were arrested and charged with lynching.Â  The police officers were not charged with a crime.Â  \r\nThe 911 tape contains the store ownerâ€™s description of the attack to the dispatcher.Â  The tape also contains conversations between the dispatcher and police officers about the incident.\r\nSeveral months prior to the lynching trial, the Post filed with the City a FOIA request for a copy of the tape.Â  The Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Circuit was consulted by the City and opined that the tape would be evidence in the upcoming lynching trial.Â  Consequently, the Solicitor suggested, the tape was exempt from disclosure pursuant to South Carolina Code section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B).[2]Â  In respect of the Solicitorâ€™s assessment, the City denied the Postâ€™s request.Â  \r\nThe Post then filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunction to compel release of the tape.Â  The circuit court held that under section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B), the tape was exempt from disclosure until the lynching trial concluded.[3]Â  The Post appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.[4]  \r\nISSUEÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhether the 911 tape was exempt from disclosure pursuant to South Carolina Code section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nUnder FOIA, â€œ[a]ny person has a right to inspect or copy any public record of a public body,â€ unless that record is exempt from disclosure.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(a) (1991).[5]Â  Whether a record is exempt depends on the particular facts of the case.Â  City of Columbia v. ACLU, 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1996).Â  Underlying each case, however, is the principle that the exemptions in section 30-4-40 are to be narrowly construed so as to fulfill the purpose of FOIA ... â€œto guarantee the public reasonable access to certain activities of the government.â€Â  Fowler v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 463, 468, 472 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (1991); Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 156, 161, 547 S.E.2d 862, 864-65 (2001).Â  To further advance this purpose, the government has the burden of proving that an exemption applies.Â  \r\nHere, the City invoked section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B), which exempts from disclosure \r\n\r\n[r]ecords of law enforcement and public safety\r\nagencies not otherwise available by law that\r\nwere compiled in the process of detecting and\r\ninvestigating crime if the disclosure of the\r\ninformation would harm the agency by â€¦\r\n[t]he premature release of information to be\r\nused in a prospective law enforcement action. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) (1991).\r\nAll of the elements of this exemption are present except â€œharm the agency.â€Â  \r\nThe City argues that pre-trial release of the tape would have led to substantial pre-trial publicity, which likely would have tainted the entire jury pool, causing the venue of the trial to be changed.Â  According to the City, the harm would have been that the Solicitorâ€™s Office could not have afforded the financial cost of a change of venue.\r\nAt the outset, we note that the harm claimed by the City would actually have been harm to the Solicitorâ€™s Office.Â  We agree with the City that with respect to the lynching prosecution, harm to the Solicitorâ€™s Office would have constituted harm to the City.Â  The City and the Solicitorâ€™s Office have a shared interest in the prosecution of persons charged with committing crimes in the City.Â  \r\nThe financial cost of a venue change, however, is not the type of harm that section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) is intended to prevent.[6]Â  Rather, it is intended to prevent harms such as those caused by release of a crime suspectâ€™s name before arrest, the location of an upcoming sting operation, and other sensitive law-enforcement information.Â  We do not close the door to pre-trial publicity ever factoring into a decision whether this exemption applies.Â  We hold only that the financial burden of a potential change in venue did not justify withholding the 911 tape.[7]\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred by holding that harm is irrefutably presumed when the subject of the FOIA request will be evidence in a prospective criminal trial.Â  We reject this categorical rule in favor of the usual case-by-case approach.Â  The City was required to prove particular harm.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals based its holding in part on State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991), cert. denied, 303 U.S. 937, 112 S. Ct. 1477, 117 L. Ed. 2d 620 (1992), in which we did adopt a narrow per se rule.Â  We held that section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) â€œexempts discovery of material that is not otherwise discoverable under Rule 5(a)(3)â€ of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.Â  â€œNo specific showing of harm is required by the State if the [FOIA] request involves such material.â€Â  Robinson, 305 S.C. at 476-77, 409 S.E.2d at 409.Â  In other words, a criminal defendantâ€™s obtaining more information through FOIA than that to which he is entitled through discovery presumptively â€œharms the agency.â€Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals misapprehended that Robinson merely reflects the widely accepted principle that FOIA is not to be used by those under criminal charges to circumvent the limitations of discovery.Â  See, e.g., State ex rel. Wyant v. Brotherton, 214 W.Va. 434, 438-39, 589 S.E.2d 812, 816-17 (W.Va. 2003); Henderson v. State, 745 So.2d 319 (Fla. 1999).Â  That principle is not implicated here, because the 911 tape was available through both criminal and civil discovery.Â  Indeed, the lynching defendants received copies of the tape through criminal discovery, and the victimâ€™s estate received a copy through civil discovery.Â  See, supra, note 3.\r\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals misinterpreted Turner v. North Charleston Police Department, 290 S.C. 511, 351 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1986), in which the Court of Appeals upheld the denial of a FOIA request pursuant to section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B).Â  In the case sub judice, the Court of Appeals held that Turner stands for the rule that evidence in a forthcoming criminal trial is categorically exempt from disclosure under FOIA.Â  Evening Post Pub. Co., 357 S.C. at 63-64, 591 S.E.2d at 41.Â  Yet, the result in Turner was reached because of a threat of particular harm,[8] not because of any per se rule.Â  Like Robinson, therefore, Turner does not support the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â Â  \r\nAs we have explained, the City was not entitled to a presumption that it would be harmed by disclosure of the 911 tapeâ€™s contents.Â  The City was required to prove that it would suffer particular harm, and the City did not meet its burden.Â  The Cityâ€™s non-disclosure therefore violated FOIA.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Cityâ€™s denial of the Postâ€™s request for a copy of the 911 tape violated FOIA.Â  The tape was not exempt from disclosure pursuant to South Carolina Code section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B).Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for a determination whether any further relief should be granted.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-10 through 30-4-165 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2004).\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3)(B) (1991).Â  Although not pertinent here, subsection 30-4-40(a)(3) was amended in 2002.Â  2002 Act No. 350, Â§ 1 (effective July 19, 2002); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3) (Supp. 2004).\r\n[3] The victimâ€™s estate intervened in the action and also sought production of the tape in its civil suit against the City.Â  The estate received a copy pursuant to the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure but was ordered to not publicize the tape until the lynching trial ended.Â  Earlier, the lynching defendants had received copies of the tape pursuant to the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure. \r\n[4] After the tape was played in open court at the lynching trial, the Post published a transcript.Â  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the case is not moot, because â€œthe facts presented here are capable of repetition yet evading review.â€Â  Evening Post Pub. Co., 357 S.C. at 62, 591 S.E.2d at 41.\r\n[5] That a record is exempt does not mean that the government has a duty of non-disclosure.Â  Rather, an exemption provides the government with discretion to either withhold the record or release it.Â  S.C. Tax Commâ€™n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 169, 447 S.E.2d 843, 846-47 (1994); Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991).\r\n[6] The City and the Solicitor were not actually seeking to protect the defendantsâ€™ rights to fair trials, and the defendants did not intervene in attempt to protect themselves.Â  Thus, the issue whether this FOIA exemption would have been a proper mechanism by which to protect the defendants is not before the Court.Â  We do note that in the past we have addressed pre-trial publicityâ€™s threat to a fair trial in other contexts.Â  See, e.g., Ex parte The Island Packet, 308 S.C. 198, 201-02, 417 S.E.2d 575, 577-78 (1992) (explaining the test for the closure of a court proceeding); Ex parte First Charleston Corp., 329 S.C. 31, 34-35, 495 S.E.2d 423, 424-25 (1998) (in another closed-proceeding case, observing that even in highly publicized cases, voir dire is usually sufficient to ensure a fair trial); State-Record Co. v. State, 332 S.C. 346, 350-59, 504 S.E.2d 592, 594-99 (1998) (upholding a temporary restraining order (TRO) that prevented the media from publishing the contents of a videotape prior to trial).\r\n[7] At the circuit court, the prosecutor in charge of the lynching trial testified that another harm would have occurred.Â  He asserted that allowing the City to release the tape prior to trial would have caused him to lose his license to practice law, for he would have thereby violated Rules 3.6 and 3.8(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct, which generally prohibit a prosecutor from creating pre-trial publicity.Â  Rules 3.6 and 3.8(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  We appreciate the prosecutorâ€™s desire to act professionally, but the Rules of Professional Conduct did not affect whether the 911 tape was exempt from disclosure under FOIA.Â  Disclosure under FOIA is the obligation of the government.Â  Professionalism is the personal obligation of a government attorney.Â Â  See Lawyer Disciplinary Bd. v. McGraw, 194 W.Va. 788, 799-800, 461 S.E.2d 850, 861-62 (W.Va. 1995) (distinguishing between the state attorney generalâ€™s professional obligations and the stateâ€™s FOIA obligations).Â Â Â Â  \r\n[8] The 911 tape at issue in Turner â€œincluded calls from regular informants as well as Crimestopper calls from citizens.â€Â  290 S.C. at 513, 351 S.E.2d at 584.Â  The sensitive nature of that information was the basis for applying section 30-4-40(a)(3)(B), though we note that another exemption specifically addresses â€œ[d]isclosing the identity of informants not otherwise known.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3)(A) (1991).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25963","title":"Evans v.

Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Lakesha Jeffries, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We granted George Allen Evansâ€™\r\n(Petitionerâ€™s) petition for a writ of certiorari to decide whether a criminal defendant has the right to obtain documents pertaining to the impanelment of the state grand jury which indicted him.Â  We conclude a defendant has a right to obtain such documents.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL POSTURE\r\nPetitioner was tried in his absence in 1992, convicted of one count of trafficking in cocaine, and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison and fined $50,000.Â  The Court of Appeals vacated the conviction due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  State v. Evans, 319 S.C. 320, 460 S.E.2d 578 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  We reversed.Â  State v. Evans, 322 S.C. 78, 470 S.E.2d 97 (1996).\r\nPetitioner filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) action and sought the â€œfiles of the state grand jury,â€ including, but not limited to, the Stateâ€™s petition and the court order impaneling the state grand jury which indicted him for trafficking in cocaine. Â The clerk of the state grand jury refused to release the documents pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1770 (Supp. 2003).\r\nHowever, by agreement of the parties and upon order of the PCR judge, the clerk provided the documents to the PCR judge for in camera review.Â  The partiesâ€™ attorneys have not reviewed the documents.Â  However, the documents have been submitted to and reviewed by this Court. \r\nThe PCR judge denied Petitionerâ€™s application following an in camera review of the documents.Â  The PCR judge found the petition and order were proper and the state grand jury that indicted Petitioner was properly impaneled.Â  Therefore, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction in Petitionerâ€™s case.\r\nThe PCR judge further ruled Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge the indictment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice.Â  Further, the documents provided to Petitioner no information Petitioner had not already received from the State, i.e., transcripts of witnessesâ€™ testimony and documentary evidence presented to the state grand jury.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Must the State provide documents pertaining to the impanelment of a state grand jury upon a criminal defendantâ€™s timely request?\r\nII. Â Does the record contain any evidence of probative value supporting the judgeâ€™s ruling that Petitionerâ€™s counsel was not ineffective in failing to request and review the impanelment documents before Petitionerâ€™s trial?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Availability of impanelment documents \r\nPetitioner asserts, first, he has a right to obtain and review the Stateâ€™s petition, supporting materials, and the judgeâ€™s order impaneling the state grand jury which indicted him; second, trial counsel should have obtained the documents in order to determine whether the state grand jury which indicted Petitioner had been properly impaneled pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1630 (Supp. 2003); and, third, the circuit court would lack subject matter jurisdiction in his case if the state grand jury was not properly impaneled.\r\nPetitioner argues the Due Process Clause,[1] the Sixth Amendment,[2] the state constitutional mandate that all courts shall be public,[3] and public policy as expressed in the state Freedom of Information Act[4] all support his argument.Â  Petitioner asserts the Court of Appeals recognized the legitimacy of his position in State v. Adams, 319 S.C. 509, 462 S.E.2d 308 (Ct. App. 1995) (concluding impanelment petition and order, reviewed only by Court of Appeals and not the parties, complied with State Grand Jury Act).Â  Petitioner further argues Section 14-7-1770 is not a complete prohibition on the production of impanelment documents, but requires such documents remain secret only to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters under consideration by the state grand jury.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s arguments relating to the Sixth Amendment, public courts, and Freedom of Information Act are not preserved for review.Â  See Plyler v. State, 309 S.C. 408, 424 S.E.2d 477 (1992) (issue or argument which is neither raised at PCR hearing nor ruled upon by the PCR court is procedurally barred from appellate review); Hyman v. State, 278 S.C. 501, 299 S.E.2d 330 (1983) (same).\r\nHowever, we conclude impanelment documents, including the Stateâ€™s petition, supporting materials, and the impaneling judgeâ€™s order, may be released to a defendant prior to trial upon timely request or to an applicant in a PCR proceeding.Â  The State may, of course, redact information not related to a particular defendantâ€™s case or information concerning other persons or matters under consideration by the state grand jury.Â  Release of the documents may be appropriate because (A) Section 14-7-1770 is not a complete prohibition on the release of the information; (B) release of the documents usually is not prohibited by secrecy provisions or other concerns following the issuance of a true bill of indictment; and (C) a defendant has the right to review the documents to determine whether to timely challenge the legality of the state grand jury which indicted him.\r\nA.Â  Impact of Section 14-7-1770\r\nSection 14-7-1770 provides that â€œ[r]ecords, orders, and subpoenas relating to state grand jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and for that time as is necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a state grand juryâ€ (emphasis added).Â  The clerk of the state grand jury relied in part on this provision in refusing to produce the impanelment documents in the present case.\r\nThe terms of the statute do not impose a complete prohibition on the release of impanelment documents or other records, such that they must remain secret forever.Â  The emphasized language indicates that, at some point in cases in which the grand jury returns a true bill of indictment, matters other than the grand juryâ€™s deliberations and voting may be disclosed to a defendant.Â  Removing the veil of secrecy after a defendant has been indicted is consistent with the legislative intent expressed in Section 14-7-1770 and the Act as a whole. Â E.g., Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998) (â€œ[a]ll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statuteâ€).\r\nB.Â  Secrecy provisions and concerns\r\nState grand jury proceedings are secret and those involved in such proceedings are prohibited from disclosing the nature or substance of the deliberations or vote of the state grand jury, or the testimony of a witness, unless otherwise ordered by a court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720 (Supp. 2003).[5]Â  The attorney general and other specified persons involved in grand jury proceedings may not disclose the testimony of a witness except when directed by the court in limited circumstances, including â€œcomplying with constitutional, statutory, or other legal requirements or to further justice.â€Â  Section 14-7-1720(A)(5).\r\nThe stringent secrecy provisions contained in the Act mirror the view long held uniformly by courts nationwide that secrecy of grand jury proceedings is desirable and necessary.Â  As the United States Supreme Court has explained in a case involving the federal grand jury system,\r\n\r\nWe consistently have recognized that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.Â  In particular, we have noted several distinct interests served by safeguarding the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings.Â  First, if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony.Â  Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements.Â  There also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment.Â  Finally, by preserving the secrecy of the proceedings, we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U.S. 418, 424, 103 S.Ct. 3133, 3138, 77 L.Ed.2d 743, 752 (1983).Â  See also State v. Whitted, 279 S.C. 260, 305 S.E.2d 245 (1983) (â€œ[i]nvestigations and deliberations of a grand jury are conducted in secret and are, as a rule, legally sealed against divulgenceâ€), overruled on other grounds by State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998); State v. Williams, 263 S.C. 290, 295-296, 210 S.E.2d 298, 301 (1974) (rejecting challenges under Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth amendments to competency and adequacy of evidence presented to grand jury, in part due to the â€œlong-established secrecy of grand jury actions and the nature and of its operations and functionsâ€); State v. Sanders, 251 S.C. 431, 437, 163 S.E.2d 220, 224 (1968) (rejecting argument that defendant should have right to have judge poll the grand jury to ensure at least twelve of them voted to indict him because such a procedure would violate â€œthe cloak of secrecy which has always been thrown around the deliberations of that bodyâ€); Margolis v. Telech, 239 S.C. 232, 241, 122 S.E.2d 417, 421 (1961) (emphasizing secret nature of grand jury matters in rejecting effort of defendant in civil case to present evidence of events and testimony that allegedly occurred in presence of grand jury, which chose not to indict relative who later sued defendant for malicious prosecution); State v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 225, 155 S.E. 385, 390 (1930) (â€œ[a]s long as the grand jury has been known to our judicial system, and that body came with the organization of our first courts, their acts and proceedings have been regarded as almost sacredly secretâ€; inquiry or divulgence of grand jury proceedings uniformly is prohibited, absent legislation allowing the same).\r\nThe secrecy provisions applicable to a particular case are relaxed after an indictment has been issued by the state grand jury.Â  All proceedings and testimony before the state grand jury are recorded by a court reporter, except the grand juryâ€™s deliberations and voting.Â  A defendant is entitled to review and reproduce recorded materials of those proceedings, subject to the limitations contained in Sections 14-7-1720, 14-7-1770, and Rule 5, SCCrimP.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-7-1700 (Supp. 2003).Â  A defendantâ€™s right to obtain such information in preparing his defense necessarily arises post-indictment.Â  Cf. Rector, 158 S.C. at 238, 155 S.E. at 394 (person does not have right to challenge qualification of grand juror until he is indicted).\r\nSimilarly, the Stateâ€™s petition, supporting materials, and the impaneling order may be made available to a defendant when a defendantâ€™s right to obtain recorded materials of the proceedings arises.Â  Although maintaining secrecy is essential while a matter is under deliberation by the grand jury, such concerns diminish following issuance of a true bill of indictment.Â  A defendant is allowed to obtain and use the impanelment documents in preparing a defense and ensuring protection of his due process rights.\r\nC.Â  Use of impanelment documents to challenge legality of grand jury\r\nInitially, we note we address this third rationale for our decision today in light of our recent decision in State v. Gentry, Op. No. 25949 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 7, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 11 at 37).Â  In Gentry, we abandoned the view that, in criminal matters, the circuit court acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear a particular case by way of a valid indictment by either a county or state grand jury.Â  Under the former approach, except for certain minor offenses, the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction in a criminal case unless there was an indictment which sufficiently stated an offense, the defendant had waived presentment of the indictment to the grand jury, or the charge was a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  Under that former approach, a defective or insufficient indictment could result in a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which is a matter that may be raised at any time, including on direct appeal, in a PCR action, or sua sponte by the trial or appellate courts.\r\nIn Gentry, taking our cue from the United States Supreme Court and in keeping with our view of subject matter jurisdiction in civil cases, we explained that the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court and the sufficiency of an indictment are two distinct concepts.Â  â€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Gentry at 42; see also Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000) (stating same principle); Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (stating same principle); S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (â€œThe Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.â€).\r\nIn Gentry, then, we returned to our earlier view that an indictment is a â€œnotice document,â€ albeit one required by our state constitution and statutes.Â  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11 and art. V, Â§ 22;[6] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003) (â€œ[n]o person shall be held to answer in any court for an alleged crime or offense, unless upon indictment by a grand juryâ€ except in specified instances).Â  The primary purposes of an indictment are to put the defendant on notice of what he is called upon to answer, i.e., to apprise him of the elements of the offense and to allow him to decide whether to plead guilty or stand trial, and to enable the circuit court to know what judgment to pronounce if the defendant is convicted.Â  Gentry at 44-45; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  This required notice is a component of the due process that is accorded every criminal defendant.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  Given that the sufficiency of an indictment will no longer be considered an issue of subject matter jurisdiction which may be raised at any time, we applied the general rule regarding preservation of error and held that a defendant must raise an issue regarding the sufficiency of the indictment before the jury is sworn in order to preserve the error for direct appellate review.Â  Gentry at 43 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003)).\r\nIn the present case, we are concerned not with the sufficiency of a particular indictment, but with the legality and sufficiency of the process of the state grand jury which issued the indictment.Â  However, we analyze this case in light of Gentry and with due regard for our renewed focus on the indictment as a notice document instead of a document which confers subject matter jurisdiction on the court.Â  As we stated in Gentry,\r\n\r\n[w]hen that indictment is presented, that accusation made, that pleading filed, the accused has two courses of procedure open to him.Â  He may question the propriety of the accusation, the manner in which it has been presented, the source from which it proceeds, and have these matters promptly and properly determined; or waiving them, he may put in issue the truth of the accusation, and demand the judgment of his peers on the merits of the charge.\r\n\r\nGentry at 44 (quoting State v. Faile, 43 S.C. 52, 59-60, 20 S.E. 798, 801 (1895), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)).\r\nA defendant has a constitutional right to demand that a grand jury which is properly established and constituted under the law consider the criminal allegations against him.Â  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11 and art. V, Â§ 22.Â  â€œ[O]ne who demands and is refused the right to be tried for crime charged against him only upon an indictment presented by a legal grand jury, in instances where such indictment is required, may thereafter justly take the position that he has been deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of lawâ€ in violation of the state constitution.Â  Rector, 158 S.C. at 230, 155 S.E. at 392 (internal quotes omitted).\r\nHowever, in keeping with our approach in Gentry, we conclude such a challenge does not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court.Â  A defendant must challenge the legality and sufficiency of the process of the state grand jury before the jury renders a verdict in order to preserve the error for direct appellate review.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1140 (Supp. 2003) (in statute which has been found to apply to petit and grand juries, â€œno irregularity . . . in the drawing, summoning, returning, or impaneling of jurors is sufficient to set aside verdict, unless the party making the objection was injured by the irregularity or unless the objection is made before the returning of the verdictâ€).[7]Â  When a defendant timely moves to quash an indictment on grounds such as those further explained below, the circuit court must determine whether the defendantâ€™s constitutional right to have the criminal allegations against him weighed by aÂ  properly constituted grand jury has been violated.\r\nIn the first category of cases, an indictment or â€œnotice documentâ€ issued by a grand jury which is established or constituted illegally is deemed a nullity.Â  An indictment which is a nullity would be insufficient, as a matter of law, to give the required notice to a defendant.Â  In such cases, a defendantâ€™s challenge â€œdoes not assert a disqualification which affects only a member of a body otherwise lawful, nor a mere irregularity in doing [that] which the law requires, which assumes a power to act; but it goes to the existence of the grand jury as a body, that it is void as such, and that its indictment is therefore a nullity.â€Â  State v. Edwards, 68 S.C. 318, 322, 47 S.E. 395, 396 (1904) (where legislative act under which grand jury was created and impaneled was later declared unconstitutional, grand jury was an illegal body and thus murder indictment issued was a nullity and incurable).Â  See also State v. Sanders, 251 S.C. 431, 438, 163 S.E.2d 220, 224 (1968) (indicating that exclusion of women from grand jury service could cause indictment to be a nullity based on challenge that goes to existence of grand jury as a whole, but in this case the male-only grand jury which indicted defendant was proper under then-existing law, as women were not allowed to serve on juries until state constitutional amendment in 1967 and grand jury system could not undergo fundamental change overnight); State v. Rafe, 56 S.C. 379, 34 S.E. 660 (1900) (stating that if record revealed every grand juror was disqualified or if only twelve grand jurors participated and one of them was disqualified, then the grand jury would be illegal and any indictment issued would be a nullity).[8]Â  \r\nSimilarly, an indictment issued by a grand jury in which the jurors were selected in an illegal or discriminatory manner likely would be deemed a nullity and, as a matter of law, would be insufficient to give the required notice to a defendant.Â  See e.g. Campbell v. Louisiana, 523 U.S. 392, 398, 118 S.Ct. 1419, 1423, 140 L.Ed.2d 551, 559 (1998) (finding white defendant had standing to raise equal protection challenge to discrimination against black persons in selection of grand jury; â€œdiscrimination on the basis of race in the selection of members of a grand jury . . . strikes at the fundamental values of our judicial system because the grand jury is a central component of the criminal justice processâ€); Vasquez v. Hillary, 474 U.S. 254, 263-264, 106 S.Ct. 617, 623, 88 L.Ed.2d 598, 609 (1986) (holding racial discrimination in selection of grand jury is fundamental flaw undermining structural integrity of criminal tribunal itself and, therefore, is not subject to harmless error review); Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 656-57, 594 S.E.2d 462, 468 (2004) (affirming denial of defendantâ€™s timely motion to quash indictment based on claim that racial discrimination infected grand jury selection process because statistical data did not support the claim).Â  \r\nIn a second category of cases, a defendant may assert a lesser irregularity in the selection or makeup of a grand jury which indicted him, such as proving the disqualification of an individual grand juror.Â  See Lollis v. Manning, 242 S.C. 316, 130 S.E.2d 847 (1963) (explaining the difference between a challenge to existence of grand jury as a legally constituted body and a challenge raising an irregularity relating to qualification of a grand juror); State v. Jackson, 240 S.C. 238, 125 S.E.2d 474 (1962) (where defendant timely moved to quash indictment before jury verdict, Court affirmed dismissal of a murder indictment issued by grand jury whose members had been drawn from a pool not constituted as then required by statute); State v. Hann, 196 S.C. 211, 218-230, 12 S.E.2d 720, 723-728 (1940) (reaffirming principles set forth in State v. Bibbs, 192 S.C. 231, 6 S.E.2d 276 (1939), and State v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 220-243, 155 S.E. 385, 388-396 (1930), but finding defendant was fully aware of potential challenge to qualification of grand jurors and expressly waived his right to require State to re-present indictment to grand jury containing only members whose voter registration certificates had been properly signed and delivered by registration board).[9]\r\nIn the first and second categories of cases, the circuit court must strike down the indictment when a defendant, in a timely motion to quash an indictment made before the jury renders its verdict, demonstrates the grand jury which indicted him is a nullity or proves the disqualification of an individual juror.Â  Otherwise, the defendantâ€™s constitutional right to demand that his case be considered by a grand jury which is properly established and constituted under the law would have no force or effect.\r\nIn a third category of cases, a defendant may assert a truly minor irregularity in the functioning or processes of the grand jury.Â  Such a challenge does not implicate the legality of the grand jury or constitute a lesser irregularity which rises to the level of a constitutional violation.Â  See State v. Orrs, 189 S.C. 1, 199 S.E. 865 (1938) (rejecting challenge to grand jury based on fact that some paper ballots had blue lines and others had red lines as result of cutting same sort of white paper, where statute required ballots to be on same type of paper); State v. Jeffcoat, 26 S.C. 114, 1 S.E. 440 (1887) (statute which changed the time of holding court did not make illegal a grand jury which had been drawn under previous statute).Â  The circuit court ordinarily should not quash an indictment when a defendant, in a timely motion made before the jury renders its verdict, asserts a truly minor irregularity in the grand jury process.\r\nIn sum, a defendant is entitled to review impanelment documents in order to determine, by a timely motion to quash an indictment made before the jury renders its verdict, whether the state grand jury which indicted him was legally established or suffered from any lesser irregularity which implicates the defendantâ€™s constitutional right to have his case considered by a grand jury which is properly constituted under the law.Â  \r\nAccordingly, impanelment documents ordinarily may be released to a defendant after the state grand jury has issued a true bill of indictment against that defendant.Â  A defendantâ€™s request should be made prior to trial pursuant to Rule 5, SCCrimP.Â  If the State should object to releasing all or part of the impanelment documents, a defendant may move to compel discovery of the documents.Â  See Rule 5(d), SCCrimP.Â  The burden of proof is on the State to demonstrate why the documents should not be released because only the State possesses the necessary information to analyze the issue and explain to the court why releasing the documents should be prohibited or delayed.Â  See Rector, 158 S.C. at 228, 155 S.E. at 391 (explaining that requiring a defendant to show he was prejudiced by the presence of a disqualified grand juror, where defendant had no right to inquire into vote of grand jury, â€œis to demand an impossibilityâ€).Â  The circuit court may, if necessary, conduct an in camera review of the impaneling documents to determine whether the State has met its burden in either prohibiting or delaying their release.\r\nThe regularity of grand jury proceedings is presumed absent clear evidence to the contrary.Â  State v. Griffin, 277 S.C. 193, 285 S.E.2d 631 (1981); State v. Thompson, 305 S.C. 496, 409 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Thus, after a defendant obtains the requested information, the burden is on the defendant to prove facts upon which a challenge to the legality of the grand jury or its proceedings is predicated.Â  E.g. State v. Jackson, 240 S.C. 238, 243, 125 S.E.2d 474, 477 (1962).Â  Further, the appellate court will reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision on the issue only if that court has abused its discretion. \r\nII.Â  Ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in the case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the applicant must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.Â  Strickland, supra; Rhodes v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002).Â  Thus, an applicant must show both error and prejudice to obtain relief in a PCR proceeding.Â  Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999).Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.Â  Johnson v. State, 325. S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997). \r\nThe burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985).Â  An appellate court may affirm the PCR courtâ€™s decision when its findings are supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry, supra.Â  However, an appellate court will not affirm the decision when it is not supported by any probative evidence.Â  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nAs previously explained, the PCR judge denied relief to Petitioner after conducting an in camera review of the Stateâ€™s petition, supporting materials, and the impaneling judgeâ€™s order.Â  After our own review of those same impanelment documents, we conclude the petitions and impaneling orders dated November 1991 and June 1992 comply with the statutory mandates.Â  See Adams, supra. \r\nThe supporting materials submitted with the Stateâ€™s petition contain a synopsis of the investigation.Â  The materials include a review of information gathered, the scope and geographic extent of the alleged crimes, law enforcement agencies involved, and a list of potential suspects.Â  The PCR judge correctly reasoned that most of this information was contained in the documents and transcripts of proceedings Petitioner obtained as a result of his discovery requests during the PCR proceeding.\r\nThe only information Petitioner may not have obtained was the list of potential suspects, to which he is not entitled.Â  The State is free to redact information unrelated to a defendantâ€™s case or information about other persons or matters under consideration by the state grand jury - including a list of potential suspects - prior to releasing impanelment documents and supporting materials to a defendant.\r\nWe conclude Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request and review the impaneling documents and supporting materials.Â  See Gilmore v. State, 314 S.C. 453, 445 S.E.2d 454 (1994) (attorney is not required to be clairvoyant or anticipate changes in the law which were not in existence at time of trial), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999).Â  Furthermore, Petitioner has not demonstrated prejudice under the facts of this case.Â  The PCR judgeâ€™s denial of relief to Petitioner is supported by evidence of probative value in the record; therefore, we affirm his decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision prohibiting the release of the impanelment documents to Petitioner.Â  We affirm the denial of Petitionerâ€™s PCR application because he failed to demonstrate error or prejudice resulting from his trial attorneyâ€™s actions.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3. \r\n[2]Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.\r\n[3]Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 9. \r\n[4]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-15 to -165 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2003). \r\n[5]Â  The secrecy provisions do not prohibit a client from discussing with his attorney the clientâ€™s testimony or other matters discussed in the clientâ€™s presence before a state grand jury.Â  Section 14-7-1720(C).\r\n[6]Â  Article I, Â§ 11 provides, in pertinent part:\r\nNo person may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over which is not within the magistrateâ€™s court, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury of the county where the crime has been committed. . . . The General Assembly may provide for the waiver of an indictment by the accused.Â  Nothing contained in this Constitution is deemed to limit or prohibit the establishment by the General Assembly of a state grand jury with the authority to return indictments irrespective of the county where the crime has been committed and that other authority, including procedure, as the General Assembly may provide.\r\nArticle V, Â§ 22 provides, in pertinent part:\r\nThe grand jury of each county, and the state grand jury, as the General Assembly may establish by general law, shall consist of eighteen members, twelve of whom must agree in a matter before it can be submitted to the Court. \r\n[7]Â  To the extent the following cases stand for the proposition that an indictment which is deemed to be a nullity because it was issued by an illegal grand jury implicates an issue of subject matter jurisdiction that may be raised at any time, we overrule them:Â  Lollis v. Manning, 242 S.C. 316, 130 S.E.2d 847 (1963); State v. Hann, 196 S.C. 211, 12 S.E.2d 720 (1940); State v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 155 S.E. 385 (1930); State v. Edwards, 68 S.C. 318, 47 S.E. 395 (1904); and State v. Rafe, 56 S.C. 379, 34 S.E. 660 (1900).\r\nAlthough this case involves the state grand jury, we similarly conclude that challenges to the legality and sufficiency of the process of a county grand jury also must be made before the jury renders a verdict in order to preserve the error for direct appellate review.\r\nWe recognize that in Gentry, relying on Section 17-19-90, we held the sufficiency of an indictment must be challenged before the jury is sworn.Â  In contrast, a challenge to the legality or sufficiency of the process of the grand jury must be made before the jury renders its verdict pursuant to Section 14-7-1140.Â  \r\n[8]Â  We note this Court later rejected language in Rafe and other cases that appeared to require a defendant to show prejudice when challenging the formation or legality of a grand jury.Â  This Court has recognized the important role of the grand jury in the criminal justice system, as well as the impossibility of demonstrating prejudice due to the secret nature of the grand juryâ€™s deliberations and voting.Â  Rector, 158 S.C. at 222-243, 155 S.E. at 389-396 (to require a defendant to show prejudice by proving an ineligible grand juror participated in the consideration of his case â€œis to demand an impossibility.Â  It is to tell him that he must establish something, even if it be true, that he is powerless to have disclosed.â€). \r\n[9]Â  Various statutes govern the qualifications and selection of grand jurors, including S.C. Code Â§ 14-7-130 (Supp. 2003) (setting forth basic qualifications to be included in list of persons eligible for jury service); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-810 to -870 (Supp. 2003); (disqualifications, exemptions, and excusals from jury service); and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1660 (Supp. 2003) (selection of state grand jurors).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25964","title":"Cockrell v.

Whetstone, Jr., of James C. Anders, P.A., of Columbia; J. Kendall Few, of J. Kendall Few, P.A., of Greer; and Stephen D. Baggett and Kenneth W. Poston, both of McDonald, Patrick, Tinsley, Baggett &amp; Poston, of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\n        C. Mitchell Brown, of Columbia, and Elizabeth M. McMillan, of Greenville, both of Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, L.L.P., for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: This is a products liability and negligence case in which the circuit court granted the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTSÂ  \r\nOn March 16, 2002, Ryan Cockrell, a thirteen-year old seventh grader, was pitching in a Greenwood High School junior varsity baseball game.Â  A line drive ball off the bat of an opposing player hit Ryan in the head causing severe injuries. The bat was an aluminum bat manufactured by defendant Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Company d/b/a Louisville Slugger (Hillerich). The respondents, the University of Massachusetts at Lowell Baseball Research Center (Research Center) and James Sherwood (Sherwood), a mechanical engineering professor and the Director of the Research Center, certified the bat as meeting certain National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) regulations.Â  \r\nThe appellant, Ryanâ€™s father, brought this action alleging products liability, negligence, breach of warranties, and fraudulent concealment against Hillerich; negligence and negligent misrepresentation against the National Federation of High Schools; and negligence against the South Carolina High School League. The appellant also alleges negligence, recklessness, and fraudulent concealment against the respondents.Â  The respondents filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  The circuit court granted the respondentsâ€™ motion and the appellant appeals.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in granting the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.Â  Background \r\nTypically, aluminum bats substantially outperform traditional wooden bats and other metal bats.Â  However, aluminum bats also increase the risk to pitchers and other infield players because the high speed of the balls batted off these bats decreases these playersâ€™ reaction time.Â  The NCAA developed a maximum-batted exit speed and certain weight and length requirements for aluminum bats and announced that the respondents would test and certify that all aluminum bat models meet these requirements.\r\nAfter the respondents have certified a bat model, aÂ  permanent certification mark must be clearly displayed on the barrel end of each bat. Further, the NCAA rules specifically state: â€œThe manufacturer may use the certification mark in descriptive materials (such as catalogs) to identify bats that comply with this testing standard, but may make no other use of the mark. Use of the certification mark to advertise or promote the sale or distribution of bats is expressly prohibited.â€Â  We note the certification of a bat means simply it has passed the standards which the NCAA has set forth.Â  It does not mean the bat has been otherwise tested for safety.\r\nÂ Apparently, some aluminum bats manufactured by Hillerich pass the NCAA certification tests in the lab but not in the field because in practice the bats swing faster.Â Â  The respondent Sherwood recognized this as evidenced by his February 7, 2000 memo to the NCAA and his presentation to the annual meeting of the New England Intercollegiate Baseball Association on February 20, 2000.Â  Sherwood sought reassurance that his certification of these bats would not render him liable and action from the NCAA to close the loopholes.Â  This information was widely disseminated throughout numerous media reports and the NCAA later changed its rules in an attempt to close any loopholes.Â  \r\nII. Personal Jurisdiction\r\nThe circuit court granted the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction finding that the respondents did not have sufficient minimum contacts with South Carolina and it would be unfair and unreasonable to exercise personal jurisdiction over them.Â  We agree. \r\nSherwood is a resident of Massachusetts and the Research Center is a corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts.Â  In the amended complaint, the appellant alleges South Carolina courts have personal jurisdiction over the respondents solely because the respondents â€œhave tested and certified baseball bats including the subject model, large numbers of which are sold, distributed and used in South Carolina.â€Â  \r\nThe question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is one which must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case. Engineered Prods. v. Cleveland Crane &amp; Eng'g, 262 S.C. 1, 201 S.E.2d 921 (1974). The decision of the trial court should be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence or influenced by an error of law. Id. at 4, 201 S.E.2d at 922.Â  At the pretrial stage, the burden of proving personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a prima facie showing of jurisdiction either in the complaint or in affidavits. Mid-State Distribs., Inc. v. Century Imps., Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 (1993).\r\nSpecific jurisdiction over a cause of action arising from a defendant's contacts with the state is granted pursuant to the long arm statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803 (2003).Â  South Carolinaâ€™s long-arm statute, which includes the powerÂ  to exercise personal jurisdiction over causes of action arising from tortious injuries in South Carolina, has been construed to extend to the outer limits of the due process clause. Meyer v. Paschal, 330 S.C. 175, 498 S.E.2d 635 (1998). Â Because South Carolina treats its long-arm statute as coextensive with the due process clause, the sole question becomes whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate due process.Â  Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc., 358 S.C. 320, 329, 594 S.E.2d 878, 883 (Ct. App. 2004)(citing Sonoco Prods. Co. v. Inteplast Corp., 867 F.Supp. 352, 354 (D.S.C.1994). \r\nDue Process/Sufficient Minimum Contacts\r\n\r\nDue process requires that there exist minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462 (1985). Further, due process mandates that the defendant possess sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state, so that he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1980); Atlantic Soft Drink Co. v. South Carolina Nat'l Bank, 287 S.C. 228, 336 S.E.2d 876 (1985).Â  Without minimum contacts, the court does not have the &quot;power&quot; to adjudicate the action. Southern Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 260, 423 S.E.2d 128, 131(1992).Â  The court must also find that the exercise of jurisdiction is &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;fair.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nUnder the fairness prong, the court must consider: (1) the duration of the activity of the nonresident within the state; (2) the character and circumstances of the commission of the nonresident's acts; (3) the inconvenience resulting to the parties by conferring or refusing to confer jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the State's interest in exercising jurisdiction. Clark v. Key, 304 S.C. 497, 405 S.E.2d 599 (1991). See alsoÂ  Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 260, 423 S.E.2d at 131. \r\nThe due process requirements must be met as to each defendant and thus the Court is to assess individually each defendant's contacts with South Carolina. See Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U.S. 320 (1980).Â  Further, the focus must center on the contacts generated by the defendant, and not on the unilateral actions of some other entity. . . .&quot; Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 417 (1984)(holding &quot;unilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate consideration&quot;).Â Â  The foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum state.Â  Rather, it is that the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.,Â  444 U.S. at 297.\r\nThe appellant alleges the following facts support finding the respondents purposefully availed themselves of the laws of South Carolina.Â  The Research Center was the exclusive testing and certification facility for all bats used in schools under the auspice of the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations and there are 20 NCAA schools and 194 high schools in South Carolina. Thus, the appellant concludes that the respondents have an effect on 6,000 students in South Carolina. Additionally, the appellant alleges that the sale of 14,000 bats in South Carolina annually generates sales of more than $2 million.Â  The appellant then contends that of the $1 million paid to the respondents,[1] $14,000 would be attributable to sales of bats in South Carolina. \r\nThe Court of Appeals recently held that an individual does not &quot;purposefully avail&quot; himself of the laws of this State merely by virtue of having authored a single literary work on a topic of national interest.Â  Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc., 358 S.C. 320, 594 S.E.2d 878 (Ct. App. 2004).[2]Â  In Moosally, the explosion of the battleship USS IOWA was the subject of two CBS 60 Minutes programs and subsequently a book was written by one of the programsâ€™ producers.Â  The plaintiffs brought a libel suit alleging the defendants incorrectly placed the blame for the explosion on them.Â  The defendants were the Virginia producer of the television program who subsequently wrote the book, a Maryland interviewee, and a New York publishing company.Â  Id.\r\nThe book had been distributed throughout the United States, including South Carolina.Â  The trial court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the Court of Appeals found that the court had personal jurisdiction over the book publisher because it conducted business in the state, selling books in approximately 315 bookstores in the state and probably selling at least one copy of each title in South Carolina, in addition to conducting other business activities that amounted to directing its activities at South Carolina residents.Â  Id. atÂ  335,Â  594 S.E.2d at 886.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals also found that personal jurisdiction did not exist for the interviewee, as &quot;merely providing information to an author about an event that did not occur in South Carolina&quot; was not sufficient to &quot;purposefully avail&quot; himself of South Carolina's laws or establish minimum contacts.Â Â  Id. at 333, 594 S.E.2d at 885.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that the court did not have personal jurisdiction over the author, because &quot;merely . . . having authored a single literary work on a topic of national interest&quot; was not enough to meet the power prong of the due process analysis.Â  Id. at 334, 594 S.E.2d at 885.Â  The plaintiffs had alleged that the following activities by the producer/author satisfied the minimum contacts requirement: (1) he was a producer on the television show 60 Minutes, which airs in South Carolina; (2) he attended a funeral in South Carolina in 1972 as a reporter for CBS; (3) copies of his book were sold in South Carolina; (4) a movie version of his book was aired in South Carolina on the FX network; and (5) he made at least one business call to South Carolina for information on the battleship IOWA.Â  Id. at 333, 594 S.E.2d at 885. The Court of Appeals held â€œ[t]he fruits of [the producer/authorâ€™s] labor -- be it in literary or in cinematic form -- arrived in South Carolina not through [his] efforts, but through the efforts of others, and therefore cannot serve as the basis for jurisdiction.â€ Id. at 334, 594 S.E.2d at 885.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that South Carolina does not have specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant who is the producer of a nationwide television program and the author of a book distributed nationwide who would directly profit from the sale of his books.Â  Likewise, we conclude that South Carolina also does not have personal jurisdiction over the respondents in this case.Â  The bats did not arrive in South Carolina through the respondentsâ€™ efforts.Â  As the NCAA regulations state, â€œ[u]se of the certification mark to advertise or promote the sale or distribution of bats is expressly prohibited.â€ Hillerich unilaterally distributed and sold them in South Carolina.Â  The respondents had no control over the distribution of the bats and did not profit from their sale.Â  The respondents merely certified the bats as having met the NCAA rules, which is clearly less activity than producing a nationwide television program or authoring a book.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court also found there was no basis for exercising general jurisdiction over the respondents.Â  We agree.Â  A court may assert general jurisdiction if the defendant has an &quot;enduring relationship&quot; with the forum state. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-802 (2003). General jurisdiction attaches even when the nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum state are not directly related to the cause of action, if the defendant's contacts are both &quot;continuous and systematic.&quot; Helicopteros Nacionales, 466 U.S. at 413-14 nn. 8-9.Â  These contacts must be &quot;so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against [the respondents] on causes of action arising from dealings entirely different from those activities.&quot;Â  International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 318 (1945).Â  Furthermore, the defendant's contacts with the forum must satisfy the due process clause.Â  Federal Ins. Co. v. Lake Shore Inc., 886 F.2d 654, 660 (4th Cir. 1989).Â  The respondents have not directed their activities at South Carolina and, as discussed above, their contacts with South Carolina cannot fairly be described as continuous and systematic so as to satisfy due process.Â  See Helicopteros Nacionales, 466 U.S. at 416.\r\nIn conclusion, we hold the respondents doÂ  not haveÂ  the minimum contacts with South Carolina necessary to comply with the due process requirements.Â  Accordingly, the trial court correctly granted the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]In computing this figure, the appellant included $600,000 which the respondents received from the National Baseball League (NBL), the NCAA, and the National Federation in the form of grants.Â  However, these grants were not only for testing bats - the NBL also commissioned the respondents to test baseballs which have nothing to do with this lawsuit.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2]We note that this case was decided after the circuit court ruled on the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25965","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Petitioner.\r\n        Assistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review State v. Parris, 353 S.C. 582, 578 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2003), in which the Court of Appeals held Respondent, Marion L. Parris, was entitled to a directed verdict on the charge of breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nParris was the owner of Parris Home Sales (PHS), which sold mobile homes in Gaffney.Â  The mobile homes he sold to third parties were financed by a $750,000 floor plan line of credit from First National Bank (FNB) of the Carolinas.Â  FNB held title to the mobile homes until such time as the person who purchased each mobile home obtained financing, and FNBâ€™s lien was paid off.Â  \r\nOn February 3, 1999, in order to finance the purchase of a double-wide mobile home, serial numbers THL2936AAL and THL2936 BAL, PHS executed a note to First National Bank for $37,405.Â  The note required PHS to pay monthly interest on the outstanding balance of the loan until February 5, 2000, at which time the full balance was due.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn November 1, 1999, Jerry and Sherry Martin signed a purchase agreement to buy the above mobile home (serial numbers THL2936AAL and THL2936 BAL) for $40,340.Â  The contract provided that title to the mobile home would remain in Seller until the purchase price was paid in full and that â€œthereupon, title to the within described unit passes to the buyer as of the date of . . . full cash payment . . . even though the actual physical delivery may not be made until a later date.â€Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n The Martins obtained financing for their mobile home from Bank of America, and the loan was closed on November 18, 1999.Â  Bank of America issued two checks totaling $40,340 which were jointly payable to Jerry Martin and Parris Home Sales.Â  Martin endorsed the checks and gave them to Parris.Â  Parris signed an endorsement on the back of the checks, as follows, â€œfor value received, by endorsement, the payee does warrant good title to and full right to convey a 1999 Legend Mobile Home.â€Â  After endorsing the checks, Parris took them and opened a checking account at American Federal Bank.Â  Thereafter, he wrote checks to himself and others, but not FNB, totaling nearly $40,000.Â  \r\nOn December 6, 1999, Sherry Martin was in her new mobile home (which had been delivered around Thanksgiving) when she saw the president of FNB, Steve Moss, walking around her property.Â  When he knocked on the door and asked her for the serial number, she told him it was none of his business, at which time he told her that it was his business as he owned the home and could repossess it.Â  The Martins went to the bank to speak to Moss, who told them to go to a lawyer and to police.Â  \r\nParris was subsequently arrested and charged with breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â  FNB accelerated the underlying note; PHSâ€™ assets were seized and sold by FNB.[1]Â  A jury convicted Parris of breach of trust with fraudulent intent; he was sentenced to ten years.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed his conviction, finding the State failed to prove the existence of a trust relationship.Â  Accordingly, it found Parris should have been granted a directed verdict.Â  State v. Parris, 353 S.C. 582, 578 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nWas there evidence of a trust relationship to support submission of the offense of breach of trust with fraudulent intent to the jury?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW/LAW\r\n\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  In reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, not with its weight.Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004).\r\nThe elements of breach of trust with fraudulent intent are not set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-230 (1985).Â  However, in State v. McCann, 167 S.C. 393, 400, 166 S.E. 411, 414 (1932), we recognized that breach of trust with fraudulent intent is peculiar to this jurisdiction, stating:\r\n\r\n  In other states, the crime, as known to us, is called by different names, such as â€œlarceny after trust,â€ â€œlarceny by a bailee,â€ â€œlarceny by false pretenses,â€ and very commonly as â€œembezzlement.â€Â Â  All the offenses are regarded as statutory, and one must look to the respective statutes to ascertain a definition of the crime.Â  In text-books, law encyclopedias, and digests, references to decisions concerning these offenses are usually found under the title or subject of â€œembezzlement.â€Â  The general purpose running through the statutes creating and defining these crimes is, however, the same;Â  to declare as a crime, and usually as one coming within the classification of larceny, acts which were formerly not deemed to be larceny at common law, because of the fact that possession of property had been obtained through the consent of the owner.\r\n\r\nSee also State v. Owings, 205 S.C. 314, 316, 31 S.E.2d 906, 907 (1944) (defined the offense as â€œlarceny after trust, which includes all of the elements of larceny or in common parlance, stealing, except the unlawful taking in the beginningâ€); State v. Scott, 330 S.C. 125, 130, 497 S.E.2d 735, 738 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œ[t]he primary difference between larceny and breach of trust is that in common-law larceny, possession of the property stolen is obtained unlawfully, while in breach of trust, the possession is obtained lawfullyâ€).Â  \r\nIn State v. Shirer, 20 S.C. 392, 408 (1884), the Court stated, â€œthe object of our [breach of trust] act was simply to enlarge the field of larceny, removing what before might have been a defense for those who received property in trust and afterwards fraudulently appropriated it.Â  The question under our act is, whether the party received the property in trust, which he afterwards violated . . . .â€Â  Therefore, the State must prove the existence of a trust relationship to sustain a charge of breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â  See State v. LeMaster, 231 S.C. 321, 98 S.E.2d 756 (1957).Â  Failure to prove the existence of a trust relationship will result in a directed verdict of acquittal for the defendant.Â  Id.\r\nA trust is an â€œarrangement whereby property is transferred with intention that it be administered by trustee for anotherâ€™s benefit.â€Â  State v. Jackson, 338 S.C. 565, 527 S.E.2d 367 (Ct. App. 2000), citing Black's Law Dictionary 1047 (6th Ed. 1991).Â  Thus, the transferor of the property must intend that the trustee will act for the transferorâ€™s benefit instead of on his own behalf.Â  Id.Â  See State v. McCann, 167 S.C. 393 166 S.E. 411 (1932).Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nEssentially, the Court of Appeals held that because there is no testimony in the record from the Martins themselves that they gave the money to Parris with the specific instruction that he pay off the FNB lien, there is no evidence that a trust relationship was formed, such that Parris was entitled to a directed verdict.Â  This was error.Â  We find sufficient evidence in the record from which the jury could have inferred a trust relationship.\r\n The Stateâ€™s first witness, FNBâ€™s chief lending officer Thomas Hale, testified as to the floor plan under which the mobile homes were financed.Â  He testified that FNB was owed $37,405 on the mobile home, and that before anyone could take clear title of that home, FNB would have to be paid that amount.Â  He testified that â€œnormally, the new owner would obtain financing or pay cash . . . and arrangements would be made with the seller, Mr. Parris, and the bank . . . to pay off the lien that existed on the mobile home.â€Â  Paula Griggs, who worked for PHS and was responsible for bringing the Martins in as customers, testified that she knew FNB had a lien on the mobile home, and that when she told Parris that he needed to pay off FNBâ€™s lien on the Martinâ€™s home, Parris told her he would take care of it.Â  She testified that in the normal course of PHSâ€™ business, the checks that came in would be deposited and then the payments would be made against the liens.Â Â  \r\nMarcia Jolly, a vice-president of Bank of America, testified that, at the closing, Martin endorsed the checks, and then she handed them to Parris.Â  Thereafter, Parris endorsed the checks, with the following language, â€œfor value received, by endorsement, the payee does warrant good title to and full right to convey a 1999 Legend Mobile Home.â€Â  Deborah Ellis, PHSâ€™ secretary/office manager, testified that she never received the Bank of America check to go to FNB and that she was told that Parris said â€œhe would take care of it.â€Â  James Parker, sales manager for PHS, testified that whenever a mobile home was sold, Marion Parris was responsible for making sure FNB was paid.Â  \r\nJerry Martin testified that when he gave Parris the $40,340 check, he expected his bank would get a clear title.Â  Sherry Martin testified that, as far as she knew, her mobile home had been paid for with the checks from Bank of America, and she did not learn otherwise until Mr. Moss (from FNB) came to the home and told her otherwise on December 6, 1999.Â  \r\nIn State v. Jackson, 338 S.C. 565, 570, 527 S.E.2d 367, 370 (Ct. App. 2000), the Court of Appeals stated: \r\n\r\n  [a] trust is an â€˜arrangement whereby property is transferred with intention that it be administered by trustee for another's benefit.â€™Â  Black's Law Dictionary 1047 (6th Ed.1991).Â  Thus, the transferor of the property must intend that the trustee will act for the transferor's benefit instead of on his own behalf.Â  \r\n\r\nClearly, the Martins here entrusted their checks to Parris with the intent they be used for their benefit, rather than for Parrisâ€™ own benefit.Â  Accordingly, we find the evidence presented, taken in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to present a jury issue as to the creation of a trust relationship.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision should be reversed, but I respectfully disagree with the majorityâ€™s rationale.Â  In my opinion, breach of a â€œtrust,â€ as that term is traditionally understood, is not essential to a conviction for breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â  Rather, the trust that must be breached for the crime to be complete is that confidence reposed by the victim in the recipient of the property.Â  \r\nBreach of trust with fraudulent intent â€œis nothing more or less than larceny. It might well be termed â€˜statutory larceny,â€™ as distinguished from larceny at common law. The main distinction between the two crimes is this: In common-law larceny, possession of the property stolen is obtained unlawfully, while in breach of trust, the possession is obtained lawfully.â€Â  State v. McCann, 167 S.C. 393, 397-98, 166 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1932) (emphasis in original).Â  â€œ[T]he object of [breach of trust with fraudulent intent] was simply to enlarge the field of larceny, removing what before might have been a defense for those who received property in trust and afterwards fraudulently appropriated it.â€Â  State v. Shirer, 20 S.C. 392, 408 (1884).Â  \r\nI disagree with the majorityâ€™s interpretation of the language from Shirer, â€œreceived in trust,â€ as meaning â€œreceived as a trustee.â€ [2]Â  In my opinion, the Shirer Court used the word â€œtrustâ€ in a lay sense, as in confidence in the integrity of another person.Â  The Court was merely explaining the dichotomy between lawful and unlawful acquisitions in the context of larceny.Â  A friend, an employee, or some other â€œtrustedâ€ person might receive property lawfully, but if he thereafter converts the property to his own use with animus furandi, then he is guilty of larceny through breach of trust with fraudulent intent.Â Â Â  \r\nIn this case, that Parris lawfully received the Martinsâ€™ money is undisputed.Â  The Martins trusted that Parris had title to the mobile home, and they tendered their money as consideration.Â  Because there is evidence that Parris converted the Martinsâ€™ money for his own use, thus breaching their confidence, Parris was not entitled to a directed verdict.\r\nIf the State were in fact required to prove the existence of a trust, however, then the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision should be affirmed.Â  There is no evidence that the Martins intended to be the settlors of a trust.Â  As the Court of Appeals noted, the Martins were not even aware that FNB financed and held title to Parrisâ€™s inventory.Â  Had Parris owned title to the mobile home, as the Martins believed, then he would have used their money - their consideration under the sales contract - for his own benefit.Â  He was not their trustee; there was no trust formed.Â  \r\nFor the reasons stated, I concur in the result reached by the majority and join in the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  FNB took the money owed from the sale of Parrisâ€™ property and ultimately gave the Martins title to the mobile home.Â  \r\n[2] Apparently, this interpretation was first made in State v. LeMaster, 231 S.C. 321, 98 S.E.2d 756 (1957).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25966","title":"City of North Charleston v.

Crowe, of Columbia, for amici curiae Municipal Association of South Carolina.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case is before us in our original jurisdiction.Â  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of a tax ordinance enacted by Charleston County (County) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-223A (Supp. 2004).Â  We find the statute unconstitutional and strike the ordinance as invalid.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nSection 12-37-233A allows a county to enact a property tax cap as follows:\r\n\r\n(A) As authorized by Section 3, Article X of the South Carolina Constitution, the General Assembly hereby authorizes the governing body of a county by ordinance to exempt an amount of fair market value of real property located in the county sufficient to limit to fifteen percent any valuation increase attributable to a countywide appraisal and equalization program conducted pursuant to Section 12-43-217.Â  An exemption allowed by this section does not apply to:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          (1)&nbsp;\r\n          real property valued for property tax purposes by the unit valuation method;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n          value attributable to property or improvements not previously taxed, such as new construction, and for renovation of existing structures;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          (3)&nbsp;\r\n           property transferred after the most recent countywide equalization program implemented pursuant to Section 12-43-217; provided, however, at the option of the governing body of a county which is in the process of first implementing a countywide equalization program under Section 12-43-217, property transferred on or after January first of the year of implementation of the most recent countywide equalization program.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn November 2000, County first adopted an ordinance allowing a tax cap only for owner-occupied property.Â  We found the ordinance inconsistent with Â§ 12-37-233A because the ordinance created an unauthorized exemption applicable only to owner-occupied property rather than all real property.Â  Riverwoods, LLC v. County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651 (2002).Â  \r\nIn July 2002, County adopted its current ordinance tracking the language of Â§ 12-37-223A as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 1.\r\nThere is hereby implemented in Charleston County the exemption provided in Section 12-37-223[A] of the Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976, as amended, by providing an exemption for real property in an amount of fair market value of real property located in Charleston County sufficient to limit to fifteen percent any valuation increase attributable to the implementation in Charleston County of a countywide appraisal and equalization program conducted pursuant to Section 12-43-217 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976, as amended.\r\nSection 2. \r\nThe exceptions from the exemption provided by this Ordinance shall be as provided in Section 12-37-223[A] of the Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976, as amended.\r\nIn February 2003, plaintiffs commenced this action challenging the new ordinance as unconstitutional.Â  We appointed Judge A. Victor Rawl as referee.Â  After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Rawl issued his report in favor of plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes Â§ 12-37-223A violate article X, Â§ 3, of our State Constitution because it is not a general law that is uniform statewide?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSection 12-37-223A states that the General Assembly is acting â€œas authorized by Section 3, Article X of the South Carolina Constitutionâ€ in enacting this exemption from property tax.Â  Article X, Â§ 3, lists specific exemptions from property tax such as government property, libraries, and churches, and further provides:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the exemptions listed in this section, the General Assembly may provide for exemptions from the property tax, by general laws applicable uniformly to property throughout the State and in all political subdivisions. . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nArticle X, Â§ 3, mandates statewide uniformity in property tax exemptions enacted by the General Assembly.Â  Where our Constitution requires statewide uniformity, a local option law is not valid.Â  Martin v. Condon, 324 S.C. 183, 478 S.E.2d 272 (1996).Â  Section 12-37-223A is patently invalid since it enacts an exemption that is not uniform throughout the State.Â  For this reason, we declare Â§ 12-37-223A unconstitutional and hold Countyâ€™s ordinance is therefore invalid.\r\n JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFFS.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25967","title":"In the Matter of Herbert Altonia Addison","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25967","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court disbarred an attorney.","date":"2005-04-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n25967\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Herbert Altonia Addison,\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25967\r\nSubmitted February 22, 2005 - Filed April 11, 2005\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nHerbert Altonia Addison, of Hopkins, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, including disbarment.Â  In addition, respondent agrees to pay restitution to clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of his misconduct.Â  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nComplainant A owned a mobile home located on a portion of her motherâ€™s property.Â  In 1999, Complainant A obtained a refinancing loan.Â  Respondent conducted the loan closing which was to include conveyance of 3/10 of an acre from Complainant Aâ€™s mother to Complainant A.Â  Respondent incorrectly described the land and conveyed all of Complainant Aâ€™s motherâ€™s land to Complainant A.Â  The error was discovered in November 2000 when Complainant Aâ€™s mother tried to obtain a home improvement loan.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges he failed to take adequate and timely steps to correct the error, including failing to cooperate with Complainant A, her attorney, and the mortgage company.Â  Before the error could be corrected, Complainant A filed for bankruptcy.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent was the closing attorney for the sale of Complainant Bâ€™s property to a buyer on April 6, 2001.Â  Before the closing, Complainant B or her representative received a HUD-1 statement which showed no excess deposit and that Complainant B would received $2,153.62 as net proceeds from the sale.Â  \r\nAt closing, however, respondent presented a different HUD-l statement which showed an excess deposit of $5,000.00 and that Complainant B was to pay $2,846.38.Â  Complainant B expressed objection to the HUD-1 statement.Â  Respondent left Complainant B and the mortgage broker alone.Â  Complainant B alleges the mortgage broker represented that the changes were simply to allow the closing to proceed and that Complainant B would still receive the sum stated on the original HUD-1.Â  Complainant B proceeded with the closing based on the mortgage brokerâ€™s representations but has not received $2,153.62.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges executing a revised HUD-1 statement that contained false and/or misleading information, failing to adequately communicate with Complainant B, failing to record the deed after closing, failing to record the original mortgage, failing to secure a title policy, and failing to provide closing documents to the purchaser.Â  Respondent further acknowledges using the name, address, and trust account of another attorney to conduct the closing although respondent was not an associate, employee, or partner of the other attorney and the other attorney was not involved in the closing.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn August 1999, respondent represented Complainant C in the purchase of a home.Â  Complainant C was told the only encumbrance on the home was a $32,830.97 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) lien against one of the sellers and that the IRS would settle the lien for $2,600.00.Â  Respondent was to pay $2,600.00 to the IRS from the proceeds of the loan closing.Â  At some point, respondent forwarded a money order for $2,600.00 to the IRS, but did not request a release.Â  The IRS did not process the money order or issue a release, apparently because it was unclear to which matter the money order pertained and the IRS did not know who to contact regarding the matter.Â  \r\nIn January 2001, Complainant C refinanced her home with another attorney.Â  The title search performed by Complainant Câ€™s refinancing attorney reported four encumbrances of record.Â  One was the IRS lien respondent was to have paid from the proceeds of the August 1999 closing.Â  The other three encumbrances were tax liens of the prior owner which had not been discovered by respondent in 1999 or by another law firm during an April 2000 refinancing.Â  After much inquiry by Complainant Câ€™s refinancing attorney, the money order was identified and the lien matter was resolved.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent was a title insurance agent for Atlantic Title Insurance Company (Atlantic) from May 27, 1998 until December 24, 1999 when respondentâ€™s agency was terminated due to an unsatisfactory audit.Â  The audit, which involved a review of approximately 350 files, revealed that respondent had collected premiums and issued commitments on a number of files, but failed to issue policies or remit premiums to Atlantic in the amount of $8,653.13.\r\nRespondent delivered a check dated February 28, 2002, to Atlantic in the amount of $8,000.00.Â  The check could not be negotiated due to insufficient funds in the account.Â  Atlantic is still owed $8,653.13.\r\nDuring investigation of this and other matters, Disciplinary Counsel issued subpoenas for respondentâ€™s financial records.Â  Respondent did not fully respond to the subpoenas.Â  Based on Disciplinary Counselâ€™s review of the limited financial records respondent did supply, it was determined that from 1999 to 2000, one of respondentâ€™s trust accounts had twenty-seven insufficient and/or NSF checks and another trust account had twenty-two insufficient and/or NSF checks and negative balances on three occasions.\r\nMatter V\r\nOn May 2, 2002, a non-lawyer assistant in respondentâ€™s office sent a letter bearing her signature to Complainant D, a contractor.Â  The letter demanded that certain repairs be made on respondentâ€™s clientâ€™s home before the warranty expired and threatened legal action if the repairs were not made.Â  On May 3, 2002, Complainant D faxed a response to respondentâ€™s office stating that a detailed inspection of the home would be conducted by the vice-president of the company before the end of the week.Â  \r\nOn May 9, the non-lawyer assistant sent a second letter to Complainant D.Â  In this letter, the assistant thanked Complainant D for the inspection, but again demanded repairs.Â  On May 14, Complainant D responded with a letter to respondentâ€™s office indicating all repairs were completed on May 13, 2002.Â  \r\nBy separate letter, Complainant D raised the appearance of the unauthorized practice of law by non-lawyer employees to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â  Respondent did not respond to Disciplinary Counselâ€™s request for information.Â Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nIn June 2001, respondent conducted a real estate closing for a client.Â  The client was buying a house for herself and her daughter.Â  At closing, respondent listed his former law partner as the settlement agent on closing documents.Â  Respondentâ€™s former partner was not the settlement agent and respondent did not have permission to use his name.Â Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s client passed away in January 2002.Â  In the process of probating her estate, the personal representative, Complainant E, discovered that respondent failed to record the deed or provide his client with the original deed, causing the sellers to remain owners of record.Â  Respondent also retained $389.04 at closing to pay county taxes but did not remit those funds to the county.Â  Complainant E made several attempts to contact respondent, but he did not respond.Â  The deed was recorded on April 9, 2002, but Complainant E has not received the deed and the taxes remain unpaid.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nOn or about October 13, 1999, respondent conducted a real estate loan closing for Complainant F and withheld $18,791.00 to pay the IRS on behalf of the client.Â  Between October 18, 1999 and June 13, 2001, respondent failed to pay the IRS on behalf of Complainant F.Â  On June 13, 2001, respondentâ€™s trust account had a negative balance.Â  Complainant F is still owed $18,791.00.\r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Complainant G in connection with claims against law enforcement agencies who had arrested and detained Complainant G in 1994 on charges of rape and related charges on which Complainant G was ultimately exonerated.Â  Respondent failed to diligently and competently represent Complainant G, failed to communicate with Complainant G, and failed to take steps to protect Complainant Gâ€™s interests upon termination of representation.Â  \r\nMatter IX\r\nOn or about April 7, 2000, respondent conducted a residential real estate closing for Clients H and I.Â  The property included two lots of land, and any improvements thereon, known as Lots 11 and 12, Block B, on a subdivision of Tracts 1 and 2, Block B, in Haskell Heights, Richland County, South Carolina, more particularly shown on a plat recorded in Richland County Plat Book 362 at page 2427.Â  At the time of the closing, a dwelling was situated on Lot 11 and Lot 12 was vacant.Â  The loan closing instructions provided by the lender and the title commitment for the mortgage required the mortgage to be secured by both lots and any improvements thereon.Â  The property description drafted by respondent for the mortgage and, subsequently, the mortgage respondent recorded, did not include Lot 11 and the dwelling situated on it.Â  Respondentâ€™s failure to comply with the closing instructions to include Lot 11 and its improvements in the mortgage was inconsistent with the clientsâ€™ and lenderâ€™s instructions and left the lender undersecured.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer\r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact to a third person);\r\nRule 5.3(a) (a partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that a non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).\r\nRespondent further admits his misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it is a ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  In addition, he admits his misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Respondent is required to pay restitution to presently known and/or subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Moreover, respondent is required to reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection for any claims paid as a result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Respondent shall not apply for readmission until all restitution has been paid.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\n DISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct =

\r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B.

Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.6 (lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of his client); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(c) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate the oath of office).Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for eighteen months.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.[1]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] The parties agreed to the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests if the Court suspended respondent for more than sixty (60) days.Â  By separate order, the Court will appoint an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25969","title":"Pittman v.

Pittman (Pittman) brought an action against Grand Strand Entertainment, Inc., d/b/a Legends In Concert of Myrtle Beach, Respondent John Stuart (Stuart), and Legends In Concert, Inc., seeking injunctive relief and damages for misappropriation of corporate opportunity and breach of contract.Â  The parties resolved all claims involving the corporations in arbitration.Â  Following arbitration, however, Pittman pursued claims against Stuart as an individual.Â  Eventually, both Pittman and Stuart moved for summary judgment, and the court granted summary judgment in favor of Stuart.Â  Pittman appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFactual / Procedural background\r\nIn 1994, Pittman and Stuart began making plans to open a live musical show, named â€œLegends in Concert,â€ in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  Stuart, president and sole shareholder of Legends In Concert, Inc. (Legends), a Nevada corporation, created and produced the show.Â  Pittman, a stockbroker and entrepreneur who had an interest in the entertainment business, offered to raise the capital needed to open the show in Myrtle Beach.[1]  \r\nTo raise the capital, Pittman formed a corporation named Grand Strand Entertainment, Inc. (Grand Strand).Â  Through a public offering of stock, the corporation would raise money to open and run the show.[2]Â  The corporation was formed in January 1995, with Pittman as its sole incorporator.Â  \r\nOn March 26, 1995, Grand Strand and Legends entered into a licensing agreement.[3]Â  The purpose of the agreement was to give Grand Strand licensing and intellectual property rights to produce the Myrtle Beach show, in exchange for raising capital to fund the showâ€™s opening and operation.Â  More specifically, the agreement provided that Grand Strand would â€œraise between $500,000 and $1,000,000 dollars to develop, stage, open, and operate the show . . . for a minimum of a one year run.â€ \r\nThe parties signed the agreement even though it contained deadlines that were to be met before the date the agreement was signed.Â  The agreement included, in part, the following terms:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        a)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;[Legends] shall commence operation in Myrtle Beach by planning, staging rehearsing and opening [the show] through supplying its own lighting, equipment and technical support, personnel, acts, talent and through accepting preliminary cash receipts from Grand Strand in the amount of $200,000 on or before March 30th, by payment of $100,000.00 on or before March 10th and the balance by March 30th.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Grand Strand will promptly register its SCOR offering and raise sufficient funds to complete capitalization of [the show] which shall include all pre-production opening costs and ongoing operating expenses, and in any event, shall not be less than $300,000.00 but is likely to be $1,000,000.00. . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        c)&nbsp;\r\n         Grand Strand will register the SCOR offering to finance the Myrtle Beach operation on or before June 1, 1995, in order to fully capitalize [the show] by not later than August 31st, 1995.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        d)&nbsp;\r\n         In the event that Grand Strand fails to perform or does not perform in a timely fashion, Legends shall have the right to continue to operate the Myrtle Beach production as a production of [Legends] . . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphases added).Â  The agreement also gave Legends the right to terminate the agreement if Grand Strand materially breached any of the terms.Â  \r\nJust two days after the agreement was signed, the show opened.Â  At this time, Grand Strand had yet to pay Legends any money as outlined in the agreement.Â  Therefore, Legends, not Grand Strand, funded all pre-production costs and was solely responsible for financing the showâ€™s opening.Â  But according to Pittman, Stuart told him not to worry about the dates in the licensing agreement; Stuart just wanted Pittman to facilitate the SCOR in order to raise capital.Â  In response to a conversation they apparently had about the missed deadlines, Pittman sent Stuart a fax, dated March 28, 1995, which provided as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nSince you have asked me not to concentrate on the $200,000 since we got the show open without it and the license was so long in the making, I will now go ahead and concentrate on the SCOR offering ASAP per you [sic] request. . . . As you said Sunday about the license agreement when I wanted to make sure the $200,000 was not an issue . . ., this is all a matter of trust and I really do trust you and hope that the same always applies to me.\r\n\r\nThe SCOR offering never occurred.Â  Grand Strand did, however, issue Stuart 120,000 shares of stock.Â  On April 17, 1995, a week after the stock was issued, Stuart sent a letter to the bank where Grand Strand maintained its accounts, authorizing the bank to honor drafts made by certain Legends personnel in Nevada.Â  Stuart signed the letters as Chief Executive Officer of Grand Strand, even though he was never officially elected or named as a director or the CEO. \r\nFinally, on April 26, 1995, Stuart sent Pittman a letter declaring Grand Strand in breach of the licensing agreement.Â  Accordingly, Stuart terminated the agreement with Grand Strand.Â  The letter also explained that Legends would continue operating the Myrtle Beach show, without the assistance of Grand Strand or Pittman. \r\nIn response, Pittman brought a derivative action on behalf of himself and all other shareholders of Grand Strand, seeking injunctive relief and damages for misappropriation of corporate opportunity and breach of contract.Â  The circuit court stayed the action pending the submission of claims against Grand Strand and Legends to arbitration, as required under the licensing agreement.Â  The court also ruled that Pittmanâ€™s claims against Stuart, in his individual capacity, were not included in the arbitration agreement and thus could be pursued in an independent legal action following arbitration.Â Â  \r\nThe arbitrator awarded judgment in favor of Legends on the claim for injunctive relief and dismissed all other claims.Â  In addition, the arbitrator awarded Pittman $15,400 for services rendered and costs advanced.Â  Finally, the arbitrator provided that â€œ[t]his Award is in full settlement of all claims (and counterclaims) submitted by either party against the other in this arbitration.â€ \r\nFollowing arbitration, the circuit court lifted the stay, allowing Pittman to pursue his remaining claims against Stuart in his individual capacity.Â  Stuart subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment based on res judicata and collateral estoppel, claiming that the parties agreed that all claims, including Pittmanâ€™s claims against Stuart, were to be resolved in arbitration.Â  The court denied Stuartâ€™s motion, finding that the parties never made such an agreement. \r\nIn the action against Stuart, Pittman alleged that Stuart misappropriated Grand Strandâ€™s corporate opportunity in breach of Stuartâ€™s fiduciary duty to the corporation.Â  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The master-in-equity granted summary judgment in favor of Stuart, and, in doing so, made the following conclusions of law:Â  (1) Grand Strand breached the agreement by failing to raise the necessary funding to open and run the show; and (2) Stuart did not usurp any corporate opportunity in breach of his fiduciary obligations to Grand Strand, or otherwise fail to act in good faith.Â  Pittman filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.\r\nPittman appeals and raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the master-in-equity err in granting summary judgment in favor of Stuart?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the master-in-equity err in finding that the arbitration award barred Pittman from bringing the same claims against Stuart that Pittman had previously asserted against Legends?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  Summary Judgment\r\nIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this Court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. Town of Awendaw, 359 S.C. 29, 34, 596 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2004) (quoting Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001)).Â  On appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\nPittman argues Stuart owed a fiduciary duty to Grand Strand, and there is an issue of fact as to whether Stuart breached this duty.Â  Because we find that the parties were not in a fiduciary relationship, we disagree.\r\nWhether there is a fiduciary relationship between two people is an equitable issue.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458, 578 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003).Â  A fiduciary relationship exists when one has a special confidence in another so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith.Â  Hotz v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 230, 403 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1991).Â  \r\nStuart did not owe a fiduciary duty to Pittman or Grand Strand.Â  However, Pittman argues that Stuart owed a fiduciary duty because he was (1) a majority shareholder; (2) the CEO of Grand Strand; and (3) the Chairman of the Board of Directors.Â  But Stuart did not occupy any of these positions.Â  \r\nFirst, there is no evidence that Stuart was a majority shareholder of Grand Strand.Â  In fact, the corporate minutes describe Pittman as â€œthe sole shareholder of the corporation.â€Â  Although Stuart was eventually issued 120,000 shares of stock, there is no indication that by holding this stock, for which Stuart paid nothing, Stuart became a majority shareholder.[4]Â  \r\nSecond, Pittman himself testified that there was no resolution or shareholder vote of the shareholders naming Stuart a director or officer.Â  In fact, Pittman signed the corporate minutes as â€œChairman.â€Â  Later, in correspondence with Stuartâ€™s attorney, Pittman signed a letter as â€œPresident of Grand Strand Entertainment, Inc.â€\r\nStuart did, however, sign his name as CEO of Grand Strand on two letters that he wrote to the bank, and on a bank agreement.Â  Although Stuartâ€™s act of signing his name as CEO may have been inappropriate, it did not transform Stuart into Grand Strandâ€™s CEO, with duties attendant to that position.Â  We are unwilling, therefore, to find that Stuart owed duties required by officers of corporation.Â  \r\nAt most, Pittman and Stuart, and their respective corporations, were parties to a contract, acting as two separate entities.Â  Pittman breached that contract by not paying the $200,000 by March 30, and by not promptly registering the SCOR offering and providing all the opening costs.Â  If anything, it was Pittman, not Stuart, whose actions were detrimental to Grand Strand.Â  \r\nBecause these parties were not in a fiduciary relationship, we affirm the master-in-equityâ€™s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Stuart. \r\nII.Â  Claim Preclusion\r\nPittman argues that the master-in-equity erred in finding that the arbitration award barred Pittman from bringing the same claims against Stuart that Pittman had previously asserted against Legends.Â  We disagree.\r\nPittman misconstrues the language in the master-in-equityâ€™s ruling.Â  In his ruling, the master found the following: â€œ[s]ince Legends in Concert, Inc. committed no wrongs, the Plaintiff is barred from asserting any such claims against the Defendant Stuart.â€Â  Pittman argues that this language effectively barred Pittman from pursuing his claims against Stuart as an individual.Â  This is incorrect.Â  The master simply reiterated what the law has been throughout this litigation: claims raised against Legends were confined to and disposed of through arbitration; therefore, Pittman was not permitted to turn around and raise those very same claims against Stuart as an individual.Â  In other words, any claims Pittman has against Stuart must specifically address wrongs committed by Stuart, not Legends.Â  \r\nTherefore, we find no error.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the master-in-equityâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of Stuart.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] The show originated in Las Vegas and had successfully opened in other cities. \r\n[2] Pittman explained that he would raise the money through a Small Corporate Offering Registration (SCOR), which is a type of public stock offering. \r\n[3] Pittman also signed the agreement as an individual.Â  Stuart signed only on behalf of his corporation, Legends. \r\n[4] Grand Strand was authorized to issue a total of 1,000,000 shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Jordan Delaine White","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2005-04-11-01","description":"Appointment of an Attorney to Protect Clients' Interests pursuant to Rule 413, SCACR.","date":"2005-04-11","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Jordan Delaine White, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel seeks the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  See In the Matter of White, Op.

Perry:\r\n\r\n1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the South Carolina Business Opportunity Sales Act (the Act) S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-57-10 et seq. apply to a contract between a business located in Texas and a Texas resident, and performed in Texas and Washington?\r\n2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the answer to question 1 change if the individual later moves to South Carolina and signs a new contract with a related entity to be performed in South Carolina?\r\n\r\nWe answer both questionsÂ  â€œNo.â€\r\nFACTS[1]Â \r\nIn 2000, plaintiff entered a business agreement with Bumper Man, Inc. (BMI).Â  This agreement, entered into in Texas, licensed plaintiff to practice the Bumper Man method of repairing automobile bumpers within a territory in San Antonio (Texas Agreement).Â  BMIâ€™s licensing fee was $15,000: Plaintiff paid $10,000 and secured the remaining $5,000 with a promissory note.\r\nThe Texas Agreement provided, among other things, that plaintiff would be offered a franchise for no additional cost at some point in the future.Â  About four months after entering the Texas Agreement, plaintiff moved to Seattle.Â  He operated his business there pursuant to the Texas Agreement.Â  The Texas Agreement had required plaintiff to pay a $2,000 relocation fee if he moved from San Antonio.Â  Further, that agreement required him to pay the remainder of the BMI licensing fee if he relocated.Â  In February 2001, a new entity, Bumper Man Franchising, Inc. (BMFI), prepared and sent plaintiff a Franchise Offer Circular.[2]Â Â Â  On the same day that plaintiff received the Franchise Offer Circular, plaintiff signed a new promissory note in favor of BMFI for $12,000.[3]\r\nIn July 2001, plaintiff moved to South Carolina.Â  Once here, he signed a franchise agreement with BMFI and began operating as a Bumper Man Franchise (South Carolina Agreement).Â  In August 2002, plaintiff and BMFI had a falling out, and this litigation followed. \r\nThe parties acknowledge that the Texas licensing agreement with BMI was performed exclusively in Texas and Washington State, while the South Carolina franchise agreement with BMFI was entered into and performed here.\r\nISSUES\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Does the South Carolina Business Opportunity Sales Act (the Act) S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-57-10 et seq. apply to a contract between a business located in Texas and a Texas resident, and performed in Texas and Washington?\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Does the answer to question 1 change if the individual later moves to South Carolina and signs a new contract with a related entity to be performed in South Carolina?\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.Â  Applicability of the Act to the Texas Agreement\r\n\r\nThe first question asks whether the Act applies to the Texas Agreement, entered into in that state and wholly performed outside South Carolina.Â  It is unnecessary to conduct any in-depth analysis in order to conclude that the answer to this question is â€œno.â€Â  E.g., Ex parte First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Co., 247 S.C. 506, 148 S.E.2d 373 (1966) (state statutes have no extraterritorial effect).[4]\r\n\r\nB.Â  Does the Act apply to the Texas Agreement by virtue of the subsequent contract entered into by plaintiff and BMFI in South Carolina?\r\n\r\nWe answer this question â€˜No.â€™ There is nothing in this record to suggest that the parties to the Texas Agreement contemplated that the plaintiff would relocate to South Carolina and that the anticipated franchise offer would be made and performed here.Â  We hold that the subsequent South Carolina Agreement between plaintiff and BMFI does not cause the Act to relate back and apply to the Texas Agreement between plaintiff and BMI.\r\nWe note further that the Act applies to the start-up of a business.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-57-20 (Supp. 2004).Â  The application, if any, of the Act to the South Carolina Agreement between plaintiff and BMFI is not before the Court.Â  We emphasize that our answers are restricted to the narrow questions certified.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe answer both certified questions \r\nâ€˜No.â€™ \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We restrict our discussion to the facts recited in the certification order.Â  \r\n[2] This circular is required by the FTC Franchise Disclosure Rule, 16 CFR Â§Â§ 436 et seq.\r\n[3] The $12,000 represents the $2,000 relocation fee and $10,000 licensing fee due BMI under the Texas Agreement.\r\n[4] Plaintiff cites numerous cases in brief for the proposition that a state statute regulating business practices applies where the state has a significant connection with the transaction.Â  Here, South Carolina has no relationship with the BMI licensing agreement executed in Texas and wholly performed in that state and in the State of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25972","title":"State v.

Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   JUSTICE WALLER: This case was certified to this Court from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Appellant, Harold Gregory, was convicted of two counts of committing a lewd act on a child and sentenced to concurrent twelve year terms of imprisonment.Â  We reverse.\r\n  FACTS\r\n  Gregory was indicted for two counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree, two counts of committing a lewd act on a child, and one count of first-degree sexual exploitation of a minor.Â  The acts allegedly committed by Gregory all involved his adopted daughter, Melissa.Â  \r\n  Melissa was born on June 23, 1973.Â  Gregory married her mother when she was 5 years old.Â  According to Melissaâ€™s testimony at trial, when she was approximately 10 years old, Gregory began coming into her bedroom at night and molesting her.Â  The molestation continued until she was approximately 13 years old, at which time Gregory adopted her, and ceased molesting her for a period of time.Â  He began the molestation again which went on, off and on, until she was 28 years old.Â  Gregoryâ€™s defense at trial was that, although he and Melissa had engaged in inappropriate acts, they had all happened after she had turned 18.Â  \r\n  The jury convicted Gregory of two counts of lewd act upon a child.Â  \r\n  ISSUE\r\n  Although numerous issues are raised, the sole issue we need address is whether the trial court erred in refusing to grant a continuance and relieve Gregoryâ€™s attorney due to the attorneyâ€™s conflict of interest?\r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n  On the first day of trial, Gregoryâ€™s defense attorney moved to be relieved as counsel and requested a continuance.Â  He advised the court that he had begun representing Gregory in June 2002 and that, in January 2003, he began representing an Aiken County Assistant Solicitor in her divorce action.Â  Defense counsel indicated he had had some negotiations with the solicitor concerning the charges against Gregory, and that Gregory was thereafter indicted for another charge (sexual exploitation of a minor).Â  Counsel advised Gregory of his representation of the assistant solicitor when it became apparent the case was going to trial.Â  \r\n  The trial court inquired in what manner Gregory would be prejudiced by counselâ€™s continued representation.Â  Counselâ€™s response was that Gregoryâ€™s confidence in his ability was diminished, regardless of whether the solicitor was out of the case because Gregory believed they may have been â€œin cahoots.â€Â  The court then indicated that the assistant solicitor would not participate in the trial, and the case would be prosecuted by another solicitor.Â  The trial court ruled Gregory had not shown he was prejudiced, and that defense counsel had not done anything inappropriate.Â  Accordingly, the motions to be relieved and for a continuance were denied.Â Â Â  \r\n  Gregory asserts the trial court erred in denying counselâ€™s motion to be relieved and in denying a continuance based upon counselâ€™s conflict of interest.Â  We agree.\r\n  â€œ[A] motion to relieve counsel is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€ State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 385, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211 (2001) (citation omitted).Â  An actual conflict of interest occurs where an attorney owes a duty to a party whose interests are adverse to the defendantâ€™s.Â  Fuller v. State, 347 S.C. 630, 557 S.E.2d 664 (2001).Â  The mere possibility defense counsel may have a conflict of interest is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. See Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 359, 426 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1993) (citing Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).Â  However, a defendant need not demonstrate prejudice if there is an actual conflict of interest.Â  Thomas v. State, 346 S.C. 140, 551 S.E.2d 254 (2001); Duncan v. State, 281 S.C. 435, 315 S.E.2d 809 (1984) citing Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348-350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718-19, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).Â  \r\n  In Duncan v. State, 281 S.C. at 438, 315 S.E.2d at 811 (1984), this Court set forth the following test to determine when an actual conflict of interest occurs: \r\n  \r\n  . . . when a defense attorney places himself in a situation inherently conducive to divided loyalties. . . .Â  If a defense attorney owes duties to a\r\n  party whose interests are adverse to those of the defendant, then an actual conflict exists.Â  The interests of the other client and the defendant are sufficiently adverse if it is shown that the attorney owes a duty to the defendant to take some action that could be detrimental to his other client.Â  An actual conflict of interest occurs where an\r\n  attorney owes a duty to a party whose interests are adverse to the defendant's.Â  \r\n  \r\n  citing Zuck v. State of Alabama, 588 F.2d 436, 439 (5th Cir.1979).Â  \r\n  The question in this case is whether defense counsel owed duties to a party whose interests were adverse to Gregory.Â  Under this Courtâ€™s holding in Duncan and the case cited therein, Zuck v. Alabama, we find that he did.Â  In Zuck v. Alabama, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that where the law firm retained to represent the defendant in a murder trial also represented the state prosecutor in an unrelated civil trial, there was an actual conflict of interest, and the conflict rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.Â  The court noted that â€œthe basis of these decisions is our belief that the sixth amendment requires that a defendant may not be represented by counsel who might be tempted to dampen the ardor of his defense in order to placate his other client. . . . This possibility is sufficient to constitute an actual conflict as a matter of law.â€ 588 F.2d at 440 (emphasis supplied).Â  Similarly, in People v. Castro, 657 P.2d 932 (Colo. 1983), the Supreme Court of Colorado held a defense attorneyâ€™s representation of the district attorney on criminal charges of overspending his office budget, while simultaneously representing the defendant on a criminal charge of murder, created a conflict of interest, notwithstanding the district attorney did not participate in the trial of the case.Â  The Castro court stated, â€œ[t]he District Attorneyâ€™s office, for example, in order to avoid any appearance of favoritism, might well take an unusually hard line on plea bargaining to the disadvantage of the defendant.Â  Defense counsel, in turn, might be reluctant to incur the disfavor of her other client, the district attorney, by pressing hard for the best possible plea bargain for the defendant. . . . What is critical, in our view, is the presence of a real and substantial conflict that placed the defense attorney in a situation inherently conducive to and productive of divided loyalties.â€Â  657 P.2d at 945.[1]Â Â  \r\n  In this case, we find Gregoryâ€™s attorney had an actual conflict because he placed himself in a â€œsituation inherently conducive to divided loyaltiesâ€ by simultaneously representing Gregory and the assistant solicitor who was handling his criminal case.Â  Given the actual conflict, Gregory is not required to demonstrate prejudice.Â  Thomas, supra.Â  \r\n  In light of our holding, we need not address the remaining issues raised by Gregory.Â  The judgment below is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.\r\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n   TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]Â  The possibility that the ardor of counselâ€™s defense was dampened by his representation of the solicitor is apparent from the record.Â  Although Gregory raised numerous issues on appeal, the majority were not preserved for review because they were not objected to at trial.Â  Further, the fact that another charge was brought against Gregory subsequent to counselâ€™s negotiations with the solicitor lend credence to the suggestion that the solicitorâ€™s office may have taken an unusually hard line against Gregory, simply to avoid any appearance of favoritism.Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Lawyers Suspended for Failure to Pay License Fees and Comply with CLE Requirements","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2005-04-12-01","description":"Under Rule 419, SCACR, the Court has issued an order suspending lawyers for failing to comply with continuing legal education requirements and failing to pay Bar license fees and assessments.","date":"2005-04-18","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Bar and Commission on Continuing Legal \r\n  Education and Specialization have furnished the attached lists of lawyers who \r\n  were administratively suspended from the practice of law on January 31, \r\n  2005, under Rule 419(b), SCACR, and remain suspended as of April 1, 2005. \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 419(e), SCACR, these lawyers are hereby suspended from \r\n  the practice of law by this Court.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth R. McMahon, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Petitioner was indicted for murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the fatal shooting of twenty-three-year-old Thomas Wideman.Â  Petitioner admitted shooting Wideman but claimed self-defense.Â  After his conviction was affirmed on appeal,[1] petitioner commenced this post-conviction relief (PCR) action.Â  The PCR court denied relief.Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to consider petitionerâ€™s allegations regarding ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe shooting occurred inside a dance club in McCormick County after a verbal confrontation in the parking lot.Â  The Stateâ€™s witnesses testified Wideman was sitting in a parked vehicle talking with two of his sisters and a friend when petitioner approached and asked Wideman to move his car.Â  When Widemanâ€™s sister responded, petitioner called her â€œignorant.â€Â  Wideman and petitioner then exchanged angry words.Â  In the club, Wideman complained to his sister that petitioner was staring at him.Â  As last call was announced, petitioner walked toward Wideman and shot him.Â  When Wideman fell, petitioner shot him two more times.Â  Wideman died shortly thereafter.Â  \r\nThe State presented witnesses who testified they never saw Wideman with a gun on the night he was shot.Â  However, defense witness Leroy Brown testified he saw Wideman in the club with a gun stuck down inside his pants immediately before the shooting.Â  Derek Ridenhour testified that after the shooting, someone tried to hand him Widemanâ€™s gun for safekeeping but he refused to take it.Â  Petitioner also testified he saw a gun in Widemanâ€™s hand during their verbal confrontation in the parking lot.Â  \r\nPetitioner further testified that before going back inside the club, he took his gun from his truck and put it in his pocket for â€œprotection.â€Â  In the club, petitioner and Wideman had another confrontation.Â  According to petitioner, Wideman continued staring at him across the room.Â  Wideman â€œpulled up his shirt and showed the gunâ€ while pointing at the door.Â  \r\nWhen last call was announced, petitioner was concerned that â€œas soon as I went out that door [Wideman] could have did anything,â€ so petitioner approached Wideman to tell him â€œhe need to stop before somebody got hurt.â€Â  Wideman jumped up from his seat and was going for his gun when petitioner shot him.Â  Wideman was still reaching for his gun after he fell so petitioner continued shooting.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.&nbsp;\r\n         Was appellate counsel ineffective for failing to appeal the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give an appearances charge?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.\r\n         Was appellate counsel ineffective for failing to appeal the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to charge immunity from retreat?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Appearances charge\r\n\r\nAt trial, counsel submitted a request to charge as follows:\r\nDEFENDANTâ€™S PROPOSED INSTRUCTION NO. 2\r\nThe test is not whether there was testimony of an intended attack but whether or not the defendant believed he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, and he is not required to show that such danger actually existed because he had a right to act upon such appearances as would cause a reasonable and prudent man of ordinary firmness and courage to entertain the same belief.\r\nAUTHORITY:\r\n State v. Jackson, 87 S.E.2d 681 (1955).\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nAt the charge conference, the trial judge distributed his proposed charge which read:\r\n\r\nThe defendant must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or the defendant must have actually been in such imminent danger. . . . If the defense relates to a belief by a defendant that he was in such imminent danger, the circumstances must have been such that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage could have entertained the same belief.\r\n\r\nThe following colloquy then occurred between counsel and the bench:\r\n\r\nMR. MIMS:Â  Your honor, I have Number Two, State versus Jackson, as the authority.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right.Â  Well. . . \r\nMR. BAGGETT:Â  I believe you had that covered on your point three on self-defense, your honor.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Yes, sir, I think I had it covered.Â  When the Supreme Court went back through and considered Davis . . . there is this addition about if the defendant was actually in danger or whether he believed he was in danger and I think Iâ€™ve covered those things in my charge.\r\n\r\nCounsel said nothing further and did not object when the charge was given. \r\nFirst, appellate counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise on appeal an issue that was not preserved for review.Â  Legge v. State, 349 S.C. 222, 562 S.E.2d 618 (2002).Â  We find trial counselâ€™s submission of the request to charge, without any further explanation of his point, was insufficient to preserve for review the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge the specific language regarding â€œa right to act on appearances.â€Â  \r\nIn State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 66, 508 S.E.2d 29, 31 (1998), we set out this preservation rule:Â  â€œ[W]here a party requests a jury charge and, after opportunity for discussion, the trial judge declines the charge, it is unnecessary to preserve the point on appeal, to renew the request at conclusion of the courtâ€™s instructions.â€Â  When given the opportunity, counsel must articulate a reason for the requested charge.Â  Counsel need not object to the charge when given if the basis of the requested charge is clear from the record.Â  It is not for the trial judge to study the requested charge and make an informed decision with no further input from counsel, especially in a situation such as this where there is only a subtle difference in the language of the judgeâ€™s proposed charge and the language of the request.[2]\r\nIn any event, aside from the lack of preservation, we find appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this issue.Â  A PCR applicant has the burden of proving appellate counsel's performance was deficient.Â  Anderson v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 581 S.E.2d 834 (2003); Southerland v. State, 337 S.C. 610, 524 S.E.2d 833 (1999).Â  Appellate counsel is not required to raise every nonfrivolous issue that is presented by the record.Â  Tisdale v. State, 357 S.C. 474, 594 S.E.2d 166 (2004).Â  \r\nA defendant is entitled to an appearances charge where the claim of self-defense arises from a mistaken appearance of danger.Â  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000).Â  Here, petitioner introduced evidence Wideman was actually armed with a gun at the time of the shooting and trial counsel focused extensively on the corroborative evidence in closing.Â  Counsel concluded his argument by stating:\r\n\r\nNow, to think that [Wideman] didnâ€™t have a gun would really stretch the imagination and it would really make you wonder about doubt. . . . [Petitioner] said he had a gun, besides all these other people who independently testified and independently gave statements that they saw a gun on [Wideman] and I submit he did have a gun.\r\n\r\nPetitionerâ€™s claim of self-defense did not rely on a mistaken appearance of danger.Â  The failure to give an appearances charge was therefore not reversible error and appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue this issue on appeal.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge properly found appellate counsel was not ineffective. \r\n2.Â  Duty to retreat\r\nTrial counsel requested the following charge which the trial judge refused to give:\r\n\r\nIf a person is assaulted while in a club of which he is a member and without fault in bring[ing] on the difficulty, he is not bound to retreat in order to invoke the benefit of the doctrine of self-defense, but may stand his ground and repel the attack with as much force as is reasonably necessary.\r\n\r\nCounselâ€™s request was based on this Courtâ€™s holding in State v. Marlowe, 120 S.C. 205, 112 S.E. 921 (1922), which involved a shooting at an Elkâ€™s Club.Â  The defendant was a member of the club and the victim was not.Â  The Court held it was error to refuse to charge that â€œthe law of retreat does not apply to a club member when attacked by another in the club roomsâ€ because â€œ[a] man is no more bound to allow himself to be run out of his rest room than his workshop.â€Â  112 S.E. at 922.Â  \r\nHere, the â€œclubâ€ in which the shooting occurred was a â€œdance clubâ€ which charged $5 for admission.Â  There is no evidence petitioner was a â€œmemberâ€ of this club.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in refusing the charge and appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue on appeal.\r\nIn any event, we take this opportunity to overrule the analysis in State v. Marlowe elevating a â€œclubâ€ to the possessory status of a home or place of business.Â  This expansion of the immunity-from-retreat doctrine is not good public policy, especially in the contemporary context of â€œprivate clubs.â€ \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm petitionerâ€™s remaining issues pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authority:Â  Issue 1:Â  Legge v. State, 349 S.C. 222, 562 S.E.2d 618 (2002) (appellate counsel not ineffective for failing to raise an issue where no objection was preserved at trial); State v. Addison, 343 S.C. 290, 540 S.E.2d 449 (2000) (charge regarding Stateâ€™s burden to disprove self-defense should be given if requested but only for cases tried after the filing of this Courtâ€™s opinion in State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 500 S.E.2d 489 (1998)); Issues 3 &amp; 4:Â  State v. Burton, 302 S.C. 494, 397 S.E.2d 90 (1990) (no error where charge given adequately covered substance of requested charge).Â  The PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]State v. Gilchrist, 342 S.C. 369, 536 S.E.2d 868 (2000).\r\n[2]In fact, in two early cases, we held a charge regarding the defendantâ€™s belief he was in danger, similar to the charge given here, covered the substance of an appearances charge.Â  State v. McGee, 185 S.C. 184, 193 S.E. 303 (1937); State v. Scruggs, 94 S.C. 304, 77 S.E. 944 (1913).Â  In recent cases, however, we have found such a charge does not cover an appearances charge.Â  Eg., State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000); Battle v. State, 305 S.C. 460, 409 S.E.2d 400 (1991); Â State v.

Hunter, 310 S.C. 364, 426 S.E.2d 797 (1993).Â  On review, we will affirm a directed verdict where there is no evidence on any one element of the alleged cause of action.Â  First State Savings and Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 385 S.E.2d 821 (1989).Â Â  In a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must establish proximate cause as well as the negligence of the physician.Â  Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 473 S.E.2d 793 (1996).Â Â  \r\nThere is no evidence Decedent relied on Hospitalâ€™s aftercare instructions and for this reason did not call his cardiologist.Â  Further, the record contains no expert testimony Decedentâ€™s death could have been prevented had he seen his cardiologist the next morning.Â  See Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 393 S.E.2d 914 (1990) (expert testimony is required to establish proximate cause in a medical malpractice case if outside the common knowledge or experience of laypersons); Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 249 S.E.2d 910 (1978) (medical malpractice plaintiff relying on expert testimony must introduce evidence that defendant's negligence most probably resulted in the injuries alleged).Â  Because there is no evidence the conflicting discharge instructions proximately caused Decedentâ€™s death, the trial judge properly granted a directed verdict on this allegation of negligence.\r\n2.Â  Exclusion of evidence\r\nHospital moved to strike the â€œAftercare Instructions,â€ along with evidence of Hospitalâ€™s internal policies regarding discharge instructions, after withdrawing comparative negligence as a defense.Â  In light of counselâ€™s assurance comparative negligence would not be argued to the jury, the trial judge found the contested evidence irrelevant and granted the motion to strike.[4]Â  \r\nWe find no error.Â  When the directed verdict on the issue of Hospitalâ€™s negligence for conflicting instructions was properly granted, this evidence became irrelevant.Â  Comparative negligence was not argued in closing nor submitted to the jury.Â  Because there was no issue of Decedentâ€™s negligence that might be explained by an inference he followed these instructions, there was no prejudice from the exclusion of this evidence. Â The exclusion of evidence that is not relevant to some matter in issue cannot be prejudicial.Â  See Otis Elevator, Inc. v. Hardin Const. Co. Group, Inc., 316 S.C. 292, 450 S.E.2d 41 (1994) (no error in the exclusion of evidence absent a showing of prejudice).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s remaining issues are without merit and we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR.Â  See Issue 2:Â  Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 249 S.E.2d 910 (1978) (medical malpractice plaintiff relying on expert testimony must introduce evidence that defendantâ€™s negligence most probably resulted in the injuries alleged); Issue 4:Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. System, 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999) (jury charge correct if when read as whole, charge contains correct definition and adequately covers law); see also State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994) (jury instructions should be considered as whole, and if as whole they are free from error, any isolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, J., and Acting Justices Reginald I. Lloyd and R. Markley Dennis, Jr., concur.Â  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  The trial court committed reversible error in granting a directed verdict on one of Appellantâ€™s central allegations of negligence and in excluding evidence related to that allegation.\r\nThis appeal offers a textbook example of an instance in which Appellant was erroneously prohibited from presenting crucial, admissible evidence and testimony to prove her case to the jury.Â  The prejudicial error, in my opinion, is clear and unambiguous, and Appellant is entitled to a new trial.\r\n\r\nAppellant raises two related issues:\r\nI.Â  Did the trial court err in granting a directed verdict against Appellant on the issue of whether Hospital was negligent in providing conflicting discharge instructions?\r\nII.Â  Did the trial court err in striking from evidence two exhibits relating to discharge instructions provided by Hospital and prohibiting testimony about those instructions?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences which reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  The trial court must deny the motion when either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Strange v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â  If the evidence is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the case must be submitted to the jury.Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).Â  When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Creech v. S.C. Wildlife and Marine Resources Dept., 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997).Â  In essence, the appellate court must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 ( 2002); Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and the trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Pike v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000); Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.Â  Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1991); Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987).Â  To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997); Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commn., 254 S.C. 378, 405, 175 S.E.2d 805, 819 (1970); Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 160, 156 S.E.2d 759, 764 (1967).\r\nI.Â  DIRECTED VERDICT REGARDING CONFLICTING DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on the issue of whether Hospital and its agent, King, were negligent in providing conflicting discharge instructions to Decedent.Â  I agree.\r\nIt is undisputed Decedent was given conflicting discharge instructions by King and Hospitalâ€™s staff.Â Â  King testified he verbally told Decedent to follow up with his cardiologist, Reeves, the next morning and he documented this instruction in emergency room records which were not provided to Decedent the night of his visit.Â  In contrast, the written discharge instructions Decedent received from Hospitalâ€™s staff, titled â€œAftercare Instructions,â€ stated:Â  â€œTHESE ARE YOUR FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS!Â  Call Dr. Hiott [Decedentâ€™s family doctor] in 2 days if not much better.Â  Call sooner if worsening.â€Â  On cross-examination, Appellant denied knowing Decedent was told at the time of his discharge from the emergency room to contact his cardiologist in the morning.\r\nAt the close of Appellantâ€™s case, Hospital moved for a directed verdict on the allegation Hospital was negligent in giving conflicting discharge instructions.Â  The trial judge granted the motion, ruling Appellant had not presented expert testimony the conflicting instructions were the proximate cause of Decedentâ€™s death.\r\nThis ruling constitutes reversible error.Â  Appellant produced no explicit expert testimony Decedentâ€™s death was proximately caused by the failure to see his cardiologist the next morning.Â  See e.g. Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 72, 393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1990) (expert testimony is required to establish proximate cause in a medical malpractice case if outside the common knowledge or experience of laypersons); Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 254, 487 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1997) (â€œunless the subject is a matter of common knowledge, the plaintiff must use expert testimony to establish both the standard of care and the defendantâ€™s failure to conform to that standardâ€).Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion the record contains no expert testimony Decedentâ€™s death was proximately caused by the failure to see his cardiologist the next morning.Â  I also disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion the record contains no evidence Decedent relied on the conflicting aftercare instructions.\r\nA plaintiff may present both expert testimony and circumstantial evidence of a physicianâ€™s culpability, and the inquiry need only be whether there is sufficient competent evidence from which the jury may infer a causal connection between the physicianâ€™s conduct and the injury.Â  Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 189-93, 249 S.E.2d 910, 912-13 (1978) (reversing grant of directed verdict for defendant physician where plaintiff relied on both expert testimony and circumstantial evidence which showed plaintiffâ€™s medical problems began soon after insertion of intrauterine device); Shelnitz v. Greenberg, 509 A.2d 1023, 1027 (Conn. 1986) (causation in medical malpractice case may be proven both by expert testimony, which usually is necessary to establish the standard of care, and circumstantial evidence); 1 Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts Â§ 173 (2001) (courts recognize juries must be permitted to make causal judgments from ordinary experience without demanding an impossible degree of proof and â€œ[e]ven scientific or medical causation might be proven by circumstantial evidence leading to an inference of causationâ€); Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§ 41 (5th ed. 1984) (â€œCircumstantial evidence, expert testimony, or common knowledge may provide a basis from which the causal sequence may be inferred.â€).\r\nAppellantâ€™s expert, Wood, testified that had Decedent been admitted to the hospital rather than discharged, he â€œmore than likely would have survived.â€Â  Wood testified â€œpeople have heart attacks and get hospitalized for it all the time, and, you know, these are general statistics, but probably ninety percent of people that get hospitalized with heart attacks live.â€Â  A reasonable inference which may be drawn from this testimony is if Decedent had seen his cardiologist the next morning as directed by King, he could have been admitted to the hospital where he most likely would have survived his heart attack.\r\nThe expertâ€™s testimony that the proximate cause of Decedentâ€™s death was the lack of hospitalization at the time of his cardiac arrest was sufficient to submit to the jury the issue of Hospitalâ€™s negligence, regardless of whether the lack of hospitalization occurred on the night of his visit to the emergency room or the morning after.Â  Therefore, liberally construing the evidence Decedent did not return to his cardiologist the next morning as directed by King, Hospital gave Decedent discharge instructions stating he should wait two days to see his family doctor, and expert testimony he most likely would have survived had he been hospitalized at the time of his heart attack, it is reasonably probable a verdict would have been rendered in Appellantâ€™s favor had the jury been allowed to consider negligence allegations relating to the conflicting discharge instructions.\r\nIn addition, the record contains circumstantial evidence Decedent relied on Hospitalâ€™s written discharge instruction (call family doctor â€œin 2 days if not much better.Â  Call sooner if worsening.â€) instead of Kingâ€™s verbal instruction (see cardiologist the next morning).Â  Appellant testified Decedent stated on September 3 he did not need to return to the hospital because, although King had told Decedent he would have a â€œterrible headacheâ€ from the nitroglycerin, he expected to â€œbe better in a day or two.â€Â  Thus Decedent told his wife he needed to give his condition a couple of days to improve - just like Hospital told him to do in its written discharge instructions.Â  See e.g. Mahaffey v. Ahl, 264 S.C. 241, 247, 214 S.E.2d 119, 122 (1975) (â€œit is axiomatic in this State that issues of negligence and proximate cause may be resolved by direct or circumstantial evidenceâ€).\r\nIn pointing to circumstantial evidence surrounding Decedentâ€™s actions, I do not suggest expert testimony is not usually required to prove medical malpractice.Â  I do conclude that expert testimony identifying the lack of hospitalization as a proximate cause of Decedentâ€™s death, combined with circumstantial evidence Decedent may have relied on discharge instructions in which he was not told to follow up promptly with a cardiologist who may have admitted him to the hospital before he suffered a fatal heart attack, are sufficient to create a jury question on whether Hospital and its admitted agent were negligent.Â  See Green, 272 S.C. at 189-93, 249 S.E.2d at 912-13; Shelnitz, 509 A.2d at 1027.\r\nII.Â  EXCLUSION OF PLAINTIFFâ€™S EXHIBITS PERTAINING TO DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAppellant contends the trial court committed prejudicial error in striking from evidence two exhibits relating to discharge instructions provided by Hospital and prohibiting testimony about those instructions.Â  I agree.\r\nThe document titled â€œAftercare Instructions,â€ discussed above, was admitted in evidence by Appellant as Exhibit 18D.Â  This document instructed Decedent to call his family doctor if he was not feeling better in two days.Â  Appellant also offered Exhibit 22, which set forth Hospitalâ€™s policies regarding discharge instructions.Â  Based on its earlier, directed verdict ruling that Appellant had failed to present expert testimony the conflicting instructions proximately caused Decedentâ€™s death, the trial court prohibited Appellant from questioning Hospitalâ€™s witnesses about the exhibits or the conflicting discharge instructions. \r\nHospital moved to strike Exhibits 18D and 22 after withdrawing its defense of comparative negligence before the case was submitted to the jury.Â  The trial court granted the motion, finding the exhibits were irrelevant because comparative negligence was no longer an issue.[5]\r\nWhen evidence is erroneously excluded by the trial court, the appellate court usually engages in the following analysis to determine whether prejudice has occurred.Â  First, the appellate court considers, inter alia, whether the error may be deemed harmless because equivalent or cumulative evidence or testimony was offered; the aggrieved party still managed to accomplish his primary objective, such as eliciting testimony about an issue or effectively cross-examining a witness; the juryâ€™s verdict or a proper court ruling rendered the wrongly excluded evidence moot because it was relevant to an issue that did not have to be reached; the aggrieved party failed to establish a claim or defense even when both the admitted and excluded evidence are considered; or the wrongly excluded evidence involved a generally known fact.Â  Fields v. Regional Medical Center, Op. No. 25939 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 14, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 8 at 17, 27-29) (citing cases supporting each proposition).\r\nSecond, the appellate court considers whether, viewing a case as a whole, the wrongly excluded evidence or testimony was so crucial and important in proving the aggrieved partyâ€™s claim or defense that its exclusion constitutes prejudicial error, i.e., the aggrieved party demonstrates there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the lack of the evidence.Â  Id. (citing cases).\r\nThe testimony of Appellantâ€™s medical expert that the proximate cause of Decedentâ€™s death was the lack of hospitalization at the time of his cardiac arrest was sufficient to submit to the jury the issue of Hospitalâ€™s negligence, regardless of whether the lack of hospitalization occurred on the night of his visit to the emergency room or the morning after.Â  Exhibit 18D was relevant and admissible because it contained the conflicting discharge instructions given to Decedent.Â  See Rules 401 and 402, SCRE (relevant evidence generally is admissible).Â  \r\nViolation of a rule or regulation designed primarily for the safety of hospital patients will constitute negligence if the violation proximately results in the injury.Â  Steeves v. U.S., 294 F. Supp. 446, 455 (D.S.C. 1968).Â  Furthermore, relevant rules of a defendant hospital or company are admissible in evidence in a personal injury action regardless of whether rules were intended primarily for employee guidance, public safety, or both, because violation of such rules may constitute evidence of a breach of the duty of care and the proximate cause of injury.Â  Tidwell v. Columbia Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 109 S.C. 34, 95 S.E. 109 (1918); see also Caldwell v. K-Mart Corp., 306 S.C. 27, 31-32, 410 S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 1991) (when defendant adopts internal policies or self-imposed rules and thereafter violates those policies or rules, jury may consider such violations as evidence of negligence if they proximately caused a plaintiffâ€™s damages).Â  Thus, Exhibit 22, which listed Hospitalâ€™s policies and procedures on discharge instructions, was relevant and admissible to establish and define the standard of care Hospital was required to meet with regard to discharge instructions.Â  \r\nKing testified he was â€œstunnedâ€ and â€œvery much surprised that [Decedent] had not seen his cardiologist the next day because I thought he was quite clear what he was to do.â€Â  In light of expert testimony that Kingâ€™s instruction to see a cardiologist in the morning was appropriate, the implication that may be drawn from evidence heard by the jury is Decedent did not follow sound medical advice and, therefore, King should not be held responsible.Â  In fact, Hospitalâ€™s counsel argued in closing that Decedent knew from his cardiologist,Â  Reeves, he needed to seek immediate medical attention if his pain was not relieved with nitroglycerin, yet he did not return to the hospital the following day.Â  If the exhibits and testimony about the conflicting discharge instructions had been allowed, Appellant could have argued the instructions contained in Exhibit 18D were circumstantial evidence which explained Decedentâ€™s failure to follow Kingâ€™s directions, as well as evidence of the negligence of Hospital and its agent.Â  \r\nIn effect, Hospital gained an improper tactical advantage by withdrawing the issue of comparative negligence as a ground to exclude the conflicting discharge instructions - which left only the evidence that Decedent did not follow his doctorâ€™s orders.Â  Hospital then implicitly asserted the defense of comparative negligence in closing arguments despite agreeing to abandon that defense. \r\nAppellant did not present any equivalent or cumulative evidence about the conflicting discharge instructions; nor was Appellant able to accomplish her primary objective of demonstrating Hospitalâ€™s alleged negligence on this ground through other testimony or evidence.Â  Viewing the case as a whole, I conclude the wrongly excluded evidence and testimony was so crucial and important in proving Appellantâ€™s claim that its exclusion constitutes prejudicial error, i.e., Appellant has demonstrated there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the lack of the evidence.\r\nI would reverse the juryâ€™s verdict and remand this matter for a new trial.Â  The trial court committed reversible error in granting a directed verdict against Appellant on the issue of whether Hospital was negligent in providing conflicting discharge instructions.Â  The trial court also committed reversible error in striking from evidence two exhibits relating to discharge instructions provided by Hospital and prohibiting testimony about the conflicting instructions.[6]  \r\n\r\n[1]Dr. King was named as a defendant.Â  The parties agreed before trial that the action would proceed solely against Hospital because Dr. King was acting as Hospitalâ€™s agent.Â  See Simmons v. Tuomey Reg. Med. Center, 341 S.C. 32, 533 S.E.2d 312 (2000) (hospitalâ€™s liability for acts of doctor-agent).\r\n[2]According to medical testimony in the record, stable angina occurs when the coronary arteries become occluded over time and smaller arteries take over to aid in carrying blood to the heart muscle.Â  In this instance, the patient feels pain only on exertion because the smaller arteries cannot handle the extra need for blood.Â  The pain of stable angina improves with rest or with nitroglycerin.Â  Unstable angina, on the other hand, occurs when an artery is suddenly occluded by a blood clot.Â  The patient feels pain, or more frequent pain, even when resting.Â  The pain is not relieved with nitroglycerin.Â  A patient with unstable angina should be admitted to the hospital to prevent the clot from getting bigger.Â  If the blockage becomes too large, the patient will suffer a heart attack. \r\n[3]Appellant makes a procedural argument that the trial judge should not direct a verdict on one specification of negligence if any other specification is supported by the evidence.Â  The cases appellant cites do not stand for this proposition and we find it without merit.Â  Cf. Young v. Charleston &amp; W.C. Ry. Co., 229 S.C. 580, 93 S.E.2d 866 (1956) (where defendant moved for directed verdict to keep entire case from being submitted to jury, motion properly denied because evidence supported at least one specification of negligence).Â Â  \r\n[4]Further, the trial judge refused appellantâ€™s counter-motion that the discharge sheet with Dr. Kingâ€™s instructions also be struck.Â  Dr. Kingâ€™s discharge instructions remained relevant since they indicated his treatment conformed to the standard of care.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Further, the trial judge refused Appellantâ€™s counter-motion that the discharge sheet containing Kingâ€™s instructions also be struck if Exhibit 18D were struck.Â  This ruling was correct.Â  Kingâ€™s discharge instructions remained relevant because they indicated his treatment conformed to the required standard of care as established by his expert witnessesâ€™ testimony.Â  The error was in not admitting the conflicting discharge instructions contained in Exhibit 18D, which constituted proof that Hospital and Kingâ€™s treatment did not conform to the required standard of care.\r\n[6]Â  I agree with the majority the trial court did not err in granting a directed verdict on Appellantâ€™s claim Hospital was negligent due to Kingâ€™s failure to obtain and record an adequate medical history (Appellantâ€™s Issue 2).Â  Appellantâ€™s own medical expert, Wood, testified the history taken was adequate to conclude Decedent was suffering from unstable angina.Â  The record contains no evidence the failure to obtain an adequate history caused a misdiagnosis of stable angina and most probably caused Decedentâ€™s death.\r\nI also agree with the majority the trial court did not err in its jury instructions establishing a presumption Hospital met the standard of care (Appellantâ€™s Issue 4).Â  When read as a whole, the charge properly informed the jury of the plaintiffâ€™s burden of proof and did not establish an erroneous presumption.Â  See Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. System, 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999) (jury charge is correct if, when read as whole, it correctly defines and adequately covers the law).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25975","title":"State v.

Jacobs, all of Columbia; and John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Angle â€œAngelâ€ Joe Perrie Vazquez (Appellant) was convicted of two counts of murder, one count of armed robbery, four counts of kidnapping, and one count of criminal conspiracy.Â  Appellant was sentenced to death for the murders and thirty years for each count of kidnapping.Â  Appellant appealed.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe events leading up to Appellantâ€™s arrest began at the Burger King restaurant (the restaurant) in Myrtle Beach where Appellant worked.Â  One of the restaurantâ€™s patrons overheard Appellant using profanity in the restaurant.Â  Appellant cursed at fellow employee Reginald Atkins for trying to feed a patronâ€™s dog french fries.Â  The patron, who was with her children, was offended by Appellantâ€™s language and phoned the restaurantâ€™s district manager from her cell phone while outside the restaurant.Â  The district manager returned the call immediately.Â  Once the patron told the district manager what happened, the district manager asked to speak to the store manager, Joey Williams.Â  As a result of the conversation with the district manager, Williams immediately fired Appellant and refunded the patronâ€™s money.Â  Employee Robbie Robertson was called in to complete Appellantâ€™s shift.Â  In addition, Kuma Walker was on duty at the restaurant at that time.Â  \r\nAppellant called Shanira Robinson (girlfriend), with whom he shared a house, to tell her that he had been fired.Â  Around 5 p.m. Kevin Cochran drove Appellant home to Conway.Â  At some point during the drive, Appellant phoned his cousin, Michael Keith Howard.[1]Â  Howard met Appellant at Appellantâ€™s home.Â  While inside, Appellant removed a black case from a shelf in the closet.Â  Appellant told his girlfriend that he was going to Lake City and would return later.\r\nHowever, Appellant and Howard did not go to Lake City.Â  After leaving the house, Appellant and Howard were seen at about 8 p.m. by the bartender at the Nuttinâ€™ Butt Horseplay strip club in Myrtle Beach, which is located near the Burger King restaurant where Appellant worked.\r\nLater that evening, Appellant and Howard knocked on the back door of the Burger King restaurant.Â  Atkins and Williams opened the door, but asked them to go around front.Â  Appellant and Howard were seen by Nathan Danner, a patron of the restaurant, inside the restaurant.Â  Appellant was seen arguing with Williams.\r\nWhile Atkins and Robertson were preparing to close the restaurant,[2] Appellant pulled out a gun and told Atkins and Robertson to get into the restaurantâ€™s freezer.Â  Appellant then locked the two in the freezer.Â  After about five minutes, Atkins and Robertson forced their way out of the freezer and fled through the back door.\r\nAtkins and Robertson flagged down a former high school classmate, Ricky Galliard, and asked for a ride to Conway.Â  Galliard took Atkins and Robertson to Atkinsâ€™ home.Â  Atkins then called his mother and told her about the armed gunman at the restaurant.Â  At that point in time Atkins thought that his coworkers were just holding up the restaurant.Â  Atkins and his mother went back to the restaurant to see if Williams and Walker were alright.\r\nUpon arriving at the restaurant, Atkins discovered that Williams and Walker had been shot and killed.Â  The police arrived, and Atkins told the police that a masked gunman robbed the restaurant.Â  Atkins did not initially indicate he knew the robbers.Â  Atkins was already on probation for gun charges and did not implicate Appellant that night because he did not want the police to suspect that he had any connection with the events that took place at the restaurant.\r\nWhen investigating the scene, the police discovered that $837 had been stolen from the restaurant.Â  The police also discovered nine-millimeter shell casings and live nine-millimeter ammunition.Â  The crime scene investigator testified the shootings were done â€œexecutionâ€ style.\r\nAppellant and Howard were seen at the Nuttinâ€™ Butt Horseplay strip club again between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., after having left the club for about an hour.Â  Appellantâ€™s girlfriend testified that Appellant returned home between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. to replace the case on the shelf in the closet.Â  Appellant then left.\r\nAt approximately 2 a.m. the next morning, a police officer saw Howard and Appellant run a stop sign in Lake City.Â  The officer attempted to pull them over.Â  Howard, who was driving, would not stop. Howard jumped from the car while it was still moving.Â  While attempting to drive the car from the passenger seat, Appellant ran the car into a mobile home.Â  When Appellant was arrested, he had $322.65 in his possession.Â  While in custody, Appellant called his girlfriend to ask her to get rid of his clothes and asked if she found the money he left in her purse.\r\nThe day after the killings, Atkins and Robertson admitted to the police they actually saw Appellant and Howard rob the restaurant.Â  This prompted the police to search Appellantâ€™s home.Â  At his home, the police discovered a nine-millimeter round on the shelf in the bedroom closet.Â  Later another box of nine-millimeter ammunition was found.\r\nFurther, the investigation led police to Kevin Cochran, who owned the case that Appellant stored in his closet.Â  At some point before the police searched the house, Cochran came back to Appellantâ€™s house and retrieved the case, which contained a nine-millimeter semi-automatic pistol.Â  Cochran gave the case to the police once he learned the weapon might have been used in the killings.\r\nBallistic analysis revealed that the bullets that killed Williams and Walker were fired from the nine-millimeter Cochran gave to the police.Â  In addition, the ammunition in Appellantâ€™s closet was the same as the ammunition and shell casings at the crime scene.Â  \r\nAfter a jury trial, Appellant was convicted on all counts in the indictment.Â  Appellant was sentenced to death, thirty years for each count of kidnapping, thirty years for armed robbery, and five years for conspiracy.Â  This appeal followed and Appellant now raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial judge err in refusing to grant a mistrial following the solicitorâ€™s closing argument?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Did the trial judge err\r\n          in failing to charge the jury with the statutory mitigators related to\r\n          intoxication?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing Argument\r\nAppellant argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant a mistrial following the solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999).Â  A mistrial should be ordered only when an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect cannot be removed.Â  Id.Â  The test for granting a new trial based on an improper closing argument is whether the defendant was prejudiced to the extent that he was denied a fair trial.Â  State v. Brisbon, 323 S.C. 324, 332, 474 S.E.2d 433, 438 (1996) (citing State v. Durden, 264 S.C. 86, 93, 212 S.E.2d 587, 591 (1975)).Â  An instruction is deemed to have cured an error unless, on the facts of the particular case, it is probable that notwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced.Â  State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 89-90, 512 S.E.2d 795, 801 (1999).\r\nIn the present case, in his closing argument, the solicitor encouraged the jury to impose the death penalty because Appellant might escape and kill the witnesses on the stateâ€™s witness list, which the solicitor referred to as a â€œhit list.â€Â  Counsel for Appellant objected to the closing remarks that referred to a threat of escape and a â€œhit list.â€[3]Â  As a result, the judge issued a curative instruction that directed the jurors to disregard those comments and to be assured that no threat of escape or any â€œhit listâ€ existed.Â  The judgeâ€™s instruction was as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst of all that is there was some argument in the closing by the Solicitor regarding an escape, and let me let you know that that is improper.Â  There is no evidence of any escape nor is there any indication that this Defendant has ever attempted any escape while incarcerated.Â  That is not for your consideration. Â Please also know that thereâ€™s no indication that the prisons cannot hold this Defendant.Â  So, any of that argument is not in the record and not for your consideration.Â  Let me make that very clear.\r\nAlso, there was some indication of a witness list being or possibly being used as a hit list.Â  Again, this is improper.Â  There is no evidence of any attempt by this Defendant to contact any witnesses, to threaten any witness, to do anything.Â  So, it would be wrong for you and Iâ€™m directing you now to not consider and it would be proper for you not to consider.Â  It would be wrong for you to consider any evidence of escape and anything in regard to any alleged hit list.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the curative instruction removed any prejudice because it made clear that the jury was not to consider the argument made by the solicitor related to escape and the existence of a â€œhit list.â€Â  This instruction removed any prejudice that might have been suffered and afforded Appellant a fair trial.\r\nTherefore, we hold that trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial in light of the its curative instruction. \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intoxication\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury with the statutory mitigators related to intoxication because Appellant presented evidence that he drank on the night of the murders.[4]Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge must submit for the jury's consideration any statutory mitigating circumstances supported by the evidence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) (2003).Â  The trial judge must make an initial determination of which statutory mitigating circumstances have evidentiary support and then allow the defendant to request any additional statutory mitigating circumstances supported in the record.Â  State v. Victor, 300 S.C. 220, 224, 387 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1989).Â  Absent a request by counsel to charge the mitigating circumstances, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  State v. Humphries, 325 S.C. 28, 36, 479 S.E.2d 52, 57 (1996).Â  However, when there is evidence that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, the trial judge is required to submit the mitigating circumstances in Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7).Â  See State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 449, 567 S.E.2d 244, 248 (2002) (holding the judge is required to submit the mitigating circumstances if there is evidence of intoxication regardless of whether they are requested).\r\nIn the present case, the evidence before the court was that Appellant had drinks at a strip club before returning to the restaurant.[5]Â  Appellant presented no evidence that he was intoxicated.Â  The evidence indicated that Appellant may have had drinks, but this is not enough to warrant a charge to the jury for the mitigating factors outlined in Â§16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7).Â  See e.g. State v. Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 429-30, 361 S.E.2d 329, 337 (1987) (holding that even though drinking was admitted, there was no evidence that the defendant was intoxicated at the time the crime was committed).Â  Therefore, we hold that the decision of the trial judge to not charge the jury on the mitigating circumstances relating to intoxication was correct.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Kidnapping Convictions\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in sentencing him for the kidnapping of the murder victims.[6]Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, when a defendant is convicted for murder any sentence for the kidnapping of the victim would be vacated.Â  See Owens v. State, 331 S.C. 582, 585, 503 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1998) (holding that a sentence for kidnapping should be vacated when the defendant received concurrent sentence under the murder statute).\r\nIn the present case, Appellant was convicted and sentenced on two counts of kidnapping for the murder victims.Â  We hold that the judged erred in sentencing Appellant for the kidnapping of the murder victims.Â  However, the sentences related to the kidnapping of Atkins and Robertson are proper under S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-910 (2003).\r\nAs a result the sentences for kidnapping related to the murder victims, Williams and Walker, are vacated.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nProportionality Review\r\nAs required, we conduct a proportionality review of Appellantâ€™s death sentence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  The United States Constitution prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when it is either excessive or disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 590, 300 S.E.2d 63, 74 (1982).Â  In conducting a proportionality review, we search for similar cases in which the death sentence has been upheld.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-25(E) (2003).\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of prior cases shows the death sentence in this case is proportionate to that in similar cases and is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the crime.Â  See State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 29, 596 S.E.2d 475, 482 (2004) (holding that the death penalty was warranted for defendant that returned to his former workplace and shot and killed former co-workers during the commission of a violent crime); State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003) (holding that the death penalty was warranted for defendant convicted of murders of former live-in lover, loverâ€™s thirteen year-old daughter, and loverâ€™s mother; aggravating circumstances included two or more persons were murdered pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, and murder was committed during commission of burglary). \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we AFFIRM the convictions and sentences for murder and two counts of kidnapping, and VACATE the sentences for the two counts of kidnapping with regard to the murder victims.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Howard previously worked at the restaurant and knew most of the staff.\r\n[2] The restaurant ordinarily closed at 9 p.m., but Williams wanted to close early that night because it was his last night at the restaurant.\r\n[3] The solicitor made other statements in his argument to the jury that referred to Appellant as a domestic terrorist.Â  In addition, the solicitor made statements that drew a correlation between the events of September 11, 2001 and the events in the present case.Â  However, these comments were not objected to.Â  Further, Appellant in his statement to the jury made reference to viewing the juror list used in voir dire.Â  The court in its curative instruction did not address the Appellantâ€™s viewing of this list.Â  While we find the solicitorâ€™s closing comments to be troublesome, we find they are not preserved for review; however, this issue may be proper for review in post conviction relief.\r\n[4] Specifically, Appellant contends the judge erred in not charging S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7) (2003).\r\n[5] In addition, in his brief, counsel for Appellant refers to dialogue with Atkins about â€œgetting some,â€ and argues that this testimony suggests they were smoking marijuana.Â  Counsel also refers to the observation of the weak handshake Atkins received as evidence that Appellant was intoxicated.Â  However, this conversation is in reference to Mike Howard, not the Appellant.Â  As a result, there is no evidence in the record that Appellant was intoxicated.\r\n[6] The prosecution conceded prior to oral argument that the kidnapping sentences related to the murder victims were improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
