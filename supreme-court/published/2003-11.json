Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and\r\nBarbara M. Seymour, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for The \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nHarold Chandler, of Surfside Beach, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   This attorney disciplinary matter consolidates multiple \r\n  matters.  After a hearing, the Panel recommended Respondent be disbarred.  We \r\n  agree with the Panel, and disbar the Respondent from the practice of law in \r\n  this State.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent was placed on interim suspension on July 17, 2002, and formal charges \r\n  were filed in these matters on November 22, 2002.  Respondent did not file an \r\n  Answer, and was held in default by the subpanel of the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conduct.  Pursuant to the Default Order, the factual allegations in the Formal \r\n  Charges are deemed admitted by Respondent.  Rule 24(a), Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement (RLDE).  Respondent did not appear at the Panel hearing.  Respondent \r\n  did not appear, nor was he represented, at the argument in front of this Court.  \r\n   \r\nFACTS\r\nThe following matters involving \r\n  misconduct are before this Court:\r\nA.      The Smith Matter\r\nRespondentâ€™s firm was hired to conduct a real estate closing for \r\n  Smith.  Respondent was responsible for the closing, but an associate covered \r\n  the closing for Respondent.  The associate did not complete the closing because \r\n  additional liens were recorded the day of the closing.  Smith paid Respondentâ€™s \r\n  firm $934.92 for fees and costs associated with the closing.  The check was \r\n  placed in a file, and Respondent took no further action. Smith contacted Respondentâ€™s \r\n  office multiple times, but Respondent did not return Smithâ€™s calls.  Smith filed \r\n  a grievance.  Respondent returned the money after receiving notice of the grievance.  \r\n\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping \r\n  of Property); Rule 5.1 (Responsibilities of a Partner or Supervisory Lawyer); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e)(Misconduct-Prejudice to the Administration of Justice). The subpanel \r\n  found Respondent violated these rules in that he failed to complete the closing, \r\n  failed to inform Smith the closing would not be completed, and failed to timely \r\n  return Smithâ€™s funds. The subpanel also found that Respondent is subject to \r\n  discipline pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6) of RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.  \r\nB.      The Doe Estate Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to represent the estate of Doe.  Respondent \r\n  failed to respond to reasonable inquiries and requests for documentation from \r\n  the personal representative (PR) and beneficiaries.  The estate was administratively \r\n  closed by the Probate Court, and Respondent failed to inform the PR or beneficiaries.  \r\n  Respondent reopened the estate and promised to pay the beneficiaries any losses \r\n  or expenses resulting from his lack of diligence.  \r\nRespondentâ€™s law firm was dissolved and Respondent opened a solo \r\n  practice.  Respondent failed to inform the PR or beneficiaries of his new address \r\n  and phone number. Four months later, Respondent closed his practice without \r\n  notifying the parties.  The loss in value of the assets of the estate is estimated \r\n  at $300,000 due to a downturn in the stock market during Respondentâ€™s delay.  \r\n\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees); \r\n  Rule 1.16 (Termination of Representation); Rule 3.2 (Expediting Litigation); \r\n  Rule 4.4 (Respect for Rights of Third Persons); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation \r\n  of Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice to \r\n  the Administration of Justice).\r\nC.      The Client A Matter\r\nThe seller retained Respondent to close on a property purchased by \r\n  Client A.  Respondent did not send the deed to Client A.  Client A called Respondent \r\n  multiple times, and Respondent assured Client A he would send it, however Respondent \r\n  did not.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule \r\n  1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees); and Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nD.      The Client B Matter\r\nRespondent entered into a real estate transaction with Client B and \r\n  represented himself, Client B, and the seller at the closing.  Respondent misappropriated \r\n  funds from his trust fund, and converted them to personal use in the transaction.  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s firm dissolved, and his partner, Mr. Patrick, had to deposit funds \r\n  to cover the deficit in the trust account.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest-General Rule); \r\n  Rule 1.8 (Conflict of Interest-Prohibited Transactions); Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping \r\n  of Property); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 8.4(b) (Misconduct-Commission of a Criminal Act); and Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation).  \r\nE.      The Company Matter\r\nRespondent was hired to form Company, LLC.  Respondent failed to \r\n  file the Articles of Organization, and therefore, Company, LLC, was never legally \r\n  formed. Respondent proceeded to handle closings on approximately 44 properties, \r\n  naming Company, LLC as the seller, even though the LLC did not exist.  Also, \r\n  Respondent was aware of outstanding liens on the property and failed to inform \r\n  the parties of the outstanding liens.  Respondent also issued title commitments \r\n  on 23 units, but failed to issue title policies to the purchasers.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent \r\n  violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); \r\n  Rule 1.5 (Fees); Rule 4.4 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice \r\n  to the Administration of Justice).\r\nF.      The Builder Matter\r\nRespondent represented both the seller and buyer in a closing on \r\n  12 lots.  Respondent was informed both before and after the closings that there \r\n  were outstanding judgments and tax liens encumbering the property. Respondent \r\n  continued with the closing and did not inform the purchasers or the lenders \r\n  of the encumbrances.  Respondent instructed his assistant to record the deed, \r\n  even though encumbrances existed.  Respondent closed several other properties \r\n  for Builder in a similar fashion.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.5 (Fees); Rule 1.7 (Conflict of \r\n  Interest-General Rule); Rule 4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others); Rule \r\n  5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation \r\n  of Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving \r\n  Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation).\r\nG.      The Sweetwater Matter\r\nRespondent was ordered by the court to file an accounting of all \r\n  the money held in escrow as a result of closings of units at Sweetwater development, \r\n  which pertained to a civil matter.  Respondent failed to file the accounting, \r\n  and failed to inform the court when his partnership dissolved and he opened \r\n  his own office. \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 3.2 (Expediting \r\n  Litigation); Rule 3.3 (Candor to the Tribunal); Rule 3.4 (Fairness to Opposing \r\n  Party and Counsel); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice to the Administration of Justice).\r\nH.      The Conservatorship Matter\r\nRespondent represented a Georgia resident, Client C, who was serving \r\n  as conservator for her husband.  Client C and her husband owned property in \r\n  South Carolina, which Client C was trying to sell.  Respondent was to open an \r\n  ancillary conservatorship estate for Client C in South Carolina by filing the \r\n  Georgia conservatorship papers with the Horry County Probate Court.  Respondent \r\n  failed to file the papers, but proceeded with the closing.  Due to Respondentâ€™s \r\n  omission, Client C did not convey marketable title to the purchasers.  Respondent \r\n  also represented the purchasers in the closing.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent \r\n  violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); \r\n  Rule 1.5 (Fees); Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest);  Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation \r\n  of Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving \r\n  Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation).\r\nI.       The Title Insurance Matter\r\nRespondent represented both seller and purchaser in a real estate \r\n  closing.  The property was encumbered by a mortgage, but Respondent failed to \r\n  inform the purchasers, lender, or title insurance company of the encumbrance.  \r\n  The purchasers requested and paid for a title insurance policy, but Respondent \r\n  failed to issue the policy.  The purchasers hired a different attorney, Mr. \r\n  Barnett, after being served with a foreclosure action for the property.  Respondent \r\n  informed Mr. Barnett that Respondent had issued a title insurance policy to \r\n  the purchasers, even though he had not.  The title insurance company ultimately \r\n  assumed representation of the purchasers, and Respondent assured Mr. Barnett \r\n  that he would pay Mr. Barnettâ€™s fees and costs.  Respondent failed to do so.  \r\n  Respondent misrepresented to his partner, Mr. Patrick, that he had paid Mr. \r\n  Barnett. Mr. Patrick paid Mr. Barnett $1,200 on Respondentâ€™s behalf and Respondent \r\n  has not repaid Mr. Patrick.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees);  \r\n  Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest);  Rule 4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others);  \r\n  Rule 4.4 (Respect for Rights of Third Persons); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation \r\n  of Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving \r\n  Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice \r\n  to the Administration of Justice).  \r\nJ.       The Client D Matter\r\nClient D paid Respondent in full for fees and costs to organize a \r\n  number of LLCs.  Respondent did not file any Articles of Organization.  Upon \r\n  dissolution of Respondentâ€™s firm, Respondent failed to take Client Dâ€™s file \r\n  with him to complete the job.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees);  \r\n  Rule 1.16 (Termination of Representation); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation \r\n  of Rules of Professional Conduct);  and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice to \r\n  the Administration of Justice).  \r\nK.      Client E Matter\r\nClient E retained Respondent to represent her in a personal injury \r\n  suit. Respondent filed a summons and complaint for Client E, but service was \r\n  never perfected. Respondent falsely stated to Client E that he received a settlement \r\n  check in her case for $42,000.  The insurance company associated with the lawsuit \r\n  has filed liquidation proceedings. Respondent had the lawsuit dismissed stating \r\n  the case had been settled.  The statute of limitations on Client Eâ€™s claim has \r\n  expired.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  Rule 1.4 (Communication);  Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct);  Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice \r\n  to the Administration of Justice).  \r\nL.      Client F Matter\r\nClient Eâ€™s daughter, Client F, also retained Respondent for a personal \r\n  injury claim arising out of the same incident.  Respondent issued a check from \r\n  his firmâ€™s operating account to the trust account, then issued a check in the \r\n  same amount to Client E on behalf of her daughter.  Respondent told Client E \r\n  and Client F that the funds were proceeds from a settlement.  This information \r\n  was false.  Respondent did not file a lawsuit on behalf of Client F, and the \r\n  statute of limitations has expired.  Respondent misrepresented to the firmâ€™s \r\n  office manager that the funds were an advance to the clients to pay for a trip.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent \r\n  violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  \r\n  Rule 1.4 (Communication);  Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct);  and Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving Dishonesty, Deceit \r\n  and Misrepresentation).\r\nM.     The Misappropriation of Law Firm Funds Matter\r\nAfter Respondent dissolved the partnership with Mr. Patrick, Respondent \r\n  took approximately $100,000 from the firmâ€™s operating account and the title \r\n  insurance account, which he was not authorized to do.  Respondent made many \r\n  unauthorized disbursements to third parties from the operating account.  Respondent \r\n  was supposed to repay the amount, but later, removed an operating account check \r\n  from the office and negotiated it for $18,000.  Respondent denied any knowledge \r\n  of the transaction.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rule of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving \r\n  Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation).\r\nN.      Client G Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Client G.  Respondent failed \r\n  to appear for Client Gâ€™s trial.  Both Client G and the judgeâ€™s secretary made \r\n  unsuccessful attempts to locate and contact Respondent.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule \r\n  1.3 (Diligence);  Rule 1.16 (Termination of Representation);  Rule 3.2 (Expediting \r\n  Litigation); Rule 3.4 (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice \r\n  to the Administration of Justice).\r\nO.      Client H Matter\r\nClient H retained Respondent, and issued a check to Respondent for \r\n  $2,000 as a retainer fee.  Respondent negotiated the check, but did not put \r\n  it in his trust account.  Respondent met with Client H once, then failed to \r\n  communicate with her, or take any action on her behalf.  Respondent did not \r\n  inform Client H that he was closing his law office.  Respondent did not take \r\n  any steps to protect Client Hâ€™s interests upon termination of his representation \r\n  of her. Respondent did not refund the retainer fee to Client H.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  Rule 1.4 (Communication);  Rule 1.5 \r\n  (Fees);  Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property); Rule 1.16 (Termination of Representation); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct);  and Rule \r\n  8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation).\r\nP.      The Bankruptcy Matter\r\nRespondent represented \r\n  the estate of Ms. Roe.  Client J was the personal representative of the estate. \r\n  Client J filed bankruptcy in Florida.  The trustee in Florida contacted Respondent \r\n  multiple times, through letters and phone calls, asking Respondent to make any \r\n  disbursements meant for Client J to the trustee, as Client Jâ€™s inheritance was \r\n  an asset of the bankruptcy estate.  Respondent did not respond.  Two years after \r\n  Ms. Roeâ€™s death, Client J died.  Respondent assured the bankruptcy trustee that \r\n  the estate would be closing in four weeks, and the funds would be distributed \r\n  to the trustee.  The trustee did not receive a distribution.  A year later, \r\n  after multiple calls and letters from the trustee, Respondent finally contacted \r\n  the trustee and informed him that a distribution of $30,000 would be made to \r\n  the trustee within a few weeks.  No distribution was made. The trustee wrote \r\n  Respondent again. Respondent did not respond.  \r\nWhen Respondent left his firm \r\n  to open a solo practice, he did not inform the trustee.  When Respondent closed \r\n  his solo practice, he failed to inform the trustee. Respondentâ€™s former law \r\n  partner discovered $30,000 that was deposited into the trust account from the \r\n  estate.  Respondent requested the office manager wire transfer $16,000 to the \r\n  trustee, however, Respondent altered the recipient and had the money transferred \r\n  to another client.  The funds did not belong to the client, and no funds were \r\n  ever distributed to the trustee. \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence);  Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  \r\n  Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property); Rule 1.16 (Termination of Representation);  \r\n  Rule 3.2 (Expediting Litigation);  Rule 3.3 (Candor to the Tribunal);  Rule \r\n  4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others);  Rule 5.1 (Responsibilities of a \r\n  Partner or Supervisory Lawyer); Rule 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer \r\n  Assistants); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct);  \r\n  Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice to the Administration of Justice).  \r\nQ.      Client K Matter\r\nRespondent represented \r\n  Client K in a real estate closing.  Client K signed over to Respondent a check \r\n  for $170,000, proceeds from the sale of Client Kâ€™s home, as well as an additional \r\n  $38,000.  Respondent was to place the funds in an interest bearing account and \r\n  draw funds on the account to pay the contractor who was building Client Kâ€™s \r\n  home.  Respondent closed his law office with no notice to Client K.  Respondent \r\n  did not pay the real estate agent, nor the contractor.  Respondent did open \r\n  an account on behalf of Client K, but only placed one dollar in the account.  \r\n  Respondent misappropriated and commingled Client Kâ€™s money.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property);  Rule \r\n  8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct);  Rule 8.4(b) \r\n  (Misconduct-Committing a Criminal Act); Rule 8.4(c) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving \r\n  Moral Turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct Involving Dishonesty, Deceit \r\n  and Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice to the Administration \r\n  of Justice).  \r\nR.      The Estate of R Matter\r\nRespondent represented the Estate of R. Respondent failed to competently \r\n  pursue legal matters on behalf of the estate. Respondent did not return phone \r\n  calls to the PR.  After Respondent closed the law practice with his partner, \r\n  he failed to notify the PR.  After Respondent closed his solo practice, he failed \r\n  to notify the PR.  Respondent did not comply with repeated attempts of his former \r\n  partner to obtain the file from Respondent.  Respondent was placed on interim \r\n  suspension and failed to notify the PR or the Probate Court of his suspension.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence);  Rule 1.4 (Communication);  Rule 1.15 \r\n  (Safekeeping of Property); Rule 1.16 (Termination of Representation); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct);  and Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Deceit and Misrepresentation).\r\nS.      Failure to Cooperate with Disciplinary Authorities\r\nRespondent did not respond to inquiries from the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel (ODC).  Respondent did have some contact, early in the proceedings, \r\n  with the ODC, but failed to keep scheduled appointments and did not respond \r\n  to the Notices of Full Investigation or Notices to Appear.  \r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rule of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.1(b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary \r\n  Matters).  \r\nRespondent did not present any evidence of mitigation.  Respondent \r\n  did assert he was suffering from depression and seeking treatment, however Respondent \r\n  did not appear at meetings with ODC scheduled for the purpose of discussing \r\n  his mental condition.  The subpanel found no evidence that would support a finding \r\n  of depression that would mitigate Respondentâ€™s conduct in this matter.\r\nThe subpanel recommended that Respondent be disbarred based upon \r\n  the egregious nature of the misconduct; the significant financial losses to \r\n  Respondentâ€™s clients, former law partner and other parties; the pattern of misconduct; \r\n  the failure of Respondent to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation; \r\n  and the failure of Respondent to appear at the hearing.  As authority for its \r\n  recommendation, ODC cites to In the Matter of Morris, 343 S.C. 651, 541 \r\n  S.E.2d 844 (2001); In the Matter of Murph, 350 S.C. 1, 564 S.E.2d 673 \r\n  (2002); In the Matter of Purvis, 347 S.C. 605, 557 S.E.2d 651 (2001) \r\n  and In the Matter of Murdaugh, 342 S.C. 59, 536 S.E.2d 370 (2000).  The \r\n  subpanel also recommended that the opinion disciplining Respondent include a \r\n  provision that Respondent is not to be reinstated or readmitted until he has \r\n  compensated all persons or entities who have suffered financial losses as a \r\n  result of Respondentâ€™s misconduct, including but not limited to Respondentâ€™s \r\n  clients, his former partner, the title insurance company, and the Lawyerâ€™s Fund \r\n  for Client Protection.\r\nThe subpanel also recommended that Respondent be assessed the costs \r\n  of these proceedings pursuant to Rule 7(b)(8), RLDE.  The costs incurred were \r\n  $271.45.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which discipline \r\n  is given rests entirely with the Supreme Court.  In re Long, 346 S.C. \r\n  110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).  The Court may make its own findings of fact and \r\n  conclusions of law, and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation.  In re \r\n  Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).  The Court must administer \r\n  the sanction it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.  Id.  \r\n\r\nWe disbar Respondent from the practice of law in this state.  Within thirty \r\n  days of the date of this opinion, Disciplinary Counsel and Respondent shall \r\n  establish a restitution schedule pursuant to which Respondent shall make restitution \r\n  to all persons and entities who have suffered financial losses as a result of \r\n  Respondentâ€™s misconduct, including but not limited to Respondentâ€™s clients, \r\n  his former partner, the title insurance company, and the Lawyerâ€™s Fund for Client \r\n  Protection.

Seymour, of Columbia, for The Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel. \r\nMarvin Daniel Iseman, of Eastover, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Marvin Daniel Iseman (â€œRespondentâ€) \r\n  has taken exception to the Subpanel of the Commission on Lawyer Conductâ€™s (â€œSubpanelâ€) \r\n  recommendation that he be disbarred and required to pay the costs of these proceedings.       \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis attorney discipline \r\n  matter arises from Respondentâ€™s conduct involving two separate events: (1) a \r\n  series of money leasing transactions and (2) bank fraud.  \r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; â€œMoney Leasingâ€ Transaction\r\nEvidently deft at putting together convoluted international \r\n  business transactions that circumvent tax laws and involve large amounts of \r\n  risk, Respondent was hired by a Kentucky law firm in late 1996 to scrutinize \r\n  the structure of a business deal originating in London.  According to Respondent, \r\n  the deal was a â€œmoney leasingâ€ transaction that involved raising $3 to $5 million \r\n  in cash to â€œleaseâ€ $40 million in cash from a Mexican bank, which would be exchanged \r\n  for a â€œGerman Bank Guaranteeâ€ and not constitute a taxable event.  Respondent \r\n  came in contact with Volker Schneider (â€œSchneiderâ€), who invested $480,000 into \r\n  the deal in February 1997.  According to Respondent, Schneider told him that \r\n  coming up with the rest of the $3 to $5 million needed to â€œleaseâ€ the $40 million \r\n  would not be a problem.  But then in late May 1997, Schneider informed Respondent \r\n  that he could not raise the balance of the capital needed for the investment.  \r\n  Respondent alleges that he raised the rest of the seed money elsewhere.      \r\nThe $480,000 that Schneider transferred \r\n  to Respondent originally came from Mathias Heizmann (â€œHeizmannâ€), who had decided \r\n  to invest a large portion of his familyâ€™s savings with a Rudolf Wehrli (â€œWehrliâ€).  \r\n  Heizmann discovered Wehrli in a local German newspaper advertisement, where \r\n  he claimed to be a â€œprofessional financial advisor and broker.â€  Wehrli gave \r\n  the sum of money to Schneider for investment purposes only to discover later \r\n  that the money had been â€œlost.â€  Wehrli hired Hans Neuhauser, an attorney with \r\n  an anti-fraud practice, to attempt to recover the large sum.     \r\nRespondent was in Zurich in September 1997, when \r\n  he was approached by Neuhauser, who explained to Respondent about the origin \r\n  of the $480,000.  Neuhauser wanted the money returned to Heizmann.  Respondent \r\n  confirmed with Schneider the existence of a â€œMr. Wehrli,â€ returned to the United \r\n  States, and decided to write Neuhauser a letter offering to return the $480,000 \r\n  in exchange for a release and indemnity from Mr. Wehrli. [1]   \r\nOn September 30, 1997, \r\n  Respondent and Neuhauser executed a Comprehensive Release, which provided that \r\n  in exchange for Respondentâ€™s payment of $500,000, Respondent would be released \r\n  from any claim asserted by Wehrli.  Respondent postdated the $500,000 check \r\n  for October 3, 1997, so that he could give himself a little â€œcontingent time.â€  \r\n  Respondent also told Neuhauser that if he did not want to proceed with the agreement,  \r\n  he would issue a Stop Payment Order on the check.  Respondent further stated \r\n  that he did not believe that Neuhauser was aware of how the stop payment process \r\n  functioned in the United States.  In his Answer to the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conductâ€™s Filing of Formal Charges, Respondent wrote, â€œin truth, I think I simply \r\n  wanted to get rid of Neuhauser as diplomatically as possible knowing I could \r\n  either go forward with the Release or NOT, based upon Schneiderâ€™s or my own \r\n  opinion.â€  After discussing the matter with Schneider, who reiterated that he \r\n  did not want to back out of the deal, Respondent issued a Stop Payment Order \r\n  for the check.  \r\nUnable to collect any of his $480,000, Heizmann \r\n  hired a local attorney and filed a civil action in federal court here in South \r\n  Carolina for breach of contract.  In his Answer, Respondent generally denied \r\n  all claims, and he did not reply to Heizmannâ€™s requests for admissions or motion \r\n  for summary judgment.  Consequently, Heizmann was awarded summary judgment against \r\n  Respondent in the amount of $500,000 plus interest, and Respondent did not appeal \r\n  the judgment.  \r\nThe Subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s conduct in \r\n  connection with his signing of the Comprehensive Release, coupled with his Stop \r\n  Payment Order, constituted a violation of Rule 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.  We agree.  \r\nRule 8.4(d) states that it is misconduct for a \r\n  lawyer to engage in fraudulent, dishonest, and deceitful conduct.  By his own \r\n  admission, Respondent exhibited this type of misconduct because he never intended \r\n  to perform his obligation under the Comprehensive Release, i.e., pay the $500,000.  \r\n\r\nBetween September 22, 1997 (the date that Respondent \r\n  faxed Neuhauser the letter requesting the indemnification) and September 30, \r\n  1997 (the date the Comprehensive Release was signed) Respondent spoke with Schneider, \r\n  and Schneider stated that he would stay in the deal and â€œwould not comply \r\n  with [Respondentâ€™s] Sept. 22 letter to Neuhauser.â€ \r\n  [2]   Knowing that the party who originally gave him $480,000 did not want \r\n  him to remit the money to Wehrli, Respondent executed the agreement and post-dated \r\n  the check to give himself some â€œcontingent time.â€  And believing that Neuhauser \r\n  did not understand how the stop payment process functioned in the U.S., Respondent \r\n  told Neuhauser that he could issue a Stop Payment Order if he wanted to get \r\n  out of the deal. [3]   Respondent then talked with Schneider and issued the Stop \r\n  Payment Order.  \r\nRespondent essentially \r\n  admits that Schneider maintained his position - that he wanted the deal to go \r\n  through and that he did not want Respondent to sign the Comprehensive Release \r\n  - throughout the transaction.  We find that Respondent had no intention other \r\n  than to decieve Neuhauser into thinking that the money would be returned to \r\n  his client.  Respondent could not have revealed his intent more lucidly than \r\n  when he wrote, â€œ[I]n truth, I think I simply wanted to get rid of Neuhauser \r\n  as diplomatically as possible.â€  Thus, we hold that Respondent violated Rule \r\n  8.4(d).  \r\nB. Bank Fraud\r\nRespondent was indicted \r\n  by the Grand Jury of the U.S. District Court of South Carolina on March 22, \r\n  2000, for five counts of wire fraud in connection with the Schneider/Wehrli/Heizmann \r\n  scheme and three counts of bank fraud arising from an unrelated check-kiting \r\n  scheme that occurred between August 1998 and December 1999.  The U.S. government \r\n  extradited Respondent in April 2000 from a Swiss prison, where he had been incarcerated \r\n  in connection with the Heizmann affair.           \r\nIn August 2000, Respondent entered \r\n  into a Plea Agreement and agreed to plead guilty to Count 8, which claimed that \r\n  he engaged in a scheme to defraud and obtain money by false pretenses from Bank \r\n  of America by presenting a check for deposit and cash drawn on another account \r\n  at First Union, an account that he knew contained insufficient funds.  The judge \r\n  sentenced Respondent to twelve months in prison and ordered him to pay $116,220.38 \r\n  in restitution.  \r\nAccording to Rule 16(d) of the \r\n  Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, (RLDE), Rule 413 SCACR, â€œ[a] \r\n  certified copy of a judgment of conviction constitutes conclusive evidence that \r\n  the lawyer committed the crime, and the sole issue in any disciplinary proceedings \r\n  based on the conviction shall be the nature and extent of the discipline imposed.â€  \r\n  Respondent pled guilty to bank fraud, which is classified as a serious offense \r\n  under Rule 2(z) of the RLDE.  In the Matter of Holt, 328 S.C. 169, 492 \r\n  S.E.2d 793 (1997).  The Subpanel found that in committing bank fraud, Respondent \r\n  violated Rules 8.4(b), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(e) of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.  \r\nC. \r\n  The Hearing\r\nRespondent takes exception \r\n  to the Subpanelâ€™s denial of his motion for a new hearing.  After being released \r\n  from prison in January 2000, Respondent resided at Caughman Farms in Eastover, \r\n  South Carolina.  His initial hearing in front of the Subpanel was scheduled \r\n  for June 13, 2000.  Respondent originally told Barbara Hinson (â€œHinsonâ€), Administrative \r\n  Assistant for the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, that the scheduled date was \r\n  â€œfineâ€ with him.  Three days prior to the hearing, Respondent called Hinson \r\n  to inform her that his brother-in-law would be representing him at the hearing \r\n  but that his brother-in-law would be out of the country on that date.  Respondent \r\n  requested a continuance, which was granted.      On June 14, Hinson sent a certified \r\n  notice to Respondent at his Eastover address, which stated that the hearing \r\n  had been rescheduled for July 9.  She received the return receipt of the certified \r\n  mailing on June 19, which was signed, but not by Respondent.  Respondent claims \r\n  that he never received the notice of the rescheduled hearing, and Edward Caughman \r\n  attested to the claim in a sworn affidavit.  \r\nRespondent did not \r\n  appear at the July 9 hearing, as he was in New York between June 23 and July \r\n  20, and the hearing proceeded without him.  Respondent made a motion for a new \r\n  hearing, which the Subpanel denied.  \r\nWe hold that the Subpanel did \r\n  not err in denying Respondentâ€™s motion for a new hearing because service was \r\n  proper under Rule 233(b) SCACR (setting forth the proper service requirements \r\n  in attorney discipline matters), and the Commission received the return receipt \r\n  on June 19, which was four days prior to Respondentâ€™s departure to New York \r\n  on June 23.  Further, we agree with the Subpanel that Respondent had every reason \r\n  to believe that the hearing would be promptly rescheduled after the June 13 \r\n  hearing was continued.  \r\nD.  \r\n  Sanction\r\nThis Court holds the \r\n  ultimate authority to sanction attorneys, and we are not bound by the Subpanelâ€™s \r\n  findings.  In the Matter of Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 165, 488 S.E.2d \r\n  871, 873 (1997).  Nevertheless, we agree with the Subpanelâ€™s recommendation \r\n  that Respondent should be disbarred because of his bank fraud conviction and \r\n  his involvement in the defrauding of Mr. Heizmann.\r\nIn Holt, we determined \r\n  that bank fraud, by itself, constitutes sufficient grounds for disbarment.  \r\n  See also, In the Matter of Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 584 S.E.2d 369 \r\n  (2003) (a guilty plea of bank fraud constituted the primary justification for \r\n  disbarment); In the Matter of Yarborough, 343 S.C. 316, 540 S.E.2d 462 \r\n  (2000) (involvement in a check-kiting scheme, committing bank fraud, and using \r\n  escrow funds to pay a margin call warranted disbarment).  \r\nAlthough Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conviction of bank fraud alone is sufficient grounds for disbarment, his violation \r\n  of Rule 8.4(d) in connection with the Heizmann matter provides additional support \r\n  for the sanction of disbarment.  Finally, we note that Respondentâ€™s prior disciplinary \r\n  history exhibits a tendency to engage in lawyer misconduct involving deceit.  \r\n  See In the Matter of Iseman, 287 S.C. 194, 336 S.E.2d 474 (1985) (Respondent \r\n  was issued a public reprimand for failing to preserve the identity of funds \r\n  and property of a client; thus violating DR 1-102(A)(4), which is the present-day \r\n  Rule 8.4(d).); In the Matter of Iseman, 290 S.C. 391, 350 S.E.2d 922 \r\n  (1986) (Respondent was suspended for 90 days because he misrepresented the amount \r\n  of Continuing Legal Education credits he had earned.). \r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, we disbar \r\n  Respondent.  Within fifteen days of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, of \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the \r\n  Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.  We also require that Respondent pay \r\n  the costs of these proceedings.   \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, \r\n  WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Wehrli assigned all of his claims against Respondent \r\n    to Heizmann.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Respondent sent a copy of the September 22 letter \r\n    to Schneider.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  No section of the Comprehensive Release indicated \r\n    that the agreement was contingent on Respondentâ€™s decision to request a Stop \r\n    Payment Order.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25745","title":"State v.

Burton, 349 S.C. 430, 562 S.E.2d 668 (Ct. App. 2002), [1]  and further directed the parties to brief whether pointing \r\n  and presenting a firearm is a lesser included offense of assault with intent \r\n  to kill.  We vacate Burtonâ€™s conviction of pointing and presenting a firearm \r\n  because it is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill.  \r\n  Also, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling that the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to direct a verdict on Burtonâ€™s charges due to a search and seizure \r\n  violation.  That issue was not properly preserved for review.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.  Is pointing and presenting \r\n  a firearm a lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill so that the \r\n  circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to try or convict Burton of that \r\n  offense?\r\nII.  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the trial judge erred in \r\n  failing to direct verdicts because of a Fourth Amendment violation?\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 1998, the Chief of Police for Laurens County asked six officers to \r\n  serve outstanding warrants.  Officer Tracey Burke explained that the officers \r\n  printed out a sheet of the names of people with outstanding warrants, and said, \r\n  â€œif we run into somebody we donâ€™t know, and we ask, then weâ€™ll get their name \r\n  and weâ€™ll look through this piece of paperâ€¦so weâ€™ll know we have active warrants \r\n  on these persons.â€  \r\nThe officers went to the Green Street Mini-mart where several people were loitering \r\n  in the parking lot.  Burton was standing at a pay phone, with the receiver in \r\n  his left hand, and his right hand in his coat pocket.  Officer Burke [2]  asked Burton if he could see \r\n  Burtonâ€™s ID, but â€œ[Burton] wouldnâ€™t acknowledge nothing [Burke] told him at \r\n  first.â€  When Burton did not respond, the other officers came over to the pay \r\n  phone.  Officer Burke asked Burton, again, for some identification, but Burton \r\n  â€œnever said a word.â€  The officers asked Burton to remove his hand from his \r\n  coat pocket, but Burton still did not respond, and did not remove his hand.  \r\n\r\nOfficer Burke testified that because Burton would not acknowledge the officerâ€™s \r\n  questions, and would not remove his hand from his pocket, â€œa lot of things went \r\n  through [Officer Burkeâ€™s] mind.  It could have been maybe a beer or anything, \r\n  but my worse interpretation was it might have been a weapon.  So, after him \r\n  not acknowledging us or even saying anything, I was positioned behind [Burton]. \r\n  I reached my hand around behind him to see what was inside of his coat, because \r\n  at that point Iâ€™d done got worried.â€  Officer Burke reached his hand in Burtonâ€™s \r\n  pocket, and Burton began to struggle with the officer.  As Officer Burke and \r\n  Burton fell to the ground, Officer Burke heard another officer say â€œHeâ€™s got \r\n  a gun.â€ The other officers ran to assist Officer Burke, and during the struggle, \r\n  Burton raised his left side, pointed the gun at Officer Burke, and fired the \r\n  gun three or four times.  The gun did not discharge because a bullet was â€œstove-piped \r\n  in the barrel.â€ [3]   After Burton \r\n  was subdued on the ground and handcuffed, Burton spit blood on Officer Dealâ€™s \r\n  shoe.  \r\nBurton was indicted for two counts of assault while resisting arrest, and two \r\n  counts of assault with intent to kill.  Burton represented himself at trial.  \r\n  The trial judge granted a directed verdict as to assault with intent to kill \r\n  Officer Deal, which stemmed from Burton spitting on Dealâ€™s shoe.  Burton was \r\n  found guilty of resisting arrest as a lesser included offense of assault while \r\n  resisting arrest; pointing and presenting a firearm as a lesser included offense \r\n  of assault with intent to kill Officer Burke; and assault while resisting arrest.  \r\n  Burton was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for assault while resisting \r\n  arrest to run concurrently with his federal sentence, [4]  and two one-year concurrent sentences \r\n  for resisting arrest and pointing and presenting a firearm.  \r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Officer Burke did not have the \r\n  right to search Burtonâ€™s pocket for weapons, and therefore the search was improper.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court erred in not directing a \r\n  verdict on all charges.  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Pointing and Presenting a Firearm\r\nWe asked the parties \r\n  to brief whether pointing and presenting a firearm is a lesser included offense \r\n  of assault with intent to kill so that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict and sentence Burton for the offense.  We hold that pointing and presenting \r\n  a firearm is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill and \r\n  therefore the conviction must be vacated.\r\nIn a criminal case, the trial courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction is limited \r\n  to those crimes charged in the indictment and all lesser included offenses.  \r\n  State v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002).  An offense is \r\n  a lesser included offense of another if â€œthe greater of the two offenses includes \r\n  all the elements of the lesser offense.â€  State v. Elliott, 346 S.C. \r\n  603, 606, 552 S.E.2d 727, 728 (2001).  However, when an â€œoffense has traditionally \r\n  been considered a lesser included offense of the greater offense charged, [this \r\n  Court] will continue to construe it as a lesser included, despite the failure \r\n  to strictly satisfy the elements test.â€  Watson, 563 S.E.2d at 338.  \r\n\r\nThe elements of pointing and presenting a firearm are (1) pointing or presenting; \r\n  (2) a loaded or unloaded firearm; (3) at another.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 \r\n  (2003).  The elements of assault with intent to kill are â€œ(1) an unlawful attempt; \r\n  (2) to commit a violent injury; (3) to the person of another; (4) with malicious \r\n  intent; and (5) accompanied by the present ability to complete the act.â€ State \r\n  v. Walsh, 300 S.C. 427, 429, 388 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1988) (overruled on other \r\n  grounds).  In State v. Walsh, this Court applied the Blockburger \r\n  test and found that the offenses of pointing and presenting a firearm and assault \r\n  with intent to kill constituted separate and distinct offenses in a double jeopardy \r\n  case.  Walsh, 388 S.E.2d at 779.  \r\nAssault with intent to kill does not require the use of a firearm.  Therefore, \r\n  strict application of the elements test leads to the conclusion that pointing \r\n  and presenting a firearm is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent \r\n  to kill.  See e.g. Watson, 563 S.E.2d at 336 (Reckless \r\n  homicide requires operation of an automobile while murder does not.  Therefore, \r\n  under the strict elements test, reckless homicide is not a lesser included offense \r\n  of murder.)  Also, pointing and presenting a firearm has not traditionally been \r\n  considered a lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill.  Walsh, \r\n  388 S.E.2d at 779.  \r\nPointing and presenting \r\n  a firearm is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill. Therefore, \r\n  Burtonâ€™s conviction is vacated because the trial court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction.  \r\nII.  Preservation\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that Officer Burke conducted an illegal \r\n  search of Burtonâ€™s coat pocket, and therefore the trial court erred in not directing \r\n  a verdict on all charges against Burton.  We agree with the Court of Appeals \r\n  that the search and seizure of Burton was illegal and we look with disapproval \r\n  on the officersâ€™ conduct leading up to the seizure.  However, Burtonâ€™s argument \r\n  was not properly preserved as to any of the counts. The record reflects no attempt \r\n  by Burton, at trial, to suppress any evidence on constitutional grounds.  Instead, \r\n  Burton only raised the propriety of the police action in a motion for directed \r\n  verdict, after the evidence pertaining to the search and seizure had \r\n  been admitted without objection. [5] \r\n      \r\nBurton made motions for directed verdicts at the close \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s case.  The appropriate â€œvehicle for challenging the admissibility \r\n  of evidence based on a search and seizure violation is a motion to suppress.â€  \r\n  State v. Green, 350 S.C. 580, 567 S.E.2d 505 (Ct. App. 2002).  A motion \r\n  for directed verdict, on the other hand, challenges the sufficiency of the properly \r\n  admitted evidence.  Green, 567 S.E.2d at 505.   Burton did not make a \r\n  motion in limine nor did he timely move to suppress the evidence. [6]   See State v. Brannon, 347 S.C. \r\n  85, 552 S.E.2d 773 (Ct. App. 2001)(finding Fourth Amendment issue not preserved \r\n  when defendant failed to join in a motion to suppress).  â€œThe general rule is \r\n  that the failure to object to, or failure to move to strike, testimony renders \r\n  such competent and accordingly entitled to be considered to the extent it is \r\n  relevant.â€  State v. Frank, 262 S.C. 526, 205 S.E.2d 827 (1974).  Because \r\n  Burton did not object to the evidence when offered, it was properly admitted.  \r\n  This properly admitted evidence was sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict.  Burton did not preserve the argument for appellate review and the \r\n  Court of Appeals erred in reversing his convictions.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBurtonâ€™s conviction of pointing and presenting a firearm is VACATED because \r\n  it is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill.  Further, \r\n  we REVERSE the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to direct verdicts as to the remaining \r\n  convictions of assault while resisting arrest, and resisting arrest as a lesser \r\n  included offense of assault while resisting arrest, as Burtonâ€™s arguments were \r\n  not preserved for review.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Reginald I. Lloyd, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \r\n    Circuit vacated and remanded Burtonâ€™s federal conviction for unlawful possession \r\n    of a firearm by a felon, which arose from the same incident.  The court found \r\n    that the â€œofficerâ€™s search was not supported by a reasonable suspicion of \r\n    criminal activity and therefore constituted an illegal search.â€  United \r\n    States v. Burton, 228 F.3d 524, 526 (4th Cir. 2000).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Officer Burke was dressed in plain clothes, and \r\n    was wearing a bullet proof vest marked â€œPoliceâ€ over his clothes.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Officer Burke explained that the bullet was perpendicular \r\n    in the chamber, which prevented the gun from firing.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Burton was convicted in federal court of unlawful \r\n    possession of a firearm by a felon, stemming from the same incident, and was \r\n    sentenced to 115 months imprisonment.  The United States Court of Appeals \r\n    for the Fourth Circuit vacated Burtonâ€™s conviction for this charge because \r\n    of the illegal search and seizure.  See footnote 1, supra.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  We note that Burton was a pro se litigant.  A \r\n    pro se litigant who knowingly elects to represent himself assumes full responsibility \r\n    for complying with substantive and procedural requirements of the law.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  â€œWhenever evidence is introduced that was allegedly \r\n    obtained by conduct violative of the defendantâ€™s constitutional rights, the \r\n    defendant is entitled to have the trial judge conduct an evidentiary hearing \r\n    out of the presence of the jury at this threshold point to establish \r\n    the circumstances under which it was seized.â€ State v.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health \r\n  and Envtl. Control, 349 S.C. 162, 561 S.E.2d 650 (Ct. App. 2002).  We affirm.  \r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe United States Congress enacted \r\n  the Federal Family Education Loan Program to encourage the making of loans by \r\n  private lenders to finance the post secondary education of eligible students.  \r\n  See 20 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1071 et seq. (2000) (the Act).  Under \r\n  this Act, guaranty agencies guarantee payment of the loan to eligible lenders \r\n  and pay the holder of the loan if the student defaults.  20 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1078.  \r\n  Thereafter, the United States Secretary of Education reimburses the guaranty \r\n  agency for these payments and loan collection costs under a reinsurance arrangement \r\n  with the agency.  20 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1078.    \r\nTo assist private guarantee agencies \r\n  in collecting defaulted student loans, Congress provided guaranty agencies with \r\n  authority to administratively garnish the wages of student borrowers who have \r\n  defaulted on their student loan agreements.  20 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1095a(a).  Under \r\n  the Act, a guaranty agency may issue a withholding order requiring a defaulted \r\n  borrowerâ€™s employer to withhold 10% of the borrowerâ€™s disposable income until \r\n  the debt is paid.  20 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1095a(a)(1).  The Act permits guaranty agencies \r\n  to sue an employer who fails to comply with the withholding order.  20 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1095a(a)(6).  Specifically, Â§ 1095a(a)(6) provides:\r\n\r\n  the employer shall pay to the Secretary \r\n    or the guaranty agency as directed in the withholding order issued in this \r\n    action, and shall be liable for, and the Secretary or the guaranty agency, \r\n    as appropriate, may sue the employer in State or Federal court of competent \r\n    jurisdiction to recover, any amount that such employer fails to withhold from \r\n    wages due an employee following receipt of such employer of notice of the \r\n    withholding order, plus attorneysâ€™ fees, costs, and in the courtâ€™s discretion, \r\n    punitive damages, but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal \r\n    pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph . . . . \r\n    \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nIn the present case, Brenda Irons \r\n  obtained a student loan from private lenders to pay educational expenses under \r\n  the Act.  Petitioner United Student Aid Funds, Inc., (United) guaranteed the \r\n  promissory note.  When Irons defaulted on her loan, United paid the private \r\n  lender the loan balance.  The Secretary of Education reimbursed United for the \r\n  amount of the defaulted loan.  \r\nUnited issued a wage withholding \r\n  order to Respondent The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental \r\n  Control (DHEC), Ironsâ€™ employer, after following the procedures outlined under \r\n  the Act.  DHEC failed to comply with the withholding order.  United sued DHEC \r\n  and other state representatives (collectively, the State) requesting monetary \r\n  and equitable remedies.\r\nThe trial court dismissed the case \r\n  finding the Eleventh Amendment barred Unitedâ€™s action against the State.  The \r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed.  United Student Aid Funds, Inc., v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, supra.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   I. Did the Court of Appeals \r\n    err by holding the Eleventh Amendment bars Unitedâ€™s suit against the State \r\n    for failing to comply with a withholding order issued pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \r\n    Â§ 1095a(a)(6)?\r\n   II. Did the Court of Appeals \r\n    err by failing to address the issue of injunctive relief?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Statutory Construction \r\nUnited asserts the United States \r\n  Constitution is not implicated in its suit and, therefore, the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by holding the Eleventh Amendment bars its action.  Relying on Hilton \r\n  v. South Carolina Pub. Rys. Commâ€™n, 502 U.S. 197, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d \r\n  560 (1991), United asserts its claim presents an issue of mere statutory construction, \r\n  not constitutional interpretation.  We disagree.\r\nIn Hilton, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court (USSC) addressed whether a private individual may sue a state-owned \r\n  railroad in state court for tortious conduct.  In particular, the Court considered \r\n  whether the phrase â€œ[e]very common carrier by railroadâ€ as used in the Federal \r\n  Employersâ€™ Liability Act (FELA) included state-owned railroads. \r\nThe Court determined suits against \r\n  state-owned railroads in state court were permissible.  It based its decision \r\n  on several factors, the primary of which was stare decisis which â€œcontrolled \r\n  and informedâ€ the Courtâ€™s decision.  Id. at 201, 112 S.Ct. at 563, 116 \r\n  L.Ed.2d at 569.  In doing so, the Court reached its decision only after finding \r\n  the matter was a question of statutory construction, not constitutional interpretation. [1]   Significantly, the Court believed the United States Constitution \r\n  was not implicated based on  prior decisions suggesting the Eleventh Amendment \r\n  did not apply to actions brought in state courts.  See id. at \r\n  204-05, 112 S.Ct. at 565, 116 L.Ed.2d at 570.  Since the Constitution was not \r\n  implicated, the Court did not have to determine if the phrase â€œ[e]very common \r\n  carrier by railroadâ€ satisfied the Eleventh Amendmentâ€™s â€œplain statement ruleâ€ \r\n  jurisprudence.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 111 S.Ct. \r\n  2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (Court uses â€œplain statement ruleâ€ to determine \r\n  whether Congressional Act applies to the states).\r\nHowever, since Hilton, the \r\n  USSC issued Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d \r\n  636, (1999), clarifying that the Eleventh Amendment does prohibit Congress from \r\n  subjecting a state to suit in state court without its consent.  Accordingly, \r\n  in this case the Eleventh Amendment is implicated.  The Court may not rely on \r\n  the rules of statutory construction, but must apply the rules of constitutional \r\n  interpretation involving the Eleventh Amendment.\r\n B.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Private Actor \r\nUnited asserts it is not a private \r\n  actor suing the State in state court, but is, instead, an agent of the federal \r\n  government not barred by the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment.  We disagree.\r\nUnitedâ€™s amended complaint alleges \r\n  only that it is a â€œnon-profit corporation organized under the State of Delaware \r\n  General Corporation law and has the power to prosecute this suit.â€   It does \r\n  not allege the action is being brought on behalf of the federal government.  \r\n  Moreover, the Act does not explicitly provide that a guaranty agency stands \r\n  in the shoes of the federal government in suits to force compliance with withholding \r\n  orders.\r\nAdditionally, Unitedâ€™s argument is \r\n  not preserved for review.  Although United raised the issue to the Court of \r\n  Appeals, it does not appear that the issue was raised to or ruled on by the \r\n  trial court.  See Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 440 S.E.2d 357 \r\n  (1994) (an issue neither raised to nor ruled upon by trial court will not be \r\n  considered on appeal); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 \r\n  (1991) (where a trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument raised and \r\n  appellant makes no Rule 59 motion to obtain a ruling, the appellate court may \r\n  not address the issue); Hoffman v. Powell, 298 S.C. 338, 380 S.E.2d 821 \r\n  (1989) (an appellate court will not consider issues raised for the first time \r\n  on appeal).   \r\nUnitedâ€™s argument is not preserved \r\n  and is otherwise without merit.\r\n C.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Applicability of the Eleventh Amendment \r\nUnited argues the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by failing to hold Congress intended to abrogate the statesâ€™ Eleventh \r\n  Amendment immunity in the Act.  We disagree.    \r\nThe Eleventh Amendment prohibits \r\n  non-consenting states from being sued in federal or state court by private individuals.  \r\n  Board of Trustees of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 121 \r\n  S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001); Alden v. Maine, supra.  However, \r\n  Congress may, when acting pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority, \r\n  abrogate the statesâ€™ Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Garrett, supra.  \r\n  Congress may abrogate the statesâ€™ immunity only after it complies with the â€œplain \r\n  statement ruleâ€ by unequivocally stating in â€œclear and manifestâ€ language its \r\n  intent to abrogate the immunity.  Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra.\r\nUnited concedes that â€œCongress did \r\n  not specifically say whether it intended to force states that happen to be employers \r\n  to submit to suit without their consent.â€  United asserts, however, that Congressâ€™ \r\n  intent to include states in its definition of employers is manifest in a variety \r\n  of ways including: 1) other federal statutes defining states as â€œpersonsâ€ or \r\n  â€œemployersâ€; 2) the State defining itself as an â€œemployerâ€; and 3) use of the \r\n  word â€œstateâ€ in the Act itself.\r\nUnited refers to other federal statutes \r\n  which include state and local governments in the terms â€œpersonsâ€ and â€œemployerâ€ \r\n  to support its contention that the term â€œstateâ€ may fall under the definition \r\n  of â€œemployer.â€  See, e.g., Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 203(d) (1998) (â€œemployerâ€ includes public agency); Age Discrimination in Employment \r\n  Act, 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 630(b)(2) (1999) (employer includes a state).  \r\nWe conclude if Congress intended \r\n  to make states, when acting as employers, liable under 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1095a(a), \r\n  it would have so stated.  Congressâ€™ failure to clearly define â€œemployerâ€ to \r\n  encompass states in light of its knowledge and ability to do so in other statutes \r\n  is fatal to Unitedâ€™s argument.\r\nSimilarly, United refers to instances \r\n  where the State is included in the term â€œemployerâ€ within the South Carolina \r\n  Code of Laws.  See, e.g., South Carolina Employment Security Law, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-27-210 and 220 (1986) (â€œemploying unitâ€ includes State); \r\n  Workers Compensation Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-140 (1985) (â€œemployerâ€ includes \r\n  the State).  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s inclusion of itself as \r\n  an employer in unrelated instances does not require the State to surrender its \r\n  sovereignty to every law, both state and federal, which imposes liabilities \r\n  on an employer.  By specifically defining those circumstances under which it \r\n  is to be treated as an employer, the State has indicated that it does not intend \r\n  to subject itself to all laws regarding employers generally.  \r\nAttendant to these arguments is Unitedâ€™s \r\n  assertion that the plain statement rule is satisfied because of the liberal \r\n  use of the word â€œstateâ€ in the text of the Act along with its legislative purpose \r\n  to establish a federal loan program to assist the states.  United suggests that \r\n  because Congress clearly wanted to provide an enforcement mechanism for student \r\n  loan debt collection agencies against non-compliant employers, then it would \r\n  be Congressâ€™ intent to subject the states to the mechanism when they act as \r\n  a non-compliant employer.  \r\nWhile this argument is logical, it \r\n  defeats the purpose of requiring a plain, unambiguous statement.  While one \r\n  may argue it was Congressâ€™ intent to encompass states in the Act, the USSC has \r\n  already decided that it will not engage in such debates but, instead, require \r\n  a clear and plain statement.  Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra.  \r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly concluded \r\n  the Eleventh Amendment is applicable and properly held that since Congress did \r\n  not include a clear statement of its intent to abrogate state sovereignty, the \r\n  suit was properly dismissed.\r\nII.\r\nUnited argues the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by not addressing its request for injunctive relief.  United asserts this \r\n  Court should consider the injunction issue to prevent the State from failing \r\n  to comply with future withholding orders.  \r\nIt appears the Court of Appeals did \r\n  not address the issue of injunctive relief because Irons is no longer employed \r\n  by the State.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded the only remaining \r\n  remedy was damages incurred by United for the Stateâ€™s refusal to comply with \r\n  the withholding order.  See United Student Aid Funds, Inc., v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, supra.  \r\n The Eleventh Amendment does not \r\n  prohibit a court from providing injunctive relief.  See Alden v. Maine, \r\n  supra; Green v. Kentucky Higher Educ. Assistance Auth., 78 F.Supp.2d \r\n  1259 (S.D. Ala. 1999).  The issue in the present case is moot, however, because \r\n  the State is not obligated to comply with the withholding orders. [2]   See Discussion I, infra.  Accordingly, there \r\n  is no basis upon which to issue an injunction requiring the State to comply \r\n  with the Act.\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals \r\n  is AFFIRMED. [3]   \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, WALLER, \r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n    Reliance on stare decisis was critical because of the USSCâ€™s previous holding \r\n    in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U.S. 184, 84 \r\n    S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), which held that States who chose to enter \r\n    the railroad business after the enactment of the FELA waived sovereign immunity \r\n    from suits based on tortious conduct.  As a result many states excluded railroad \r\n    workers from their workersâ€™ compensation statutes because the FELA provided \r\n    an adequate alternative.  Therefore, if the Hilton Court would have \r\n    forbade suits against state-owned railroads in state court it â€œwould have \r\n    dislodged settled expectations and required an extensive legislative response.â€  \r\n    Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 736, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 2258, 144 L.Ed.2d \r\n    636, 667 (1999).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] We note that South Carolina law prohibits the State from employing any \r\n    person who is considered in default of a federally insured student loan.  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-111-50 (1990).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  In light of our disposition of \r\n    Unitedâ€™s appeal, we decline to address the Stateâ€™s Tenth Amendment argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25747","title":"Franklin v.

The USSC noted that \r\n  â€œ[t]o the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally \r\n  retarded offenders, it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.  \r\n  . . . Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as \r\n  to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is \r\n  a national consensus.â€  Id. at 317, 122 S.Ct. at 2250.  The USSC left \r\n  â€œthe task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restrictions \r\n  upon [the] execution of sentencesâ€ to the states.  Id.  Therefore, the \r\n  state of South Carolina has the obligation to establish procedures for possible \r\n  capital cases where the defendant is allegedly mentally retarded.\r\nPetitioners, all either death-sentenced inmates or capital defendants, \r\n  filed this petition for a writ of certiorari in our original jurisdiction requesting \r\n  we establish procedures implementing the Atkins decision. \r\n  [1] \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n       What is the definition of mental retardation?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II. \r\n       What is the procedure for making the mental retardation determination \r\n  in post-Atkins cases?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n       What is the procedure for cases where the defendant was sentenced to death \r\n  prior to Atkins?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nWe find it inappropriate to create a definition of mental retardation \r\n  different from the one already established by the legislature in S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-3-20 (C)(b)(10) (2003) (mental retardation is a statutory mitigating circumstance). \r\n  [2]   Section 16-3-20(C)(b)(10) defines mental retardation as:  â€œsignificantly \r\n  subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits \r\n  in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period.â€  Altering \r\n  this definition is a matter for the legislature.\r\nII\r\nRegarding the procedures to be used in making the mental retardation determination \r\n  in post-Atkins cases, we conclude the trial judge shall make the determination \r\n  in a pre-trial hearing, if so requested by the defendant or the prosecution, \r\n  after hearing evidence, including expert testimony, from both the defendant \r\n  and the State.  The defendant shall have the burden of proving he or she is \r\n  mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence.  Cf. State v. \r\n  Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998) [3]  (defendant bears burden of proving incompetence \r\n  by preponderance of evidence); State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d \r\n  99 (1998) [4]  (same).\r\nIf the judge finds the defendant to be mentally retarded by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence in the pre-trial hearing, the defendant will not be eligible \r\n  for the death penalty.  If, however, the judge finds the defendant is not \r\n  mentally retarded and the jury finds the defendant guilty of the capital charge, \r\n  the defendant may still present mitigating evidence that he or she had mental \r\n  retardation at the time of the crime.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(10) \r\n  (2003). [5]   If the jury finds \r\n  this mitigating circumstance, then a death sentence will not be imposed.\r\nIII\r\nWhile petitioners argue we should establish procedures for cases \r\n  where the defendant was sentenced to death prior to Atkins, [6]  such procedures already exist.\r\nA death row inmate who claims he is mentally retarded and, as a result, \r\n  not subject to the death penalty, may institute post-conviction relief (PCR) \r\n  proceedings because his sentence is in violation of the Constitution and exceeds \r\n  the maximum authorized by law. [7] \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-20(a) and -160 (2003).  As with other \r\n  PCR claims, the applicant must show he or she is mentally retarded by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.  See, e.g., Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 53 (1993) (competency for execution).  If mental retardation is proven, \r\n  the PCR court will vacate the death sentence and impose a life sentence.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  \r\n    s/Jean H.

Emory Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, for The Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nCarol S. Broome, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney-disciplinary matter, \r\n  the Sub Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct found, and the Full Panel \r\n  agreed, that John C. Broome (â€œRespondentâ€) committed misconduct and recommended \r\n  that he receive a public reprimand and pay proceeding costs.  We find that the \r\n  gravity of Respondentâ€™s misconduct justifies harsher sanctions.  Therefore, \r\n  we hereby suspend Respondent for 90 days, order him to pay proceeding costs, \r\n  and require that he be re-examined by the Committee on Character and Fitness \r\n  before he may re-activate his license to practice law.  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis attorney-disciplinary case arises from Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conduct in three separate matters: (1) adoption-related proceedings; (2) a custody \r\n  dispute (â€œSparks matterâ€); and (3) a divorce action (â€œJones matterâ€).  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conduct in the adoption-related proceedings is the most serious, most factually \r\n  complex of the three matters. \r\nA.          Adoption-Related Proceedings\r\nThe same adoptive child is the subject of three \r\n  distinct adoption-related proceedings.  Mr. and Ms. Roe \r\n  [1]  filed the first action (â€œAdoption #1â€) as a married couple seeking \r\n  to adopt the infant child.  A few months later, alleging that Mr. Roe had abused \r\n  the child, Ms. Roe moved out of the marital home, took the infant child with \r\n  her, and then filed the second action (â€œSupport Actionâ€), seeking separate maintenance \r\n  and support and temporary custody.  Shortly thereafter, Ms. Roe filed the third \r\n  action (â€œAdoption #2â€), seeking to adopt the child as a single parent. \r\nRespondent represented Ms. Roe in both the Support \r\n  Action and Adoption #2.  In short, Respondent initiated Adoption #2 while Adoption \r\n  #1 was pending and did not notify the Adoption #1 parties that he had done so.  \r\n  Throughout, Respondent handled Adoption #2 as if it were an independent action, \r\n  unrelated to Adoption #1, even though the very same child, birth parents, and \r\n  prospective adoptive parents had a stake in each matter.   \r\n1.          Timeline\r\nThe following timeline illustrates \r\n  the interplay among the three adoption-related proceedings:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Apr. 23, 1998\r\n       Adoption #1 (Case No. 1766) filed \r\n  in County X [2]  by Mr. and Ms. \r\n  Roe to adopt infant child.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Aug. 12, 1998\r\n       Ms. Roe filed Support Action (purportedly \r\n  pro se but with documents prepared by Respondent) in County Y. \r\n  [3]\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Aug. 27, 1998\r\n       Upon learning that the Roes had separated, \r\n  the birth parentsâ€™ attorney, Sam Crews, wrote a letter to Respondent and other \r\n  counsel requesting that the child be returned to the birth mother for temporary \r\n  placement with the birth motherâ€™s relatives.  (A few days later, Respondent \r\n  filed Adoption #2 in direct opposition to this request.)\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Aug. 31, 1998\r\n       Final hearing in Adoption #1 continued \r\n  until November 1.  (This continuance made it possible for Respondent to go forward \r\n  with plans to file Adoption #2, contravening the birth motherâ€™s wishes as detailed \r\n  in the August 27, 1998 letter from Sam Crews.) \r\n        \r\n Ms. Roe filed a Notice \r\n  of Dismissal â€œas to [her]â€(purportedly pro se but with documents prepared \r\n  by Respondent) in Adoption #1 but did not serve the other parties until November \r\n  6, 1998. [4]\r\n        \r\n  Ms. Roe signed the \r\n  complaint for Adoption #2 with Respondent as counsel.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Sept. 3, 1998\r\n       Complaint in Adoption #2 filed but not \r\n  served on Mr. Roe, his counsel, the guardian ad litem, or the birth parents.  \r\n  Complaint fails to make any reference to pending Support Action and states that \r\n  Adoption #1 was dismissed â€œas to [Ms. Roe].â€\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Sept. 8, 1998\r\n       Hearing held in Support Action. Respondent \r\n  did not inform Judge Nuessle that Adoption #2 had been filed.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Sept. 24, 1998\r\n       Judge Nuessle granted Ms. Roe temporary \r\n  child custody.  Birth mother given 30 days to intervene in Support Action.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Oct. 16, 1998\r\n       Final hearing held in Adoption #2 \r\n  before Judge Brown.  While Ms. Roe was on the witness stand, Respondent asked \r\n  her whether Adoption #1 â€œwas dismissed by [her]â€ to which she answered, â€œYes.â€  \r\n  Without knowledge that Adoption #1 and Support Action were pending, Judge Brown \r\n  issued an order of adoption to Ms. Roe.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nov. 6, 1998\r\n       Ms. Roe finally served parties with \r\n  Notice of Dismissal as to her only in Adoption #1.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nov. 9, 1998\r\n       Respondent filed a Notice of Representation \r\n  in Adoption #1.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nov. 13, 1998\r\n       Attorney for birth parents (Sam Crews) \r\n  wrote letter to Judge Brown requesting that Adoption #2 be re-opened and an \r\n  emergency hearing held.\r\n        \r\n Hearing held before \r\n  Judge Riddle in Adoption #1 in what should have been a final hearing in that \r\n  case.  But then Respondent announced that Ms. Roe already adopted the child \r\n  in Adoption #2.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nov. 17, 1998\r\n       Hearing held in Support Action before \r\n  Judge Sawyer.  Judge Sawyer held the proceeding in abeyance until Judge Brown \r\n  had an opportunity to re-hear the matter.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nov. 20, 1998\r\n       Hearing held before Judge Brown in \r\n  Adoption #2 to re-hear order of adoption previously granted to Ms. Roe.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nov. 23, 1998\r\n       Judge Riddle issued order continuing \r\n  Adoption #1 once again and requiring that the contents of the Adoption #2 proceeding \r\n  be unsealed to allow the guardian ad litem to review the case.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Dec. 10, 1998\r\n       Judge Brown vacated the order of \r\n  adoption he issued in Adoption #2 finding (1) lack of notice to necessary parties; \r\n  (2) Adoption #1 was still pending; and (3) lack of notice to court that Adoption \r\n  #1 and Support Action were pending.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nFailure to Inform the Court \r\nThis Court finds that on at least \r\n  four different occasions in front of four different judges, Respondent engaged \r\n  in deceitful conduct. The conduct in Adoption #2 is outlined first and most \r\n  thoroughly, since it is the focus of the partiesâ€™ briefs.  \r\na.     Judge Brown, Adoption #2\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel (â€œODCâ€) and \r\n  Respondent center their discussion of the adoption-related proceedings on Respondentâ€™s \r\n  failure to inform the court in Adoption #2 that Adoption #1 and the Support \r\n  Action were pending.  Respondent had two opportunities to inform the Adoption \r\n  #2 court: (1) in the complaint and (2) at the final hearing for adoption.  \r\nIn the complaint, Respondent referred to Adoption \r\n  #1 in two separate paragraphs.  Paragraph 6 states, â€œ[a]n action for adoption \r\n  of the minor child was filed in [County X] as File No. 98-DR-40-1766.  This \r\n  plaintiff has had that action as to her dismissed as more fully set forth \r\n  herein.â€ (emphasis added).  Also, Paragraph 16 states: \r\n\r\nA previous action for adoption \r\n  was filed under File No. 98-DR-40-1766 on April 23, 1998, which was within 60 \r\n  days of placement as required by statute, by this Plaintiff and her now estranged \r\n  husband, however due to his abusive behavior toward the baby, the Plaintiff \r\n  determined that for her safety and the safety of the child, and the impossibility \r\n  of an adoption by both under the circumstances, that the action as to her \r\n  should be dismissed and an [sic] new action begun with this plaintiff alone.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  Respondent \r\n  argues that these references to Adoption #1 sufficiently informed the court \r\n  that Adoption #1 remained viable.  Further, he argues that the onus was on the \r\n  court to determine the status of Adoption #1 and to inquire as to whether any \r\n  other action concerning the child or parties was pending.  But ODC argues that \r\n  these references fall short of informing the court that Adoption #1 was pending \r\n  as to other parties.  \r\nIf there was any confusion concerning \r\n  the status of Adoption #1 from language in the complaint, that confusion could \r\n  have been clarified in Respondentâ€™s direct examination of Ms. Roe during the \r\n  final hearing in Adoption #2.  When Ms. Roe was on the witness stand, Respondent \r\n  asked, â€œwas [Adoption #1] dismissed by you?â€ to which Ms. Roe replied, â€œYes, \r\n  sir, it was.â€  Judge Brown relied on this testimony and thus believed Adoption \r\n  #1 had been dismissed in its entirety.      \r\nRespondent also failed to inform the courtâ€”both \r\n  in the complaint and at the final hearingâ€”that the Support Action was pending, \r\n  even though Respondent was the attorney of record and had appeared in that case.  \r\n  He argues that he was not required by law to disclose the action in the Adoption \r\n  #2 complaint because the court in the Support Action had yet to issue an order \r\n  affecting custody. [5]   In addition, Respondent argues that he did not entirely fail \r\n  to inform the court because the Adoption #2 complaint and its attached reports \r\n  explained that Ms. Roe was estranged from her husband, suggesting a Support \r\n  Action of sorts might exist.\r\nRespondent also failed to inform the court in Adoption \r\n  #2 (1) that a guardian ad litem had already been appointed for the child \r\n  in Adoption #1; (2) that the natural parents had asserted an interest in the \r\n  child; and (3) that Mr. Roe had not taken legal action to terminate his desire \r\n  to adopt the child.\r\nBased on the record and the testimony at the October \r\n  16, 1998 final adoption hearing in Adoption #2, Judge Brown issued an order \r\n  of adoption to Ms. Roe as the sole adoptive parent.  But shortly thereafter, \r\n  Mr. Roe brought a motion to vacate, and upon rehearing the matter, Judge Brown \r\n  vacated this order finding (1) that the court was misled as to Adoption #1â€™s \r\n  status, (2) that the court was not informed about the Support Action, and (3) \r\n  that Mr. Roe, the birth parents, and the guardian ad litem appointed \r\n  in Adoption #1 were necessary parties to Adoption #2.  Judge Brown also declared \r\n  that Respondent and his client had demonstrated â€œa willful and flagrant disregard \r\n  for their statutory and ethical duties to [the] court.â€  Finally, Judge Brown \r\n  ordered Respondent and Ms. Roe to pay $5,000 in fees.\r\nb.          Judge Nuessle, Support \r\n  Action\r\nOn September 8, 1998, Respondent \r\n  appeared at a hearing in the Support Action before Judge Nuessle.  At the time \r\n  he appeared, Respondent had already filed Adoption #2, but he did not inform \r\n  Judge Nuessle of this fact.  Not knowing that Adoption #2 existed, Judge Nuessle \r\n  issued an order on September 24, 1998, granting temporary custody to Ms. Roe.  \r\n  Just two weeks after obtaining this order, Respondent appeared in the final \r\n  hearing for Adoption #2 before Judge Brown.  As outlined above, Respondent never \r\n  mentioned the existence of the Support Action or the recently-obtained order \r\n  to Judge Brown. \r\nc.          Judge Riddle, Adoption \r\n  #1\r\nOn November 13, 1998, Respondent appeared before \r\n  Judge Riddle at what was supposed to be the final hearing in Adoption #1.  But \r\n  as soon Judge Riddle learned that the child had already been adopted in Adoption \r\n  #2, she spent much of the hearing trying to determine how this could have happened \r\n  while Adoption #1 was pending.  Respondent did little to clarify the confusion.  \r\n  Although he rightfully refused to reveal the facts of Adoption #2 (since the \r\n  record was sealed), he told Judge Riddle that â€œan adoption was properly done.â€  \r\n  In addition to withholding the facts, he refused to provide the other attorneys \r\n  with the Adoption #2 caption and case number, preventing them from knowing where \r\n  and how to intervene. [6]   Judge Riddle was forced to order Respondent \r\n  into her chambers to gather the information necessary for her ruling.      \r\nd.         \r\nJudge Sawyer, Support \r\n  Action\r\nOn November 17, 1998, Respondent \r\n  appeared at a hearing in the Support Action before Judge Sawyer.  Just as he \r\n  did with Judge Riddle, Respondent evaded Judge Sawyerâ€™s questions by stating \r\n  that the Adoption #2 proceedings were sealed.  Based on the record before him, \r\n  Judge Sawyer stated that he was â€œconcerned from an ethical, a legal, and criminal \r\n  standpointâ€ about the issues before the court.  He explicitly asked Respondent \r\n  if Respondent informed Judge Brown that Adoption #1 was pending.  Respondent \r\n  answered, â€œYes, your honor.â€  In closing, Judge Sawyer stated, â€œthis is a matter \r\n  of grave concern certainly not only to the court, not only to [him], but also \r\n  to the attorneys and litigants.â€  \r\n3.          Failure to Notify Interested \r\n  Parties and Counsel\r\nIn addition to failing to fully inform the various \r\n  courts in the adoption-related proceedings, Respondent failed to inform interested, \r\n  necessary parties that Adoption #2 had been filed.  Such parties included Mr. \r\n  Roe, the birth parents, the guardian ad litem, and the partiesâ€™ counsel.  \r\n\r\nRespondent admitted that he did not provide these \r\n  parties or their counsel with notice.  He justified his course of action by \r\n  arguing that Adoption #2 was an entirely separate matter than Adoption #1.  \r\n  Because they were not parties to Adoption #2, he argued, they were not entitled \r\n  to notice.  But given that all three actions involved the same parties, Adoption \r\n  #2 can hardly be considered a â€œseparate matterâ€ to which these parties were \r\n  not entitled notice. \r\n4.          Failure to Abide by \r\n  the Birth Motherâ€™s Wishes [7] \r\nFinally, Respondent directly contravened the birth \r\n  motherâ€™s wishes to have the child adopted by a two-parent familyâ€”specifically \r\n  Ms. and Mr. Roeâ€”as designated in her consent and waiver.  He attached the very \r\n  same consent and waiver forms executed for Adoption #1, an adoption by a two-parent \r\n  family, in Adoption #2, an adoption by a single parent.  In addition, he claimed \r\n  that he did not notify the birth parents that he filed Adoption #2 because they \r\n  waived their rights to notice and to being named as parties in their consents.  \r\n  Once the birth parents (and particularly the birth mother) learned of the Roesâ€™ \r\n  separation, they attempted to intervene in the Support Action.  But because \r\n  Adoption #2 ended before they knew it had begun, they were unable to intervene \r\n  in that action. [8]   \r\nB.          Sparks Matter\r\nRespondent met with Joanne Sparks during the initial \r\n  stages of a custody action.  While Respondent dealt with Sparks, the time to \r\n  respond to the summons and complaint in the custody action expired, and opposing \r\n  counsel filed an affidavit of default.  After Sparks went into default, Respondent \r\n  attempted to back out of his relationship with Sparks, stating that he could \r\n  â€œno longer provide any further services to Ms. Sparks until [he] received a \r\n  written employment agreement.â€  In addition, Respondent argues that Sparks never \r\n  gave him the authority to prepare pleadings; rather, she consulted him solely \r\n  for the purpose of investigating her options for settlement.  \r\nAt the Sub-Panel hearing, Respondent claimed that \r\n  Sparks was not his client at the time the response became due.  He further testified \r\n  that a note he penned to another attorney referring to Sparks as â€œmy clientâ€ \r\n  was written in error.  Sparks never signed a retainer agreement and did not \r\n  testify at the Sub-Panel hearing.\r\nC.          Jones Matter\r\nRespondent represented Charlotte Jones in a divorce \r\n  matter.  Over the course of two years, Respondent was unable to obtain a divorce \r\n  or settlement agreement on Jonesâ€™s behalf.\r\nRespondent argues that the delays in this matter \r\n  were due to Jonesâ€™s difficulties with her husband and her uncertainties as to \r\n  how she wanted to proceed.  He argues that he did not secure court approval \r\n  of the settlement agreement because the parties were unable to agree on final \r\n  terms.\r\nBut at the Sub-Panel hearing, Jones testified (1) \r\n  that she did not understand why her divorce action could not go forward, (2) \r\n  that she did not hear from Respondent for months at a time, and (3) that Respondentâ€™s \r\n  paralegal seemed to know more about the case than he did.\r\nBased on the lack of results, Jones filed a claim \r\n  with the Fee Disputes Board (â€œBoardâ€) alleging that Respondent overcharged her \r\n  and that she â€œgot no agreement and no divorce.â€  The Board denied Jonesâ€™s request \r\n  for a refund of fees, even though the Board found that there was â€œa hiatus in \r\n  file activityâ€ for seven months. [9]      \r\nRespondent argues that the rehearing of these issues \r\n  constitutes res judicata.  But the Board and Commission on Lawyer Conduct \r\n  investigations are separate matters.  The Board conducted its investigation \r\n  for the purpose of determining whether Respondent had overcharged Jones.  Here, \r\n  the issues are whether Respondent acted diligently, kept his client informed, \r\n  and provided competent representation.  \r\nD.      Sub-Panel Hearing and Report\r\nThe Sub Panel filed its \r\n  report on April 30, 2002.  On July 24, 2002, the Full Panel adopted the Sub-Panel \r\n  report in its entirety, making changes only to protect the confidentiality of \r\n  the parties in the adoption proceedings.  \r\nIn its report, the Full Panel stated that it had \r\n  â€œcarefully reviewed [the Sub-Panel Report], the Objections to it filed by [Respondent], \r\n  and the Return filed by counsel for Office of Disciplinary Counselâ€ before coming \r\n  to a unanimous decision to adopt the Sub-Panel Report in full.  (July 26, 2002 \r\n  Full Panel Report incorrectly titled â€œSub-Panel Reportâ€).  Because the Full \r\n  Panel did not specify that it had also reviewed the â€œrecordâ€ in making its findings, \r\n  Respondent argues that the Full Panel therefore failed to review the hearing \r\n  transcript, adopting the Sub-Panel Report without knowledge of the necessary \r\n  facts, and thus violated Rule 26(c)(7) of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR. \r\nRule 26(c)(7) provides, \r\n  in part, that the Full Panel â€œshall review the [Sub-Panelâ€™s] report and record, \r\n  and make its own report â€¦.â€  In response to Respondentâ€™s argument, ODC points \r\n  out that simply because the Full Panel did not enumerate that it had reviewed \r\n  the â€œreport and recordâ€ does not necessarily mean that the Panel failed to review \r\n  the hearing transcript.  ODC also argues that Rule 26(c)(7) does not compel \r\n  the Panel to read each and every page of the transcript; rather, a review of \r\n  the â€œreport and recordâ€ may be accomplished without reading each and every page \r\n  of the transcript. \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAs to the adoption-related proceedings, the Sub \r\n  Panel found, and the Full Panel agreed, that Respondent violated the following \r\n  from the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: (1) Rule 8.4(d) \r\n  (engaged in conduct involving deceit and misrepresentation); (2) Rule 8.4(e) \r\n  (engaged in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice); and \r\n  from Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, (3) Rule 7(a)(5) \r\n  (engaged in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring \r\n  the courts or legal profession into disrepute and engaged in conduct demonstrating \r\n  unfitness to practice law).  We agree.\r\nIn our opinion, Respondent proceeded with Adoption \r\n  #2 in a manner that deceived the court and that prejudiced and polluted the \r\n  administration of justice.  We acknowledge that Respondent referenced Adoption \r\n  #1 in the complaint, but he crafted the language in such a way that the court \r\n  was misled as to the status of Adoption #1.  \r\nParagraph 6 of the complaint stated that a previous \r\n  action for adoption had been filed and that Ms. Roe â€œhad that action as to her \r\n  dismissed as more fully set forth herein.â€  Standing by itself, this paragraph \r\n  did not explain the status of Adoption #1.  Even if the reader caught the â€œas \r\n  to herâ€ language, he still would not knowâ€”unless he inferred itâ€”that Adoption \r\n  #1 remained viable as to other parties.  Moreover, Paragraph 6 directed the \r\n  reader to what was â€œmore fully set forth hereinâ€ to learn the rest of the story.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the story appears ten paragraphs later \r\n  in Paragraph 16.  Paragraph 16â€”the second and final time Adoption #1 is referencedâ€”stated \r\n  once again that a previous action for adoption was filed.  As in Paragraph 6, \r\n  this language made it clear that another action was filed, but it did not clarify \r\n  the status of that action.  Also as in Paragraph 6, Respondent used the â€œas \r\n  to herâ€ language to support his contention that the court should have known \r\n  that the Adoption #1 action remained viable.  But what was remarkable here was \r\n  that the â€œas to herâ€ language followed language concerning child abuse, a motherâ€™s \r\n  panic, and a sense of urgency.  Respondent knew that no court would have allowed \r\n  Adoption #2 to go forward without informing the parties to Adoption #1, and \r\n  so it is inferable that he crafted the language accordingly and placed it at \r\n  the end of an emotionally-charged paragraph.\r\nEven if we accepted that Respondent informed the \r\n  court in the complaint as to the status of Adoption #1, he directly misled the \r\n  court at the hearing, asking his client whether Adoption #1 had been dismissed, \r\n  not whether it had been dismissed â€œas to her.â€  When Ms. Roe answered that it \r\n  had, any confusion the court may have had from reading the complaint was clarified:  \r\n  Adoption #1 had been dismissed in its entirety.  Although Respondent \r\n  argues that he simply erred in omitting â€œas to herâ€ during the direct examination, \r\n  he cannot convincingly rely on the â€œas to herâ€ language in one instance (in \r\n  the complaint) and then overlook it in the next instance (at the hearing).  \r\n\r\nFinally, Respondent made no reference whatsoeverâ€”in \r\n  the complaint or at the hearingâ€”to the Support Action.  Again, he knew that \r\n  revealing such information would prevent Adoption #2 from going forward.  \r\nThroughout his representation of Ms. Roe in Adoption \r\n  #2, Respondent had the opportunity and the ethical duty to clarify the status \r\n  of Adoption #1 and the existence of the Support Action so that the court could \r\n  make an informed decision.  Respondent did neither.  Finally, Respondentâ€™s failure \r\n  to notify the interested parties that Ms. Roe was filing an action on her own \r\n  to adopt the very same child at issue in Adoption #1 confirms his intent to \r\n  proceed without interference from what he knew to be interested parties.   \r\nAs to the Sparks matter, the Sub Panel found that \r\n  Respondent violated the following from the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR: (1) Rule 1.3 (failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness \r\n  in representing a client); (2) Rule 1.1 (failed to represent a client competently); \r\n  and (3) Rule 1.16 (terminated representation without taking steps to protect \r\n  client interests).  We agree.\r\nThat Respondent consulted with Sparks about her \r\n  settlement options, communicated on her behalf on more than one occasion, and \r\n  referred to her as â€œmy clientâ€ on at least one occasion, is enough to create \r\n  an attorney-client relationship.  See Marshall v. Marshall, 282 \r\n  S.C. 534, 539, 320 S.E.2d 44, 47 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding that â€œ[a] person attains \r\n  the status of â€˜clientâ€™ when that person seeks legal advice by communicating \r\n  in confidence with an attorney for the purpose of obtaining such adviceâ€).  \r\n  Moreover, a signed retainer agreement is not essential to create such a relationship.  \r\n  See 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law Â§ 136 (2003).  Therefore, by \r\n  allowing Sparks to go into default without taking action to protect her interest, \r\n  we find that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.1, and 1.16 as enumerated \r\n  in the Sub-Panel Report. \r\nAs to the Jones matter, the Sub Panel found that \r\n  Respondent violated the following from the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR: (1) Rule 1.3 (failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness \r\n  in representing a client); (2) Rule 1.4(a) (failed to keep a client reasonably \r\n  informed about the status of a matter and comply promptly with reasonable requests \r\n  for information); and (3) Rule 1.1 (failed to represent a client competently).  \r\n  We agree.\r\nGiven Jonesâ€™s testimony and the fact that Respondent \r\n  obtained no results for his client over a two-year period, we find that Respondent \r\n  failed to act diligently and competently in this matter.\r\nFinally, Respondentâ€™s contention \r\n  that the Full Panel did not review the report and record before making its decision \r\n  is without merit.  This Court is not confined to the Sub-Panel or Full-Panel \r\n  findings.  Burns v. Clayton, 237 S.C. 316, 331, 112 S.E.2d 300, 307 (1960).  \r\n  Indeed, this Court is required to conduct its own thorough review of \r\n  the record and then render an appropriate sanction.  Matter of Kirven, \r\n  267 S.C. 669, 670, 230 S.E.2d 899, 900 (1976) (emphasis added).  Moreover, this \r\n  Court â€œmay accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings, conclusions \r\n  and recommendationsâ€ of the Full Panel.  Rule 27(e)(2), Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.  Given its authority and given that this Court \r\n  has reviewed the record in its entirety, we hold that Respondentâ€™s argument \r\n  that the Full Panel failed to conduct a thorough review of the record before \r\n  making its decision is unfounded.\r\nSanctions\r\nBecause of the seriousness of the misrepresentations \r\n  in the adoption-related proceedings, the Full Panel recommended that Respondent \r\n  be publicly reprimanded.  The Full Panel also recommended that Respondent pay \r\n  proceeding costs.  In our opinion, these sanctions are appropriate at a minimum. \r\n\r\nThis Court has deemed public reprimand the appropriate \r\n  sanction in cases involving deceit.  See Matter of Gregg Jones, 344 S.C. \r\n  379, 544 S.E.2d 826 (2001) (attorney refrained from recording a series of deeds \r\n  so that a husband would not learn that his wife had sold the property and did \r\n  not tell subsequent buyers that the property carried an outstanding mortgage); \r\n  Matter of Celsor, 330 S.C. 497, 499 S.E.2d 809 (1998) (attorney falsely \r\n  notarized clientâ€™s signature and submitted such falsified documents to the court); \r\n  Matter of Bruner, 321 S.C. 465, 469 S.E.2d 55 (1996) (attorneyâ€™s misrepresentations \r\n  to title insurer stemmed from lackadaisical and mismanaged office practices); \r\n  Matter of Blackmon, 295 S.C. 333, 368 S.E.2d 465 (1988) (attorney inadvertently \r\n  signed his name on judgeâ€™s signature line on a motion, filed the motion, and \r\n  then misrepresented the situation to the investigator at the Attorney Generalâ€™s \r\n  office).  \r\nBut unlike the cases outlined above, the present \r\n  case involves multiple instances of deceit before judges.  Because there \r\n  is no South Carolina case on point, this Court has looked to cases from other \r\n  states for guidance.    \r\nThe Supreme Court of Arizona recently imposed a \r\n  six-month suspension in a case where two attorneys (1) conducted a â€œshamâ€ trial; \r\n  (2) misled the judge by deliberately concealing the existence of an out-of-court \r\n  agreement; (3) evaded the trial court judgeâ€™s questions; and (4) deceived the \r\n  trial judge with â€œanswers that purposefully disguised the true situation when \r\n  a â€˜lawyer of reasonable prudence and competenceâ€™ would have known that the judgeâ€™s \r\n  inquiry required disclosure.â€  Matter of Alcorn, 41 P.3d 600, 611 (Ariz. \r\n  2002). \r\nThe Supreme Court of Washington suspended an attorney \r\n  for 60 days for misrepresenting facts to a court in ex parte proceedings.  \r\n  Matter of Carmick, 48 P.3d 311 (Wash. 2002).  The Court noted that: \r\n\r\nAn attorneyâ€™s duty of candor is at it highest when opposing \r\n  counsel is not present to disclose contrary facts or expose deficiencies in \r\n  legal argument.  Such a high level of candor is necessary to prevent judges \r\n  from making decisions that differ from those they would reach in an adversarial \r\n  proceeding.  \r\n\r\nId. at 318.             \r\nTaking an even stricter stance than the Arizona \r\n  and Washington courts, the Supreme Court of Georgia disbarred an attorney (1) \r\n  for telling a client that he had re-filed a claim when he never had and (2) \r\n  for presenting two falsified client letters and postal receipts to the investigative \r\n  panel to support his position.  Matter of Shehane IV, 575 S.E.2d 503 \r\n  (Ga. 2003).  Disbarment was warranted even though this was the attorneyâ€™s first \r\n  instance of discipline.  Id. at 504.       \r\nIn the present case, Respondent evaded judgesâ€™ \r\n  questions and in some instances, directly misled the court.  Respondentâ€™s duty \r\n  of candor was at its highest in the Adoption #2 final hearing, and it was at \r\n  this hearing that he most noticeably misled the court.  This final hearing was \r\n  much like an ex parte proceeding in that the adversarial parties were \r\n  not present, and Judge Brown was left to depend on Respondentâ€™s representations \r\n  alone.  Respondent took advantage of this opportunity, successfully leading \r\n  the court to issue an order that it would later vacate.   \r\nIn addition, Respondentâ€™s misconduct in the Sparks \r\n  and Jones matters, including lack of due diligence, failure to keep his clients \r\n  informed, failure to take steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests, and incompetence, \r\n  justifies the sanctions imposed by this Court. \r\nConclusion\r\nGiven the gravity of Respondentâ€™s numerous incidents \r\n  of misconduct, we hereby suspend Respondent for 90 days, order him to pay proceeding \r\n  costs, and require that he be re-examined by this Courtâ€™s Committee on Character \r\n  and Fitness before re-activating his license to practice law.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The name â€œRoeâ€ is used to protect the partiesâ€™ identities, given \r\n    that the underlying action is an adoption proceeding.  On May 21, 2003, this \r\n    Court ordered that portions of the record referring to the adoption proceeding \r\n    be sealed.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]   â€œCounty Xâ€ is used to maintain confidentiality.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  â€œCounty Yâ€ is used to maintain confidentiality.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Judge Brown deduced that the only reason Ms. Roe filed her notice \r\n    of dismissal in Adoption #1 was so that she could proceed with having Adoption \r\n    #2 filed, without her husband.  And when asked whether he knew if Ms. Roe \r\n    had served the notice at the time it was filed, Respondent said that he never \r\n    inquired, and he assumed that she had served it.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Throughout, Respondent supports his course of action by asserting \r\n    that Adoption #1 and Adoption #2 were entirely separate matters, and he proceeded \r\n    with Adoption #2 accordingly.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Judge Riddle eventually ruled that the law did not permit her to \r\n    require Respondent to disclose the caption and case number of Adoption #2.  \r\n    The parties would therefore have to file yet another motion just to learn \r\n    the caption and case number.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]   This issue is not a part of the Sub-Panel Report or the briefs but \r\n    is included here in support of this Courtâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]   The birth parents eventually intervened in the Support Action, and \r\n    on June 28, 1999, Judge Nuessle issued an order approving an agreement naming \r\n    Mr. and Ms. Roe as the adoptive parents (in accordance with the birth parentsâ€™ \r\n    wishes).  But due to the adoptive parentsâ€™ separation, Ms. Roe was given custody \r\n    and Mr. Roe was given visitation rights.     \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  Jones never appealed the Boardâ€™s findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25749","title":"State v.

Belding (â€œRespondentâ€) shall be definitely suspended from the practice \r\n  of law for a period of one year.\r\nFACTS\r\nRucker-Taylor \r\n  Matter\r\nTodd Hunnicutt (â€œMr. Hunnicuttâ€) and Elizabeth Hunnicutt (â€œMs. Hunnicuttâ€) \r\n  were having marital problems.  According to Respondent, in the late summer of \r\n  2000, Mr. Hunnicutt approached Respondent and told him that he and his wife \r\n  were undergoing a â€œGestaltâ€ method of therapy.  Mr. Hunnicutt asked Respondent \r\n  to create a fictitious set of divorce documents to â€œshockâ€ his wife as prescribed \r\n  by the therapy.  According to this method, Ms. Hunnicutt would be â€œshockedâ€ \r\n  into mending the marriage upon seeing the fictitious documents. \r\n  [1] \r\nAs requested, Respondent prepared the documents.  He drafted a Summons \r\n  and Complaint titled Elizabeth Stenzel Hunnicutt v. A. Todd Hunnicutt.  \r\n  The documents bore a ficticious docket number with the last three digits handwritten, \r\n  a fictitious filing stamp for the Clerk of Court of Newberry County, and the \r\n  signature of â€œMark J. Taylor,â€ as Respondent purported to be. \r\nRespondent continued to draft documents that appeared authentic. \r\n  [2]   He drafted a fictitious Consent Order to Change Venue from Newberry \r\n  to Lexington County.  On the document, Respondent signed the names â€œMark J. \r\n  Taylorâ€ and â€œWarren Powell.â€ [3]   He also signed â€œJ. M. Ruckerâ€ in the block designated â€œpresiding \r\n  judge.â€ \r\nRespondent then drafted a letter on his own letterhead, which purported \r\n  to be written to Taylor, indicating that he, Respondent, was now representing \r\n  Mr. Hunnicutt in the divorce. \r\nRespondent then prepared a false â€œDefendantâ€™s First Set of Interrogatories \r\n  and First Request for Production.â€  He signed his assistantâ€™s name to the certificate \r\n  of mailing, purporting proper service of the Interrogatories.  He then drafted \r\n  a fictitious Request for Hearing form, bearing â€œMark J. Taylorâ€ as counsel for \r\n  Ms. Hunnicutt. Respondent then prepared a handwritten letter on his letterhead \r\n  addressed to â€œToddâ€ and attached a fictitious settlement agreement bearing the \r\n  false docket numbers.  \r\nThe documents are entirely false and were never filed in any court.  Respondent \r\n  gave the documents to Mr. Hunnicutt.  Ms. Hunnicutt found the documents in the \r\n  trunk of Mr. Hunnicuttâ€™s car and was confused because she had not initiated \r\n  the divorce action as suggested in the documents.  She faxed the documents to \r\n  a cousin in Missouri.  The Missouri attorney confirmed that the documents appeared \r\n  authentic and that a divorce action appeared to be underway.  \r\nThe Missouri attorney contacted Taylor and Judge Rucker, neither of whom \r\n  knew about the matter. In turn, Taylor and Judge Rucker contacted the Commission \r\n  on Lawyer Conduct.  The Attorney Generalâ€™s Office joined this matter with the \r\n  Jennifer Carmen matter and issued formal charges accordingly.\r\nJennifer \r\n  Carmen Matter\r\nIn 1997, Jennifer Carmen (â€œMs. Carmenâ€) hired Respondent in an action \r\n  to increase child support payments from her former husband.  Respondent brought \r\n  the action in Lexington County Family Court.  Ms. Carmenâ€™s former husband, Mark \r\n  Carmen (â€œMr. Carmenâ€), who was represented by Nancy M. Young (â€œYoungâ€), counterclaimed \r\n  for additional visitation with the coupleâ€™s son.           \r\nRespondent told Ms. Carmen that a hearing would take place on June 29, \r\n  1998.  The Lexington County docketing clerk sent Respondent a Notice of Hearing \r\n  indicating that the hearing had been set for June 23, 1998.  Respondent failed \r\n  to send Ms. Carmen a copy of the Notice, and he did not inform her of the change.  \r\n  As a result, Ms. Carmen and Respondent were not present at the June 23 hearing.           \r\n\r\nAfter the June 23 hearing, Young called Respondent and offered to settle \r\n  the case.  Respondent was unaware that he had missed the hearing.  Young presented \r\n  Respondent with an offer that would increase visitation rights for Mr. Carmen \r\n  and would increase child support for Ms. Carmen.  Respondent told her that he \r\n  would call Ms. Carmen to obtain her consent to settle the matter.  He was unable \r\n  to reach Ms. Carmen and obtain her approval.  Nevertheless, he called Young \r\n  and accepted the offer to settle.          \r\nOn June 26, 1998, Mr. Carmen contacted Ms. Carmen to ask her when he could \r\n  pick up their son.  Ms. Carmen did not know about the June 23 hearing or the \r\n  subsequent settlement agreement.  She contacted Respondent to find out about \r\n  the status of her case.  Respondent assured her that he would call the court \r\n  to find out the results of the hearing.  He admitted to missing the hearing \r\n  date and encouraged her to agree to the terms of the proposed settlement.  He \r\n  reiterated that the settlement terms were consistent with what a judge would \r\n  order, but Ms. Carmen refused to consent to the proposed settlement.  \r\nIn late July 1998, Ms. Carmen went to Respondentâ€™s office to retrieve \r\n  her file.  The file contained a copy of the settlement agreement that she never \r\n  signed. \r\nOn July 29, 1998, Young filed a Motion to Compel Settlement.  Respondent \r\n  received a copy of this Motion and informed Ms. Carmen that a hearing on the \r\n  Motion was set for September 4, 1998.           \r\nOn August 4, 1998, Respondent filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel \r\n  in the case.  He did not notify Ms. Carmen that he had filed this Motion.   \r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1998, Respondent and Ms. Carmen attended the scheduled \r\n  hearing.  The court was the first to inform Ms. Carmen of Respondentâ€™s Motion \r\n  to be Relieved as Counsel.  She agreed to find another counsel.  Judge Sawyer \r\n  issued an Order granting Youngâ€™s Motion to Compel Settlement but ruled that \r\n  the issues of reasonableness and fairness would be heard de novo on November \r\n  17, 1998.  \r\nAfter Respondent was relieved as counsel, Ms. Carmen hired Kenneth H. \r\n  Lester (â€œLesterâ€) to represent her at the November hearing.  Lester also helped \r\n  negotiate a settlement that was more advantageous to Ms. Carmen than the settlement \r\n  that Respondent negotiated for her.  Lesterâ€™s fees totaled approximately $7,000.  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nWe hold that Respondentâ€™s conduct constituted a violation of Rules 1.1 \r\n  (competence), 1.2 (scope of representation), 1.4 (communication), 1.16 (terminating \r\n  representation), 4.1 (truthfulness and statements to others), and 8.4 (a), (d), \r\n  and (e)  (misconduct) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR, and warrants discipline in accordance with Rule 7(a)(3) (definite suspension \r\n  from the practice of law) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nWe hold that Respondent violated Rule 4.1, which states that a lawyer \r\n  shall not knowingly, â€œ[m]ake a false statement of material fact or law to a \r\n  third personâ€ or â€œ[f]ail to disclose a material fact to a third person when \r\n  disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a \r\n  client, unless disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6.â€ \r\nThis Court has recently heard two cases involving lawyers who engaged \r\n  in conduct similar to Respondentâ€™s conduct.  In In the Matter of Mozingo, \r\n  330 S.C. 67, 497 S.E.2d 729 (1998), this Court disbarred an attorney for signing \r\n  Chief Justice Toalâ€™s name on a falsified document.  The attorney represented \r\n  his client in an action to reduce or eliminate child support and alimony payments.  \r\n  To help the client appease his family, the attorney signed Justice Toalâ€™s name \r\n  to a letter stating that the court had received the clientâ€™s Motion and was \r\n  in the process of eliminating the requirement that his wages be garnished.           \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Walker, 305 S.C. 482, 409 S.E.2d 412 (1991), \r\n  a client hired an attorney to expunge the clientâ€™s record.  Two years later, \r\n  the client saw his attorney at a party.  The attorney told the client that he \r\n  â€œwas a free manâ€ when in fact the attorney had done nothing to expunge his clientâ€™s \r\n  record.  To support his misrepresentation, the attorney signed a circuit court \r\n  judgeâ€™s name to a false order and gave it to the client.  The client, concerned \r\n  that the document did not appear to be properly filed, went to the Clerk of \r\n  Court to file it.  The Clerk rejected the order because the signature had been \r\n  forged.  The attorney argued that that the only reason that he signed the judgeâ€™s \r\n  name was so that client could see how the order would appear.  The attorney \r\n  was indefinitely suspended.  Chief Justice Gregory dissented, stating that the \r\n  attorney should have been disbarred.  \r\nIn the present case, Respondent drafted false documents that included \r\n  names of real lawyers and a judge.  He argues that he never intended for the \r\n  documents to be presented as if they were authentic, yet the record indicates \r\n  that he made a conscious effort to make the documents appear authentic.           \r\nRespondent further argues that he has not violated Rule 4.1 because he \r\n  lacked the intent to commit criminal forgery as defined by the Court of Appeals \r\n  in State v. Westcott, 316 S.C. 473, 477, 450 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. \r\n  1994).  We disagree.  Rule 4.1 does not require that criminal conduct be shown \r\n  in order to justify a sanction.  Whether Respondent committed criminal forgery \r\n  is a collateral determination that is not dispositive of a determination of \r\n  Respondentâ€™s misconduct under Rule 4.1. \r\nThis Court generally imposes severe sanctions for attorneys who sign anotherâ€™s \r\n  name without authorization. [4]   However, we elect to impose \r\n  a less severe sanction for this violation because we find that the facts of \r\n  Mozingo and Walker are distinguishable from the present case.  \r\n  In both Mozingo and Walker, attorneys actively presented false \r\n  documents as if the documents were authentic.  In this case, the documents were \r\n  never presented as authentic; rather, Ms. Hunnicutt found the documents in Mr. \r\n  Hunnicuttâ€™s car.  \r\nThe Attorney Generalâ€™s Office presented no direct evidence that Respondent \r\n  used these documents to facilitate fraud upon the court. Nevertheless, the documents \r\n  appear authentic and Respondent signed the names of real people, including a \r\n  family court judge.  This Court will impose substantial sanctions upon any attorney \r\n  who signs the name of a judge, regardless of the use made of the document.  \r\n\r\nWe hold that Respondent violated Rule 1.2(a), which provides that â€œ[a] \r\n  lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement.â€  \r\n  This Court has frequently held that failing to receive a clientâ€™s consent before \r\n  entering into a contract is a violation of Rule 1.2.  See In the Matter of \r\n  Edens 344 S.C. 394, 544 S.E.2d 627 (2001) (attorney refinanced loan without \r\n  clientâ€™s consent);  In the Matter of Lewis, 344 S.C. 1, 542 S.E.2d 713 \r\n  (2001) (in approximately fifty-one instances, attorney signed settlement agreements \r\n  without clientâ€™s consent).\r\nIn this case, Respondent accepted Youngâ€™s offer to settle without consulting \r\n  Ms. Carmen and obtaining her consent.  Respondent denies that he and Young entered \r\n  into a binding settlement agreement.  Nevertheless, Young prepared an agreement, \r\n  and the court granted a Motion to Compel settlement.  That Respondent attempted \r\n  to reach Ms. Carmen when Young proposed the settlement demonstrates that he \r\n  knew he needed his clientâ€™s consent in order to proceed, yet he proceeded anyway. \r\n\r\nWe also hold that Respondent violated Rule 1.4 (a) and (b).  Rule 1.4(a) \r\n  states that â€œ[a] lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status \r\n  of a matter.â€   Respondent admits that he failed to inform his client about \r\n  the September 23, 2003 hearing.  \r\nRule 1.4(b) states that â€œ[a] lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent \r\n  reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding \r\n  the representation.â€  Respondent failed to inform Ms. Carmen about the settlement \r\n  negotiations.  He also failed to properly inform Ms. Carmen of her rights and \r\n  options upon his Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  \r\nWe hold that Respondent violated Rule 1.16, which states that â€œ[u]pon \r\n  termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably \r\n  practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice \r\n  to the client.â€   \r\nThis Court has reiterated the policy considerations of proper notice upon \r\n  intention to withdraw as counsel.  In Ex Parte Strom, this Court held \r\n  that â€œ[s]trong policy considerations dictate that a client and the court must \r\n  be unequivocally informed when an attorney intends to withdraw from representing \r\n  a party, for whatever reason.â€ 343 S.C. 257, 259, 539 S.E.2d 699, 701 (2000). \r\n   Respondentâ€™s notice was less than â€œunequivocal.â€  Ms. Carmen was entitled to \r\n  notice that Respondentâ€™s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel had been filed.  \r\nUpon learning that he missed the September 23, 2003 hearing, Respondent \r\n  engaged in a charade to conceal his mistakes.  Rather than trying to mitigate \r\n  the damage he caused to his client, Respondent orchestrated an unauthorized \r\n  settlement.  When his client would not consent to that settlement he attempted \r\n  to be relieved as counsel.  We believe that when an attorney attempts to cover \r\n  up bad acts in lieu of continuing to remain an active advocate for his client, \r\n  he subjects himself to substantial sanctions.\r\nConsequently, we suspend Respondent for one year, effective as of the \r\n  date of this opinion, and order him to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, of \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR .\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Reginald \r\n  I. Lloyd, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Dr. Peter Kilman, the coupleâ€™s marriage counselor, testified at the \r\n    hearing that, under his direction, the couple never underwent â€œGestaltâ€ therapy. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2] Respondent made mistakes in his efforts to make the documents appear authentic.  \r\n    He signed Mark Taylorâ€™s (â€œTaylorâ€) name as â€œMark J. Taylorâ€ but Taylor signs \r\n    his name â€œJ. Mark Taylor.â€  Respondent also misnamed Taylorâ€™s firm.  In addition, \r\n    Respondent signed Judge Ruckerâ€™s name â€œJ. M. Ruckerâ€ whereas Judge Rucker \r\n    signs his name â€œJohn M. Rucker.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    Warren Powell (â€œPowellâ€) has never represented Mr. or Ms. Hunnicutt.  \r\n    But Powell did represent Mr. Hunnicuttâ€™s first wife in her divorce with Mr. \r\n    Hunnicutt.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  See Mozingo, 330 S.C. 67, 497 S.E.2d 729 (1998) (disbarment \r\n    for signing judgeâ€™s name to a false letter); Walker, 305 S.C. 482, \r\n    409 S.E.2d 412 (1991) (indefinite suspension for signing circuit court judgeâ€™s \r\n    name to expungement order); Cate v.

As used in these Rules, &quot;fee&quot; is deemed to include a legal fee, \r\n  costs of litigation and disbursements associated with a legal cause, claim or \r\n  matter and &quot;client&quot; is defined as a person who has engaged the professional \r\n  legal services of an attorney who is a member of the South Carolina Bar. The \r\n  Board may decide fee disputes between two or more members of the South Carolina \r\n  Bar when those disputes arise from a single case or fee share provided all parties \r\n  consent in writing to the Board's jurisdiction.\r\nUnder no circumstances will the Board participate in: (1) a fee dispute involving \r\n  an amount in dispute of $50,000 or more, (2) the dissolution of a law partnership, \r\n  law practice or any other business relationship between attorneys, or (3) disputes \r\n  over which, in the first instance, a court, commission, judge, or other tribunal \r\n  has jurisdiction to fix the fee. When an allegation of attorney misconduct arises \r\n  out of a fee dispute, the Board, in its discretion, may (1) address the alleged \r\n  misconduct in its findings, or (2) refer the matter to the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conduct. If the alleged misconduct does not arise out of a fee dispute, it shall \r\n  be referred to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.\r\nNo fee dispute may be filed with the Board more than three (3) years after \r\n  the dispute arose.\r\nJurisdictional issues shall be determined by the circuit chair.\r\nRULE 12.Â  SCHEDULE OF PROCEEDINGS\r\n(A)Â All fee disputes should be resolved within six (6) \r\n  months. The assigned member's report should be completed within thirty (30) \r\n  to ninety (90) days after being forwarded by the circuit chair.

Ariail, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted \r\n  certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals erred by finding petitioner \r\n  was not entitled to a directed verdict on the charge of strong armed robbery.  \r\n  State v. Rosemond, 348 S.C. 621, 560 S.E.2d 636 (Ct. App. 2002).  We \r\n  affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was charged with strong \r\n  armed robbery, resisting arrest, and assault and battery with intent to kill.  \r\n  After being found guilty on all counts, he was sentenced to six-years imprisonment, \r\n  to be served concurrently, on each count.\r\nAt trial, Barbara Murray testified \r\n  she was working the second shift at a convenience store on the night of the \r\n  crime.  Around 9:00 p.m., petitioner walked in and, without speaking, entered \r\n  the bathroom.  At the time, Murray was on the other side of the cash register \r\n  sweeping.  After about five minutes, petitioner came out of the bathroom and \r\n  went behind the counter to the register.  Petitioner never said anything to \r\n  Murray.  He pushed the buttons on the register in an attempt to open it.  When \r\n  this failed, he grabbed the bottom of the two-piece register and flipped it \r\n  into the air.  The register fell on the floor and petitioner lifted it and slammed \r\n  it down.  The register popped open and petitioner grabbed the money and fled.\r\n Murray testified she was just a \r\n  few feet from petitioner at the time.  When petitioner went behind the counter, \r\n  Murray stated she ran behind the freezer door because she was scared.  In response \r\n  to the question about what exactly scared her, Murray stated:  â€œJust the way \r\n  he looked.  I mean, he didnâ€™t say anything.  He didnâ€™t move toward anybody, \r\n  he just looked, thatâ€™s all, it was like a glare.â€  She further testified petitionerâ€™s \r\n  act of lifting the register and slamming it to the ground frightened her because \r\n  they were â€œpretty heavyâ€ registers.  Murray identified petitioner as the perpetrator. \r\n  \r\nDefense counsel moved for a directed \r\n  verdict on the strong armed robbery charge and stated it should be reduced to \r\n  a larceny charge because petitioner did not act with force or intimidation when \r\n  carrying out his crime.  The trial court denied the motion.  Petitioner then \r\n  testified and denied being involved in the crime.\r\nThe trial court granted defense counselâ€™s \r\n  request that the court charge petit larceny, the lesser-included offense to \r\n  strong armed robbery.  However, the jury found petitioner guilty of strong armed \r\n  robbery and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Was petitioner entitled to a directed \r\n    verdict on the charge of strong armed robbery?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.  State \r\n  v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).  In reviewing a motion for \r\n  directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, \r\n  not with its weight.  Id.  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, \r\n  an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State.  Id.  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the appellate \r\n  court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.  Id.\r\nStrong armed robbery is defined as \r\n  the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property \r\n  of any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by \r\n  putting such person in fear.  State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 472 S.E.2d \r\n  241 (1996).  The gravamen of a robbery charge is a taking from the person or \r\n  immediate presence of another by violence or intimidation.  State v. Hiott, \r\n  276 S.C. 72, 276 S.E.2d 163 (1981).  When determining whether the robbery was \r\n  committed with intimidation, the trial court should determine whether an ordinary, \r\n  reasonable person in the victimâ€™s position would feel a threat of bodily harm \r\n  from the perpetratorâ€™s acts.  See, e.g., United States v. Wagstaff, \r\n  865 F.2d 626 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 491 U.S. 907, 109 S.Ct. \r\n  3193 (1989) (taking by intimidation occurs when ordinary person in bank tellerâ€™s \r\n  position reasonably could infer threat of bodily harm from defendantâ€™s acts).\r\nWe conclude there was evidence petitioner \r\n  took the money from the register in the immediate presence of Murray by force \r\n  and intimidation.  An ordinary, reasonable person in Murrayâ€™s position would \r\n  have felt a threat of bodily harm from petitionerâ€™s acts.  See State \r\n  v. Gourdine, supra; State v. Hiott, supra.  After petitioner \r\n  exited the bathroom, he immediately went behind the register and intimidated \r\n  Murray by glaring at her.  Further, after his attempt to open the register failed, \r\n  he acted with force by flipping the heavy register in the air and then lifting \r\n  it and slamming it down to open it.  Murray indicated she was scared because \r\n  petitioner glared at her and because he was able to lift the heavy register \r\n  and slam it to the ground.  These facts are sufficient to support the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to deny the directed verdict motion on the strong armed robbery \r\n  charge.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that Murrayâ€™s \r\n  fears of being harmed by the perpetrator were reasonable based on the testimony \r\n  of the arresting officers that petitioner punched and struggled with them and \r\n  lifted one officer off the ground and slammed him to the ground.  It is improper \r\n  to consider petitionerâ€™s subsequent actions because they are irrelevant to a \r\n  determination whether petitioner had acted with force or intimidation at the \r\n  time of the crime.  Accordingly, we\r\nAFFIRM AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25752","title":"State v.

Morgan, \r\n          of Aiken, for respondent/petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We \r\n  granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision [1]  holding that petitioner/respondent \r\n  Hookâ€™s statement to his probation officer was inadmissible at Hookâ€™s trial for \r\n  driving under the influence (DUI) third offense.  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nAt trial, the State introduced evidence \r\n  Hook was involved in an automobile accident in the early morning hours of January \r\n  15, 1999.  He failed to yield the right of way at an intersection and collided \r\n  with a Williston city police car.  Both Hook and the police officer were taken \r\n  to the hospital.  \r\nTrooper Cruz, who was called to the \r\n  crash scene, went to the hospital to question both parties.  Cruz asked the \r\n  treating doctor whether he could speak with Hook and the doctor gave his permission.  \r\n  According to Cruz, Hook appeared intoxicated and â€œsomewhat in painâ€ although \r\n  Cruz observed no physical injuries.  Cruz smelled a strong odor of alcohol on \r\n  Hookâ€™s breath and on his person.  When Cruz asked if he had been drinking, Hook \r\n  replied that he had â€œconsumed alcohol, mainly beer, at 2400 hours which was \r\n  12 midnight.â€  The wreck had occurred between 1:30 and 2:30 a.m.  Hook denied \r\n  he had used any illegal drugs.  Cruz placed Hook under arrest, read him his \r\n  Miranda rights and, with permission from the doctor, transported Hook \r\n  to the detention center for a breathalyzer test which Hook ultimately declined \r\n  to take.  During the next few days, while in jail, Hook began spitting up blood \r\n  and had to seek further medical attention.  He eventually had surgery to remove \r\n  a ruptured spleen.\r\n Hook testified he drank three beers \r\n  at home before dinner on the evening before the wreck between 6:00 and 7:30 \r\n  p.m.  He went to bed between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. but awoke later around 1:00 \r\n  a.m. and decided to return to his former residence to pick up a television set.  \r\n  On his way, the wreck occurred. \r\nOn cross-examination, Hook denied \r\n  he had used illegal drugs on the evening of the wreck.  The State then moved \r\n  to impeach Hook with a statement he made to his probation officer admitting \r\n  he had snorted cocaine on the evening before the wreck and that he was impaired \r\n  at the time the wreck occurred.  Hook strenuously objected that the statement \r\n  was privileged and inadmissible under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-290 (Supp. 2002) \r\n  which provides:\r\n\r\n  All information and data obtained \r\n    in the discharge of his official duty by a probation agent is privileged information, \r\n    is not receivable as evidence in a court, and may not be disclosed directly \r\n    or indirectly to anyone other than the judge or others entitled under this \r\n    chapter to receive reports unless ordered by the court or the director.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge ruled that Hookâ€™s \r\n  statement to his probation officer was admissible for impeachment only. \r\n  [2]   \r\nWhen cross-examination resumed, Hook \r\n  testified as follows:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    Q: \r\n    So \r\n      you did not tell [your probation officer] that you sniffed powder cocaine \r\n      the night of the accident?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    A: \r\n    No.  \r\n      The night of the accident was - when I went to sleep it was the 14th \r\n      and, you know, I woke up that night and really, you know, when itâ€™s 1:00 \r\n      or so, I still consider that even though it was actually the 15th, \r\n      I was still thinking of it as the 14th.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Q: \r\n    What \r\n      did you tell [your probation officer]?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    A:\r\n    Um \r\n      - I told him that I had used powder cocaine a couple of days before the \r\n      accident.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Q:  \r\n    How \r\n      about did you tell anyone else about this powder cocaine usage?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    A:\r\n    Um \r\n      - there was my other probation officer, Judy Brown.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Q:\r\n    You \r\n      did not tell Judy Brown that you used powder cocaine on the night of this \r\n      accident?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    A:  \r\n    I say \r\n      the day before the accident.  In other words, I was thinking of the day \r\n      of the accident as the 14th.

Brown testified that on January 15, at the detention \r\n  center, she had a conversation with Hook in which he told her that a friend \r\n  had brought some powder cocaine to Hookâ€™s home â€œand he sniffed it and he said \r\n  thatâ€™s what led to the accident.â€  Hook appealed the admission of this evidence.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed \r\n  and remanded for a new trial holding that (1) information received by a probation \r\n  officer is privileged under Â§ 24-21-290 and (2) because Hookâ€™s statement was \r\n  involuntary due to his medical condition, it was not admissible as impeachment \r\n  evidence.  \r\nISSUE \r\n\r\n\r\n  Is Hookâ€™s statement to his probation \r\n    officer inadmissible for impeachment under Â§ 24-21-290?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSection 24-21-290 provides:\r\n\r\n   1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all information \r\n    received by a probation agent in his official capacity is privileged;\r\n   2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this information \r\n    is not receivable as evidence in court; and\r\n   3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this information \r\n    may not be disclosed to anyone other than the judge and those specifically \r\n    entitled to receive reports unless ordered by the court or the director.\r\n\r\nThe State contends the phrase â€œunless \r\n  ordered by the courtâ€ in phrase (3) means the information received by a probation \r\n  agent in his official capacity is receivable as evidence whenever it is so ordered \r\n  by the court, and therefore Hookâ€™s statement was properly admitted.\r\nTo the contrary, we find the phrase \r\n  â€œunless ordered by the courtâ€ modifies only phrase (3), which relates narrowly \r\n  to disclosure, and does not modify the informationâ€™s receipt as evidence in \r\n  court, which is specifically prohibited under phrase (2).  We hold the Court \r\n  of Appeals properly ruled Â§ 24-21-290 does not allow the admission of a probationerâ€™s \r\n  statement as evidence in court simply because the judge orders it.  \r\nIn opposition to the Stateâ€™s position, \r\n  Hook contends Â§ 24-21-290 prohibits such a statementâ€™s admission in court for \r\n  any purpose, including impeachment.  We agree.\r\nBy its terms, Â§ 21-24-290 makes information \r\n  given by a probationer to his probation agent inadmissible as evidence in court \r\n  with no exception.  A plain reading of the statute leaves no room for grafting \r\n  onto it an exception to exclusion when the evidence is used for impeachment \r\n  purposes.  See State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847 \r\n  (2002) (the words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning \r\n  without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s \r\n  operation).  The question of admissibility under Â§ 21-24-290 is simply one of \r\n  legislative intent.  Unlike judicially-crafted rules regarding unconstitutionally \r\n  seized evidence, [3]  whether the statement is voluntary or involuntary \r\n  is irrelevant here.  Under Â§ 24-21-290, a probationerâ€™s statement to his probation \r\n  agent is inadmissible for impeachment regardless of whether it is voluntarily \r\n  or involuntarily given.\r\nBecause the Court of Appeals found \r\n  the voluntariness of Hookâ€™s statement dispositive rather than simply finding \r\n  the statement inadmissible under Â§ 24-21-290, we affirm as modified.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] State v.

[1]   Child was returned to mother \r\n  (mother and father were separated at this time) subject to conditions that the \r\n  family court judge set forth at a merits hearing.  Both mother and father had \r\n  to submit to drug testing, mother had to seek drug treatment, and they had to \r\n  complete a parenting skills program and a marriage counseling program.  If mother \r\n  failed a drug test, child would immediately be removed from her custody.  Mother \r\n  tested positive for cocaine shortly thereafter, and DSS regained custody of \r\n  child in November 1997.  \r\nA permanency planning hearing took \r\n  place on July 30, 1998, and the judge concluded that DSS should retain custody \r\n  of the child and that DSS could proceed to terminate mother and fatherâ€™s parental \r\n  rights to the child.  The following is a list of some of the events that transpired \r\n  between the initial merits hearing and the termination of parental rights hearing, \r\n  which was heard on July 20 and August 21, 2000 respectively: \r\n\r\n   1. Child was 4 years old when \r\n    initially placed in protective custody, and he could not eat with silverware; \r\n    he only spoke in one or two word phrases; he wet his bed and was not potty \r\n    trained; and he had problems walking properly.  \r\n   2. Mother and father attended \r\n    regular meetings with a marriage and family therapist, Dr. Harold Heidt (â€œDr. \r\n    Heidtâ€), for almost a year.  The visitations stopped in May 1999, and mother \r\n    and father returned to have therapy from February to July 2000 at their own \r\n    expense.  Dr. Heidt testified that as of May 1999, he was close to recommending \r\n    that the child be reunited with the parents, but as of the time that he testified, \r\n    in July 2000, he would have needed to have many more sessions with the parents \r\n    to determine if the child should return to the parentsâ€™ home.  \r\n   3. Mother and father successfully \r\n    completed the parenting skills program twice at Waccamaw Mental Health Center.  \r\n    Father would walk 2 Â½ hours to the class.  \r\n   4. Mother initially was asked \r\n    to give urine samples for testing for drugs, but after some problems arose, \r\n    she was asked to take blood tests.  Mother testified that she tested positive \r\n    on five occasions.  \r\n\r\nThe trial court determined that mother \r\n  and fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated based on the following grounds: \r\n  1) that pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 2000), mother and father \r\n  failed to remedy or rehabilitate the situation which caused the initial removal \r\n  of child; 2) that pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6) (Supp. 2000), mother \r\n  had a diagnosed drug addiction, which prevented her from providing minimally \r\n  acceptable care for the child; 3) that pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) \r\n  (Supp. 2000), the child had been in foster care for 15 of the previous 22 months; \r\n  and 4) that termination was in the best interest of the child.  \r\nMother appeals the family court determination \r\n  and raises the following issues on appeal:  \r\n\r\n   I. Did the family court err in \r\n    admitting evidence of drug test results from blood samples taken from mother \r\n    in May and June of 2000?  \r\n   II. Did the family court err in \r\n    terminating motherâ€™s parental rights because she failed to remedy or rehabilitate \r\n    the situation that caused the initial removal of child, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2), \r\n    or because she had a diagnosable condition that made it unlikely that she \r\n    could provide minimally acceptable care for the child, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6)?\r\n   III. Does the termination of motherâ€™s \r\n    parental rights based on Â§ 20-7-1572(8) violate her due process rights?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\nThe family court will terminate parental \r\n  rights and free a child up for adoption if it finds that one of the nine statutory \r\n  grounds for termination has been met and that â€œtermination is in the best interest \r\n  of the child.â€   S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2000).  The family court \r\n  judge terminated motherâ€™s parental rights pursuant to three statutory grounds.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1572(2), (6), and (8).  DSS must prove these grounds \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, \r\n  102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed. 2d 599 (1982); Richland County v. Earles, 330 \r\n  S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998).  When reviewing the family court decision, this \r\n  Court may make its own conclusion as to whether DSS proved by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence that parental rights should be terminated.  South Carolina DSS v. \r\n  Brown, 317 S.C. 332, 454 S.E.2d 335 (Ct. App. 1995).   \r\nI. Chain of Custody \r\n\r\nMother argues that the family court \r\n  erred in concluding that DSS had established a proper chain of custody for motherâ€™s \r\n  blood samples that were used for drug testing in May and June of 2000.  We agree.  \r\n  \r\nAlthough mother raises various issues \r\n  on appeal, [2]  in our opinion, the central issue \r\n  in this case is whether motherâ€™s drug addiction is so enduring that she cannot \r\n  parent her child. [3]   We find \r\n  that the full picture of motherâ€™s drug addiction is unclear because DSS did \r\n  not establish a proper chain of custody for key evidence that supported its \r\n  allegation that mother failed two recent drug tests.  \r\nMother presented evidence to support \r\n  her contention that she was trying to overcome her drug addiction and improve \r\n  her parenting skills.  The merits hearing judge ordered mother to submit to \r\n  drug testing, take marriage and family counseling courses, and seek drug treatment.  \r\n  Mother participated in all of these activities.  She failed to finish the marriage \r\n  counseling regimen with Dr. Heidt, but she and her husband later returned to \r\n  continue the counseling with Dr. Heidt.  However, the fact that she may have \r\n  tested positive for drugs in May and June of 2000 would seem to suggest that \r\n  despite her good intentions to become a better mother, she could not rid herself \r\n  of her drug addiction.  Therefore, motherâ€™s blood samples that were taken for \r\n  the May and June 2000 drug tests become highly important in determining the \r\n  progression of her drug addiction, and DSS must have established a proper chain \r\n  of custody for those samples in order to utilize the results to request termination \r\n  of motherâ€™s rights.\r\nDSS has the burden to establish a \r\n  chain of custody for the blood samples â€œas far as practicable.â€  State v. \r\n  Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 376 S.E.2d 773 (1989).  This Court has held:\r\n\r\n  [T]he party offering such specimen \r\n    is required to establish, at least as far as practicable, a complete chain \r\n    of evidence, tracing possession from the time the specimen is taken from the \r\n    human body to the final custodian by whom it is analyzed.  Where the substance \r\n    analyzed has passed through several hands the evidence must not leave it to \r\n    conjecture as to who had it and what was done with it between the taking and \r\n    the analysis.    \r\n\r\nBenton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. \r\n  26, 33-34, 100 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1957) (cited in Raino v. Goodyear Tire and \r\n  Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 258, 422 S.E.2d 98, 99-100 (1992)).  \r\nIn this case, DSS took a telephonic \r\n  deposition of Steven Ivey (â€œIveyâ€), an employee of LabCorp, which is the laboratory \r\n  that tested the blood samples. [4] \r\n    Ivey testified generally as to who would have handled the samples and \r\n  how the testing of the samples would have occurred.  However, he also testified \r\n  that he did not handle the samples, nor did he know which employee handled the \r\n  samples.  While the chain of custody that DSS is required to establish does \r\n  not have to be perfect, Ivey presented no direct evidence as to how those specific \r\n  blood samples were processed.  We find that Iveyâ€™s testimony does not establish \r\n  the practicable chain of custody of motherâ€™s blood samples that is required \r\n  by the Williams, Pellum, and Raino line of cases.  This \r\n  Court is unable to affirm the family court when key evidence of motherâ€™s alleged \r\n  pervasive drug addiction has not been authenticated.  \r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nWe REVERSE the trial court \r\n  and REMAND this case with leave to open the record to receive any other \r\n  evidence pertinent to a determination as to whether mother has overcome her \r\n  drug addiction and to give DSS the opportunity to present a proper chain of \r\n  custody for motherâ€™s blood samples.  \r\nWe leave for another day the analysis \r\n  of whether section 20-7-1572(8), the 15 months out of 22 months provision, is \r\n  unconstitutional.           \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES :  I agree \r\n  that this matter should be reversed and remanded in light of the evidentiary \r\n  error, but write separately to explain why I would not reach the constitutionality \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (8) (Supp. 2000).  \r\nThe decision to terminate appellantâ€™s \r\n  parental rights was based primarily on the family court judgeâ€™s finding that \r\n  appellant continued to use illegal drugs.  While the judge found that termination \r\n  was  proper under Â§ 20-7-1572 (8), it is unclear to me whether he would have \r\n  terminated appellantâ€™s rights for this reason alone.  Although this Court may \r\n  find facts on appeal in accordance with our view of the evidence, Hooper \r\n  v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999), I am not willing to sever \r\n  the parent-child relationship solely on the basis that the child has spent fifteen \r\n  of twenty-two months in foster care where the appellant presented substantial \r\n  evidence that much of the delay in the processing of this case is attributable \r\n  to the acts of others.\r\n  In keeping with our well-established \r\n  policy of declining to address constitutional issues unless necessary to our \r\n  decision, Morris v. Anderson County, 349 S.C. 607, 564 S.E.2d 649 (2002), \r\n  and since the family court did not rule on appellantâ€™s constitutional challenge, \r\n  Talley v. South Carolina Higher Educ. Tuition Grants Committee, 289 S.C. \r\n  483, 347 S.E.2d 99 (1986)(issue must be raised and ruled upon to be preserved \r\n  for appellate review), I would not reach the issue whether appellantâ€™s due process \r\n  rights were violated by a termination predicated on Â§ 20-7-1572 (8).  I concur \r\n  in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse and remand this family court order.  \r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Father spanked the child hard enough to leave his handprint on the \r\n    child.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Mother contests the family courtâ€™s finding of the three grounds for \r\n    termination and the manner in which DSS attempted to prove that she tested \r\n    positive in the two most recent drug tests.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  This issue focuses on the two grounds for termination, contained \r\n    in subsections (2) and (6) of Â§ 20-7-1572, which provide as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n  (2) The child has been \r\n    removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20-7-610 or Section 20-7-736, \r\n    has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption \r\n    of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department \r\n    and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused \r\n    the removal;\r\n\r\n \r\n  â€¦\r\n   \r\n\r\n  (6) The parent has a \r\n    diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, \r\n    but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, mental deficiency, mental illness, \r\n    or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition makes the parent unlikely \r\n    to provide minimally acceptable care of the child.  It is presumed that the \r\n    parent's condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time upon proof \r\n    that the parent has been required by the department or the family court to \r\n    participate in a treatment program for alcohol or drug addiction, and the \r\n    parent has failed two or more times to complete the program successfully or \r\n    has refused at two or more separate meetings with the department to participate \r\n    in a treatment program.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Section (6) obviously addresses \r\n    motherâ€™s potential drug addiction, and section (2) does as well because of \r\n    the requirement of a determination of whether mother has rehabilitated or \r\n    remedied the prior condition that necessitated the childâ€™s removal.  In this \r\n    case, the condition was drug abuse.  Consequently, we will combine both grounds \r\n    for purposes of this analysis.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  On the first day of trial, July 20, 2000, counsel for DSS brought \r\n    the positive test results to the courtâ€™s attention and requested that he be \r\n    able to take an expert witnessâ€™s deposition rather than bring the witness \r\n    to the courtroom because of the â€œunreasonableâ€ cost to bring him down from \r\n    LabCorpâ€™s office in North Carolina.  The trial judge granted counselâ€™s request \r\n    and instructed him to inform motherâ€™s counsel of the identity and expertise \r\n    of the witness one week prior to the deposition.  DSS counsel took the telephonic \r\n    deposition of the expert, Steven Ivey, on August 18, 2000, the last business \r\n    day before the trial resumed on August 21, 2000.  DSS failed to give a weekâ€™s \r\n    notice to motherâ€™s counsel as to the identity of the expert and when the deposition \r\n    would occur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25754","title":"Allendale Bank v.
