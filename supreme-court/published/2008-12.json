Bell, Jr. and Mitchell A. Norrell, both of Lancaster, for Petitioner.\r\n        James\r\n          Hugh Ryan, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We granted\r\n  petitioner Lancaster County Bar Associationâ€™s (Lancaster Bar) request to hear\r\n  this petition for mandamus and for injunction in our original jurisdiction.Â  At\r\n  issue is whether respondentâ€™s (Indigent Defense) construction of S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 17-3-510(A) (Supp. 2007), which determines the membership of each circuitâ€™s\r\n  Circuit Public Defender Selection Panel, is correct.Â  We find that it is, and\r\n  deny Lancaster Barâ€™s request for relief.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Sixth Judicial\r\n  Circuit is composed of three counties: Chester, Fairfield, and Lancaster, and its Circuit Public Defender Selection Panel will have five members.Â  Â§\r\n  17-3-510(A).Â  Indigent Defense proposes to allocate the five members of the\r\n  Sixth Judicial Circuitâ€™s Selection Panel as follows: 2 from Lancaster County, 2 from Chester County and 1 from Fairfield County.Â  The Lancaster Bar\r\n  challenges Indigent Defenseâ€™s method of calculating the positions, contending\r\n  that under the statutory formula the correct distribution is: 3 members from\r\n  Lancaster and 1 each from Chester and Fairfield.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whether Indigent Defense has properly construed Â§ 17-3-510(A)(1)?\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSection\r\n  17-3-510(A) provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)Â \r\n    There is created in each judicial circuit in the State a Circuit Public\r\n    Defender Selection Panel, the membership of which is composed of, and must be\r\n    elected by, the active, licensed attorneys who reside within the counties of\r\n    each judicial circuit.Â  Each county in each judicial circuit must be\r\n    represented by at least one member and the remaining members must be determined\r\n    by equal weighting of county population based on the most recent decennial\r\n    census and the most recent annual county appropriations to public defender\r\n    operations according to the following formula:\r\n  \r\n    (1)Â \r\n      percentage of distribution of population plus the percentage of distribution of\r\n      appropriations for public defender operations divided by two and rounded to the\r\n      nearest whole number;\r\n    (2)Â \r\n      the weighted values of each county multiplied by the number of remaining\r\n      members in each Circuit Public Defender Selection Panel determines the number\r\n      of additional members each county must have on the panel.\r\n  \r\n  Judicial\r\n    circuits with three or less counties must have five members.Â  Judicial circuits\r\n    with four counties must have seven members.Â  Judicial circuits with five\r\n    counties must have nine members.\r\n\r\nAfter assigning one seat to\r\n  each county in the Sixth Circuit, two seats must be allocated under the\r\n  statuteâ€™s formula.\r\nLancaster Bar asks\r\n  the Court to enjoin Indigent Defense from utilizing its interpretation of the\r\n  statutory formula in Â§ 17-3-510(A)(1) and to mandamus Indigent Defense to use\r\n  the Lancaster Barâ€™s interpretation instead. \r\nThe\r\n  parties agree on the percentages to be used under the formula, and the method\r\n  of calculation for the first two steps of the statute:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Chester&nbsp;\r\n    Fairfield&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Lancaster \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Population:&nbsp;\r\n    28.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    19.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    51.6\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      plus\r\n    \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Appropriations:&nbsp;\r\n    25.2\r\n    19.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    55.2\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n       equals&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    53.9&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    39.3&nbsp;\r\n    106.8\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    divided by 2:\r\n    26.95&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    18.65&nbsp;\r\n    53.4\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhile both parties agree to\r\n  this point, they disagree on the meaning of the requirement of Â§ 17-3-510(A)(1)\r\n  that following the division of the combined percentage by two, the result be\r\n  â€œrounded to the nearest whole number.â€Â  Indigent Defense contends that this\r\n  phrase requires that the percentages be rounded to the nearest whole number,\r\n  thus Chester becomes 27, Fairfield 19, and Lancaster 53.Â  Lancaster Bar\r\ncontends, however, that the requirement that after the percentage for\r\n  each county is obtained, it must be rounded to the next whole number results in\r\n  the following: Chester 0; Fairfield 0; Lancaster 1.[1]\r\nAlthough poorly\r\n  articulated in the statute, we hold that Indigent Defenseâ€™s interpretation of\r\n  the statute is correct.Â  If its view were not correct, then in any circuit in\r\n  which one county has more than 50% of the combined population and funding, that\r\n  county would automatically get all the â€œat largeâ€ members because the majority\r\n  countyâ€™s percentage would round up to 1, and all other counties in the circuit would\r\n  round down to 0.Â  Conversely, in any circuit where no county dominates, [2] then all counties will have percentages less than 50%, which under the\r\n  Lancaster Barâ€™s theory must be rounded down to 0.Â  Under this interpretation,\r\n  the â€œat largeâ€ members of the Circuit Panel could not be assigned since 0 times\r\n  the number of â€œat largeâ€ members will always equal 0.Â  To read the statute\r\n  other than as Indigent Defense has would be to rewrite it to read: In any\r\n  circuit where one county has more than 50% of the population and funding, it\r\n  receives all the â€œat largeâ€ members.Â  In any circuit where no county has at\r\n  least 50% of the population and funding, then no â€œat largeâ€ members will be\r\n  selected.\r\nIn construing a\r\n  statute, this Court will reject an interpretation when such an interpretation\r\n  leads to an absurd result that could not have been intended by the\r\n  legislature.Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 663 S.E.2d\r\n  484 (2008).Â  Since to read the statute any way other than has Indigent Defense\r\n  leads to an absurd result, we hold that Indigent Defense has correctly\r\n  interpreted Â§ 17-3-510(A)(1).Â  Accordingly, we deny Lancaster Barâ€™s request for\r\n  mandamus and injunction relief.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe petition for\r\n  mandamus and for an injunction is \r\nDENIED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]That\r\n  is, Lancaster Bar first converts the percentages to decimals, and then rounds\r\n  the decimal to the nearest whole number.Â  Thus, .543 becomes 1 while .2695 and\r\n  .1865 are rounded down to 0. \r\n[2] E.g., the Fourth and the Eighth Circuits. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26569","title":"Turner v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n          and Assistant Attorney General Michelle J. Parsons, all of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari from an\r\n  order granting him a belated review of his direct appeal issues pursuant to White\r\n    v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  We grant the petition for a\r\n  writ of certiorari, dispense with further briefing, reverse the order of the\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) judge, and remand this matter for an evidentiary\r\n  hearing.\r\nFollowing a trial, counsel is required to make certain the\r\n  defendant is made fully aware of the right to appeal.Â  White v. State,\r\n    supra.Â  In the absence of an intelligent waiver by the defendant, counsel\r\n  must either initiate an appeal or comply with the procedure in Anders v.\r\n    California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).Â  Id.Â  However, the standard for a\r\n  guilty plea differs.Â  Absent extraordinary circumstances, such as when there is reason to think a rational defendant would want to\r\n  appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal) or when\r\n  the defendant reasonably demonstrated an interest in appealing, there is no constitutional requirement\r\n  that a defendant be informed of the right to a direct appeal from a guilty\r\n  plea.Â  Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000); Weathers v. State, 319 S.C. 59, 459 S.E.2d 838 (1995).Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  pled guilty to the charges against him.Â  On PCR, petitioner did not allege he asked\r\n  counsel to file a direct appeal, he had viable issues for appeal, or there were\r\n  other extraordinary circumstances which would require him to be advised of his\r\n  right to a direct appeal from his guilty plea.Â  Petitionerâ€™s PCR application\r\n  merely states counsel failed to inform him of his right to appeal and he did\r\n  not know the law.Â  The State agreed to allow petitioner a belated review of his\r\n  direct appeal issues and petitioner agreed to withdraw his other PCR issues.Â  There\r\n  was no evidence at the PCR hearing that petitioner was entitled to be advised\r\n  of his right to a direct appeal from his guilty plea and was not advised of\r\n  that right, nor was there evidence petitioner requested counsel file an appeal.\r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge found counsel did not advise petitioner of his right to appellate\r\n  review and petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to a\r\n  direct appeal.Â  However, there was no evidence of extraordinary circumstances\r\n  which would require counsel to advise petitioner of his right to a direct\r\n  appeal.Â  Without evidence of extraordinary circumstances, the PCR judge erred\r\n  in finding petitioner was entitled to a belated appellate review of his guilty plea.Â  Roe\r\n    v. Flores-Ortega, supra; Weathers\r\n      v. State, supra.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the PCR judge is reversed and this matter is remanded for an\r\n  evidentiary hearing.Â  At this hearing, petitioner may present evidence on his\r\n  allegation that he is entitled to belated appellate review of his guilty plea\r\n  and any other allegations withdrawn at the original PCR hearing based on the Stateâ€™s agreement that petitioner was\r\n  entitled to a belated review of his direct appeal issues. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Ronald W.

Lounds.Â \r\n  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was indicted for armed robbery and kidnapping.Â  A jury\r\n  found petitioner not guilty of armed robbery but convicted him on the\r\n  kidnapping charge.Â  He was sentenced to life without parole (LWOP).\r\nAt trial, Todd Garrett testified that on February 18, 2000,\r\n  petitioner entered his warehouse in Greenville County and inquired about a\r\n  job.Â  When Garrett replied that petitioner would have to submit an application\r\n  at the companyâ€™s office located a few blocks away, petitioner â€œstepped a little\r\n  bit closer and pulled a gun out of his left hand pocket, kept it to his side and\r\n  said, give me your money.â€Â  Garrett stated he only had a couple of dollars in\r\n  his wallet.Â  Another man who had been standing in the doorway approached, and\r\n  helped petitioner pat Garrett down.Â  Garrett testified that petitioner asked\r\n  where the rest of the money was, and he said he had a little bit in a bank\r\n  account.Â  According to Garrett, petitioner and the other man pulled him up, and\r\n  led him out of the warehouse to Garrettâ€™s truck.Â  \r\nGarrett\r\n  testified that once in his truck, petitioner found a knife and held it to his\r\n  neck while the other man drove the truck.Â  After Garrett told them he did not\r\n  have an ATM card and would have to go into the bank, Garrett then suggested\r\n  they could go to his parentsâ€™ house to find some money there.Â  Garrett\r\n  explained that he believed his life was in danger if he did not â€œget them\r\n  something.â€\r\nAfter parking the truck in his parentsâ€™ driveway, Garrett,\r\n  petitioner, and the other man exited the truck.Â  Garrett advised the other man\r\n  that the keys to the house were on the keychain left in the truck.Â  When the\r\n  man went back to retrieve the keys, Garrett punched petitioner in the face and\r\n  ran away.Â  He noticed that the men had gotten back into his truck and were\r\n  coming back after him.Â  Once Garrett made it to a store, he called police and\r\n  reported the incident. \r\nThe\r\n  police officer left after taking Garrettâ€™s statement.Â  Garrett testified that\r\n  he and his father decided to â€œride through the neighborhoodsâ€ to find the\r\n  perpetrators or his truck.Â  They located the truck and told police its\r\n  location. The truck was impounded and a forensic investigation revealed a\r\n  fingerprint on the rearview mirror that matched petitioner.Â  Garrett identified\r\n  petitioner from a photo line-up and then again at trial.Â  Garrett testified he\r\n  had never seen petitioner before the day of the incident.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  testified in his own defense and related a much different account.Â  According\r\n  to petitioner, Garrett had bought crack cocaine from him on several occasions\r\n  from 1999 to 2000, and Garrett owed petitioner about five hundred fifty dollars\r\n  in connection with the drug deals.Â  Petitioner testified that he went to\r\n  Garrettâ€™s place of business on February 18, 2000, and asked for his money.Â \r\n  Petitioner stated he did not have a gun, he did not threaten Garrett in any\r\n  way, and he was not looking for any trouble.Â  When pressed on whether he had a\r\n  weapon, petitioner stated that he did not need a weapon since â€œthere was [sic]\r\n  two people.â€ \r\nPetitioner\r\n  further explained that Garrett â€œvolunteered to go to his peopleâ€™s homeâ€ to get\r\n  some money.Â  According to petitioner, it was Garrett who drove the truck, and\r\n  when he stopped it, he â€œgot out and took off running.â€Â  Petitioner took the\r\n  truck back to Garrettâ€™s warehouse and suggested that Garrett had moved the\r\n  truck to the location where police found it.Â  The following colloquy then took\r\n  place:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tYou did not commit this crime here?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tNo, sir, I didnâ€™t.&nbsp; If anything you can find \r\n\t\t\tme guilty of is taking his truck.&nbsp; I did that.&nbsp; You know \r\n\t\t\twhat Iâ€™m saying?&nbsp; I had to get back to my location.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThatâ€™s how my fingerprint got on that window.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tAll right.&nbsp; And you donâ€™t make money by \r\n\t\t\trobbing people?&nbsp; You sell drugs?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tYes, Sir.&nbsp; Got various drug charges to prove \r\n\t\t\tit.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  reply, the State recalled Garrett who denied ever buying or using crack\r\n  cocaine.\r\nDuring\r\n  deliberations, the jury returned to the courtroom with a request for a recharge\r\n  on kidnapping.Â  A few hours later, the jury again returned with a request to\r\n  rehear petitionerâ€™s testimony in full.Â  Ultimately, the jury reached its verdict\r\n  of not guilty on the armed robbery charge, but guilty on the kidnapping\r\n  charge.Â  Because of a prior conviction, the trial court sentenced petitioner to LWOP.[1]\r\nPetitioner\r\n  directly appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal. Â State v.\r\n    Lounds, Op. No. 2003-UP-408 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 18, 2003).\r\nThereafter,\r\n  petitioner filed for PCR.Â  Petitioner raised several issues at the hearing,\r\n  including that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and\r\n  prepare for trial, and for making improper comments during closing argument.Â \r\n  The PCR court denied relief and also subsequently denied petitionerâ€™s motion to\r\n  alter or amend the judgment.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Did the PCR court err in failing to find counsel ineffective\r\n  for inadequate preparation? \r\n\t2.&nbsp; Did the PCR erroneously find that counselâ€™s closing argument\r\n  comments were not improper?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn\r\n  order to prove counsel was ineffective, the PCR applicant must show:Â  (1)\r\n  counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) there is a reasonable probability\r\n  that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have been\r\n  different.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Rhodes v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002).Â  A reasonable\r\n  probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\r\n  of the trial.Â  Id. Moreover, â€œwhen a defendantâ€™s conviction is\r\n  challenged, â€˜the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\r\n  absent the errors, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting\r\n  guilt.â€™â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590,\r\n  596&nbsp;(2007) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 695).\r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his\r\n  application.Â  E.g., Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 509 S.E.2d\r\n  807 (1998).Â  This Court will uphold the findings of the PCR court if there is\r\n  any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300\r\n  S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  However, if no probative evidence supports\r\n  these findings, the Court will not uphold the findings of the PCR court.Â  Jackson v. State,&nbsp;355 S.C. 568, 570, 586 S.E.2d 562, 563&nbsp;(2003). Furthermore,\r\n  this Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an\r\n  error of law. Â Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225\r\n  (2000).\r\n1.Â  Inadequate preparation\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately prepare for\r\n  petitionerâ€™s trial, especially given the fact that counsel had ample notice\r\n  this was an LWOP case.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  criminal defense attorney has a duty to perform a reasonable investigation.Â  Ard\r\n    v. Catoe, 372 S.C. at 331, 642 S.E.2d at 597.Â  â€œ[W]hile the scope of a\r\n  reasonable investigation depends upon a number of issues, at a minimum, counsel has the duty to\r\n  interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.â€Â  Id. at\r\n  331-32, 642 S.E.2d at 597 (internal quotes and citation omitted).\r\nPetitionerâ€™s trial took place on December 4 - 5, 2001. Â At the\r\n  outset, trial counsel Greg Newell informed the court that petitionerâ€™s family\r\n  was â€œsupposed to bring several witnesses with themâ€ for petitioner.Â  Counsel\r\n  then requested a continuance because he had â€œfound out the names of\r\n  these people just this morningâ€ and therefore had not had a\r\n  chance to subpoena them.Â  (emphasis added).\r\nNewell\r\n  discussed witnesses for the defense a few other times during trial.Â  After a\r\n  pretrial hearing, Newell advised the trial court there were two witnesses who\r\n  would be arriving in the afternoon, but two others who were â€œnot available.â€Â Â \r\n  Newell offered his opinion that the unavailable witnesses would not â€œadd muchâ€\r\n  to petitionerâ€™s case, although he informed the trial court that the witnesses\r\n  would be able to connect Garrett with petitioner through drug dealing.Â  Later\r\n  that afternoon, counsel requested assistance to locate a witness named Elaine\r\n  Sara Hawkins who was in detention.Â  Hawkins, however, was unable to be located\r\n  either that day or the following day.Â  Newell told the court that he had spoken\r\n  to the two other witnesses, but contended they would not â€œadd that muchâ€ to the\r\n  case.Â  As a result, petitioner was the sole defense witness.\r\nAccording to the State, both petitioner and Newell had been served\r\n  written notice of the Stateâ€™s intent to seek an LWOP sentence on May 3, 2001.Â \r\n  Additionally, Newell was served again with notice on October 18, 2001.Â \r\n  Therefore, Newell had several monthsâ€™ notice petitioner was facing a LWOP\r\n  sentence if convicted.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner testified that Newell had not done\r\n  anything to investigate his case.Â  Significantly, petitioner stated Newell had\r\n  met with him only once - on the morning of trial.Â  Although Newell had\r\n  represented petitioner in a probation violation matter in August 2001,\r\n  petitioner testified Newell never discussed the armed robbery and kidnapping\r\n  charges at all. Â Petitioner further explained that on the morning of trial, he\r\n  gave Newell the names of witnesses who could identify Garrett as someone with\r\n  whom he had dealt.Â  Petitioner said Newell showed him some discovery that\r\n  morning, but Newell did not discuss the file; he simply asked petitioner to\r\n  look it over and if petitioner saw anything, to let him know.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  presented two other witnesses at the PCR hearing.Â  George Lounds, petitionerâ€™s\r\n  brother, testified that Garrett and petitioner bought and used drugs together.Â \r\n  George stated that Newell spoke to him before trial, and said he would get back\r\n  to him, but George never heard back from Newell.Â  According to George, if Newell\r\n  had called him to the stand, he would have testified about the connection\r\n  between Garrett and petitioner.Â  Moreover, George stated he was surprised when\r\n  he learned that petitioner had been charged with robbing and kidnapping Garrett\r\n  because the two of them were â€œalways togetherâ€ hanging out and smoking together\r\n  at a crack house.\r\nPreston Lounds, petitionerâ€™s nephew, testified that he had seen\r\n  Garrett purchase drugs and had also seen petitioner and Garrett together in\r\n    Garrettâ€™s truck.Â  Preston further testified he was at the courthouse during\r\n  petitionerâ€™s trial, but Newell never spoke to him.\r\nNewell did not testify at the PCR hearing.Â  The State attempted to\r\n  subpoena Newell for the PCR hearing, but was unable to successfully serve him.[2] \r\nThe PCR\r\n  court found that â€œtrial counsel adequately conferred with [petitioner],\r\n  conducted a proper investigation, and was competent in his representation.â€Â \r\n  The PCR court suggested that because Newell told the trial court the witnesses\r\n  would not â€œadd anything to the defense case,â€ it was a strategic reason to not\r\n  call the witnesses.Â  Moreover, the PCR court found it unlikely that George and Prestonâ€™s testimony â€œwould have overcome the victimâ€™s testimony at trial.â€Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find there is no probative evidence\r\n  to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings on this issue.\r\nWe\r\n  have recognized that when counsel articulates a valid reason for\r\n  employing a certain strategy, such conduct generally will not be deemed\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel. Â Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 560\r\n  S.E.2d 402 (2002); Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 419 S.E.2d 778 (1992).\r\n  Â The validity of counselâ€™s strategy is reviewed under â€œan objective standard of reasonableness.â€ Ingle, 348\r\n  S.C. at 470, 560 S.E.2d at 402. Â \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, however, Newell\r\n  did not articulate a strategy because he did not testify at the PCR hearing.Â \r\n  Although Newell did state to the trial court he believed the witnesses would\r\n  not add much to petitionerâ€™s defense, we find this was not objectively\r\n  reasonable given the defense theory of the case.Â  The only defense Newell\r\n  presented to the jury was that petitioner and Garrett knew each other through\r\n  drug dealing.Â  If witnesses other than petitioner were willing to testify to this\r\n  fact, certainly that would have added significantly to the credibility of\r\n  petitionerâ€™s case.Â  Thus, we find the PCR court erred in finding that Newell\r\n  offered an objectively valid strategic reason not to call these witnesses.\r\nFurthermore, both the trial transcript and petitionerâ€™s PCR\r\n  testimony inescapably point to the conclusion that Newell simply had not\r\n  adequately prepared the defense case.Â  Newell himself admitted to the trial\r\n  court he had only learned of defense witnesses that morning, and therefore they\r\n  had neither been interviewed nor subpoenaed.Â  Petitioner corroborated this at\r\n  the PCR hearing when he stated Newell had only spoken to him about the case on\r\n  the morning of trial. \r\nWe hold the evidence clearly shows that Newell inadequately\r\n  prepared for trial.Â  See Ard v.\r\n    Catoe, supra (at a minimum,\r\n  counsel has the duty to interview potential witnesses).Â  This was unreasonable in light of the\r\n  fact that Newell had several monthsâ€™ notice that petitioner was facing LWOP if\r\n  convicted.Â  Therefore, we find counsel deficient in this regard.Â  \r\nAs to\r\n  the prejudice resulting from counselâ€™s deficient performance, we believe petitioner\r\n  clearly was prejudiced by Newellâ€™s failure to subpoena and call witnesses who\r\n  would have supported petitionerâ€™s own testimony at trial.Â  With its not-guilty\r\n  verdict on the armed robbery charge, the jury necessarily rejected several\r\n  aspects of Garrettâ€™s account, and accepted as true certain parts of\r\n  petitionerâ€™s testimony.Â  Moreover, the juryâ€™s questions during deliberations\r\n  indicate it also struggled with whether petitioner was guilty of kidnapping.Â \r\n  Thus, we find that if additional witnesses had confirmed petitionerâ€™s testimony,\r\n  there is a reasonable likelihood the\r\n  result of the trial would have been different on the kidnapping count.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, supra.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the PCR court erred in not finding ineffective assistance of counsel on this\r\n  issue.Â  See Jackson v. State,&nbsp;supra (if no\r\n  probative evidence supports the PCR courtâ€™s findings, this Court will not\r\n  uphold the findings of the PCR court) Pierce v. State, supra (the\r\n  PCR courtâ€™s decision will be reversed when it is controlled by an error of\r\n  law).\r\n2.Â  Counselâ€™s closing\r\n  argument comments\r\nPetitioner also argues the PCR court erred in not finding counsel\r\n  ineffective for certain comments made during closing argument.Â  We agree.\r\nDuring closing argument, Newell essentially tried to point out the\r\n  inconsistencies and improbabilities in Garrettâ€™s account.Â  However, he also\r\n  offered his own characterization of petitionerâ€™s testimony, as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\tBut what it comes down to is two different storiesâ€¦ \r\n\tThe victim told a story.Â  And his story was that there was an\r\n  armed robbery.Â  And in the course of that armed robbery he was taken to his\r\n  parentsâ€™ home, let out, escaped, and then called the police.Â  My clientâ€™s story\r\n  is, and he admitted, I deal drugs.Â  I admit that Iâ€™m a criminal in that\r\n  respect, but I did not do this armed robbery.Â  I came there to collect some\r\n  money I was owed.Â  The guy had built up an account, I mean, and it was getting\r\n  too big.Â  And I wanted my money.Â  And I brought along a little muscle.â€¦Â  I\r\n    brought along a little muscle with me.Â  Two against one, hey, weâ€™re going to -\r\n    we want our money.Â  You owe us money.Â  We want our money.Â  A little bit of\r\n    leaning, not necessarily beating him up.Â  But Iâ€™m standing there, two big\r\n  guys, I need my money.Â  Okay.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner testified that Newell â€œrepeatedly pounded his right\r\n  fist into his left palm in a display of use of force to the jury.â€Â  According\r\n  to petitioner, Newell pounded his fist as he said, â€œI brought along a little\r\n  muscle.â€Â  Petitioner further maintained he told Newell that he did not rob or\r\n  kidnap Garrett and had not threatened Garrett in any way; petitioner specifically\r\n  denied he had told Newell he went with some â€œmuscle.â€Â  In addition, petitioner\r\n  stated that Newellâ€™s comments, coupled with the fist-pounding, gave the jury\r\n  the impression that petitioner used\r\n  force, which is an element of kidnapping.[3]\r\nThe\r\n  PCR court found that Newellâ€™s comments were not improper as he was â€œsimply\r\n  presenting to the jury an alternate explanation of events that was implied from\r\n  [petitionerâ€™s] own testimony.â€Â  \r\nIn our\r\n  opinion, there is no probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings on\r\n  this issue.Â  While Newellâ€™s comments were not an outright admission of\r\n  kidnapping, they significantly departed from petitionerâ€™s own testimony which\r\n  was that Garrett â€œvolunteered to go to his peopleâ€™s\r\n  homeâ€ to get some money.Â  The pounding of Newellâ€™s fist into his palm only\r\n  served to highlight the inference that petitioner and the other man had\r\n  threatened the use of force.Â  This form of argument did not advocate in\r\n  petitionerâ€™s favor, but rather tended to support the Stateâ€™s theory on\r\n  kidnapping.Â  Therefore, we hold Newellâ€™s closing argument comments were\r\n  improper and constituted deficient performance.Â  \r\nWe further find petitioner was prejudiced by Newellâ€™s closing\r\n  argument.Â  Both petitioner and Garrett testified that they went from the\r\n  warehouse to Garrettâ€™s parentsâ€™ home in the truck.Â  Thus, the elements at issue\r\n  were petitionerâ€™s intent, force, and the victimâ€™s consent. Â Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  credibility was crucial as to these elements. Â The jury clearly struggled with\r\n  whether petitioner was guilty of kidnapping as evidenced by its requests for a\r\n  recharge on kidnapping and the replaying of petitionerâ€™s testimony.Â  Yet, petitionerâ€™s\r\n  own counsel damaged the defense case because the closing argument did not\r\n  support petitionerâ€™s account of what had happened.Â  Cf. Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. at 472, 560 S.E.2d at 403&nbsp;(where\r\n  defense counsel put up a witness who gave testimony contradictory to the\r\n  petitionerâ€™s defense and was therefore â€œquite damagingâ€ to the defense, the\r\n  Court found ineffective assistance of counsel).Â  In other words, we find there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s improper\r\n  closing argument comments, the result of the trial would have been different.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  PCR court erred in not finding that counsel was ineffective.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the denial of PCR and remand for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in\r\n  1995.Â  He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, suspended on the service of\r\n  seven years and five years probation.\r\n[2] We note that the PCR\r\n  hearing was held in 2004.Â  In 2002, Newell was definitely suspended for nine\r\n  months. Â See In re Newell, 349 S.C. 40, 562 S.E.2d\r\n  308&nbsp;(2002). Newell was again suspended in 2003 for failure to comply with\r\n  CLE requirements.Â  It appears Newell currently remains suspended from the\r\n  practice of law.\r\n[3]Â  The trial court charged the jury that kidnapping has\r\n  four elements:Â  (1) intent (2) to take or carry away the victim (3) by force or\r\n  threat of force (4) without the consent of the victim.Â  Specifically as to the element\r\n  of force, the trial court stated that force â€œcan result from the threatened use\r\n  of force by placing that person in fear of losing his life or suffering bodily\r\n  harm.â€ Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26572","title":"Fulmer v.

App. filed May 19, 2006).Â  Â We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis is a dispute between siblings over the will of their mother,\r\n  Mary Fulmer, who died on April 29, 2002.Â  The petitioners are Jewel Oxner, one\r\n  of Mary Fulmerâ€™s children and the Personal Representative of Maryâ€™s estate, and\r\n  four of Jewelâ€™s five siblings.Â  Respondent is Janette Cain, the remaining\r\n  sibling.Â  In her 1998 will, Mary bequeathed 10.59 acres of property to Cain;\r\n  Fulmerâ€™s remaining real estate was to be divided equally among the remaining\r\n  siblings.Â  By a 2002 addendum/codicil, Mary bequeathed her house and pecan\r\n  trees to Cain.Â  \r\nIn December 2002, after Maryâ€™s death, Jewel Oxner, as Personal\r\n  Representative of the estate, brought an action in probate court to set aside\r\n  the transfer of funds in certain bank accounts which were jointly held by Mary\r\n  and Cain; Oxner also alleged fraud and sought to have the codicil set aside.Â \r\n  Cain counterclaimed for Oxnerâ€™s removal as personal representative, and sought\r\n  damages for waste, and the issuance of deeds of distribution.Â  \r\nIn February 2003, Oxner and her remaining siblings filed a petition\r\n  for formal testacy in probate court, challenging the validity of the codicil,\r\n  and listing Cain as defendant.Â  Attached to the Petition, the siblings filed a\r\n  complaint against Cain, reiterating the allegations of Oxnerâ€™s earlier\r\n  complaint, seeking to set aside the codicil and alleging fraud.Â  The complaint\r\n  also alleged causes of action for tortious interference with a contract and\r\n  tortious interference with inheritance rights.Â  The siblings requested\r\n  consolidation with the action previously filed by Oxner.Â  Cain moved to remove\r\n  the siblingsâ€™ action to circuit court; she also moved to dismiss the siblingsâ€™\r\n  action on the ground that another formal testacy matter related to the same\r\n  subject matter was pending between the parties.Â  \r\nThe probate court denied Cainâ€™s motions to remove and to dismiss,\r\n  finding Cain had waived her right to remove the siblingsâ€™ action by failing to\r\n  remove the action instituted by Oxner as personal representative; the probate\r\n  court granted the siblingsâ€™ motion to consolidate.Â  \r\nCain appealed, and the circuit court affirmed, without prejudice\r\n  to Cainâ€™s right to remove the consolidated action after the personal\r\n  representative filed an amended pleading in the probate court.Â  In an\r\n  unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals held the order, although\r\n  interlocutory, was immediately appealable inasmuch as it denied Cain a mode of\r\n  trial to which she was entitled.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in ruling the order denying Cainâ€™s\r\n  motion to remove was immediately appealable?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppeal may be taken, as provided by law, from any final judgment,\r\n  appealable order or decision.Â  Rule 201, SCACR.Â  Accord Culbertson v.\r\n    Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 471 S.E.2d 163 (1996) (general rule that only final\r\n  orders are appealable).Â  Appeals from the probate court are governed by S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308 (Supp. 2007), which provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tExcept as provided in subsection (g),[1] appeals from the probate court must\r\n  be to the circuit court and are governed by the following rules: \r\n\t(a) A person interested in a final order, sentence, or decree\r\n  of a probate court and considering himself injured by it may appeal to the\r\n  circuit court in the same county.Â  \r\n\r\nEmphasis supplied.Â  The order denying Cainâ€™s motion to remove is\r\n  not a final order, and is therefore not reviewable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-1-308.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals found that, although the order on appeal was interlocutory, it\r\n  was nonetheless immediately appealable because it denied Cain a mode of trial\r\n  to which she was entitled.Â  The Court of Appeals relied upon its opinion in Truluck\r\n    v. Snyder, 362 S.C. 108, 606 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Truluck was wrongly decided.Â  There, the Court of Appeals held the probate courtâ€™s\r\n  order denying the plaintiffâ€™s motion to remove a matter to circuit court was â€œa\r\n  final order for purposes of filing an appealâ€ (under S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-1-308), because it impacted the mode of trial.Â  362 S.C. at 113, 606 S.E.2d\r\n  at 794.Â  However, jury trials are available in the probate court.Â  SeeÂ \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 62-1-306.Â  Contrary to the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding in Truluck,\r\n  the order denying the plaintiffâ€™s motion to remove was not a final, appealable\r\n  order.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe cases of this Court permitting an appeal from the denial of\r\n  the mode of trial to which a party is entitled are distinguishable.Â Â  Salmonsen\r\n    v. CGD, Inc., 377 S.C. 442, 661 S.E.2d 81 (2008); Flagstar Corp. v.\r\n      Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 72, 533 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2000); Hagood\r\n        v. Somerville, 362 S.C. 191, 607 S.E.2d 707 (2005); Creed v. Stokes,\r\n  285 S.C. 542, 331 S.E.2d 351 (1985).Â  As Justice Pleicones noted in his dissent\r\n  in Salmonsen, â€œthe â€˜mode of trialâ€™ exception to the general rule that\r\n  only final orders are appealable is confined to orders which abridge a partyâ€™s\r\n  constitutional right to trial by jury.â€Â  377 S.C. at 461, 661 S.E.2d at 91.Â \r\n  Here, there has been no abridgment of Cainâ€™s right to a jury trial.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in holding the order denying Cainâ€™s\r\n  motion to remove was immediately appealable because it is not a final order, as\r\n  required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308.Â  Cf. Woodward v. Westvaco, 319\r\n  S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995) (order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction does not finally determine anything and is not\r\n  immediately appealable); Breland v. Love Chevrolet, 339 S.C. 89, 559\r\n  S.E.2d 11 (2000) (order denying a motion to change venue is not immediately\r\n  appealable); Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 477-78, 443 S.E.2d 379,\r\n  380 (1994) (order denying a motion for summary judgment is not appealable).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the probate court.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\nChief\r\n  Justice Toal:Â Â Â Â  I agree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s holding that this interlocutory order was not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  I write separately, however, to express my view that the probate\r\n  court properly consolidated the two cases.Â  Both matters involve the estate of\r\n  Mary Fulmer, similar questions of law and fact exist, and consolidation of the\r\n  actions will promote judicial economy and reduce the risk of inconsistent\r\n  rulings.Â Â  Furthermore, it is my view that considering the nature of this\r\n  consolidated action, Respondent has an absolute right to remove this case to\r\n  circuit court following the personal representativeâ€™s amendment to the\r\n  pleading.Â  Not only does the consolidated action relate to an amount in\r\n  controversy of at least $5,000, but also it involves a formal proceeding for\r\n  the probate of Fulmerâ€™s will.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(d)(1) and\r\n  (5) (2007) (providing that any action or proceeding\r\n  filed in the probate court and relating to formal proceedings for the probate\r\n  of wills and actions in which a party has a right to trial by jury and which\r\n  involve an amount in controversy of at least five thousand dollars in value\r\n  must be removed to the circuit court).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section 62-1-308(g) allows the parties, under\r\n  certain conditions, to consent to a direct appeal to this Court.Â  They did not\r\n  do so in the present case.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26573","title":"Williams v.

Williams was convicted of murder and sentenced\r\n  to death.Â  Petitioner has exhausted his appeals and now seeks a writ\r\n  of habeas corpus from this Court based on our decision in State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  873 (2007). \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn\r\n  1993, a jury found Petitioner guilty of the murders of his wife and son.Â  During\r\n  the sentencing phase, the solicitor stated\r\n  three times that he â€œexpectedâ€ the death penalty.Â  Defense counsel did not\r\n  object, and the jury sentenced Petitioner to death.Â  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s\r\n  convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal.Â  State v. Williams,\r\n  321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996).Â  Petitioner applied for post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR) raising three issues.Â  The PCR court granted relief on the third\r\n  ground.[1]Â \r\n  However, this Court reversed, finding lack of prejudice.Â  Williams v. State,\r\n  363 S.C. 341, 611 S.E.2d 232 (2005).Â  The United States District Court for the\r\n  District of South Carolina granted Petitioner a writ of habeas corpus, but the\r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district courtâ€™s decision.Â  Williams\r\n    v. Ozmint, 494 F.3d 478 (4th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S.Ct. 1445 (2008).\r\nPetitioner now seeks issuance of a writ of\r\n  habeas corpus based on this Courtâ€™s decision in State v. Northcutt, 372\r\n  S.C. 207, 641 S.E.2d 873 (2007), in which this Court reversed the defendantâ€™s\r\n  death sentence based upon the solicitorâ€™s improper statements in the sentencing\r\n  phase. \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because the solicitor improperly\r\n  stated that he â€œexpectedâ€ the death penalty during his sentencing argument.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  common law, habeas relief was only available to a convicted defendant to attack\r\n  the jurisdiction of the court imposing the sentence.Â  See Ex parte Klugh, 132 S.C. 199, 128 S.E. 882 (1925) (recognizing that habeas corpus is a collateral\r\n  remedy and calls in question only the jurisdiction of the court whose judgment\r\n  is challenged).Â  However, during the 1950s and 1960s, South Carolina courts\r\n  greatly expanded the use of the writ in order to ensure that our state afforded\r\n  prisoners a proceeding where they could assert claims regarding constitutional\r\n  violations.Â  See Simpson v. State, 329\r\n  S.C. 43, 44, 495 S.E.2d 429, 430 (1998)\r\n  (recognizing that the appeals in habeas matters\r\n  increased between 1950 and 1970 apparently in response to United States Supreme\r\n  Court decisions relating to the exhaustion of state remedies requirement for\r\n  federal habeas corpus relief).Â  In 1969, South Carolina adopted our version of\r\n  the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act (UPCA), which drastically limited the\r\n  availability of habeas corpus.Â  See James Blume, note, An\r\n    Introduction to Post-Conviction Remedies, Practice and Procedure in South Carolina 45 S.C.L.Rev. 235, 263 (recognizing that following the adoption of the\r\n  UPCA, post-conviction relief largely replaced habeas corpus relief).Â  The UPCA directed\r\n  that post conviction relief (PCR) was to encompass the relief available under\r\n  the common law writ of habeas corpus, the relief available under the expansion\r\n  of the writ, and the relief available by collateral attack under any common\r\n  law, statutory or other writ, motion, petition, proceeding, or remedy.Â  See Simpson, 329 at 44, 495 S.E.2d at 430; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-12(b) (2007).Â  \r\nIn a PCR proceeding, a\r\n  defendant collaterally attacks his conviction and may raise any claims of constitutional\r\n  violations relating to his conviction.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-12(a) (2007).Â  Every applicant has the right\r\n  to appellate review of the denial of PCR, and every applicant is entitled to\r\n  the assistance of counsel in seeking review of the denial of PCR. Bray v. State, 366 S.C. 137, 139-40, 620 S.E.2d\r\n  743 (2005).Â  Counsel is required to advise a PCR\r\n  applicant of the right to appellate review of the denial of PCR and to brief\r\n  arguable issues to safeguard the right to appeal, despite counselâ€™s belief that\r\n  the appeal is frivolous.Â  Id.Â  Although successive PCR applications are\r\n  disfavored, they are not prohibited.[2]Â  See Washington v. State, 324\r\n  S.C. 232, 478 S.E.2d 833 (1996) (allowing successive PCR\r\n  application where the defendant was denied due process due to numerous\r\n  procedural irregularities); Aice v. State, 305\r\n  S.C. 448, 409 S.E.2d 392 (1991) (denying a successive PCR\r\n  application where the defendant failed to show a sufficient reason to entertain\r\n  the successive application).Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the exhaustion of appellate review, including all direct appeals and PCR, habeas\r\n  corpus relief remains available to prisoners in South Carolina.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Const. art. I, Â§ 18.Â  Habeas relief is seldom used and acts as an ultimate\r\n  ensurer of fundamental constitutional rights.Â  For these reasons, a defendant\r\n  bears a much higher burden in a habeas proceeding.Â  A writ of habeas corpus is\r\n  reserved for the very gravest of constitutional violations â€œwhich, in the\r\n  setting, constitute[] a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal\r\n  sense of justice.â€Â  Green v. Maynard, 349 S.C. 535, 538, 564 S.E.2d 83,\r\n  84.Â  It is clear that â€œnot every intervening decision, nor every constitutional\r\n  error at trial will justify the writ.â€Â  McWee v. State, 357 S.C. 403,\r\n  406, 593 S.E.2d 456, 457 (2004) (quoting Green v. Maynard, 349 S.C. at\r\n  538, 564 S.E.2d at 84).Â  A defendant who seeks a writ of habeas corpus based on\r\n  an error recognized as a constitutional violation after his conviction must\r\n  show that, in the setting, the violation denied him fundamental fairness.Â  Butler v. State, 302 S.C. 466, 468, 397 S.E.2d 87, 88 (1990).Â  It is against\r\n  this backdrop that we must review Petitionerâ€™s case.\r\nAt the beginning of the sentencing phase, the solicitor stated that â€œweâ€™re seekinâ€™ [the death\r\n  penalty] and we expect to get it.â€ At the beginning of his closing argument,\r\n  the solicitor stated again â€œwe expect the death penaltyâ€ and finished his\r\n  closing argument with â€œ. . . you can give him what he deserves.Â  What he gave\r\n  them!Â  And we ask for it!Â  Be bold! Â Be strong!Â  Do what this case screams out\r\n  for!Â  We ask for it!Â  We seek it!Â  We expect to get the death penalty.â€Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that this Court should issue a writ of habeas corpus based on State\r\n    v. Northcutt, in which this Court reversed the defendantâ€™s death sentence\r\n  based in part upon the solicitorâ€™s statements that he â€œexpectedâ€ the death\r\n  penalty in his closing argument of the sentencing phase. Â Petitioner contends\r\n  that the solicitor injected his own authority into the juryâ€™s deliberations and\r\n  that the implication of the solicitorâ€™s argument was that his expectation was a\r\n  proper consideration for the jury to weigh in deciding whether to impose the\r\n  death penalty.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Northcutt,\r\n  this Court held that the solicitorâ€™s interjection of â€œexpectingâ€ the death\r\n  penalty required reversal because such comments imposed the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  personal beliefs upon the jury.Â  372 S.C. at 223, 641 S.E.2d at 881.Â  In our\r\n  view, Northcutt is inapposite.Â  The Court did not hold that the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s comments regarding â€œexpectingâ€ the death penalty constituted a\r\n  denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.Â \r\n  Rather, we held that the solicitorâ€™s closing argument as a whole[3] infused the sentencing proceeding with â€œpassion and prejudiceâ€ in violation of\r\n  S.C. Code Â§16-3-25(C)(1) (2003).Â  Northcutt at 222, 641 S.E.2d at 881.Â \r\n  Furthermore, unlike Northcutt which was a direct appeal, this case\r\n  reaches the Court in the posture of a claim for a writ of habeas corpus.Â  Petitioner\r\n  therefore bears a much higher burden in challenging his conviction.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, although the solicitor stated that he â€œexpectedâ€ the death penalty,\r\n  the totality of his argument did not â€œminimize the jurorâ€™s own sense of\r\n  responsibility for [Petitionerâ€™s] fate.â€Â  State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170,\r\n  175, 284 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1981) (holding that solicitorâ€™s attempt to minimize\r\n  juryâ€™s responsibility was improper).Â  Notably, the solicitor referenced the\r\n  jurorsâ€™ promise to â€œbase [their] verdict on the testimony and the exhibits and\r\n  the law presented,â€ and told the jury that after considering all of the\r\n  evidence, they should give â€œthe punishment that fits the crime.â€Â  Moreover, the\r\n  trial judge gave thorough instructions to the jury, including the statement\r\n  that â€œyou are never required to recommend the death penalty.â€Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  hold that Petitioner failed to show that, in the setting,[4] the solicitorâ€™s remarks \r\n  constituted a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of\r\n  justice.[5]Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  has been afforded more than sufficient judicial review.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Petitioner raised this issue on PCR, but was denied relief on this ground.Â  This\r\n  Court reviewed Petitionerâ€™s direct appeal as well as his PCR proceeding.Â  The\r\n  federal district court, the federal circuit court, and the United States\r\n  Supreme Court have also reviewed Petitionerâ€™s case.Â  Finality\r\n  must be realized at some point in order to achieve a semblance of effectiveness\r\n  in dispensing justice. Aice, 305\r\n  S.C. at 451, 409 S.E.2d at 394. Â At some juncture judicial review\r\n  must stop, with only the very rarest of exceptions, when the system has simply\r\n  failed a defendant and where to continue the defendantâ€™s imprisonment without\r\n  review would amount to a gross miscarriage of justice.Â  Id.Â  This is not\r\n  such a case.Â  We hold that Petitionerâ€™s conviction and sentence does not constitute\r\n  denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we deny the writ of habeas corpus.\r\nWALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., not\r\n  participating. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner raised the issue of the solicitorâ€™s improper closing argument in\r\n  this PCR application, but the PCR court denied relief on this ground.\r\n[2] In fact, Petitionerâ€™s PCR application mentioned above was successive.Â  The PCR\r\n  court allowed it to proceed on the merits finding that Petitioner did not\r\n  receive adequate assistance of PCR counsel in his first application.Â  \r\n[3] The solicitor in Northcutt, an infant homicide case, not only\r\n  stated that he â€œexpectedâ€ the death penalty, but also declared that it would be\r\n  â€œopen season on babiesâ€ if the jury did not return the death penalty and staged\r\n  a funeral procession with a black shroud draped over the victimâ€™s crib.Â  \r\n[4] We reject Petitionerâ€™s argument that â€œin the settingâ€ refers to all cases\r\n  containing similar facts.Â  Rather, â€œin the settingâ€ refers specifically to the\r\n  totality of the facts and circumstances in the defendantâ€™s case.\r\n[5] We recognize that this Court has granted habeas relief in other cases.Â  See Tucker v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 483, 552 S.E.2d 712 (2001)\r\n  (finding the combination of the judgeâ€™s withholding of pertinent information\r\n  regarding the deadlocked jury, the failure to instruct the jury not to\r\n  communicate the nature of its division in future deliberations, and the giving\r\n  of a coercive Allen charge shocking to the universal sense of justice) and Butler, 302 S.C. 466, 397 S.E.2d 87 (holding that a mentally retarded\r\n  defendant was entitled to habeas corpus relief where coercive comments made by\r\n  the trial judge violated the defendantâ€™s fifth amendment right).Â  In our view,\r\n  however, the circumstances in Tucker and Butler were extreme and,\r\n  unlike Petitioner, the defendants in Tucker and Butler were\r\n  denied fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26574","title":"Dargan v.

Ervin Dargan, Jr. and New River\r\n  Corporation (Appellants) appeal from an order finding James B. Tankersley and\r\n  the remaining parties (collectively, Respondents) were the owners of a disputed\r\n  parcel of property and awarding them damages.Â  We reverse.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nAppellants\r\n  brought this quiet title action to establish their ownership of a tract of real\r\n  property in Greenville County, South Carolina.Â  Respondents claimed an interest\r\n  in the property and asserted counterclaims for damages.Â  The disputed parcel is\r\n  mountainous property measuring approximately twenty-seven acres.Â  \r\nThe case was\r\n  referred to a master-in-equity, who found (1)&nbsp;Appellants failed to prove\r\n  by the preponderance of the evidence that they were the owners of the property;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;Respondents did prove by the preponderance of the evidence that they\r\n  were the owners of the disputed property; and (3)&nbsp;Appellants have damaged\r\n  the property owned by Respondents by cutting trees and preparing the foundation\r\n  for a road.Â  The master ordered Appellants to execute a quitclaim deed to the\r\n  property in favor of Respondents and to pay Respondents $25,000 in damages.Â \r\n  Appellants appeal from this order.\r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal,\r\n  Appellants argue the master erred in finding they had not proven their\r\n  ownership claim and that Respondents have established their entitlement to the\r\n  property and to damages.Â  We agree.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nAlthough\r\n  actions to quiet title are usually in equity, â€œwhen the defendantâ€™s answer\r\n  raises an issue of paramount title to land, such as would, if established,\r\n  defeat [the] plaintiffâ€™s action, the issue of title is legal.â€Â  Hilton Head Plantation Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v Donald, 375 S.C. 220, 223, 651 S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (citing Mountain Lake Colony v. McJunkin, 308 S.C. 202, 204,\r\n  417 S.E.2d 578, 579 (1992)).Â  In a case tried by a judge without a jury, the\r\n  factual findings of the judge will not be reversed on appeal unless found to be\r\n  without evidence that reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Id.\r\nAppellants\r\n  and Respondents own multiple tracts of property around the disputed\r\n  twenty-seven-acre parcel.Â  For simplicity, the property owned by Appellants,\r\n  which is south of the disputed parcel, shall be called the Dargan Property, and\r\n  the area owned by Respondents, which is north of the disputed parcel, shall be\r\n  called the Tankersley Property.Â  At issue is whether the disputed parcel, which\r\n  is in an overlap area between the two properties, is part of the Dargan\r\n  Property or the Tankersley Property. \r\nAs\r\n  noted by the master, it is undisputed that the Dargan Property, the Tankersley\r\n  Property, and the overlap area were once owned by a common grantor, the Saluda Land and Lumber Company.Â  Saluda executed two deeds that eventually led to the\r\n  competing claims for the twenty-seven acres.\r\nRespondentsâ€™\r\n  Title.Â  Respondents trace their title\r\n  to a deed executed by Saluda to one of their predecessors-in-title, Earle Hart,\r\n  in 1943 (the Hart Deed).Â  The Hart Deed conveyed several large tracts of land\r\n  described as the â€œBetty Orr Tractâ€ or â€œTract 1â€ (1,517 acres plus 82 acres) and\r\n  the â€œL. I. Jennings Tractâ€ or â€œTract 2â€ (835 acres).Â  The Hart Deed described\r\n  the property by metes and bounds and referenced a plat prepared by surveyor\r\n  Howard Wiswall, 1918-20 (the Wiswall Plat).Â  The Hart Deed description does not\r\n  include the twenty-seven disputed acres.Â  The twenty-seven disputed acres are\r\n  specifically shown on the Wiswall Plat as an overlap area lying between the L.\r\n  I. Jennings Tract, which is to the north, and the J. N., R. M. and Harvey\r\n  Cleveland (Dolton [T]ract),â€[1] which is to the south.Â  The Wiswall Plat includes a notation about what is\r\n  variously referred to as the Dolton Tract or the Dalton Tract.Â  The notation is\r\n  â€œ400 Ac.â€ - meaning 400 acres, and under that is the phrase, â€œLaps not\r\n  included.â€Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1951, Hart conveyed approximately 704 acres of this property to William\r\n  Goldsmith, Jr.Â  Hart simultaneously recorded a plat entitled the â€œHart Valley\r\n  Ranchâ€ Survey, which had been prepared in 1944, some sixteen months after the\r\n  deed from Saluda to Hart, and it was prepared at Hartâ€™s request.Â  The Hart\r\n  Valley Ranch Survey includes the twenty-seven-acre overlap area in the property\r\n  owned by Hart and transferred to Goldsmith.Â  In 1952, Goldsmith conveyed the\r\n  704 acres to some of the Respondents (James Tankersley and the now-deceased\r\n  Lowell and Posey Tankersley) by a deed that also referenced the Hart Valley\r\n  Ranch Survey.Â  The property owned by Respondents is what is now called the\r\n  Tankersley Property.\r\nAppellantsâ€™\r\n  Title.Â  Appellants trace their title\r\n  to a deed from Saluda to E. E. Dargan (the father of appellant E. Ervin Dargan,\r\n  Jr.) that was signed on June 28, 1951 and recorded on April 11, 1952 (the\r\n  Dargan Deed).Â  The Dargan Deed conveyed various interests in 85 parcels to E.\r\n  E. Dargan, including an undivided one-half interest in â€œParcel 10â€ that now forms\r\n  part of the Dargan Property.Â  Appellantsâ€™ remaining one-half interest in the\r\n  Dargan Property was conveyed by various deeds recorded between 1980 and\r\n  1995.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellants contend\r\n  their title to the disputed property comes from either of two clauses in the Dargan Deed.Â  They first assert the description of Parcel 10 conveys the\r\n  property.Â  In the alternative, they assert the language contained after all the\r\n  property descriptions, which they refer to as a â€œcatch-all provision,â€ conveys\r\n  the disputed property.\r\nParcel\r\n  10 Description.Â  Appellants first\r\n  rely upon the description of Parcel 10 in the Dargan Deed, which provides for\r\n  conveyance of the following property from Saluda to E. E. Dargan:\r\n\r\n\tAn undivided one-half interest in and to that certain\r\n  tract of land in Cleveland Township, Greenville County, State of South\r\n  Carolina, containing 400 acres, more or less, situate and lying to the South of\r\n  the property designated on the plat mentioned above as â€œL. I. Jennings Tractâ€,\r\n  and fully described on said plat as â€œJ. N., R. M., and Harvey Cleveland (Dalton\r\n  Tract) 400 acresâ€, reference to which plat is hereby craved for a complete and\r\n  accurate description of the area, metes and bounds of said property.Â  \r\n\tThere\r\n  is expressly excluded from this tract the following:\r\n\t(a) Â 16\r\n  acres, more or less, conveyed by the Grantor to Mark Jones, by deed dated May\r\n  26, 1934, recorded in the said [R.M.C.] Office in Deed Book 132, at page 196.\r\n\t(b)Â \r\n  Right-of-way granted by the Grantor to Duke Power Co., by deed dated May 27,\r\n  1937, recorded in the said R.M.C. Office in Deed Book 199, at page 121.\r\n\tThe\r\n  tract above conveyed contains approximately 384 acres.Â  \r\n\r\nAppellants assert\r\n  the master should have found the Parcel 10 legal description in the Dargan Deed\r\n  conveyed the disputed area to them because it indicated the property being\r\n  conveyed was the tract of land lying to the south of the L. I. Jennings Tract\r\n  as shown on the Wiswall Plat, and the tract of land to the south is the Dalton\r\n  Tract.Â  Additionally, since Parcel 10 refers to the Wiswall Plat, the plat is\r\n  part of the deed.Â  Appellants assert that an ambiguity arises as to whether the\r\n  overlap area shown on the Wiswall Plat is included in the Dalton Tract, which\r\n  is the parcel of land lying to the south of the L. I. Jennings Tract referred to\r\n  in the Parcel 10 description in the Dargan Deed.Â  Appellants argue that due to\r\n  the ambiguity, the master should have considered the surrounding circumstances\r\n  and found the overlap property was conveyed in the Parcel 10 description of the\r\n  Dargan Deed.Â  They note the metes and bounds description of the property in the\r\n  deed from Saluda to Hart, Respondentsâ€™ predecessor-in-title, excluded the\r\n  overlap area; thus, it fell within the parameters of what was conveyed to them\r\n  in Parcel 10.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  rejecting Appellantsâ€™ claim that the Parcel 10 legal description in the Dargan\r\n  Deed conveyed the overlap area to Appellants, the master made the following\r\n  findings:Â  (1)&nbsp;the disputed property is shown on the Wiswall Plat as an\r\n  overlap in the southern portion of what is now the Tankersley Property and on\r\n  the northern portion of what is now the Dargan Property, (2) the Wiswall Plat\r\n  specifically states on its face that â€œlapsâ€ are not included in what was called\r\n  the Dalton Tract and is now the Dargan Property, (3) a calculation of acreage\r\n  based on the calls, metes, and bounds shown on the Wiswall Plat confirms that\r\n  the overlap area is not part of the Dargan Property, (4) the Hart Valley Ranch\r\n  Survey includes the overlap property in the Tankersley Property, (5) the\r\n  overlap area is not included in a metes and bounds description in the 1943 deed\r\n  from Saluda to Hart in Respondentsâ€™ chain of title, (6) the property is\r\n  included by reference to the Hart Valley Ranch Survey in the 1951 deed from\r\n  Hart to Respondentsâ€™ predecessor-in-title, and (7) the property is not included\r\n  in the Dargan Deed in the Parcel 10 description because the description craves\r\n  reference to the Wiswall Plat, which the master noted he had already determined\r\n  did not include the overlap area as part of the Dalton Tract that had become\r\n  the Dargan Property.Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree\r\n  with the masterâ€™s conclusion that the Parcel 10 description in the Dargan Deed\r\n  did not convey the overlap property to Appellants.Â  Although the Dargan Deed\r\n  describes the property as being south of the L. I. Jennings Tract, it further\r\n  identifies it as being the 400 acres shown on the Wiswall Plat as the Dalton\r\n  Tract, and the Wiswall Plat expressly indicates the Dalton Tract is 400 acres\r\n  with â€œ[l]aps not included.â€Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted by the master, Appellantsâ€™ own witness, surveyor Ray Dunn, acknowledged\r\n  during cross-examination that the overlap area is not included on the Wiswall\r\n  Plat as being part of what is now the Dargan Property because it is designated\r\n  on the Wiswall Plat as a â€œlapâ€ and is specifically excluded from the acreage\r\n  description.Â Â Â  \r\nAn\r\n  expert witness for Respondents, surveyor Dick Williams, testified that he found\r\n  the Wiswall Plat to be very reliable, and he calculated the acreage of the\r\n  Dargan Property from the calls, metes, and bounds shown on the Wiswall Plat for\r\n  the Dalton Property and determined that Wiswallâ€™s calculation of 400 acres does\r\n  not include the disputed overlap property.Â  He stated the Wiswall Plat itself\r\n  notes that the Dalton Tract consists of 400 acres and indicates â€œLaps not\r\n  included,â€ which he said â€œmeans that any laps are not included in that 400\r\n  acres.â€Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the Parcel 10 description did not convey the overlap property\r\n  to Appellants.Â  It is not necessary to rely upon the additional grounds\r\n  enumerated by the master to reach this conclusion.Â  \r\nCatch-All\r\n  Provision.Â  Appellants next assert\r\n  the master erred in finding the catch-all provision in the Dargan Deed did not\r\n  provide an alternative basis for finding they owned the twenty-seven acres in\r\n  dispute.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  Dargan Deed enumerates and describes 85 separate parcels, after which there is\r\n  the following provision wherein Saluda states it is conveying to E. E. Dargan\r\n  all other real estate that Saluda owned in Greenville County and Pickens County:\r\n\r\n\tTOGETHER with any and all other real estate owned\r\n  directly by the Grantor in Greenville and Pickens Counties, State of South\r\n  Carolina, together with all easements, rights-of-way, reversions or other\r\n  rights of any kind, as the Grantor may own directly in connection with any of\r\n  the above described real estate, it being the intent of the Grantor by this\r\n    deed to convey to the Grantee herein named, all real estate or other rights in\r\n    real estate owned directly by the Grantor.Â  [Emphasis added.]\r\n\r\nThe master found\r\n  this catch-all provision was â€œso broad as to be ineffective because it offers\r\n  no means of identifying the Property [the parcel in dispute], particularly in\r\n  light of the fact that the Dargan Deed contains no fewer than 85 specific,\r\n  identifiable, and fully-described parcels of property.â€Â  The master observed\r\n  that â€œa conveyance through a deed is not like a will, and deeds must\r\n  necessarily identify the property being conveyed.â€Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  their briefs, Appellants and Respondents state South Carolina courts have not\r\n  directly ruled on the validity of catch-all provisions, although they note we\r\n  have made a passing reference to such provisions in one case, Hamilton v.\r\n    CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 155, 263 S.E.2d 378, 379-80 (1980) (â€œIn 1975\r\n  Lighthouse Beach Company was dissolved and its properties were divided between\r\n  Sea Pines and Travelers through the execution of two deeds.Â  Each of these\r\n  deeds conveyed numerous parcels of land, although neither deed made specific\r\n  reference to Parcel B-2.Â  It was thereafter discovered that Parcel B-2 had not\r\n  been specifically conveyed to either Travelers or Sea Pines but that title to a\r\n  tract of land which included Parcel B-2 had in fact passed by virtue of a\r\n  residual or catch-all clause contained in the dissolution deed from Lighthouse\r\n  Beach Company to Sea Pines.Â  Upon this discovery, this tract of land was\r\n  conveyed in 1976 by Sea Pines to Travelers.Â  Travelers then conveyed the\r\n  property, including Parcel B-2, to CCM.â€).\r\nRespondents\r\n  state the Court in Hamilton did not cite the language of the dissolution\r\n  deed, but they concede that â€œit would appear that South Carolina courts will\r\n  accept the use of a catch[-]all provision under certain circumstances.â€Â \r\n  Respondents argue the description here was too vague, however, to operate as a\r\n  valid conveyance.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina has expressly recognized the\r\n  validity of a catch-all provision.Â  In Sally v. Gunter, 47 S.C.L. (13\r\n  Rich.) 72 (1860), one of the issues on appeal concerned a challenge to a deed\r\n  that was issued from an executor to an individual.Â  The first part of the deed\r\n  described twenty-seven tracts of land to be conveyed, then provided for the\r\n  conveyance of all additional real estate owned in South Carolina as follows:Â \r\n  â€œ[T]ogether with all other lands and real estates whatsoever and wheresoever\r\n  situated in the State of South Carolina.â€Â  Id. at 74 note (a).Â  The land\r\n  in dispute was not included in the property that was specifically described.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  appellant challenged the deed on the basis that it did not describe the land in\r\n  dispute with legal and sufficient certainty and that the deed was, therefore,\r\n  void for uncertainty.Â  Id. at 73.Â  The appellate court rejected this\r\n  argument and found the description was sufficient, citing the maxim â€œid certum\r\n  est, quod certum reddi potestâ€ - i.e., â€œthat is certain which can be made\r\n  certain.â€Â  Id. at 76; see also Carolina Helicopter Corp. v.\r\n    Cutter Realty Co., 139 S.E.2d 362, 366 (N.C. 1964) (defining this legal\r\n  maxim).\r\nThe\r\n  weight of authority holds that such catch-all provisions are sufficient to\r\n  transfer title.Â  See W.S.R., Annotation, Sufficiency and Construction\r\n    of Description in Deed or Mortgage as â€˜Allâ€™ of Grantorâ€™s Property, or â€˜Allâ€™ of\r\n    his Property in Certain Locality, 55 A.L.R. 162, 163 (1928) (â€œBy the weight\r\n  of authority, a deed or mortgage, describing the subject-matter as â€˜allâ€™ of the\r\n  grantorâ€™s property, or â€˜allâ€™ of his property in a certain locality, is not\r\n  defective or void for want of a sufficient description.â€ (citing, among other\r\n  cases, Sally v. Gunter)).Â  This principle has long been recognized by\r\n  various courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States.Â  See, e.g., Wilson v. Boyce, 92 U.S. 320, 325 (1875) (holding a deed â€œof all my\r\n  estateâ€ or â€œof all my lands wherever situatedâ€ is sufficient to pass title).\r\nAlthough\r\n  there may be situations where a party may not be on notice of a catch-all\r\n  provision, that does not appear to be the situation in the current appeal.Â  Notice\r\n  is sufficient if it puts anyone in the chain of title on notice.Â  See Fuller-Ahrens\r\n    Pâ€™ship v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 311 S.C.\r\n  177, 181, 427 S.E.2d 920, 923 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Carolina Land Co. v.\r\n    Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 217 S.E.2d 16 (1975)).Â  The catch-all provision was in\r\n  a deed recorded within the chain of title of what is now the Dargan Property,\r\n  and the overlap area was clearly exempted from the metes and bounds description\r\n  of what is now the Tankersley Property in Respondentsâ€™ chain of title. \r\nThe\r\n  master concluded Respondents had established title to the disputed parcel.Â  In\r\n  so doing, however, the master specifically acknowledged and found that the\r\n  disputed parcel â€œis not included in a metes and bounds description in the 1943\r\n  deed from Saluda to Hart in [Respondentsâ€™] chain of title.â€Â  Nevertheless, the\r\n  master found the disputed parcel â€œis included by reference to the Hart Valley\r\n  Ranch Survey in the 1951 deed from Hart to [Respondentsâ€™] predecessor in\r\n  title.Â  The clear inference is that Hart was conveying what he felt he owned,\r\n  including the [disputed parcel].â€Â  The master further noted that the Hart\r\n  Valley Ranch Survey includes the disputed parcel in the area that is now the\r\n  Tankersley Property.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master correctly observed that the metes and bounds description of the L. I.\r\n  Jennings Tract (or Tract 2) in the Hart Deed does not include the overlap area,\r\n  as the description expressly follows a path around the overlap.Â  Based on this\r\n  fact, the master erred in finding that, simply because Hart included the\r\n  disputed parcel in a plat he prepared and then purported to transfer this\r\n  property, that he (and his successors) somehow acquired legal title to the\r\n  disputed parcel.Â  The fact that Hart included property that â€œhe felt he ownedâ€\r\n  does not transform the legal title.Â  Although Respondents pled other grounds\r\n  for acquiring ownership the master did not rule on them.[2]Â \r\n  The basis for the masterâ€™s ruling is that Respondents had legal title to the\r\n  property from their chain of title.Â  We hold this was error as the deeds in\r\n  this case indicate the property was conveyed in Appellantsâ€™ chain-of-title\r\n  under the catch-all provision whereby Saluda expressly stated it was its intent\r\n  was to distribute all of its remaining property.\r\nIII.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we conclude Appellants have established their ownership of\r\n  the twenty-seven-acre parcel via the catch-all provision in the deed in their\r\n  chain of title.Â  Therefore, we reverse the masterâ€™s ruling that Respondents are\r\n  the owners of the disputed parcel and that they are entitled to a quitclaim\r\n  deed and damages.[3]\r\nREVERSED.Â \r\n  Â \r\nWALLER and PLEICONES JJ., concur. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a separate opinion in which\r\n  TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in result and the reasoning of the\r\n  majority concerning Respondentsâ€™ lack of ownership of the disputed tract, a\r\n  tract of approximately thirty acres referred to as the â€œlapsâ€ or the overlap\r\n  area.Â  I write separately because of the incongruity of a deed that excludes a\r\n  tract of land juxtaposed to a catch-all provision.\r\nI\r\n  begin with the premise that the relevant inquiry is to ascertain the intent of\r\n  the grantor, the Saluda Land and Lumber Company (Saluda).Â  Gardner v.\r\n    Mozingo, 293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 391 (1987) (â€œIn construing a\r\n  deed, the intention of the grantor must be ascertained and effectuated . . .\r\n  .â€).Â  In the construction of deeds, we are usually confronted with a detailed\r\n  description of the property sought to be conveyed.Â  Yet jurisprudence is fairly\r\n  uniform to the effect that catch-all provisions are not defective for want of a\r\n  sufficient description.Â  The majority opinion cites to W.S.R., Annotation, Sufficiency\r\n    and Construction of Description in Deed or Mortgage as â€œAllâ€ of Grantorâ€™s\r\n    Property, or â€œAllâ€ of his Property in Certain Locality, 55 A.L.R. 162, 163\r\n  (1928) (â€œA deed is generally held not to be ineffective because it describes\r\n  the property conveyed as all the real estate belonging to the grantor.â€).Â  See\r\n    also 23 Am. Jur. 2d Deeds Â§ 49 (2002) (â€œA deed\r\n  describing land as â€˜allâ€™ the grantorâ€™s property or â€˜allâ€™ his property in a\r\n  certain locality is not defective or void for want of a sufficient description\r\n  . . . .â€).\r\nCatch-all\r\n  provisions may even convey all of a grantorâ€™s property when the deed\r\n  specifically describes property which does not include the property in\r\n  question.Â  Sally v. Gunter, 47 S.C.L. (13 Rich.) 72 (1860) (holding that\r\n  disputed land not included in the twenty-seven tracts described in deed was\r\n  conveyed under a catch-all provision); see also Hightower v. Blakely Hard Wood\r\n    Lumber Co., 137 S.E. 22, 23 (Ga. 1927) (holding that a deed containing\r\n  several described tracts, followed by a conveyance of â€œalso any and all other\r\n  lots owned by me anywhere not herein enumerated,â€ was sufficiently definite to\r\n  convey the disputed, non-described tract).Â  The consistent theme in the cases\r\n  giving efficacy to catch-all provisions is the recognition that the grantor\r\n  intended to convey the disputed tract, notwithstanding the absence of a\r\n  detailed description.\r\nAppellantsâ€™\r\n  ownership claim of the disputed tractâ€”the â€œlapsâ€â€”turns on the construction of\r\n  the deed recorded on April 11, 1952 (the Dargan Deed).Â  The Dargan Deed\r\n  conveyed eighty-five specifically described tracts, followed by a broad\r\n  catch-all provision, including language that the property was conveyed\r\n  â€œTOGETHER with any and all other real estate owned directly by the Grantor in\r\n  Greenville and Pickens Counties . . . [and it is] the intent of the Grantor by\r\n  this deed to convey to the Grantee herein named, all real estate or other\r\n  rights in real estate owned directly by the Grantor.â€Â  As determined in the\r\n  majority opinion, Appellants may not rely on â€œParcel 10â€ referenced in the\r\n  Dargan Deed.Â  Parcel 10 incorporates the Wiswall Plat; the Wiswall Plat shows\r\n  the disputed tract, but the metes and bounds description in the plat\r\n  specifically excludes the disputed tract.Â  We are thus presented with\r\n  the unusual situation of an exclusion of a tract juxtaposed to a catch-all\r\n  provision.Â  Does a catch-all provision include a tract that is identified but\r\n  excluded in the deed?Â  I answer that question withâ€”it depends.Â  More to the\r\n  point, it depends on the intent of the grantor.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, it is manifest that Saluda intended the catch-all to convey all of\r\n  its interest in the property, including the disputed tract.Â  Saluda at one time\r\n  owned thousands of acres in this area.Â  Saluda ceased its lumber business and\r\n  began selling its property in Greenville and Pickens Counties years prior to\r\n  the Dargan Deed.[4]Â \r\n  Saludaâ€™s final sale was the Dargan Deed, which went to great lengths to\r\n  specifically describe eighty-five separate parcels.Â  The Dargan Deed concluded\r\n  with the broad catch-all provision noted above.Â  Given the multiple deeds out\r\n  from Saluda, the intended finality of the Dargan Deed, and the arguably\r\n  difficult task associated with construing the Wiswall Plat, I find the grantor Saluda\r\n  intended to convey the disputed tract to Appellantsâ€™ predecessor-in-title\r\n  through the catch-all provision in the Dargan Deed.\r\nUnder\r\n  the circumstances presented, the unmistakable intention of Saluda was to convey\r\n  whatever remaining interest in real property it had in 1952.Â  It defies all\r\n  reason to infer an intent on the part of Saluda to convey all of its property\r\n  except this inaccessible small tract.Â  In concurring with the result of the\r\n  majority, my analysis rests on ascertaining the intent of the grantor.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The Wiswall Plat itself appears to refer to the â€œDolton [T]ract,â€ but the plat is not clear and the parties (and other documents) have also referred\r\n  to this as the â€œDalton Tract.â€\r\n[2]Â  Although not ruled upon by the master, Respondents pled adverse possession and the forty year\r\n  statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-380 (2005).Â  At oral argument, Respondents\r\n  asserted the evidence showed they had\r\n  been using the property for thirty-seven years.Â  This is less than the\r\n  statutory period, in any event.\r\n[3]Â  Based on our disposition, we need not reach\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ remaining allegation of error regarding the exclusion of an expert\r\n  witness. \r\n[4]&nbsp; One example of a previous conveyance is the\r\n  1943 Hart Deed from Saluda to one of Respondentsâ€™ predecessors-in-title. Â For\r\n  the reasons discussed in the majority opinion, Respondentsâ€™ claim to the â€œlapsâ€\r\n  fails because of the inclusion of the Wiswall Plat in the 1943 Hart Deed and\r\n  the exclusion of the â€œlapsâ€ by the platâ€™s mete and bounds description.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26543","title":"Council v.

Councilâ€™s (Respondentâ€™s)\r\n  sentence of death; grant a new hearing for the penalty phase of his capital\r\n  murder trial; and continue indefinitely one of his PCR grounds until Respondent\r\n  regained competence.Â  After we issued our original opinion affirming in part,\r\n  reversing in part, and remanding for a new sentencing hearing, the State\r\n  petitioned for rehearing.Â  We deny the petition for rehearing, withdraw our\r\n  original opinion, and substitute it with this opinion which revises footnote\r\n  number seven.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn the evening of October\r\n  9, 1992, police discovered the body of seventy-two-year-old Elizabeth Gatti\r\n  underneath a bedspread in her basement. Â She had been hogtied with a white cord\r\n  and layers of duct tape were wrapped around her entire head. Â Her clothes had\r\n  been ripped, and the crotch of her underwear had been cut out. Â Surrounding her\r\n  body were various bottles of cleaning fluids which she had been forced to\r\n  ingest. Â Mrs. Gatti had been sexually assaulted as evidenced by a gaping\r\n  laceration extending from her vagina into the rectal area.\r\nRespondent was arrested for the crimes on October 12, 1992. Â In\r\n  two separate statements, Respondent admitted to being in Mrs. Gattiâ€™s house on\r\n  the night she was killed and that he had sex with her.Â  However, he denied committing the\r\n  murder and implicated a man named â€œFrankie J,â€ who Respondent alleged was present with him at the\r\n  time of the crime. Â â€œFrankie Jâ€ was later identified as Frank Douglas.Â  None of\r\n  the physical evidence found in Mrs. Gattiâ€™s house or in her car matched Douglas.Â  \r\nBecause Respondent admitted to being in Mrs. Gattiâ€™s home when the\r\n  crime took place, trial counsel pursued the theory that Respondent did not\r\n  murder Mrs. Gatti but was merely present at the time of the crime.Â  The jury found\r\n  Respondent guilty of murder, administering\r\n  poison, first-degree burglary, grand larceny of a motor vehicle, petty larceny,\r\n  kidnapping, and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC).Â  \r\nPrior to the beginning of the penalty\r\n  phase, trial counsel moved to allow into evidence the results of Frank Douglasâ€™\r\n  polygraph test which indicated deception.Â  Trial counsel sought to present this\r\n  evidence to the jury in an effort to establish that Douglas was the actual\r\n  perpetrator and Respondent was merely present at the time of the crime.[1]Â  The trial judge declined to admit\r\n  the polygraph test.Â  \r\nAs part\r\n  of its case, the State called several witnesses to testify regarding\r\n  Respondentâ€™s juvenile and adult records as well as his numerous disciplinary\r\n  problems while incarcerated for these offenses at the Department of Juvenile\r\n  Justice (DJJ) and the Department of Corrections (DOC). Â The testimony\r\n  established that Respondent entered the DJJ system at ten years old with his adult\r\n  criminal activity escalating to more violent offenses which included resisting\r\n  arrest, assault and battery with intent to kill, and armed robbery.Â  After\r\n  outlining Respondentâ€™s prior record, the State offered testimony to establish\r\n  the aggravating circumstances surrounding Mrs. Gattiâ€™s murder.\r\nIn\r\n  response, trial counsel offered Respondentâ€™s mother, Betty Council, as the sole\r\n  defense witness.Â  She told the jury that Respondent is the youngest of ten\r\n  children.Â  She testified she took Respondent to â€œmental healthâ€ between the\r\n  ages of seven and fourteen and that he had been teased as a child while at\r\n  school.Â  She also showed the jury a childhood picture of Respondent.Â  Respondentâ€™s\r\n  mother further testified that Respondent suffered third-degree burns from a\r\n  cooking accident, and that the treating physician told her that it would â€œtake\r\n  effectâ€ on Respondent.Â  In terms of Respondentâ€™s adulthood, Respondentâ€™s mother\r\n  testified that he has two young sons.Â  When asked by defense counsel what she\r\n  would do as Respondentâ€™s mother when faced with the juryâ€™s decision as to life\r\n  without parole or death, she pleaded for the jury to impose a life sentence.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was committed in the\r\n  commission of the following aggravating circumstances:Â  criminal sexual\r\n  conduct; kidnapping; burglary; larceny with the use of a deadly weapon; killing\r\n  by poison; and physical torture.Â  As a result, the jury recommended Respondent\r\n  be sentenced to death.Â  The trial judge denied all of Respondentâ€™s post-trial\r\n  motions and ordered Respondent to be put to death on December 6, 1996.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this Court affirmed Respondentâ€™s convictions and sentences.Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999).Â  After the United States Supreme\r\n  Court denied Respondentâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari,[2] he petitioned this Court for a stay of execution to pursue state PCR remedies.Â  \r\nFollowing this Courtâ€™s grant of the stay, Respondent\r\n  filed his initial PCR application.Â  Shortly thereafter, Respondent indicated\r\n  that he wished to withdraw his PCR application and be executed.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  this request, a hearing was held before the circuit court on December 8, 2000.Â \r\n  As a result of this hearing, the circuit court judge ordered a competency\r\n  evaluation of Respondent.Â  Three months later, the Department of Mental Health\r\n  found that Respondent was not competent to waive PCR or be executed because he\r\n  suffered from schizophrenia, undifferentiated type.Â  Respondentâ€™s PCR counsel\r\n  then moved to stay the PCR proceedings.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, a\r\n  circuit court judge ordered the capital PCR proceedings to be stayed\r\n  indefinitely due to Respondentâ€™s incompetence.Â  The State petitioned for and\r\n  was granted certiorari by this Court to review the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  This\r\n  Court set aside the stay and ordered the PCR proceedings to continue.Â  Council\r\n    v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782 (2004).Â  \r\nFollowing this\r\n  Courtâ€™s decision, Respondent filed two amended applications.Â  In his final\r\n  application, Respondent alleged he was entitled to relief based on the\r\n  following grounds:Â  ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire and jury\r\n  selection; ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase for:Â \r\n  (i) failing to obtain a mitigation investigator or to otherwise adequately\r\n  prepare and present powerful mitigating evidence; (ii) failing to develop a\r\n  consistent, credible theme for a sentence of life imprisonment; (iii) failing\r\n  to obtain the assistance of a pathologist and failing to challenge the\r\n  testimony of the Stateâ€™s expert pathologist regarding the circumstances\r\n  surrounding Mrs. Gattiâ€™s death; Respondent may not be executed because he is\r\n  incompetent; ineffective assistance of counsel in investigating Respondentâ€™s\r\n  competency to stand trial; and ineffective assistance of counsel in\r\n  investigating Respondentâ€™s mental state at the time of the offenses.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, PCR\r\n  counsel called Respondent as a witness.Â  Â Â However, due to his incompetence, Respondent\r\n  was essentially unintelligible in his testimony.Â  As a second witness, PCR\r\n  counsel called Dr. Tora Brawley, a clinical neuropsychologist who reviewed\r\n  Respondentâ€™s records and interviewed several of his family members.Â  Based on the\r\n  results of a battery of tests, Dr. Brawley believed there was evidence of brain\r\n  dysfunction, particularly in the frontal lobe.Â  Dr. Brawley testified\r\n  Respondent began having problems when he was seven years old.Â  Although\r\n  Respondent had an I.Q. of 106 at that time, he was diagnosed with a learning\r\n  disability and enrolled in special education classes.Â  When Respondent was\r\n  tested again at ten years old, his I.Q. had dropped approximately twenty-three\r\n  points.Â  In Dr. Brawleyâ€™s opinion, this significant decrease represented an\r\n  overall decline in general cognitive functioning. \r\nNext, PCR counsel called Marjorie Hammock a forensic social worker\r\n  who compiled a â€œsocial family historyâ€ for Respondent. Â Based on her investigation,\r\n  Hammock found that several of Respondentâ€™s family members suffered from mental\r\n  illness, were involved in criminal activity, and have â€œsignificant educational\r\n  deficit problems.â€Â  Hammock also discovered that Respondentâ€™s father was an\r\n  alcoholic who was extremely violent.Â  Divorce records indicated Respondentâ€™s\r\n  mother was granted a divorce on the ground of physical cruelty.Â  After the\r\n  father left the home, Respondentâ€™s family moved at least seven times from one\r\n  bad neighborhood to another and lived in several homes which did not have\r\n  running water and indoor plumbing.Â  The family members also depended on\r\n  government assistance for their financial existence.Â  Respondentâ€™s individual\r\n  records revealed that he:Â  failed the first, seventh, and ninth grades;\r\n  suffered two head injuries prior to the age of ten years old; suffered a burn\r\n  injury which occurred when he was cooking without adult supervision at age\r\n  seven; was treated at seven or eight years old for nervousness, sleepwalking,\r\n  and nightmares at the local mental health center; and had attempted suicide.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  next witness called by PCR counsel was Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, a forensic\r\n  psychiatrist who began evaluating Respondent in the summer of 1999.Â  At that\r\n  time, she believed Respondent was acutely psychotic and unable to assist his\r\n  appellate counsel due to his â€œparanoid ideationâ€ and â€œdelusions of grandeur.â€Â \r\n  In 2001, Dr. Schwartz-Watts conducted an additional evaluation of Respondent in\r\n  preparation for a competency hearing. Â Dr. Schwartz-Watts diagnosed Respondent\r\n  with â€œundifferentiated schizophrenia,â€ which she believed began in early\r\n  adolescence or childhood.Â Â Â  \r\nIn its\r\n  case, the State called James Whittle, Jr., Respondentâ€™s lead trial counsel.Â  In\r\n  terms of trial preparation, Whittle testified he filed pre-trial motions\r\n  seeking the following records:Â  DJJ records; school records; state mental\r\n  health records, as well as Respondentâ€™s familyâ€™s DSS records; and records from\r\n  the vocational school attended by Respondent.Â  Whittle turned the records he\r\n  obtained over to Dr. Everett Kuglar, a forensic psychiatrist who was\r\n  court-appointed on August 8, 1995, for his evaluation of Respondent. Â Although\r\n  Dr. Kuglar reviewed these records, trial counsel decided not to call him as a\r\n  witness because he believed the Stateâ€™s cross-examination would have hurt the\r\n  case. \r\nIn\r\n  terms of compiling additional mitigation evidence, Whittle met with several of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s family members.Â  However, Whittle testified they did not offer\r\n  anything that could be used in mitigation.Â  Additionally, Whittle filed a\r\n  motion seeking authorization and funding approval for a social history\r\n  investigator to aid in preparing mitigation evidence.Â  After receiving all of\r\n  the requested records through the efforts of his investigator and law partner,\r\n  Whittle decided not to procure a social history investigator even though\r\n  funding had been approved. \r\nInstead of offering social history evidence, Whittle focused on\r\n  presenting the defense theory that Respondent did not participate in the murder\r\n  but was merely present when Douglas committed the murder. Â Â Whittle believed\r\n  the strongest mitigating evidence was Respondentâ€™s statement that he was not\r\n  the perpetrator, the presence of another individualâ€™s DNA evidence at the\r\n  scene, and Douglasâ€™ polygraph test which indicated deception.Â  Based on this\r\n  theory, Whittle testified he wanted to be consistent throughout the guilt phase\r\n  and the penalty phase and that â€œit was basically an all-or-nothing approach.â€Â  Because\r\n  he believed the trial judgeâ€™s decision not to admit Douglasâ€™ polygraph results limited\r\n  what he could do in mitigation, Whittle decided to only call Respondentâ€™s\r\n  mother as a witness.Â  \r\nIn his deposition, Dr. Kuglar testified he was court appointed in\r\n  August 1995, but did not meet with Respondent until September 1996 when Whittle\r\n  scheduled the first meeting.Â  He stated the only records he received were\r\n  Respondentâ€™s incomplete high school records and the state mental hospital\r\n  records from 1992-93.Â  Dr. Kuglar testified that he met with Respondent for the\r\n  specific purpose of evaluating Respondentâ€™s mental competency and criminal\r\n  responsibility.Â  Additionally, Dr. Kuglar testified that although he met with\r\n  several members of Respondentâ€™s family, the interviews were not â€œvery\r\n  satisfactory of getting anything.â€Â  \r\nThe PCR judge partially denied Respondentâ€™s application for\r\n  relief, finding trial counsel was not ineffective:Â  (1) during voir dire and\r\n  jury selection; and (2) during sentencing for failing to develop a credible\r\n  theme, failing to obtain an independent pathologist, and failing to investigate\r\n  whether Respondent was mentally competent to stand trial.Â  \r\nThe PCR judge granted Respondent relief, finding trial counselâ€™s\r\n  conduct was both deficient and prejudicial during the penalty phase of the\r\n  trial in that he failed to adequately prepare and present evidence in\r\n  mitigation.Â  Relying extensively on the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion\r\n  in Wiggins,[3] the judge found trial counsel was deficient in failing to obtain Respondentâ€™s\r\n  background records prior to the beginning of trial.Â  The judge also found that\r\n  trial counsel neglected to pursue Respondentâ€™s earlier childhood records even\r\n  though mental health records revealed that Respondent had a significant drop in\r\n  I.Q. between the ages of seven and ten and had been medicated to â€œsettle his\r\n  nervesâ€ during this time period.Â  Additionally, the judge found trial counsel\r\n  â€œunreasonably failed to expand the investigation to include obtaining records\r\n  of [Respondentâ€™s] immediate family membersâ€ and to conduct more than just\r\n  â€œlimitedâ€ interviews with Respondentâ€™s family. Â The PCR judge also found trial\r\n  counselâ€™s conduct regarding Dr. Kuglar was unreasonable given trial counsel\r\n  failed to provide him with adequate records and only asked him to examine Respondent\r\n  with respect to the issues of competency to stand trial and his criminal\r\n  responsibility or capacity at the time of the offenses.\r\nThe judge concluded this deficient conduct was prejudicial to Respondent,\r\n  stating â€œ[i]f counsel had adequately investigated and presented the available\r\n  mitigation evidence, the jury would have heard substantial evidence in\r\n  mitigation which was presented by [Respondent] in the PCR hearing.â€Â  Ultimately,\r\n  the PCR judge set aside Respondentâ€™s death sentence and ordered a new sentencing\r\n  trial.\r\nAs to Respondentâ€™s remaining grounds, the judge ruled the\r\n  allegation that Respondent should not be executed because he is incompetent was\r\n  not ripe for consideration.Â  The judge found that even though Respondent was\r\n  incompetent under the standards of Singleton[4] the issue would not be procedurally\r\n  proper until execution was imminent.Â  Moreover, given his decision to set aside\r\n  Respondentâ€™s death sentence, the judge concluded that no remedy was necessary.Â \r\n  Finally, the judge held the allegation that Respondent was incompetent at the\r\n  time of the offenses and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\n  adequately investigate Respondentâ€™s mental state should be continued until such\r\n  time as Respondent regains competence.Â  \r\nThe State petitioned for and was granted certiorari by this Court\r\n  to consider the PCR judgeâ€™s decision to vacate Respondentâ€™s death sentence and\r\n  to grant a continuance as to whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing\r\n  to adequately investigate Respondentâ€™s mental state at the time of the\r\n  offenses.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR judge erred in finding trial counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to investigate and present mitigation evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR\r\n  applicant must show that: (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2)\r\n  there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of\r\n  the trial would have been different.Â  Id. (citing Strickland v.\r\n    Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  We will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is\r\n  any evidence of probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision\r\n  of the PCR court when it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Suber v. State,\r\n  371 S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nAlthough\r\n  the State admits that trial counsel did not obtain all records for Respondentâ€™s\r\n  immediate family, it asserts trial counsel adequately investigated Respondentâ€™s\r\n  background and was aware of his disadvantaged background, learning\r\n  disabilities, family turmoil, his siblingsâ€™ criminal activities, his prior\r\n  record, and his drug use.Â  In light of trial counselâ€™s investigation, the State\r\n  avers there is no evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling because trial\r\n  counsel made an informed, strategic decision to omit certain mitigating\r\n  evidence in an effort to present a consistent theory that Respondent was\r\n  present but did not participate in Mrs. Gattiâ€™s murder.Â  Even if trial\r\n  counselâ€™s conduct is found to have been deficient, the State asserts Respondent\r\n  failed to establish that he was prejudiced.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  will be more fully discussed, we hold the PCR judge correctly determined that\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate and present\r\n  mitigating evidence.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we believe the PCR judge properly relied on the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s\r\n  decision in Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003).Â  In Wiggins, the\r\n  defendant was tried and convicted for capital murder before a judge.Â  After his\r\n  conviction, the defendant elected to be sentenced by a jury.Â  Id. at\r\n  515.Â  In a pre-sentencing motion, defendantâ€™s counsel sought to bifurcate the\r\n  proceedings so that he could first present his theory that the defendant did\r\n  not act as the principal in killing the victim.Â  Counsel then intended to\r\n  present a mitigation case.Â  After this motion was denied, the sentencing\r\n  proceeding commenced immediately.Â  Although counsel made a general reference to\r\n  the defendantâ€™s â€œdifficult life,â€ counsel did not present any evidence of the\r\n  defendantâ€™s life history.Â  The jury sentenced Wiggins to death.Â  On appeal, Wigginsâ€™\r\n  convictions and sentences were affirmed.Â  Id. at 516.\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Wiggins filed an application for post-conviction relief, alleging his trial\r\n  attorneys had rendered constitutionally defective assistance by failing to\r\n  investigate and present mitigating evidence of his dysfunctional background.Â  Id. at 516.Â  After he exhausted his state PCR remedies, Wiggins filed a petition for\r\n  habeas corpus in federal district court.Â  The federal courtâ€™s grant of relief\r\n  was reversed by the Fourth Circuit, which held that Wigginsâ€™ trial counsel made\r\n  â€œa reasonable strategic decision to focus on petitionerâ€™s direct\r\n  responsibility.â€Â  Id. at 519.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Fourth\r\n  Circuitâ€™s decision.Â  The Supreme Court found trial counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to adequately prepare and present mitigating evidence.Â  Although trial\r\n  counsel obtained a pre-sentencing investigation report and DSS records, which\r\n  revealed Wigginsâ€™ tumultuous childhood and low I.Q., counsel failed to\r\n  investigate further.Â  Counsel also chose not to retain a forensic social worker\r\n  despite the fact that funds were made available to commission a social history\r\n  report.Â  Id. at 524.Â  The Court found counselâ€™s decision not to expand\r\n  their investigation beyond the retained records was unreasonable given it fell\r\n  short of professional state standards and the American Bar Association standards\r\n  governing capital defense work.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court also determined that counselâ€™s performance prejudiced Wiggins.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the Court found that had trial counsel further investigated they would have\r\n  discovered the following powerful mitigating evidence:Â  Wiggins was abused by\r\n  his alcoholic mother during the first six years of his life; he suffered\r\n  physical and sexual abuse while in foster care; he was homeless at times; and\r\n  suffered from diminished mental capacities.Â  Id. at 535.Â  Given the\r\n  strength of the mitigating evidence, the Court believed there was a reasonable\r\n  probability that the jury would have returned a different sentence had they\r\n  been presented with this evidence. Id.Â  Not only did the Court find that\r\n  it was unreasonable for counsel not to investigate and present this mitigating\r\n  evidence, it also rejected counselâ€™s assertion that the omission of the evidence\r\n  constituted a trial strategy.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  recent decisions, this Court has adhered to the principles and analysis in Wiggins in determining whether counsel was ineffective in failing to thoroughly\r\n  investigate potential guilt and penalty phase evidence.Â  See Ard v.\r\n    Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 332 n.14, 642 S.E.2d 590, 597 n.14 (2007), cert.\r\n      denied, Ozmint v. Ard, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007) (referencing Wiggins and affirming PCR courtâ€™s decision finding trial counsel ineffective in failing\r\n  to further investigate gunshot residue evidence in capital murder case); Nance\r\n    v.

Ct. 131 (2006) (noting the holding in Wiggins and\r\n  concluding defense counsel in capital murder case should have, among other\r\n  things, investigated and presented evidence of defendantâ€™s â€œadaptabilityâ€ to\r\n  confinement and presented mitigating social history evidence outlining\r\n  defendantâ€™s troubled childhood and mental illness); Von Dohlen v. State,\r\n  360 S.C. 598, 606-07, 602 S.E.2d 738, 742-43 (2004), cert. denied, 544\r\n  U.S. 943 (2005) (concluding case was sufficiently analogous to Wiggins and holding that trial counsel in capital murder case was ineffective in\r\n  failing to adequately prepare and present evidence in the penalty phase that\r\n  defendant suffered from severe, chronic depression at the time of the murder given\r\n  trial counsel failed to provide expert witness with crucial medical records and\r\n  related information which prevented witness from conveying an accurate\r\n  diagnosis of defendantâ€™s mental condition to the jury).\r\nApplying\r\n  the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we find the PCR judge correctly\r\n  relied on Wiggins and there is evidence to support his finding that\r\n  Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was deficient in failing to sufficiently investigate\r\n  and present mitigating evidence.\r\nWe\r\n  believe it was unreasonable for trial counsel not to further investigate\r\n  Respondentâ€™s background and present even the minimal mitigating evidence that\r\n  was obtained.Â  Initially, trial counsel was deficient in not beginning his\r\n  investigation into Respondentâ€™s background once the State served its notice of\r\n  intent to seek the death penalty, counsel discovered that Respondentâ€™s DNA was\r\n  found at the scene of the crime, and counsel learned of Respondentâ€™s inculpatory\r\n  statements to police indicating that he sexually assaulted the victim.Â  Clearly,\r\n  counsel should have been aware that the defense accomplice theory was not that\r\n  strong and that mitigation evidence was the only means of influencing the jury\r\n  to recommend a life sentence.Â  Yet, despite this knowledge, trial counsel: Â only\r\n  obtained the DJJ and state hospital records before trial; did not request\r\n  certain background records until the day of jury selection; did not set up a\r\n  meeting between Dr. Kuglar and Respondent until one month before trial; and\r\n  provided Dr. Kuglar with only limited records.Â  As in Wiggins, counselâ€™s\r\n  conduct fell below the standards set by the ABA.Â  See American Bar\r\n    Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel In Death\r\n    Penalty Cases, 11.4.1(2)(C) (1989) (once counsel is appointed in any case\r\n  in which the death penalty is a possible punishment, he or she should begin,\r\n  among other things, collecting information relevant to the sentencing phase\r\n  including, but not limited to:Â  medical history, educational history, family\r\n  and social history, and prior adult and juvenile record).[5]\r\nEven\r\n  the limited information obtained should have put counsel on notice that Respondentâ€™s\r\n  background, with additional investigation, could potentially yield powerful\r\n  mitigating evidence.Â  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 398 (2000) (â€œMitigating evidence unrelated to dangerousness may alter the juryâ€™s\r\n  selection of penalty, even if it does not undermine or rebut the prosecutionâ€™s\r\n  death-eligibility case.â€); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978)\r\n  (stating that mitigating evidence includes â€œany aspect of a defendantâ€™s\r\n  character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the\r\n  defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than deathâ€); see also Gary Goodpaster, The Trial for Life:Â  Effective Assistance of Counsel in\r\n    Death Penalty Cases, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 299, 317-339 (1983) (discussing counselâ€™s\r\n  preparation of and impact of mitigating evidence in capital cases).\r\nHowever,\r\n  not only did counsel delay in investigating Respondentâ€™s background, he failed\r\n  to conduct an adequate investigation.Â  Significantly, he failed to provide his\r\n  only expert witness, Dr. Kuglar, with sufficient records and only directed him\r\n  to evaluate Respondentâ€™s competency to stand trial and criminal responsibility.Â \r\n  Additionally, Dr. Kuglar, at the direction of counsel, only met with Respondent\r\n  on two occasions, the first being shortly before trial. \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  even though the funding was available, trial counsel chose not to hire a social\r\n  history investigator.Â  Instead, he relied on his law partner and private investigator\r\n  to collect potentially relevant information.Â  However, neither of these\r\n  individuals was qualified, in terms of social work experience, to evaluate the\r\n  information to assess Respondentâ€™s background.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we believe it was unreasonable for trial counsel not to obtain Respondentâ€™s\r\n  family records.Â  First, it is inexplicable that trial counsel deemed these\r\n  records unimportant because they did not directly involve Respondent. Â See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (stating â€œâ€˜evidence about the\r\n  defendantâ€™s background and character is relevant because of the belief, long\r\n  held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are\r\n  attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems\r\n  may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuseâ€™â€ (quoting California\r\n    v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 545 (1987)(Oâ€™Connor, J., concurring))), abrogated\r\n      by Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002) (holding executions of\r\n  mentally retarded criminals constituted cruel and unusual punishments\r\n  prohibited by the Eighth Amendment); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104,\r\n  115 (1982) (â€œEvidence of a difficult family history and of emotional\r\n  disturbance is typically introduced by defendants in mitigation.â€); American\r\n    Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel In\r\n    Death Penalty Cases, 11.8.3(F)(1) (1989) (in preparing for the sentencing\r\n  phase, trial counsel should consider investigating â€œ[w]itnesses familiar with\r\n  and evidence relating to the clientâ€™s life and development, from birth to the\r\n  time of sentencing, who would be favorable to the clientâ€); 11.8.6(B)(5) (stating\r\n  that trial counsel should consider presenting in mitigation:Â  â€œFamily, and\r\n  social history . . . professional intervention (by medical personnel, social\r\n  workers, law enforcement personnel, clergy or others) or lack thereofâ€). Â Secondly,\r\n  even counselâ€™s brief interviews with several of Respondentâ€™s family members and\r\n  the DJJ records should have alerted him to the fact that the family was\r\n  dysfunctional, Respondent had been raised in a violent home environment, and\r\n  experienced learning disabilities. Â All of these factors constituted mitigating\r\n  evidence and warranted further investigation.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if trial counselâ€™s investigation could be deemed sufficient or adequate, we\r\n  believe trial counsel also failed to present any significant mitigating\r\n  evidence.Â  Trial counselâ€™s mitigation presentation consisted solely of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s motherâ€™s extremely limited testimony.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we disagree with the Stateâ€™s argument that Respondent is not entitled to\r\n  post-conviction relief given trial counsel made a strategic decision not to\r\n  present additional evidence in mitigation.Â  â€œ[W]here counsel articulates a valid reason for\r\n  employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.â€ Watson v. State,\r\n  370 S.C. 68, 72, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006). Â Counselâ€™s strategy will be reviewed\r\n  under â€œan objective standard of reasonableness.â€ Ingle v. State, 348\r\n  S.C. 467, 470, 560 S.E.2d 401, 402 (2002). Â For\r\n  several reasons, counselâ€™s decision was not reasonable and any strategic reason\r\n  asserted would not excuse the deficient conduct.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  as outlined above, counselâ€™s investigation was inadequate and incomplete.Â \r\n  â€œThis Court has recognized that strategic choices made by counsel after an\r\n  incomplete investigation are reasonable â€˜only to the extent that reasonable\r\n  professional judgment supports the limitations on the investigation.â€™â€ McKnight\r\n    v. State, 378 S.C. 33, 45, 661 S.E.2d 354, 360 (2008) (quoting Von\r\n      Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598, 607, 602 S.E.2d 738, 743 (2004)).Â  Secondly,\r\n  counsel was already aware the jury had rejected the defense theory that\r\n  Respondent was not the actual perpetrator but was merely present.Â  Therefore,\r\n  counselâ€™s â€œall or nothingâ€ approach was unreasonable.Â  Thirdly, it would not\r\n  have been inconsistent for trial counsel to have pursued this theory in the\r\n  guilt phase but then offered mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.Â \r\n  Clearly, trial counsel could have argued to the jury that even if Respondent\r\n  was the actual perpetrator he suffered from these mental deficiencies and\r\n  mental illness at the time of the crime.Â  As the Supreme Court indicated in Wiggins,\r\n  it is not inconsistent to present the accomplice theory during the guilt phase\r\n  but mitigation evidence in the penalty phase.Â  Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535\r\n  (â€œWhile it may well have been strategically defensible upon a reasonably\r\n  thorough investigation to focus on Wigginsâ€™ direct responsibility for the\r\n  murder, the two sentencing strategies are not necessarily mutually\r\n  exclusive.â€).Â  Finally, given the State had already presented damaging\r\n  character evidence, we do not believe Respondentâ€™s character could have been\r\n  damaged any further by the presentation of additional mitigating evidence.Â \r\n  Trial counsel essentially would have had â€œnothing to loseâ€ and â€œeverything to\r\n  gainâ€ by presenting this evidence.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing,\r\n  we hold the PCR judge properly found trial counselâ€™s conduct was deficient.Â  There\r\n  is also evidence to support his finding that Respondent was prejudiced by\r\n  counselâ€™s deficient performance. \r\nâ€œWhen a defendant\r\n  challenges a death sentence, prejudice is established when â€˜there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that, absent [counselâ€™s] errors, the sentencer-including\r\n  an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence-would\r\n  have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did\r\n  not warrant death.â€™â€Â  Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 333, 504 S.E.2d 822,\r\n  823 (1998) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984)).Â  This Court explained, â€œ[t]he bottom line is that we must determine whether\r\n  or not [Respondent] has met his burden of showing that it is reasonably likely\r\n  that the juryâ€™s death sentence would have been different if counsel had\r\n  presented additional information about [Respondentâ€™s] mental condition.Â  In\r\n  making this determination, we must consider the totality of the evidence before\r\n  the jury.â€Â  Jones, 332 S.C. at 333, 504 S.E.2d at 824.\r\nIn light of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s burden and this Courtâ€™s standard of review, we agree with the PCR\r\n  judge that counselâ€™s deficient performance prejudiced Respondent.Â  Admittedly,\r\n  the State produced overwhelming evidence of Respondentâ€™s guilt[6] and the jury found six aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  However,\r\n  there was very strong mitigating evidence to be weighed against the aggravating\r\n  circumstances presented by the State.Â Â  We believe, as did the PCR judge, this\r\n  evidence may well have influenced the juryâ€™s assessment of Respondentâ€™s\r\n  culpability.Â  See Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 393 (2005)\r\n  (â€œ[A]lthough we suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard [the mitigation\r\n  case] and still have decided on the death penalty, that is not the test.Â  It\r\n  goes without saying that the undiscovered â€˜mitigating evidence, taken as a\r\n  whole, might well have influenced the juryâ€™s appraisal of [Respondentâ€™s]\r\n  culpabilityâ€™â€ (quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 538)).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  only evidence presented in mitigation was Respondentâ€™s motherâ€™s brief\r\n  testimony.Â  Although the jury heard that Respondent had received mental health\r\n  treatment between the ages of seven and fourteen, there was no medical evidence\r\n  or other testimony describing his mental health issues or that several of his\r\n  immediate family members suffered from mental illness.Â  Furthermore, the jury\r\n  never heard that:Â  Respondentâ€™s father was an extremely violent alcoholic who\r\n  was divorced by Respondentâ€™s mother on the ground of physical cruelty; Respondent\r\n  and his siblings resided in bad neighborhoods, lived in poverty, and often\r\n  lived in homes without running water or indoor plumbing; Respondent and his\r\n  siblings were neglected by their parents and, as a result, on one occasion\r\n  Respondent suffered severe burns while trying to cook without supervision; Respondent\r\n  had a significant drop in his I.Q. between the ages of seven and ten which may\r\n  have been the result of a head injury or the onset of mental illness; Respondent\r\n  began getting into trouble at the age of ten years most likely as the result of\r\n  his violent family environment and negative influence of his siblings;\r\n  Respondentâ€™s immediate family members had been diagnosed with mental illnesses\r\n  such as schizophrenia, schizoid, bipolar disorder, depression, and borderline\r\n  personality disorder; Respondent had learning disabilities; DJJ caseworkers\r\n  recognized Respondentâ€™s emotional and mental problems; Respondent began using\r\n  drugs and alcohol at sixteen years old; Respondent attempted suicide in his\r\n  twenties; Respondent has a borderline I.Q. and frontal lobe brain dysfunction;\r\n  and the onset of Respondentâ€™s current diagnosis of schizophrenia may have begun\r\n  in early adolescence or childhood. Â Â Â \r\nAlthough\r\n  this mitigating evidence may not have risen to the level of â€œabuse, neglect,\r\n  and predator and prey situations found in other cases,â€ as the State contends,\r\n  it nevertheless may have swayed the jury as in Wiggins.Â  See Rompilla,\r\n  545 U.S. at 390-93 (finding trial counselâ€™s failure to investigate prior\r\n  conviction file which revealed mitigation evidence concerning defendantâ€™s\r\n  mental health issues, troubled upbringing, and alcoholism fell below the level\r\n  of reasonable performance and was prejudicial to defendant in death penalty\r\n  case); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 397-98 (2000) (finding\r\n  defendant in capital murder case was prejudiced where trial counsel failed to\r\n  investigate and present substantial mitigating evidence during the sentencing\r\n  phase given â€œthe graphic description of [defendantâ€™s] childhood, filled with\r\n  abuse and privation, or the reality that he was â€˜borderline mentally retarded,â€™\r\n  might well have influenced the juryâ€™s appraisal of his moral culpabilityâ€); Von\r\n    Dohlen, 360 S.C. at 608, 602 S.E.2d at 743 (holding trial counsel failed to\r\n  adequately investigate and prepare expert testimony regarding petitionerâ€™s\r\n  mental condition, â€œadjustment reaction disorder,â€ severe chronic depression,\r\n  and pathological intoxication, at the time of the murder and petitioner was\r\n  prejudiced given the outcome of the trial might have been different had the\r\n  jury heard the available information regarding petitionerâ€™s mental condition); cf. Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 605-07, 627 S.E.2d 701, 711-12 (2006)\r\n  (reversing PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that capital defendant suffered prejudice\r\n  from trial counselâ€™s failure to offer sufficient social history evidence in the\r\n  mitigation case where trial counsel interviewed a number of witnesses about\r\n  defendantâ€™s childhood and life; hired a private investigator to gather\r\n  background information on defendant; called several witnesses, including three\r\n  experts, to offer mitigating evidence that defendant grew up in a drug\r\n  environment, had trouble in school, had been abandoned, had a low I.Q., tested\r\n  â€œhighly abnormalâ€ on the scales of paranoia, schizophrenia, and mania, suffered\r\n  from chronic depression, ADD, and post-traumatic stress-disorder, and had a\r\n  history of drug and alcohol abuse); Jones, 332 S.C. at 336-39, 504\r\n  S.E.2d at 826-27 (holding capital defendant was not prejudiced by trial\r\n  counselâ€™s alleged failure to thoroughly investigate and present mitigating\r\n  evidence regarding his mental impairments where the following evidence was\r\n  presented in mitigation:Â  six witnesses, who were familiar with defendantâ€™s\r\n  background, testified regarding defendantâ€™s learning difficulties and â€œunusual\r\n  behavior;â€ a clinical psychologist who testified that defendant had â€œsome\r\n  mental deficiency,â€ was â€œmentally retarded,â€ had some brain damage, and acted\r\n  impulsively; concluding that â€œnewâ€ evidence presented at PCR hearing was the\r\n  same as trial evidence and at best was a â€œfancier mitigation caseâ€). \r\nIn\r\n  sum, we believe there is evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that\r\n  Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate\r\n  and present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of Respondentâ€™s trial.[7]Â  \r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR judge erred in granting a continuance regarding whether\r\n  Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate\r\n  Respondentâ€™s mental competence at the time the crimes were committed.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nThe PCR judge found\r\n  neither Dr. Kuglar nor the court-appointed examiners, who examined Respondent\r\n  only for competence to stand trial, determined Respondent was mentally ill at\r\n  the time of the crime.Â  The judge noted, however, that Dr. Kuglar had not been\r\n  provided with the necessary and relevant background information to make this\r\n  determination.Â  The judge believed that Dr. Kuglar would have found â€œplenty of\r\n  red flags pointing up to a need to test further.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge opined â€œ[a]ll of this information raises questions about whether\r\n  [Respondent] was mentally ill prior to these offenses and what if any impact\r\n  his mental illness had on his thinking and behavior at the time of these\r\n  offenses.â€Â  The judge believed these questions were not adequately addressed\r\n  prior to trial because the court-appointed examinations were conducted solely\r\n  on the issue of competence to stand trial.Â  Furthermore, the judge found that\r\n  Dr. Schwartz-Watts was unable to adequately examine Respondent with respect to\r\n  his mental state at the time of the crimes due to his current state of\r\n  incompetence.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  light of these findings, the PCR judge ruled the issue of whether Respondentâ€™s\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate\r\n  Respondentâ€™s mental state at the time of the crime was a â€œfact-based challenge\r\n  to his defense counselâ€™s conduct at trial that cannot be adequately addressed\r\n  until [Respondent] regains competence.â€Â  As a result, the judge granted a\r\n  continuance staying review of this allegation until Respondent regains\r\n  competence.[8] \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Stateâ€™s assertion that the PCR judgeâ€™s legal conclusions are â€œflawed.â€\r\n  Â We find the PCR judge analyzed this issue without properly applying the rule\r\n  adopted by this Court in Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782\r\n  (2004).Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  there appears to be no dispute that Respondent was, and is currently,\r\n  incompetent.Â  Thus, pursuant to the mandate in Council v. Catoe,[9] the PCR judge should have ruled on the allegation for relief unless\r\n  Respondentâ€™s PCR counsel could establish that this issue constituted a\r\n  â€œfact-based challengeâ€ to Respondentâ€™s counselâ€™s conduct at trial.Â  If\r\n  Respondentâ€™s incompetency inhibited the PCR challenge, then a continuance would\r\n  have been proper.Â  We believe Respondentâ€™s assistance was not required and,\r\n  thus, the PCR allegation was properly before the judge.\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the collateral attack on trial counselâ€™s conduct regarding\r\n  Respondentâ€™s mental state and criminal responsibility at the time of the crime\r\n  was dependent on Respondentâ€™s records as well as the testimony of experts and\r\n  others who observed Respondent around the time of the crime.Â  Therefore, we do\r\n  not believe Respondentâ€™s assistance or decision making was required.Â  Moreover,\r\n  all of the evidence needed to rule on this issue was presented at the PCR\r\n  hearing. Â Â Specifically, the PCR judge had before him the trial transcript, the\r\n  testimony of defense counsel, Dr. Kuglar, Dr. Brawley, and Dr. Schwartz-Watts,\r\n  as well as Respondentâ€™s records. Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find the PCR judge erred in granting a continuance.\r\nIn light\r\n  of our holding, the question becomes whether this Court should rule on the\r\n  merits of the ineffectiveness of counsel issue.Â  Because this Court reviews PCR\r\n  decisions pursuant to an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard, we find it is procedurally\r\n  proper to remand this issue for the PCR judge to make a definitive ruling. On\r\n  remand, the PCR court shall consider the evidentiary record established at the\r\n  prior PCR hearing in addition to any relevant evidence admitted on remand. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nGiven there is evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s holding\r\n  that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate and\r\n  present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of Respondentâ€™s trial, we\r\n  affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s decision vacating Respondentâ€™s sentence and ordering a\r\n  new sentencing hearing.Â  We, however, find the PCR judge erred in continuing\r\n  indefinitely one of the PCR grounds until Respondent regains competence. Because\r\n  Respondentâ€™s assistance is not required for PCR counsel to present the issue\r\n  regarding whether Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to\r\n  adequately investigate Respondentâ€™s mental competence at the time the crimes\r\n  were committed, we reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s order on this issue and remand for\r\n  the PCR judge to rule based on the evidentiary record presented at the PCR\r\n  hearing in addition to any relevant evidence admitted at the hearing on remand. \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and\r\n  dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Although I agree that the PCR court erred in granting a continuance\r\n  as to trial counselâ€™s investigation of Respondentâ€™s mental competence at the\r\n  time the crime was committed, I disagree with the majority regarding trial\r\n  counselâ€™s performance during the mitigation phase of trial.Â  In my view, even assuming\r\n  trial counsel was deficient in presenting mitigating evidence, Respondent was\r\n  not prejudiced.Â  Considering the overwhelming evidence against Respondent, the\r\n  violent and brutal nature of this crime, and the fact that the jury found the\r\n  existence of six aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, in my opinion,\r\n  it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have returned a different\r\n  sentence.Â  See Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 333, 504 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1998) (recognizing that the PCR applicant bears the burden of showing that it is reasonably likely that the juryâ€™s death sentence\r\n  would have been different if counsel had presented additional mitigation\r\n  evidence); see also Plath v. Moore, 130\r\n  F.3d 595, 602 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that, considering the â€œsheer magnitudeâ€\r\n  of the aggravating evidence, the defendant failed to show prejudice from trial\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to present certain mitigating evidence). Â Accordingly,\r\n  I would reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order finding trial counsel ineffective during\r\n  the mitigation phase of Respondentâ€™s trial.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Counsel\r\n  contended the polygraph test was relevant to establish the following two\r\n  statutory mitigating circumstances:Â  (1) Respondent was an accomplice in the\r\n  murder committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor;\r\n  and (2) Respondent acted under duress or under the domination of the other\r\n  person.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(4), (5) (1985).Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  Council v. South Carolina, 528 U.S. 1050 (1999).\r\n[3]Â  Â Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003).\r\n[4]Â  In Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437\r\n  S.E.2d 53 (1993), this Court adopted a two-prong analysis to determine a\r\n  convicted defendantâ€™s competency to be executed. \r\n[5]Â Â  We note that these guidelines were revised in\r\n  2003.Â  However, we cite to the 1989 guidelines given they were in effect at the\r\n  time of Councilâ€™s trial.\r\n[6]Â  In Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 128, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 782, 786 (2004), this Court noted the State presented an overwhelming\r\n  amount of evidence of Respondentâ€™s guilt. \r\n[7]Â Â  In no way should our decision be construed as\r\n  minimizing the brutality of the victimâ€™s murder.Â  We are, nevertheless, bound\r\n  by a standard of review which mandates our affirmance of the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision if there is any probative evidence to support it.Â  Moreover, we are\r\n  cognizant of appellate decisions in this state which determined that counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient performance in a death penalty case did not warrant reversal where\r\n  the error did not contribute to the verdict.Â  See Plath v. Moore,\r\n  130 F.3d 595, 601-02 (4th Cir. 1997) (finding trial counselâ€™s alleged failure\r\n  to present additional mitigating evidence in sentencing phase of capital trial\r\n  did not warrant habeas relief for petitioner; stating â€œin weighing the omitted\r\n  evidence against that actually used to convict and sentence Plath, the\r\n  mitigating evidence seems insufficient to shift the balance in Plathâ€™s favorâ€); Arnold v. State/Plath v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992)\r\n  (finding, in capital case, trial counselâ€™s failure to object to\r\n  unconstitutional malice charge was harmless where, beyond a reasonable doubt,\r\n  the error did not contribute to the verdict in light of the overwhelming\r\n  evidence of malice).Â  We cannot say that the undiscovered mitigating evidence,\r\n  taken as a whole, would not have influenced at least one juror to recommend a\r\n  life sentence for Respondent.Â  Thus, we are unable to find trial counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient performance was not prejudicial.\r\n[8]Â  The PCR judge inferred that it would be unlikely\r\n  that Respondent would regain competence.Â  Based on our review of the record and\r\n  the opinion of Dr. Schwartz-Watts, we agree with the PCR judgeâ€™s assessment.Â \r\n  Thus, even if Respondent is sentenced to death after a re-sentencing hearing,\r\n  we believe it is doubtful that he will ever be executed in light of our decision\r\n  in Singleton.\r\n[9]Â Â  In Council v. Catoe, this Court stated:\r\n\r\n  the\r\n    default rule is that PCR hearings must proceed even though a petitioner is\r\n    incompetent.Â  For issues requiring the petitionerâ€™s competence to assist his\r\n    PCR counsel, such as a fact-based challenge to his defense counselâ€™s conduct at\r\n    trial, the PCR judge may grant a continuance, staying the review of those\r\n    issues until petitioner regains his competence.Â  All other PCR claims will not\r\n    be subject to a continuance based on a petitionerâ€™s incompetence.\r\n\r\nCouncil v. Catoe, 359 S.C. at 130, 597 S.E.2d at 787.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
