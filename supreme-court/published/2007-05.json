Brown, of Young, Clement, &amp; Rivers, Â LLP, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  John Doe (Petitioner) brought an action on behalf of his minor son, James Doe, to recover damages arising from the sexual abuse of James Doe by Robert Francis Marion, Jr., M.D.Â  Petitioner also alleged Carol Graf, M.D. and Carol Graf, M.D. &amp; Associates (Respondents) were negligent in failing to report to authorities or warn future victims of Dr. Marionâ€™s predilection for child molestation.Â  The trial court disagreed and dismissed the case.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 605 S.E.2d 556 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We granted Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, and we affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJames Doe was a patient of Parkwood Pediatrics Group (Parkwood) from 1990 to 1998.Â  Dr. Marion was a member of Parkwood until 1985 when he was asked to leave due to complaints of sexual abuse and molestation against him.Â  Dr. Marion established a solo practice and began treating James Doe in 1999 after James Doeâ€™s mother transferred him from Parkwood to Dr. Marion.Â  James Doe was allegedly sexually abused by Dr. Marion for a period of several years beginning in 1999.Â \r\n \r\nDr. Marion received psychiatric treatment from Dr. Graf beginning in 1984 for his predilection for child molestation.Â  Dr. Graf also treated a victim of Dr. Marion who informed Dr. Graf of the molestation.Â  Petitioner alleges Dr. Graf was negligent per se in her failure to notify the appropriate authorities of Dr. Marionâ€™s child molestation and abuse and in breaching her duty to report suspected sexual abuse of a child pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-510 (Supp. 2002).Â  Petitioner also alleges Dr. Graf was negligent under common law principles for her failure to warn â€œreasonably foreseeableâ€ future minor patients of Dr. Marion.Â  Finally, Petitioner alleges Carol Graf, M.D. &amp; Associates, P.A., is vicariously liable for Dr. Grafâ€™s negligence. \r\n \r\nRespondents were dismissed from the initial suit after the trial court granted their motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The trial court found: (1) no common law duty to warn existed because there was not a specific threat to a specific individual; and (2) Â§ 20-7-510 did not create a private right of action for failing to report, and if it did, it would only apply to threats to a specific child, not any possible future victims.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal in Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 605 S.E.2d 556 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Court of Appeals found Petitioner failed to allege a specific threat necessary to compel a duty to warn and, therefore, the trial court correctly determined no legal duty existed under the common law.Â  The Court of Appeals also found Â§ 20-7-510 does not create a private cause of action and, consequently, the trial court correctly determined Dr. Graf was not negligent per se.Â  \r\n \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in finding S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-510 (Supp. 2002) does not give rise to a private cause of action for negligence per se?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in finding a physician/psychiatrist is not liable under common law negligence principles for failing to report to authorities or warn future victims about the predilection for child molestation of her patient?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 116, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874&nbsp;(2006).Â  If the facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999); Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995).Â  â€œThe question is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief.â€Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999).Â  The complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action. Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Negligence Per Se\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Petitionerâ€™s claims for negligence against Dr. Graf.Â  Specifically, Petitioner contends S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-510 creates a private cause of action for negligence per se.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-510 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t(A)&nbsp;&nbsp; A physician â€¦ shall report in accordance with this section when in the personâ€™s professional capacity the person has received information which gives the person reason to believe that a childâ€™s physical and mental health or welfare has been or may be adversely affected by abuse or neglect.\r\n\tâ€¦\r\n\t(D) Reports of child abuse or neglect may be made orally by telephone or otherwise to the county department of social services or to a law enforcement agency in the county where the child resides or is found.[1]\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the statute imposes a duty on Dr. Graf to report Dr. Marionâ€™s predilection for sexual abuse and/or molestation of children to the appropriate authorities.Â  Petitioner argues the purpose of the Childrenâ€™s Code[2], and specifically of the reporting statute, is to protect children from the type of harm James Doe suffered.Â  \r\n \r\nIn determining whether a statute creates a private cause of action, the main factor is legislative intent:\r\n\r\n\tThe legislative intent to grant or withhold a private right of action for violation of a statute or the failure to perform a statutory duty, is determined primarily from the language of the statuteâ€¦.Â  In this respect, the general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish a civil liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the public as an entity is not subject to a construction establishing a civil liability.\r\n\r\nDorman v. Aiken Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 67, 398 S.E.2d 687, 689 (1990) (quoting Whitworth v. Fast Fare Markets of South Carolina, Inc., 289 S.C. 418, 420, 338 S.E.2d 155, 156 (1985)).Â  When a statute does not specifically create a private cause of action, one can be implied only if the legislation was enacted for the special benefit of a private party.Â  Citizens of Lee County v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 416 S.E.2d 641 (1992).Â  \r\n \r\nWhile Â§ 20-7-510 is silent as to civil liability, Â§Â§ 20-7-567 &amp; -570 (Supp. 2005)[3] do impose liability for making a false report.Â  Sections 20-7-567 &amp; -570 indicate the legislature intended to impose civil liability and establish private causes of action in certain instances.Â  The fact that such language is missing from Â§ 20-7-510 indicates the legislative intent was for the reporting statute not to create civil liability.Â  See Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 433-34, 468 S.E.2d 861, 865 (1996) (finding when one provision does not include a right that is included in a related provision, legislative intent is that a right will not be implied where it does not exist); State v. Hood, 181 S.C. 488, 188 S.E. 134 (1936) (â€œIt is presumed that the Legislature was familiar with prior legislation, and that if it intended to repeal existing laws it would have expressly done so.â€).Â  Further, in Rayfield v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (1988), this Court stated:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e are able to derive a test for determining when a duty created by statute will support an action for negligence.Â  In order to show that the defendant owes him a duty of care arising from a statute, the plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the essential purpose of the statute is to protect from the kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and (2) that he is a member of the class of persons the statute is intended to protect.\r\n\r\nIn determining Dr. Graf had no duty to report, we look to the purpose of the Childrenâ€™s Code and determine the statute in question is concerned with the protection of the public and not with the protection of an individualâ€™s private right[4].Â  Section 20-7-480[5] states the purpose of the Childrenâ€™s Code and focuses entirely, although not explicitly, on the duties of the Department of Social Services (DSS).Â  See, e.g., S.C. Depâ€™t of Social Servs. v. Pritcher, 329 S.C. 242, 246, 495 S.E.2d 242, 244 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œSCDSS has been designated as the state agency primarily responsible for implementing the child welfare scheme for the protection of children in South Carolina.â€).Â \r\n \r\nPetitioner cites Jensen v. Anderson County Department of Social Services, 304 S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (1991), to support his contention Â§ 20-7-510 creates a private cause of action.Â  In Jenson, this Court upheld a private cause of action when a DSS worker failed to properly investigate claims of abuse of a young man.Â  After the young manâ€™s brother was beaten to death by his motherâ€™s boyfriend, the administratix of the brotherâ€™s estate brought an action against DSS and the social worker.Â  While public officials are generally not liable for their negligence in public duties, this Court noted an exception exists when a duty is owed to an individual rather than the public, i.e., a â€œspecial duty.â€[6]Â   \r\nThis case is distinguishable from Jenson because there existed no special duty between Dr. Graf and James Doe.Â  Dr. Graf was not a public official.Â  She never had contact with James Doe.Â  In fact, James Doe was not even born when Dr. Graf began treating Dr. Marion in 1984.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the dismissal of the action and finding Â§ 20-7-510 does not create a private cause of action for negligence per se.Â  \r\n \r\nII.Â  Common Law Negligence\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Petitionerâ€™s claim for common law negligence.Â  Specifically, Petitioner argues Dr. Graf had a duty to warn all future foreseeable victims which arose out of the â€œspecial relationshipâ€ created in the psychiatrist-patient relationship.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nIn order to prove negligence, a plaintiff must show: (1) defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.Â  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999) (â€œThe court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty. If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a directed verdict.â€).Â  In Faile v. South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 546 (2002), this Court recognized five exceptions to the general rule that there is no general duty to control the conduct of another or to warn a third person or potential victim of danger:\r\n\r\n\t(1) where the defendant has a special relationship to the victim;\r\n\t\r\n\t(2) where the defendant has a special relationship to the injurer; \r\n\t\r\n\t(3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a duty; \r\n\t\r\n\t(4) where the defendant negligently or intentionally creates the risk; and\r\n\t\r\n\t(5) where a statute imposes a duty on the defendant.\r\n\r\n350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 546 (2002).Â   \r\nThe defendant may have a common law duty to warn potential victims under the â€œspecial relationshipâ€ exception when the defendant â€œhas the ability to monitor, supervise and control an individualâ€™s conductâ€ and when â€œthe individual has made a specific threat of harm directed at a specific individual.â€Â  Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998).Â  In Bishop, this Court relied on â€œ[t]he seminal case on the liability of one treating a mentally afflicted patient for failure to warn or protect third persons threatened by a patientâ€ and stated: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profession should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger. The discharge of this duty may require the therapist to take one or more of various steps, depending upon the nature of the case. Thus it may call for him to warn the intended victim or others likely to apprise the victim of the danger, to notify the police, or to take whatever other steps are reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nBishop, 331 S.C. at 87, 502 S.E.2d at 82&nbsp;(quoting Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of California, 551 P.2d 334 (1976)).Â  The key is there must be a specific threat made by the patient to harm a readily identifiable third party.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nPetitioner argues Dr. Graf had a duty to warn James Doe because he was a member of a readily identifiable group of future patients of Dr. Marion.Â  In Gilmer v. Martin, 323 S.C. 154, 157, 473 S.E.2d 812, 814 (Ct. App. 1996), the Court of Appeals rejected a similar argument, holding â€œit is not simply foreseeability of the victim which gives rise to a personâ€™s liability for failure to warn; rather, it is the personâ€™s awareness of a distinct, specific, overt threat of harm which the individual makes towards a particular victim.â€\r\n \r\nPetitionerâ€™s claim fails to allege a specific threat against James Doe necessary to create a duty to warn.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Petitionerâ€™s claims.Â \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the decision of the Court Appeals and find: (1) Â§ 20-7-510 does not create a private right of action for negligence per se; and (2) a physician/psychiatrist is not liable under common law negligence principles for failing to report or warn about the predilection for child molestation of her patient in the absence of a specific threat to an identifiable party. \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section 20-7-510(A) was amended in 2003 and now reads: â€œA physician â€¦ must report in accordance with this section when in the personâ€™s professional capacity the person has received information which gives the person reason to believe that a child has been or may be abused or neglected as defined in section 20-7-490.â€Â  The amendments do not affect the analysis of Petitionerâ€™s argument.Â  \r\n \r\n[2]Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-10 to -9740 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2006).\r\n[3] Â South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-567 states: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(A) It is unlawful to knowingly make a false report of abuse or neglect.\r\n\t(B) A person who violates subsection (A) is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-570 provides:\r\n\r\n\t(A) If the family court determines pursuant to Section 20-7-695 that a person has made a report of suspected child abuse or neglect maliciously or in bad faith or if a person has been found guilty of making a false report pursuant to Section 20-7-567, the department may bring a civil action to recover the costs of the departmentâ€™s investigation and proceedings associated with the investigation, including attorneyâ€™s fees. The department also is entitled to recover costs and attorneyâ€™s fees incurred in the civil action authorized by this section. The decision of whether to bring a civil action pursuant to this section is in the sole discretion of the department.\r\n\t(B) If the family court determines pursuant to Section 20-7-695 that a person has made a false report of suspected child abuse or neglect maliciously or in bad faith or if a person has been found guilty of making a false report pursuant to Section 20-7-567, a person who was subject of the false report has a civil cause of action against the person who made the false report and is entitled to recover from the person who made the false report such relief as may be appropriate, including:\r\n\t(1) actual damages;\r\n\t(2) punitive damages; and\r\n\t(3) a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee and other litigation costs reasonably incurred.\r\n\r\n[4] Other jurisdictions have interpreted similar statutes and reached the same conclusion.Â  For example, the Alabama Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\n\tThe Child Abuse Reporting Act creates a duty owed to the general public, not to specific individuals, and, consequently, it does not create a private cause of action in favor of individuals.Â  Therefore, to the extent that the plaintiffs rely on that statute, they fail to state a cause of action, and the trial court properly dismissed the claims insofar as they were based on the statute.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nC.B. v.

Davis, of Latta, Pro Se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21of the Rules of Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the issuance of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the Agreement and suspend respondent from office for six months.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was contacted at 8:00 p.m. at his residence by an officer of the Dillon County Sheriffâ€™s Department and informed that one of the officerâ€™s friends had been arrested that afternoon, that bond court had closed for the day, and that the friend needed to be released so he could attend work the following day.Â  Respondent instructed the officer to bring the necessary bond paperwork to respondentâ€™s residence for respondent to review.Â  Later that evening, respondent set a $2,500 personal recognizance bond and the officerâ€™s friend was released.Â  The victim was not notified of the bond hearing even though he had requested to be present for the bond hearing.\r\nRespondent was not the magistrate on call that evening, he did not seek permission to conduct the special bond hearing, he failed to ascertain whether there were other inmates awaiting bond hearings, he did not conduct bond hearings for any other inmates awaiting bond hearings, and he failed to inform the Chief Magistrate that a special bond hearing had been conducted.Â \r\n \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent acknowledges that his conduct violates the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 29, 2000, as well as the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary); Canon 1(A)(a judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judgeâ€™s activities); Canon 2(A)(a judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2(B)(a judge shall not convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge); Canon 3 (a judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3(B)(2)(a judge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon 3(B)(5)(a judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice); Canon 3(B)(7)(a judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding the right to be heard according to law); and Canon 3(B)(8)(a judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and fairly).Â  Respondent also concedes that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4)(persistent failure to perform judicial duties or perform judicial duties in an incompetent or neglectful manner); Rule 7(a)(7)(willful violation of a valid court order issued by a court of this state); and Rule 7(a)(9)(violation of the Judgeâ€™s Oath of Office contained in Rule 502.1, SCACR).\r\nRespondent indicates that his misconduct in this matter was not intentional and that he will not engage in similar misconduct in the future; however, we note that respondent has a prior disciplinary history of similar misconduct.Â  In the Matter of Davis, 368 S.C. 662, 630 S.E.2d 281 (2006)(respondent publicly reprimanded for conducting two special bond hearings in 2004 and 2005 in violation of the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a suspension from judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from office for six months.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.Â   \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

Goldstein, of Belk, Cobb, Infinger &amp; Goldstein, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking this Court to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Douan v. Charleston County Council, 369 S.C. 271, 631 S.E.2d 544 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent (Douan) brought this action against petitioner Charleston County Council (Council) alleging a proposed ordinance and subsequent referendum violated statutory election law.Â  Following this Courtâ€™s decision in the related case of Douan v. Charleston County Council, 357 S.C. 601, 594 S.E.2d 261 (2003), the circuit court judge dismissed the pending action as moot and denied Douanâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding Douanâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees was not moot.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals err in holding Douanâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees was not moot?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\tCouncil contends the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit court judgeâ€™s denial of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (1985) provides:\r\n\tIn any civil action brought by the State, any political subdivision of the State or any party who is contesting state action, unless the prevailing party is the State or any political subdivision of the State, the court may allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if: \r\n\t\r\n\t(1) The court finds that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and\r\n\t(2)&nbsp;The court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nA prevailing party is a party who successfully prosecutes the action by prevailing on the main issue and â€œin whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.â€Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 394 S.E.2d 709 (1990) (citing Buza v. Columbia Lumber Co., 395 P.2d 511 (Alaska 1964)).Â  The key factor in determining whether a party is a prevailing party is the degree of success obtained by the party seeking attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court judge found the pending action was moot because this Court voided the election results of the 2002 Charleston County Sales and Use Tax Referendum in Douan v. Charleston County Council, supra.Â  Additionally, the circuit court judge ruled that Â§ 15-77-300 does not create a separate cause of action for attorneyâ€™s fees, but requires a party to be the prevailing party in an action.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court judge denied the request for attorneyâ€™s fees, finding Douan was not the â€œprevailing partyâ€ in the circuit court action because the action was moot. Â The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the circuit court judge erred in finding Douanâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees was moot.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred in holding the circuit court judge dismissed Douanâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees as moot.Â  The circuit court judge did not dismiss Douanâ€™s request as moot, but rather denied Douanâ€™s request, finding he was not the prevailing party in the action.Â \r\n \r\nFurthermore, in City of Charleston v. Masi, 362 S.C. 505, 609 S.E.2d 301 (2005), this Court held issues concerning public service district elections were moot due to the Courtâ€™s intervening decision in Kizer v. Clark, 360 S.C. 86, 600 S.E.2d 529 (2004), and, because the issue was moot, declined to award attorneyâ€™s fees under Â§ 15-77-300. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the circuit court judge properly found Douan was not the prevailing party in the action below due to this Courtâ€™s superseding opinion in Douan v. Charleston County Council, supra, which rendered Douanâ€™s current claim moot, and denied his request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We therefore reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion remanding the matter to the circuit court.\r\n \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26327","title":"Schnellmann v.

Roettger, 368 S.C. 17, 627 S.E.2d 742 (Ct. App. 2006). Â We grant the petition only as it pertains to whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding petitionersâ€™ reliance on respondentâ€™s representation was not justifiable and whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct measure of damages in a fraud case.Â  We dispense with further briefing and affirm as modified the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent acted as the real estate agent for the sellers of a home purchased by petitioners.Â  Respondent advertised the property in the Charleston Trident Multiple Listing Service (MLS) as having approximately 3,350 square feet.Â  At the bottom of the MLS listing, it indicated the information stated was â€œdeemed reliable but not guaranteed.â€&nbsp; The listing also included the following disclaimer:&nbsp; â€œIF EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, MEASURE, MEASURE!â€&nbsp; Respondent also advertised the property on the website www.realtor.com.Â  This listing, however, did not identify the square footage as approximate or contain the disclaimer language.Â  However, the sales contract granted the purchaser the privilege and responsibility to inspect the home prior to closing, the wording of the clause including specifically the homeâ€™s square footage. Â In addition, prior to the closing, petitionersâ€™ real estate agent was presented with a summary appraisal revealing that the house was less than 3,350 square feet, but continued with the closing.\r\nAn appraisal conducted after petitioners purchased the house revealed it measured only 2,987 square feet.[1]&nbsp; Petitioners sued respondent for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA), alleging she misrepresented the square footage of the house in the real estate listing.Â  The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on all claims.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judgeâ€™s grant of summary judgment, finding petitionersâ€™ fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims failed because their reliance on respondentâ€™s representation was not justified.Â  In addition, the Court of Appeals held these claims, as well as the SCUTPA claim, failed because petitioners had suffered no damages as a result of respondentâ€™s representations.Â  Specifically, the Court of Appeals found that, because appraisals of the home conducted at the time of purchase and shortly thereafter reflected its square footage as less than 3,000 square feet and assessed its value in excess of the $478,000 purchase price, petitioners suffered no damages stemming from respondentâ€™s alleged misrepresentation.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals apply the incorrect method for calculating damages in a fraud case?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners argue, inter alia, the Court of Appeals erred in finding they were not justified in relying on respondentâ€™s representation as to the homeâ€™s square footage and by applying an incorrect method of calculating damages in a fraud case.[2]Â  Petitioners claim damages for fraud are not measured by calculating the difference between the contract price and the reasonable market value of the property, which was the approach taken by the Court of Appeals.Â  Rather, petitioners contend damages for fraud are determined pursuant to the â€œbenefit of the bargainâ€ rule, or the difference between the value the plaintiff would have received if the facts had been as represented and the value he actually received, plus any consequential losses proximately resulting from the fraud.\r\nTo establish a cause of action for fraud, the following elements must be proven by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence: (1) a representation of fact; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.Â  Kahn Constr. Co. v. S.C. Natâ€™l Bank of Charleston, 275 S.C. 381, 271 S.E.2d 414 (1980). Â The failure to prove any element of fraud or misrepresentation is fatal to the claim.Â  Id.\r\nPetitioners correctly argue the Court of Appeals applied the wrong method for determining damages from fraud.Â  It is the well-settled law of this state that the proper method in such a case is the benefit of the bargain approach, according to which the plaintiff is entitled to the difference between the value he would have received if the defendantâ€™s representations had been true and the value he actually received, together with any proximately caused consequential or special damages.Â  E.g., Riddle v. Pitts, 283 S.C. 387, 324 S.E.2d 59 (1984); Byrn v. Walker, 275 S.C. 83, 267 S.E.2d 601 (1980); Reid v. Harbison Dev. Corp., 285 S.C. 557, 330 S.E.2d 532 (Ct. App. 1985); Starkey v. Bell, 281 S.C. 308, 315 S.E.2d 153 (Ct. App. 1984). Â \r\nThe Court of Appeals did not undertake a â€œbenefit of the bargainâ€ analysis in determining petitionersâ€™ damages, nor did it cite any law for the damages measure it applied.Â  Instead, the Court of Appeals summarily concluded petitioners suffered no damages because, even taking into account the missing square footage, they still paid less than market value for the house.Â  This approach is not in accord with the damage calculation method for fraud utilized by the courts of this state.\r\nHowever, because we also find the Court of Appeals correctly determined petitioners did not justifiably rely on respondentâ€™s representation, we need not decide whether petitioners suffered any damages under the â€œbenefit of the bargainâ€ approach. Â See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining the appellate court \r\nneed not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive).Â  Accordingly, we affirm as modified the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] A second measurement taken by petitionersâ€™ expert revealed the square footage of the house was closer to 3,087 square feet.&nbsp;\r\n[2] We note the Court of Appeals found all of petitionersâ€™ claims failed as a result of their failure to prove damages.Â  However, in their argument on the damages issue, petitioners specifically refer to only the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling regarding their fraud claim.Â  Therefore, the Court will address this issue with reference only to the fraud cause of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26328","title":"Torrence v.

Summers, of Malone, Thompson &amp; Summers, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE COTTINGHAM:Â Â Â  This is a direct appeal from the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of appellantsâ€™ declaratory judgment action.Â  We affirm in result.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants seek certain declarations of rights under various statutes related to the Prison Industries Program. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-3-40, 24-3-310 thru -430 (2007). Â Appellantsâ€™ Second Amended Complaint alleged a class action suit and described the class as follows:Â  â€œThe class consists of all individuals who are beneficiaries of the wages â€¦ paid to prisoners participating in the Prison Industries Program.â€Â  Three specific sub-classes were alleged:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the â€œPrisoner Subclassâ€ - Thomas J. Torrence and William Ray Ward represent all prisoners who have participated in the Prison Industries Program at Evans Correctional Institution;\r\n\t(2) the â€œVictim Beneficiary Subclassâ€ - Kimberly Dubose, a victim of a felony and recipient of funds from the South Carolina Victims Compensation Fund (â€œSCVCFâ€), represents all crime victims who have been awarded funds from the SCVCF and all crime victims receiving restitution paid by prisoners participating in the Prison Industries Program; and\r\n\t\r\n\t(3) the â€œDependent Beneficiary Subclassâ€ - Susan Smith, who has a child whose father is an inmate working in the Prison Industries program at Evans, represents all dependents of prisoners entitled to support payments from funds received through the Prison Industries Program.[1]\r\n\r\nBoth Torrence and Ward participated in the Prison Industries Wire Harness Assembly facility at Evans for the private sector company Insilco Technologies Group (â€œInsilcoâ€).Â  The program is federally certified and operates under various state statutes.Â  See e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-3-40, 24-3-315 &amp; 24-3-430 (2007).Â  After initially receiving training wages at 25 cents and 75 cents per hour, Torrence and Ward were subsequently paid $5.25 per hour for their work.[2]Â  Appellants allege, however, that Insilco pays respondent, the South Carolina Department of Corrections (the â€œDOCâ€), $7.17 per hour for their labor.Â  Appellantsâ€™ main claim is that the DOC improperly diverts $1.92 from the $7.17 hourly wage received from Insilco and deposits this money into a DOC Surplus Fund.Â Â  As a result, members of all three subclasses allegedly lose money to which they are entitled under statute.Â  Appellants further claim that the prevailing wage for similar work is $9.84 per hour.Â  Finally, Torrence and Ward claim that they are entitled to immediate access of the portion of their wages which are placed in escrow pursuant to section 24-3-40(A)(5).\r\nBased on the above allegations, appellants sought, inter alia, a declaration from the circuit court that the DOC has violated South Carolina law.Â  See Â§Â§ 24-3-40 &amp; 24-3-430.Â  \r\n \r\nThe DOC filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Finding that the complaint properly stated a declaratory judgment action which involved novel issues, the trial court initially denied the motion in November 2002.Â  However, after this Court issued its opinions in Adkins v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 360 S.C. 413, 602 S.E.2d 51 (2004), and Wicker v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 360 S.C. 421, 602 S.E.2d 56 (2004), the DOC renewed its motion to dismiss.Â  \r\n \r\nThe trial court ruled that Adkins and Wicker barred the entire declaratory action and therefore granted the dismissal.Â  The trial court found the circuit court was not the proper forum for members of the Prisoner Subclass to use for an adjudication of their rights.Â  Instead, the trial court noted that, pursuant to Wicker, these members could pursue their claims via the DOCâ€™s inmate grievance procedure.Â  As to the Victim and Dependent Beneficiary Subclasses, the trial court ruled that, pursuant to Adkins, these members likewise had no private right of action.Â  Essentially, the trial court ruled the non-prisoners could rely on the prisoner membersâ€™ grievance actions.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants moved for reconsideration; after additional briefing on specific issues related to the Victim and Dependent Beneficiary Subclasses, the trial court denied the reconsideration motion.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdismissing the declaratory judgment action brought by the three \r\n\t\t\tSubclasses regarding their rights under the Prison Industries \r\n\t\t\tStatutes?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdismissing the claim related to the inmatesâ€™ wages held in escrow?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Dismissal of Action from Circuit Court\r\nAppellants argue the trial courtâ€™s determination left the victim and dependent beneficiaries without any avenue of relief.Â  Although we affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal from circuit court of the entire lawsuit, we agree with appellants that the victim and dependent beneficiaries may not be denied some form of process for their claims to percentages of the monies earned by inmates who participate in the Prison Industries Program.\r\nThe Legislature specifically authorized inmate labor in private industry via S.C. Code Ann. section 24-3-430.Â  This statute provides that â€œ[n]o inmate participating in the program may earn less than the prevailing wage for work of similar nature in the private sector.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D) (2007); see also Â§ 24-3-315 (for a prison industry project, the DOC must determine â€œthat the rates of pay and other conditions of employment are not less than those paid and provided for work of similar nature in the locality in which the work is performedâ€).Â  Moreover, section 24-3-430(H) expressly directs that â€œ[t]he earnings of an inmate authorized to work at paid employment pursuant to this section must be paid directly to the [DOC] and applied as provided under Section 24-3-40.â€Â  (Emphasis added).\r\nSection 24-3-40 governs the disposition of prisoner wages and provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t(A) Unless otherwise provided by law, the employer of a prisoner authorized to work at paid employment â€¦ in a prison industry program â€¦ shall pay the prisonerâ€™s wages directly to the [DOC].\r\n\tThe Director of the Department of Corrections shall deduct the following amounts \r\n\tfrom the gross wages of the prisoner:\r\n\t(1) If restitution to a particular victim or victims has been ordered by the court, then \r\n\ttwenty percent must be used to fulfill the restitution obligation. â€¦\r\n\t(3) Thirty-five percent must be used to pay the prisonerâ€™s child support obligations pursuant to law, court order, or agreement of the prisoner. Â These child support monies must be disbursed to the guardian of the child or children or to appropriate clerks of court, in the case of court ordered child support, for application toward payment of child support obligations, whichever is appropriate.â€¦\r\n\t(4) Ten percent must be available to the inmate during his incarceration for the purchase of incidentals. Any monies made available to the inmate for the purchase of incidentals also may be distributed to the person or persons of the inmateâ€™s choice.\r\n\t(5) Ten percent must be held in an interest bearing escrow account for the benefit of the prisoner.\r\n\t(6) The remaining balance must be used to pay federal and state taxes required by law. Any monies not used to satisfy federal and state taxes must be made available to the inmate for the purchase of incidentals pursuant to subsection (4).\r\n\r\nS.C. CodeÂ  Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (emphasis added).\r\nThis Court addressed the Prison Industries statutes in the companion cases of Adkins and Wicker.Â  In Wicker, the inmate (Wicker) filed an inmate grievance claiming that his training wages violated the prevailing wage provision. Â See Â§ 24-3-430(D).Â  The Court affirmed the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s ruling that Wicker was entitled to the prevailing wage of $5.25 per hour during his first 320 hours of employment.Â  In so finding, we acknowledged that while Wicker did not have a private, civil cause of action available to him, he nevertheless had a statutory right to a prevailing wage which had been created by the State.Â  Significantly, we held that a state-created right cannot thereafter be denied â€œwithout affording due process of law.â€Â  Wicker, 360 S.C. at 424, 602 S.E.2d at 57.Â  Thus, Wicker had appropriately utilized the internal DOC grievance procedure to adjudicate his rights.\r\nIn Adkins, the inmates filed tort claims in circuit court against the DOC alleging violations of the prevailing wage statutes.Â  The Court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s determination that these statutes provided no private right of action for inmates.Â  Noting that â€œthe overall purpose of the prevailing wage statute is to prevent unfair competition, and to aid society and the public in general,â€ we decided the statutes were not enacted for the special benefit of inmates.Â  Adkins, 360 S.C. at 418, 602 S.E.2d at 54.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Adkins Court stated the inmates were not without a remedy because Wicker allowed them an avenue of relief through the inmate grievance system.[3]\r\nAppellants claim that despite the holdings of Adkins and Wicker, the Prisoner Subclass should be able to proceed in circuit court in the posture of a declaratory judgment action.Â  We disagree.Â  The clear rule emerging from the Adkins and Wicker cases is this:Â  inmates working in the Prison Industries Program have a cognizable, state-created interest in having the DOC pay them according to the statutory scheme governing the Program, but they do not have a private right of action; instead, the DOCâ€™s internal grievance procedure, with recourse to the Administrative Law Court, is the appropriate way to have a prisonerâ€™s wage claim adjudicated.Â  Therefore, the trial court correctly applied Adkins and Wicker to the Prisoner Subclass.Â  To hold otherwise would contravene our precedent on these issues by allowing inmates access to the circuit court merely by styling their cases as declaratory judgment actions.\r\nLikewise, regarding the victim and dependent beneficiaries, Adkins and Wicker apply to bar an action in circuit court.Â  As we stated in Adkins: â€œthe overall purpose of the prevailing wage statute is to prevent unfair competition, and to aid society and the public in general.â€Â  Adkins, 360 S.C. at 418, 602 S.E.2d at 54.&nbsp; Because the statutes are not for the special benefit of the victim and dependent beneficiaries, there is no private right of action. See id.\r\nNonetheless, the trial court erred in suggesting that these beneficiaries could rely on the prisonersâ€™ own inmate grievance claims. Â We made clear in Wicker that a state-created right cannot be denied â€œwithout affording due process of law.â€Â  Wicker, 360 S.C. at 424, 602 S.E.2d at 57.Â  Since the victim and dependent beneficiaries are directly entitled to a portion of the prisonersâ€™ wages earned through the Prison Industries Program, the DOC must afford a process for these beneficiaries to have their claims addressed. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, we hereby hold that, like inmates, the victim and dependent beneficiaries shall be able to maintain their own claims through the DOCâ€™s internal grievance procedure.[4]\r\n2.Â  Torrence and Wardâ€™s Escrowed Wages\r\nTorrence and Ward also argue that they are entitled to a declaration - by the circuit court - of their rights regarding their wages held in escrow.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nThe statute governing the disposition of prisonersâ€™ wages provides that the DOC â€œshall return a prisonerâ€™s wages held in escrow â€¦ as follows: â€¦\r\nA prisoner serving life in prison or sentenced to death shall be given the option of having his escrowed wages included in his estate or distributed to the persons or entities of his choice.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40(B)(2).Â  According to the Second Amended Complaint, both Torrence and Ward are serving life sentences, and the DOC has informed them they are not entitled to access their escrowed wages until after their death.Â  They claim, however, they are entitled to immediately access these escrowed funds.\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the trial court correctly dismissed pursuant to Adkins and Wicker.Â  Clearly, Torrence and Ward can present this claim via the inmate grievance procedure.Â  See Wicker, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we hold that appellants cannot maintain their action in the circuit court, and therefore, the trial court correctly granted the DOCâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  However, because the victim and dependent beneficiaries need a forum to pursue their own claims, we direct the DOC to afford them due process via the internal grievance system. Â Wicker, 360 S.C. at 424, 602 S.E.2d at 57 (a state-created right cannot be denied â€œwithout affording due process of lawâ€).\r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We note that the issue of class certification was not ruled upon by the trial court.\r\n[2] The training period covered their initial 320 hours of employment.\r\n[3] More recently, we held in Williams v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, Op. No. 26274 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 26, 2007), that a class of inmates could not maintain a prison industry program suit against the private industry sponsor who paid the prisonersâ€™ wages to the DOC.\r\n[4] We recognize that the DOC will need to implement new regulations to allow these claimants access to the agencyâ€™s internal grievance system.Â  Furthermore, if appellants prove true their allegation that the DOC removes any of the money remitted by the private industry sponsor and then disburses the percentages listed in section 24-3-40 based on the lower rate, the DOC would be in violation of the plain language of the statute which directs it to disburse the money based on the gross wages.Â  See Â§ 24-3-40(A).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of John M.

The administrative tribunal   shall insure that the transcript is delivered to the appellant within (60) days   after the date of the request.\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extension.&nbsp; If the administrative tribunal cannot   deliver the transcript in the time specified, it shall promptly seek an   extension from the appellate court.&nbsp; The request for an extension shall be in   writing and shall comply with Rule 224, SCACR.\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to Receive Transcript.&nbsp; If appellant has not   received the transcript within the allotted time nor received notification of an   extension within ten (10) days after the allotted time, appellant shall notify   the clerk of the appellate court, and the administrative tribunal in   writing.\r\n\r\n(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duty of Appellant.&nbsp; The transcript received from the   court reporter or the administrative tribunal must be retained by appellant   during the entire appeal and for a period of at least one (1) year after the   remittitur (See Rule 221) is sent to the lower court or administrative   tribunal.\r\n(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 208(b)(1)(C), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of the Case.&nbsp; The statement shall contain a concise   history of the proceedings, insofar as necessary to an understanding of the   appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The statement shall not contain contested matters and shall contain,   as a minimum, the following information: the date of the commencement of the   action or matter; the nature of the action or matter; the nature of the defense   or of the response; the action of the court, jury, master, or administrative   tribunal; the date(s) of trial or hearing; the mode of trial; the amount   involved on appeal; the date and nature of the order, judgment or decision   appealed from; the date of the service of the notice of appeal; the date of and   description of such orders, judgments, decisions and proceedings of the lower   court or administrative tribunal that may have affected the appeal, or may throw   light upon the questions involved in the appeal; and any changes made in the   parties by death, substitution, or otherwise.&nbsp; Any matters stated or alleged in   appellant's statement shall be binding on appellant.\r\n(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 210(c), SCACR, is amended to read\r\n(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content. &nbsp;The Record on Appeal shall include all   matter designated to be included by any party under Rule 209 and shall comply   with the requirements of Rule 238.&nbsp; The Record shall not, however, include   matter which was not presented to the lower court or tribunal.&nbsp; Matter contained   in the Record on Appeal shall be arranged in the following order: the title   page, index, orders, judgments, decrees, decisions, pleadings, transcript,   charges, exhibits and other materials or documents, and a certificate by   appellant.&nbsp; Each page of the Record on Appeal shall be numbered consecutively   beginning with the index.&nbsp; Where a portion of a page of the trial transcript, or   a page of an exhibit or document, is to be included in the Record on Appeal, the   entire page shall be included.&nbsp; When a portion of an order, judgment, decision   or pleading is to be included in the Record on Appeal, the entire order,   judgment, decision or pleading shall be included in the Record, to include the   caption and signature(s); provided, however, that the portion of a pleading   showing verification or service shall not be included unless relevant to the   appeal. If the original court reporter's numbering has been deleted, the Record   on Appeal shall contain ellipses or other notation indicating when pages of the   court reporter's transcript have been omitted.\r\n(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 210(e), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Index.&nbsp; Every Record on Appeal shall contain an   index to the principal matters therein to include orders, judgments, decisions,   pleadings, pretrial matters, opening statements, testimony, motions, closing   arguments, jury charges, post-trial motions and exhibits.&nbsp; For witness   testimony, the index shall show the pages on which direct, cross, redirect and   recross examination begins.\r\n(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 212(a), SCACR, is amended to   read:\r\n(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Court. The appellate court may require copies   of all or any part of the transcript of proceedings or other matter which was   before the lower court or administrative tribunal to be sent up for its   inspection and consideration.&nbsp; It may likewise require a report of the trial or   hearing or of any matter relative thereto, to be made by the trial judge or   administrative tribunal.&nbsp; These matters shall become part of the Record on   Appeal.\r\n(10)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 214, SCACR, is amended to read:\r\nRULE   214\r\n      CONSOLIDATION\r\nWhere there is more than one appeal from the same order, judgment, decision   or decree, or where the same question is involved in two or more appeals in   different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion, order the appeal to   be consolidated.\r\n(11)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 220(c), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affirmance on Any Ground Appearing in Record. The   appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any   ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\r\n(12)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 221(b), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remittitur.&nbsp; The remittitur shall contain a copy of   the judgment of the appellate court, shall be sealed with the seal and signed by   the clerk of the court, and unless otherwise ordered by the court shall not be   sent to the lower court or administrative tribunal until fifteen (15) days have   elapsed (the day of filing being excluded) since the filing of the opinion,   order, judgment, or decree of the court finally disposing of the appeal.&nbsp; If a   petition for rehearing is received before the remittitur is sent, the remittitur   shall not be sent pending disposition of the petition by the court.&nbsp; Where a   petition for rehearing has been denied, the Court of Appeals shall not send the   remittitur to the lower court or administrative tribunal until the time to   petition for a writ of certiorari under Rule 226(c) has expired.&nbsp; If a petition   for writ of certiorari is filed, the Court of Appeals shall not send the   remittitur until notified that the petition has been denied. If the writ is   granted by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals shall not send the   remittitur.\r\n(13)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 225, SCACR, is amended to read:\r\nRULE   225\r\n      STAY AND SUPERSEDEAS IN CIVIL   ACTIONS\r\n(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Rule.&nbsp; As a general rule, the service of a   notice of appeal in a civil matter acts to automatically stay matters decided in   the order, judgment, decree or decision on appeal, and to automatically stay the   relief ordered in the appealed order, judgment, decree or decision.&nbsp; This   automatic stay continues in effect for the duration of the appeal unless lifted   by order of the lower court, the administrative tribunal, appellate court, or   judge or justice of the appellate court.&nbsp; The lower court or administrative   tribunal retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by the appeal including   the authority to enforce any matters not stayed by the appeal.\r\n(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exceptions. &nbsp;The exceptions to the general rule are   found in statutes, court rules, and case law.&nbsp; Where specific conditions must be   met before the exception applies, those conditions must be strictly complied   with.&nbsp; A list of some, but not all, of the exceptions to the general rule   is:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money judgments as provided in S.C. Code   Ann. &sect;18-9-130.\r\n\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgments directing the assignment or delivery of   documents or personal property as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-150.\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgments directing the execution of conveyances or   other instruments as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-160.\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgments directing the sale or delivery of   possession of real property as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-170.\r\n  (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgments directing the sale of perishable property   as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-220.\r\n  (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family court orders regarding a child or requiring   payment of support for a spouse or child as provided in S.C. Code Ann.   &sect;20-7-2220.\r\n  (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worker&rsquo;s compensation awards as provided in S.C.   Code Ann. &sect;42-17-60.\r\n  (8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An appeal from an order granting an injunction or   temporary restraining order.\r\n  (9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family court orders awarding temporary suit costs or   attorney&rsquo;s fees as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;20-7-420(2).\r\n  (10)&nbsp;&nbsp; Ejectment orders as provided in S.C. Code Ann.   &sect;27-37-130 and S.C. Code Ann. &sect;27-40-800.\r\n  (11)&nbsp;&nbsp; Appeals from administrative tribunals as provided in S.C. Code   Ann. &sect;1-23-380(A)(2) and &sect;1-23-600(G)(5).\r\n\r\n(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supersedeas or Lifting of Automatic Stay.\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After service of notice of appeal, any party may   move for an order lifting the automatic stay in cases which involve the general   rule.&nbsp; In a case subject to an exception, any party may move for an order   imposing a supersedeas of matters decided in the order, judgment, decree or   decision on appeal after service of the notice of appeal.&nbsp; The effect of the   granting of a supersedeas is to suspend or stay the matters decided in the   order, judgment, decree or decision on appeal and, where a prior order or   decision was in effect at the time the appealed order, judgment, decree or   decision was filed, to revive the terms of the prior order or decision.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining whether an order should issue   pursuant to this Rule, the lower court, administrative tribunal, appellate   court, or judge or justice of the appellate court should consider whether such   an order is necessary to preserve jurisdiction of the appeal or to prevent a   contested issue from becoming moot.\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The granting of supersedeas or the lifting of the   automatic stay under this Rule may be conditioned upon such terms, including but   not limited to the filing of a bond or undertaking, as the lower court,   administrative tribunal, appellate court, or judge or justice of the appellate   court may deem appropriate.&nbsp; Further, where it appears that the granting or   lifting of a stay, or the issuance of a writ of supersedeas is insufficient to   afford complete relief, the lower court, administrative tribunal, appellate   court, or judge or justice of the appellate court may order other affirmative   relief upon such terms as are deemed appropriate.\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an order is issued pursuant to Rule 225(c)(1),   the terms of that order continue in effect during the pendency of the appeal   unless modified or revoked by the lower court, the administrative tribunal or   the appellate court or judge or justice of the appellate court which issued it,   or by a superior court.&nbsp; The granting of any relief pursuant to this Rule shall   not be construed to affect the validity of the judgment, order, decree, decision   and any liens until the judgment, order, decree or decision is reversed or   modified by the appellate court.\r\n\r\n(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure for Obtaining Lift of Stay or   Supersedeas.\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except where extraordinary circumstances make it   impracticable, an application for an order lifting the automatic stay or for   supersedeas must first be made to the lower court or administrative tribunal   which entered the order or decision on appeal.&nbsp; The issuance of an ex parte   order or decision, or an unnecessary delay by the lower court or administrative   tribunal in ruling on this application shall constitute an extraordinary   circumstance.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the lower court or administrative tribunal has   ruled, any party may petition the appellate court where the appeal is pending or   an individual judge or justice for review of this order.&nbsp; The individual judge   or justice may grant or deny the relief on a temporary basis, and refer the   matter to the full appellate court to hear and determine the matter, or he or   she may issue a final order.&nbsp; Upon the issuance of a final order by an   individual judge or justice, an aggrieved party may petition the full appellate   court for review of that decision.\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person seeking an order lifting an automatic stay   or granting a writ of supersedeas must file a written petition verified by the   client.&nbsp; The petition shall be captioned the same as the appeal.&nbsp; In addition to   the petition and verification, the moving party must contemporaneously file a   certified copy of the order, judgment, decree or decision of the lower court or   administrative tribunal and a copy of the notice of appeal with its proof of   service.\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition shall contain:\r\n  \r\n    (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the factual background necessary for an understanding   of the petition.&nbsp; If the facts are subject to dispute, the petition shall be   supported by affidavits or other sworn statements;\r\n    (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the grounds for the petition, and legal arguments   with supporting points and authority;\r\n    (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a showing that an application for this relief was   made to the lower court or administrative tribunal, and was unjustifiably denied   or that the relief granted failed to afford the relief which the petitioner   requested.&nbsp; A certified copy of the lower court&rsquo;s or administrative tribunal&rsquo;s   ruling must be included.&nbsp; If no application was made to the lower court or   administrative tribunal, then the petition shall state the extraordinary   circumstances which made it impracticable to make such an   application.\r\n  \r\n  (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition and accompanying documents shall be   served on the opposing party(ies).&nbsp; Upon application to the full appellate   court, one original and six copies, and a certificate of service shall be filed   with the clerk of the appellate court.&nbsp; If the relief is sought from an   individual judge or justice, the original and two copies must be filed with the   judge or justice.&nbsp; The individual judge or justice shall forward the original   documents, including a copy of any order issued by the judge or justice in the   matter, to the clerk of the appellate court as soon as possible.\r\n  (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A supersedeas or order lifting the automatic stay   may be issued ex parte only where exigent circumstances require that   action be taken before there is time for a hearing.&nbsp; An ex parte order   shall issue only if:\r\n  \r\n    (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it clearly appears from specific facts shown by   affidavits or included in the verified petition that immediate and irreparable   injury, loss or damage will result before the opposing party can respond;   and\r\n    (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moving party&rsquo;s attorney certifies in writing, as   an officer of the court, the efforts which have been made to give notice, or the   reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be   required.\r\n  \r\n  (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any party aggrieved by the decision of the lower   court, the administrative tribunal, or an individual judge or justice may   petition under this Rule for a review of that decision.\r\n\r\n(14)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 231(a), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Involuntary Dismissal and Reinstatement.&nbsp; Whenever   it appears that an appellant or a petitioner has failed to comply with the   requirements of these Rules, the clerk shall issue an order of dismissal, which   shall have the same force and effect as an order of the appellate court.&nbsp; A case   shall not be reinstated except by leave of the court, upon good cause shown,   after notice to all parties.&nbsp; The clerk shall remit the case to the lower court   or administrative tribunal in accordance with Rule 221 unless a motion to   reinstate the appeal has been actually received by the court within fifteen (15)   days of filing of the order of dismissal (the day of filing being excluded).\r\n(15)&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 232(b), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vacation of Prior Opinions, Orders or Judgments. &nbsp;As part of   their agreement, parties may request vacation of previously rendered opinions,   orders, decisions and judgments.&nbsp; However, an appellate court retains the   authority to deny any request for vacation.&nbsp; If an agreement which includes a   request for vacation is rejected, the parties are free, if they so choose, to   resubmit their agreement absent the request for vacation.\r\n(16)&nbsp; Rule 238(a), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captions.&nbsp; All documents filed in the appellate court shall be   headed by a caption.&nbsp; Except as provided below for appeals from administrative   tribunals, the caption shall contain the name of the appellate court where the   document is to be filed (i.e., Supreme Court or Court of Appeals); if the matter   involves review of a lower court decision, the name of the county and judge from   which the appeal is taken including the title of the judge (e.g., Circuit Court   Judge, Family Court Judge, Master-in-Equity, Probate Judge, Special Referee,   Special Circuit Court Judge); the title of the case (the party commencing the   action in the lower court shall always appear first in the title regardless of   whom is appellant or petitioner);&nbsp; the title of the document (e.g., RECORD ON   APPEAL;&nbsp; APPENDIX;&nbsp; BRIEF OF APPELLANT;&nbsp; PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI;&nbsp;   MOTION TO DISMISS);&nbsp;and the name, address and phone number of the counsel   submitting the document, or in the case of a Record on Appeal or Appendix, the   names, addresses and phone numbers of all counsel in the case.&nbsp; The caption   should be substantially in the form shown by this example:\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In the   Supreme Court\r\nAPPEAL FROM RICHLAND COUNTY\r\n  Howard   S.

Code Ann. Â§16-3-25 (1985).Â  We affirm the convictions and sentences.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe victim in this case, Rhonda Ward (â€œWardâ€™), was the manager of a convenience store in Spartanburg.Â  One early morning in February 2003, Evins approached Ward in the parking lot of the store on her way into work.Â  Ward spoke to Evins briefly before he lead her back to her car where she got in the driverâ€™s side and he got into the passenger side.Â  Â Surveillance cameras at the store captured the exchange between Ward and Evins. Â Two days later, Wardâ€™s naked body was found face down in an apple orchard.Â  She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed twelve times. Â \r\nAfter police discovered Evins had been driving Wardâ€™s car on the day of the murder, he was arrested and subsequently confessed to Wardâ€™s murder.Â  Initially, Evins denied having had sex with Ward; instead, he claimed another man was with him in the woods and insisted that Evins kill Ward.Â  However, upon being taken to the hospital for DNA testing, Evins admitted he had had sex with Ward on the day of her death.Â  At trial, Evins claimed he and Ward had been engaged in a long-term, consensual sexual relationship.Â  He testified that on the day of her death, he and Ward were engaged in sexual intercourse outside in an apple field, when Ward became angry with him for refusing to leave his girlfriend.Â  According to Evins, Ward wielded a knife, and wound up getting stabbed.Â \r\n \r\nThe jury convicted Evins of murder, kidnapping, first degree CSC, and grand larceny.Â  After a separate sentencing phase, Evins was sentenced to death for murder, thirty years for CSC and five years for grand larceny.Â  Evins raises the following issues for this Courtâ€™s review:[1]\r\n\r\n\tI. Did the trial court err in denying Evinsâ€™ motion for a change of venue based on pre-trial publicity?\r\n\tII. Did the trial court err in ruling the stateâ€™s exercise of peremptory challenges did not violate \r\n\tBatson v. Kentucky?Â  \r\n\tIII. Did the trial court err in excusing three African-American potential jurors for cause?Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tIV. Did the trial court err in admitting certain photographs of the victimâ€™s body at sentencing?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Pre-trial Publicity- Change of Venue\r\nIn September 2002, approximately five months prior to the murder in this case, the body of a woman named Demaris Huff was found near a creek beside a walking trail near a park in Spartanburg.Â  She had been strangled and was nude except for a pair of socks.Â  DNA testing revealed that semen found on Huff matched that of Evins.Â  The case remained unsolved until Evinsâ€™ subsequent arrest for the February 2003 murder of Ward.Â  At that time, after DNA testing, authorities also charged Evins with Huffâ€™s murder. Â The Huff murder charges were pending at the time of Evinsâ€™ trial for the murder of Ward.Â \r\n \r\nEvins moved for a change of venue based upon extensive pre-trial publicity, much of which linked Evins to both murders.Â  The trial court ruled in a pre-trial hearing that it would allow Evins latitude in the voir dire of potential jurors to determine if they had any prior knowledge of Evins and/or the Huff murder.Â  At the conclusion of voir dire, the defense renewed its motion for a change of venue, indicating that a total of thirty-nine people out of the jury pool of sixty-eight had heard something about the case.Â  By defense counselâ€™s count, seven of the twelve jurors seated had some knowledge of the case.Â  The trial court declined to change venue, concluding that all of the jurors who had any prior knowledge of the case had indicated they could set aside any information and would not consider it.Â  The court also noted the defense had used only nine of its ten peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors.Â  Evins now contends the denial of his motion to change venue constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  Â  \r\n\r\nA motion to change venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 594 S.E.2d 462 (2004); State v. Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 495 S.E.2d 191 (1997) (finding trial court abused discretion by granting the Stateâ€™s motion to change venue based on pretrial publicity because no evidentiary facts supported finding of actual juror prejudice towards the State). When a trial judge bases the denial of a motion for a change of venue because of pretrial publicity upon an adequate voir dire examination of the jurors, his decision will not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances. State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990).Â  When jurors have been exposed to pretrial publicity, a denial of a change of venue is not error where the jurors are found to have the ability to set aside any impressions or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 S.E.2d 99 (1999); Manning, 329 S.C. at 1, 495 S.E.2d at 191. Â Â Therefore, mere exposure to pretrial publicity does not automatically disqualify a prospective juror.Â  Id.Â  The relevant question is not whether the community remembered the case, but whether the jurors had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.Â  Id.Â  It is the defendantâ€™s burden to demonstrate actual juror prejudice as a result of such publicity.Â  Caldwell, 300 S.C. at 494, 388 S.E.2d at 816.\r\nIn Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723 (1963), the United States Supreme Court found reversible error in a trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a motion for a change of venue due to the effect of pretrial publicity.Â  There, the Court found that the people of Calcasieu Parish in Lake Charles, Louisiana, were â€œexposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged.â€Â  Id.Â  The Court noted that three members of the jury which convicted Rideau had seen and heard Rideauâ€™s televised â€œinterviewâ€ in which he confessed to the sheriff, and that two members of the jury were deputy sheriffs of Calcasieu Parish.Â  Id.Â  The Court found Rideauâ€™s due process rights had been compromised by such a procedure.Â  Â Id. The present case is clearly inapposite.\r\nWe find Evins has demonstrated no prejudice from the denial of his motion.Â  Both the trial court and defense counsel conducted a thorough voir dire of the jury pool.Â  Additionally, all members of the jury who had any knowledge of Evins or the Huff murder due to pre-trial publicity indicated they could put that knowledge aside.Â  Further, the defense used only nine of its peremptory challenges.Â  Evins contends, however, that one juror had read about both crimes and connected them mentally such that â€œshe could not be expected to disregard the image created by the articles.â€Â  Evinsâ€™ depiction of the jurorâ€™s response is overstated.Â  Â Â The juror testified on voir dire that the only thing she had heard was that the crime had taken place; she specifically testified that she knew no details, did not know the location, she had formed no opinion, could put aside what she had heard, and could be fair and impartial.Â  This is simply not akin to the situation in Rideau.Â  \r\n \r\nWe find this case more akin to Sheppard, 357 S.C. at 646, 594 S.E.2d at 462, in which the defendant claimed he was entitled to a change of venue due to extensive pretrial publicity where, out of eighty-seven potential jurors, all but five had been exposed to pretrial publicity.Â  Noting our holdings in Manning and Caldwell, we found the defendant had not met his burden of demonstrating actual juror prejudice as a result of the publicity.Â  Sheppard, 357 S.C. at 655, 597 S.E.2d at 468. We held, â€œ[m]ere exposure to pretrial publicity does not automatically disqualify a prospective juror. Instead, the relevant question is not whether the community remembered the case, but whether the jurors had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, Evins concedes that evidence of the Huff murder was properly admitted at the sentencing phase of trial. Â Accordingly, Evinsâ€™ complaint regarding pretrial publicity is necessarily limited to the guilt phase of his trial.Â  Given the overwhelming evidence presented during that phase of trial, and the fact that Evins actually admitted to stabbing Ward, we find Evins has suffered no prejudice.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion to change venue is affirmed.\r\n \r\nII. Batson Motion\r\nEvins next asserts the trial court erred in denying his Batson[2] motion and ruling that two of the Stateâ€™s peremptory challenges were not racially motivated.Â  We disagree.Â  We find the solicitorâ€™s stated reasons for striking the jurors were race-neutral.Â  \r\n \r\nThere were a total of twelve African-American venire members out of the pool of sixty-three potential jurors.Â  During jury selection, the state exercised a total of seven peremptory challenges, striking three African American and four white potential jurors.Â  The jury was ultimately comprised of eleven white jurors, one black juror, and one each white and black alternate.Â  Evins complains that two of the African-Americans were struck in violation of Batson.[3] Â We disagree.Â   \r\nIn response to Evinsâ€™ Batson motion, the solicitor explained that he struck Juror #78 because she had recently lost two sons in a felony DUI, for which the perpetrator had received only a six-year sentence.Â  The solicitor was concerned that the juror would weigh the sentence given to the defendant of a felony DUI in which her sons were killed with the potential death sentence she would be considering in Evinsâ€™ case.Â  Additionally, he addressed the fact that the solicitorâ€™s office prosecuted the case and the public defenderâ€™s office defended the defendant.Â  The trial court ruled the solicitorâ€™s explanation satisfied the test required in Batson.Â  \r\n \r\nAs to the other juror, Juror #399, the solicitor argued that the juror was â€œbeyond vacillation on the death penalty.Â  He is clearly life prone.Â  And thatâ€™s why we struck him.â€Â  The trial court ruled the solicitorâ€™s reason was race-neutral, specifically stating, â€œI do agree with his assessment that [the juror] did appear to have - was one of the jurors with the largest problems with finding - would have one of the hardest times finding death.Â  So I do agree with that.â€Â \r\n \r\nEvins asserts the solicitorâ€™s stated reasons were mere pretext.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.Â  State v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 631 S.E.2d 244 (2006); State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001).Â  The proper procedure for a Batson hearing is set forth in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (citing Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995)). Â After a party objects to a jury strike, the proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation.Â  Once the proponent states a reason that is race-neutral, the burden is on the party challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, either by showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury or that the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 123-24, 470 S.E.2d at 371-72.Â  The burden of persuading the court that a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on the opponent of the strike.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d 88 (1999). \r\n \r\nâ€œTypically, the decisive question becomes whether counselâ€™s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed. . . . [T]here is seldom much evidence in the record bearing on that issue, and the trial courtâ€™s findings regarding purposeful discrimination necessarily will rest largely on the evaluation of demeanor and credibility of counsel. Therefore, those findings are given great deference and will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.â€Â  State v. Cochran, 369 S.C. 308, 631 S.E.2d 294 (Ct. App. 2006) citing State v. Guess, 318 S.C. 269, 457 S.E.2d 6 (Ct.App. 1995).\r\nAs this Court held in Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998), the right to serve on a jury and not to be discriminated against because of race or gender belongs to the potential juror, not a litigant.Â  This is so because a defendant has no right to trial by a particular jury.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 126, 470 S.E.2d at 373.\r\nWe find the record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that the stateâ€™s explanation for its peremptory challenges of these two jurors were race-neutral.Â  The fact that Juror #78 had had two sons killed in a felony DUI, and the perpetrator had received only six years imprisonment was sufficient reason for the solicitor to believe that this juror might be reluctant to impose a death sentence.Â  Moreover, when initially questioned by the trial court as to whether she could be a fair and impartial juror, she responded, â€œwell, your Honor, I done been through this before, so it would be kind of hard for me to, you know. . .â€ Â When questioned further as to whether she could find a defendant either guilty or not guilty depending on what she heard, she went on to state, â€œWell, to be truthful, I donâ€™t know. . . .Your Honor, I still - I canâ€™t make up my mind.Â  I donâ€™t know what happened to my two sons, and I havenâ€™t got over it yet.â€Â  Although she ultimately testified that she would honor her oath if selected to be a fair and impartial juror, she nonetheless maintained when asked if she knew any reason why she could not serve on this jury that serving would be difficult for her.Â  In sum, although her answers varied somewhat, we simply cannot say the solicitorâ€™s proffered reason for striking Juror #78 was not race-neutral or that the solicitorâ€™s stated reasons were pretext.\r\nAs for Juror #399, the solicitorâ€™s stated reason for striking him was that he was likely the most pro-life person in the jury venire.Â  When asked whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror, he responded, â€œPossibly, I could, but I donâ€™t know.â€Â  When questioned about whether he could sentence someone to death, he repeatedly stated, â€œThatâ€™s a tough one. . . .Â  Well, like I said, I never really thought about it, but that would still be just like killing somebody.Â  I mean, thatâ€™s basically, the same thing to me. . . . Thatâ€™s just what I - thatâ€™s just he way I feel right now, you know.Â  Like I say, I never really thought about it. . . .Â  So, I mean, death is death.. . . â€ Â When the trial court asked, â€œSo, are - you donâ€™t - what youâ€™re telling me is that you donâ€™t believe in killing; is that right?,â€ the juror responded, â€œWell, I like life better than death.Â  Thatâ€™s a tough one, Iâ€™m going to tell you.â€Â  When told by the trial court that they need to know where he stood, the juror concluded, â€œI probably could.Â  But then again, I hear this little voice saying, you know, itâ€™s not right, but I probably could.â€Â \r\n \r\nVacillating responses to voir dire questions regarding the death penalty will support the use of a peremptory strike against a Batson challenge. Â State v. Bell, 305 S.C. 11, 406 S.E.2d 165 (1991); State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157 (1990); State v. Elmore, 300 S.C. 130, 386 S.E.2d 769 (1989).Â  Where the Solicitor perceives a person will have difficulty imposing the death penalty, he may exercise a peremptory challenge against that juror upon this ground as a racially neutral reason.Â  Bell. 305 S.C. at 15, 406 S.E.2d at 168. Â Â \r\nHere, the jurorâ€™s vacillation and reluctance to impose a death sentence is quite evident.Â  Further, although Evins now points to several white jurors who were seated on the jury who also vacillated in their responses regarding a sentence of death, Evins did not raise this point at the time of his Batson challenge during the trial and therefore failed to meet his burden of demonstrating pretext to the trial court.Â  In any event, the four white jurors cited by Evins on appeal simply did not vacillate in their responses to the same degree as Juror #399.Â  None of these jurors were nearly as equivocal in their responses concerning the death penalty.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly ruled the solicitorâ€™s stated reason for striking him was race-neutral, and Evinsâ€™ Batson motion was properly denied.\r\nIII. Juror Disqualification\r\nEvins next contends the trial court erred in disqualifying three African American venire members from serving on the jury.Â  Juror #258 was disqualified because of her reluctance to impose a sentence of death; Juror #182 was disqualified due to her predisposition to impose a sentence of death; and Juror #134 was disqualified due to both his reluctance to impose a death sentence and the fact that he had charges pending against him for which he was being prosecuted by the solicitor, and represented by the Public Defenderâ€™s office (which also represented Evins).Â  Evins asserts these jurors were improperly disqualified.Â  We disagree.\r\nA prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his or her views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.Â  S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(E) (2003) (juror may not be excused in a death penalty case unless his beliefs or attitudes against capital punishment would render him unable to return a verdict according to law); State v. Lindsey, Op. No. 26268, (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 20, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 68); State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 621 S.E.2d 883 (2005) (citing Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985)). When reviewing the trial courtâ€™s qualification or disqualification of prospective jurors, the responses of the challenged juror must be examined in light of the entire voir dire.Â  Id.Â  The determination whether a juror is qualified to serve in a capital case is within the sole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Id.Â  A jurorâ€™s disqualification will not be disturbed on appeal if there is a reasonable basis from which the trial court could have concluded that the juror would not have been able to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as a juror under the law. Â State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157 (1990).Â  Deference must be paid to the trial court who sees and hears the juror.Â  Id.Â  There will be situations where a trial court is left with definite impression that prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law and this is why deference must be paid to a trial court who sees and hears the juror.Â  Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985).Â  \r\n \r\nAs discussed below, we find the trial court properly disqualified these jurors under Wainwright.\r\nA.Â  Juror # 258\r\nJuror #258 originally testified that she could not give the death penalty because she did not feel that it was her right to give a man death.Â  Juror #258 then indicated she could impose a sentence of death under certain circumstances.Â  When asked thereafter if she could sign her name to a verdict form imposing a sentence of death, Juror #258 replied, â€œ No.â€Â  She explained the reason for this as being that given her job in the public, she could be a target for anybody, so she wouldnâ€™t want to sign her name.Â  When the trial court indicated her name would be protected, she indicated she could sign a verdict form for death.Â  When questioned by the solicitor, Juror #258 vacillated between being opposed to the death penalty, and appearing to believe it would be appropriate for most murders.Â  Ultimately, however, when asked by the solicitor if she had a choice between life in prison or death, the juror answered that she would always pick life in prison.Â \r\n \r\nGiven the variations in Juror #258â€™s responses and statement that she would always pick life in prison over death, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying her because it appears she could not have discharged her duties in accordance with the law.Â  Â Id.Â  \r\n \r\nB.Â  Juror #182\r\nDuring voir dire, Juror #182 stated she was a Type 3 juror who would hear all the evidence before deciding upon an appropriate sentence.Â  On examination by the solicitor, however, Juror #182 strongly indicated that she would always give the death penalty to anyone who intentionally kills another.Â  Upon further examination, Juror #182 explained that she would give life only to someone who unintentionally kills another, like self-defense.Â  Juror #182 ultimately concluded that â€œif you intentionally kill somebody, you know what you were doing, death penalty, but self-defense, life sentence.â€Â  \r\n \r\nAgain, it is clear this juror was predisposed to recommend a sentence of death in the case of an intentional killing such that there is a reasonable basis from which the trial court could have concluded she would not have been able to faithfully discharge her responsibilities as a juror under the law.Â  We find she was properly disqualified under Wainwright.Â  See also State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. at 283, 621 S.E.2d at 883. \r\n \r\nC.Â  Juror # 134\r\nWhen asked whether, after considering all of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, he could return a sentence of death, Juror #134 testified that he was not in favor of the death penalty and that he â€œreally would have to be persuadedâ€ to give the death penalty.Â  Thereafter, when asked if he could sign his name to a death verdict, Juror #134 responded that, depending on the facts, he could sign a death verdict form.Â  However, he subsequently described himself as a Number 2 juror - a juror who would not give the death penalty.Â  Upon further inquiry by the solicitor regarding the death penalty, Juror #134 responded:Â  â€œIâ€™ve just always been the type that when I see it on TV or something about the death penalty, Iâ€™m always against it.Â  There hasnâ€™t been one case yet where I said he deserves it.â€\r\nWe find the record supports the trial courtâ€™s disqualification of Juror #134.[4]Â  Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 412 (holding that where trial court is left with definite impression that prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law, it is within his discretion to disqualify a potential juror); see also State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (ultimate consideration of the judge concerning juror qualification is that the juror be unbiased, impartial and able to carry out the law as explained to him).\r\nIV. Sentencing Phase Photographs \r\n\r\nLastly, Evins asserts the trial court committed error at sentencing in admitting seven photographs of the victim, contending they served no legitimate purpose and served only to inflame the jury.Â Â  In particular, Evins contests the admission of Exhibit numbers 70 and 71, which reveal that the victim had defecated on herself.Â  We find the photographs were properly admitted.\r\nThe relevance, materiality and admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial courtâ€™s ruling on such issues will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1200 (1997).Â  The purpose of the sentencing phase in a capital trial is to â€œdirect the juryâ€™s attention to the specific circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the offender.â€Â  State v. Matthews, 296 S.C. 379, 373 S.E.2d 587 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1091 (1989).Â  Photographs may be offered as evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation. Â State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003).Â  In the sentencing phase, the scope of the probative value of such photos is much broader than at the guilt or innocence phase.Â  Id.Â  See also State v. WeikÂ¸ 356 S.C. 76, 587 S.E.2d 683 (2002); State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357 (1995).Â Â  In determining whether to recommend a sentence of death, the jury may be permitted to see photographs which depict the bodies of the murder victims in substantially the same condition in which the defendant left them.Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986).Â Â  There is no abuse of discretion if the offered photograph serves to corroborate testimony.Â  State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 519 (2000).\r\nExhibit 70 is a 4â€ x 6â€ photograph of the victimâ€™s body, taken from a distance of several feet away.Â Â  It reveals the victim lying in a grassy field, naked and face down, with her right arm stretched up over her head, and her left arm bent and stretched out to the left.Â  Upon close inspection, a small amount of feces is visible.Â  Exhibit 71 is a photograph of victimâ€™s body taken from a further distance away, and was taken from an angle above the victimâ€™s head.Â  The feces is not clearly visible in Exhibit 71.Â  We find the photographs were properly admitted to show the victim in substantially the same condition as Evins left her, and to corroborate the testimony that the victim had defecated on herself.Â  The photographs are not unnecessarily gruesome or disturbing.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs.\r\n \r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nWe have conducted the proportionality review as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C), and we find the sentence in this case was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Furthermore, a review of similar cases illustrates that imposing the death sentence in this case would be neither excessive nor disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004) (death sentence warranted where defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor); State v. Stokes, 345 S.C. 368, 548 S.E.2d 202 (2001); State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) cert. denied 528 U.S. 1050 (1999); State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995) cert. denied 516 U.S. 1080 (1996).Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm Evinsâ€™ convictions and sentences.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â We have re-framed the seven issues raised by Evins.\r\n[2]Â Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n[3]Â Evins does not contest the strike of Juror # 154 on appeal.\r\n[4] In addition to Juror #134â€™s views on the death penalty, the solicitor also explained to the court that Juror #134 had charges pending against him for which he was being prosecuted by the solicitorâ€™s office and represented by the public defenderâ€™s office.Â  The solicitor argued that the combination of the jurorâ€™s views on the death penalty and the pending charges disqualified Juror #134. Â Because we find that Juror #134 was properly disqualified on the basis of his views on the death penalty, we decline to address the issue of whether he was properly disqualified because of the pending charges. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26330","title":"Hill v.

Mark Davis and William Thomas Bacon, IV, both of McAngus, Goudelock &amp; Courie, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tSteve Wukela, Jr., of Wukela Law Firm, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In this workersâ€™ compensation case, Eagle Motor Lines and Alabama Truckers Association c/o Attenta (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€) argue that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission did not have jurisdiction over the claim of Jimmy Hill (â€œRespondentâ€), and that Respondentâ€™s injuries are not compensable under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part, holding that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission had jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s claim and that Respondent suffered compensable injuries.Â Â \r\n \r\nFactual/Procedural BackgroundÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent, a resident of South Carolina, completed an application for employment as a truck driver with Appellant Eagle Motor Lines (â€œEmployerâ€).Â  Thereafter, Employerâ€™s recruiting manager telephoned Respondent at his home in South Carolina and requested Respondent travel to Employerâ€™s headquarters in Alabama to complete an employee screening process.Â  Respondent traveled to Alabama where he completed a drug screening test, a driving test, and other orientation procedures before being assigned a truck.Â  During the course of his employment, Respondentâ€™s driving route traversed several states along the east coast.Â  \r\n \r\nIn 2001, Respondent suffered a brain injury and a broken rib when his truck overturned while driving through Virginia. As a result, Respondent is disabled and unable to return to work as a truck driver.Â  Respondent claimed entitlement to medical and compensation benefits. Appellants initially paid Respondentâ€™s medical bills and disability benefits, but terminated benefits after Respondent suffered a stroke allegedly caused by a confrontation with a nurse who was handling Respondentâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent filed a Form 50 and Appellants denied Respondentâ€™s claim.Â  Following a hearing before the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (â€œCommissionâ€), the single commissioner found the Commission had jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s claim because: (1) Respondent was hired in South Carolina during a telephone conversation with Employerâ€™s recruiter; (2) Employer was not exempt from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because it had four or more employees in South Carolina; and (3) Employer subjected itself to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act by filing for workersâ€™ compensation coverage in South Carolina.Â  The commissioner also found Respondent suffered compensable injuries and ordered Appellants to continue providing benefits to Respondent.Â \r\n \r\nOn appeal, the Commissionâ€™s appellate panel affirmed the decision of the single commissioner.Â  On appeal to the circuit court, the court affirmed the appellate panel on all grounds of appeal except the issue of jurisdiction, which the court remanded to the Commission for reconsideration.\r\nThis case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Appellants raise the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit err in failing \r\n\t\t\tto decide whether the Commission had jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tworkersâ€™ compensation claim?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit err in failing \r\n\t\t\tto find that the Commission did not have jurisdiction over \r\n\t\t\tRespondentâ€™s claim because Respondent was not hired in South \r\n\t\t\tCarolina?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in \r\n\t\t\tfailing to find that the Commission did not have jurisdiction over \r\n\t\t\tRespondentâ€™s claim because Employer did not have four or more \r\n\t\t\temployees in South Carolina?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in \r\n\t\t\taffirming the Commissionâ€™s findings that Respondentâ€™s physical brain \r\n\t\t\tinjury, stroke, and psychological illness were compensable?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard ofÂ  Review\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (APA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310 et. seq. (2005 &amp; Supp. 2006), governs appellate review of a final decision from an administrative agency.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp;(2000).Â  Under the APA, this Court must determine whether the findings of fact of the Commissonâ€™s appellate panel are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006); Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43 (2006). \r\n \r\nWhen the jurisdiction of the Commission is at issue, the reviewing court is not bound by the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact upon which jurisdiction is dependent.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 181, 528 S.E.2d 435, 439 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  If the factual issue before the Commissionâ€™s appellate panel involved a jurisdictional question, this Courtâ€™s review is governed by the preponderance of the evidence standard.Â  Id.Â  â€œIn determining jurisdictional questions, doubts of jurisdiction will be resolved in favor of inclusion of employees within workersâ€™ compensation coverage rather than exclusion.â€Â  Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, 94, 447 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1994).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s remand of the jurisdictional issue.\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in failing to rule on whether the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission had jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  We agree.Â \r\n \r\nThe circuit court has both the power and duty to review the entire record in order to find the jurisdictional facts without regard to the conclusion of the Commission on the issue of jurisdiction.Â  White v. J. T. Strahan Co., 244 S.C. 120, 125, 135 S.E.2d 720, 723 (1964).Â  Accordingly, the court must decide the jurisdictional question in accord with the preponderance of the evidence, bearing in mind that the basic purpose of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is to include, rather than exclude, employers and employees within its coverage.Â  Id.Â  Here, the geographical facts and circumstances of Respondentâ€™s hiring and employment were determinative of whether the Commission had jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s claim.Â  Therefore, the circuit court had the power and duty to decide the jurisdictional issue and erred by remanding the issue to the Commission for reconsideration.Â  \r\n \r\nII.Â  Jurisdiction in the state where an employee is hired\r\nAppellants argue that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission did not have jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s claim because Respondent was neither hired nor employed in South Carolina.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nAn employee covered by the provisions of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is authorized to file his claim under the laws of the state where he is hired, the state where he is injured, or the state where his employment is located.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-10 (1976).Â  The partiesâ€™ central dispute concerns where Respondent was hired.Â  \r\n \r\nThe employer-employee relationship is the jurisdictional foundation upon which workersâ€™ compensation is awarded; the existence of a contract, not the commencement of work, establishes the employer-employee relationship.Â  Oâ€™Briant v. Daniel Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 254, 256, 305 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1983).Â  Accordingly, the situs of the contract determines where an employee was hired for purposes of determining jurisdiction under Â§ 42-15-10.Â  Moore v. N. Amer. Van Lines, 310 S.C. 236, 238-39, 423 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1992).Â  The place of contracting is where the minds of the parties meet or the place where the final act occurred which made a binding contract.Â  Id.Â  Where acceptance is given over the telephone, â€œthe place of contracting is where the acceptor speaks his acceptance.â€Â  Oâ€™Briant, 279 S.C. at 256, 305 S.E.2d at 243.Â  \r\n \r\nThe single commissioner relied on Oâ€™Briant v. Daniel Construction Co. in finding that Respondent was hired in South Carolina.Â  In Oâ€™Briant, the employee, a construction worker, initially filled out an employment application with a construction company at its Georgia office.Â  The employee was not offered a job at the time, but the construction company later contacted him by telephone at his home in South Carolina offering him employment on a construction site in Georgia.Â  The employee accepted the job offer over the telephone.Â  279 S.C. at 255-56, 305 S.E.2d at 242.Â  The Court found that although the employee signed his application and enrollment card in the Georgia office, was hired to work at a job site in Georgia, was paid in Georgia, and received his fatal injuries in Georgia, the final act which created a binding contract occurred when the employee verbally accepted the job over the telephone in South Carolina.Â  Id. at 256, 305 S.E.3d at 243. Â Therefore, the Court held that the employee was hired in South Carolina and the Commission had jurisdiction under Â§ 42-15-10. \r\n \r\nWe find the present case to be indistinguishable from Oâ€™Briant.Â  Pursuant to another employeeâ€™s recommendation,[1] Respondent called Employer at its office in Alabama and spoke with the recruiting manager about being hired as a driver.Â  The recruiting manager mailed Respondent an employment application to his home in South Carolina, which Respondent filled out and returned to Employerâ€™s office in Alabama.Â Â  Â After filling out the application and sending it in, Respondent received a telephone call from the recruiting manager a few months later informing Respondent that his application had been approved and that Employer had a position open for him.Â  The recruiting manager informed Respondent that he needed to travel to Alabama for drug screening and a road test; to attend orientation; and to receive his truck assignment.Â  Employer promised to provide, and in fact did provide, Respondentâ€™s travel and lodging expenses for this trip.Â  Â Once in Alabama, and after drug screening and a road test, the recruiting manager certified Respondent for driving and gave Respondent his first assignment and a $150 advance for road expenses.Â  Respondent left Alabama with a truck and headed towards his first delivery destination.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants argue that the purpose of the phone interview and employment application was to pre-screen potential employees before bringing them to Alabama for the last steps of the hiring process.Â  We find this argument to be unpersuasive.Â  Based on the facts, we agree with the Commission that any drug tests, road tests, and paperwork completed by Respondent in Alabama were simply incidental to the hiring of Respondent.[2]Â  Clearly a meeting of the minds had to occur before Respondent traveled to Alabama to meet Employer, and before Employer promised to finance such a trip.Â  We therefore find that Employer hired Respondent during the telephone conversation in which Employer notified Respondent that there was a job opening for him and arranged for Respondent to travel to Alabama and commence work.Â  Â Accordingly, the situs of the contract was in South Carolina and the Commission has jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s claim.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent finds additional support for the Commissionâ€™s jurisdiction under Â§ 42-15-10 because his place of employment was in South Carolina.Â  In order to determine where a claimantâ€™s employment is located for purposes of Â§ 42-15-10, South Carolina has adopted the â€œbase of operationsâ€ rule.Â  Voss v. RAMCO, Inc., 325 S.C. 560, 482 S.E.2d 582 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Holland v. W.C.A.B. (Pep Boys), 586 A.2d 988 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1990)).Â  Under the base of operations rule, â€œthe workerâ€™s employment is located at the employerâ€™s place of business to which he reports, from which he receives his work assignments, and from which he starts his road trips, regardless of where the work is performed.â€Â  Holman v. Bulldog Trucking Co., 311 S.C. 341, 346, 428 S.E.2d 889, 892 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough transient employees such as Respondent do not always fit squarely within the base of operations test, we find that based on the specific facts and circumstances of this case, Respondentâ€™s employment was located in South Carolina.Â  Respondent received his work assignment from dispatch at his South Carolina home; started his road trips from his home; used drop yards in South Carolina; kept his truck at his home on the weekends; and received his paycheck at his home in South Carolina.Â  Although Respondent was required to call the Alabama office at the end of each delivery in order to find out where to pick up his next load, he was not required to report to the Alabama office for duty or return to Alabama after completing each assignment.Â  Employer also did not require Respondent to maintain and wash the truck at the Alabama terminal.Â  Additionally, Employerâ€™s trucks were not licensed in Alabama, but Oklahoma.Â  Cf. Holman, 311 S.C. 341, 428 S.E.2d 889 (holding that an employee truck driver who lived in South Carolina was nevertheless employed in Georgia for purposes of jurisdiction under Â§ 42-15-10 because Georgia is where he reported for duty each day; picked up and returned his company truck; received work assignments; reported to dispatch; was required to call in during the course of work; maintained and washed his truck; filed trip logs; and received his paycheck).\r\nMoreover, based on the testimony of Employerâ€™s officers, retaining drivers in states located throughout Employerâ€™s shipping areas benefited Employer in several ways.Â  Primarily, it saved Employer money by reducing the number of miles required by drivers to complete jobs and by decreasing the amount of â€œdead headâ€ time due to the driversâ€™ proximity to the pick-up locations of their cargo.Â  Officers of Employer also testified that this system served to attract potential employees who would be enticed by the idea of spending weekends at home.Â  In our opinion, and in keeping with general concepts of due process, Employer should not be permitted to retain the benefits of employing South Carolina residents in this capacity without submitting to jurisdiction under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  See Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958) (stating that a courtâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction requires some act by which a defendant purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws).\r\nAccordingly, we hold the Commission correctly exercised jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s claim because Respondent was hired in South Carolina and his employment was located in South Carolina.Â  \r\n \r\nIII.Â  Jurisdiction when an employer has four or more employees in South Carolina.\r\nAppellants argue that even if Respondent was authorized to file his claims in South Carolina under Â§ 42-15-10, Appellants are nevertheless exempt from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because Employer did not have any employees in South Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn employer is exempt from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act if the employer has less than four employees in this State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-360(2) (1976). Â Â \r\nThere are numerous facts that lead this Court to conclude that Employer has at least four employees in South Carolina.Â  First, Employer is required to file with the South Carolina Employment Security Commission when it employs South Carolina drivers.Â  According to Employment Security Commission reports, Employer had more than four employees in South Carolina during each fiscal quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.Â  Employer also files income taxes with the South Carolina Department of Revenue for South Carolina employees.Â  Additionally we note that Employerâ€™s out-of-state drivers are not permitted to exercise an election to file their income tax withholding or unemployment security benefits with the State of Alabama.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nEmployer claims that it has no employees in South Carolina because it has no offices, facilities, or office staff in South Carolina.Â  Employer also argues that the South Carolina income tax and unemployment filings are merely formalities required by law.Â  However, given that the crux of Employerâ€™s business requires the mobility of its employees, we will not, as Employer suggests, limit our interpretation of Â§ 42-1-360(2) to traditional jurisdictional notions of a â€œprincipal place of business.â€Â  See Lester v. S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n, 334 S.C. 557, 561, 514 S.E.2d 751, 752 (1999) (â€œWorkersâ€™ compensation statutes are to be construed in favor of coverage; any exception to workersâ€™ compensation coverage must be narrowly construed.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nUnder the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that Employer regularly employed more than four employees in the same business in South Carolina at the time of Respondentâ€™s accident.Â  Accordingly, Employer is not exempt from jurisdiction under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Compensability of Respondentâ€™s injuries\r\nAppellants argue that Respondentâ€™s injuries are not compensable under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nInjuries are covered by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act when they arise out of and in the course of employment and when they naturally and unavoidably result from the accident in question.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (1976).Â  In our opinion, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that Respondent sustained a brain injury and a stroke (transient ischemic attack), and developed a psychological condition stemming from an accident arising out of and in the scope of his employment.\r\nFollowing the accident, an emergency room CT scan indicated Respondent had a post-trauma subarachnoid hemorrhage[3] in the right parietal region of his brain.Â  At a follow-up appointment the following day, a neurosurgeon assessed Respondent and noted a closed head injury with post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and probable post-concussive syndrome.Â  During the following month, Respondent complained to the neurosurgeon of dizziness, vertigo, and light-headedness, at which point the doctor referred Respondent to neurologist Dr. R. Joseph Healy (â€œDr. Healyâ€) for a formal neurological evaluation.Â  Dr. Healy also diagnosed Respondent as having a closed head injury with post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhaging and post-concussive syndrome.Â  Although Respondent had no previous history of high blood pressure, the doctor also prescribed medication for treatment of hypertension.Â  As Respondent continued under the care of Dr. Healy, he continued to complain of sleeplessness, numbness in his left hand, and hearing loss.Â  Â Â \r\nOn Respondentâ€™s third visit, Dr. Healy overheard a confrontation between Respondent and his workersâ€™ compensation nurse about whether the nurse would remain in the examination room during Respondentâ€™s exam.Â  When Dr. Healy entered the room to begin the exam, he observed that Respondent was very agitated and had extremely high blood pressure.[4]Â  During the exam, Respondentâ€™s blood pressure remained at an elevated level.Â  Respondent complained of a headache, dizziness, and left arm numbness; the doctor also noted high blood sugar.Â  Concerned that Respondentâ€™s symptoms were related to his high blood pressure, Dr. Healy listed Respondent as suffering from a transient ischemic attack[5] and admitted him to the hospital that day.Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent continued under Dr. Healyâ€™s care and, with medication and modifications in his diet, Dr. Healy found that Respondentâ€™s conditions were improving.Â  However, based on the poor results from Respondentâ€™s sleep study and Respondentâ€™s decreased ability to focus and perform tasks, Dr. Healy did not yet believe that Respondent was fit to return to work as a truck driver, and requested neuropsychological testing.Â  The neuropsychological examination revealed that Respondent suffered from depression, mainly due to his head injury, and partly due to marital problems.\r\nAccording to Dr. Healy, Respondentâ€™s underlying medical problems were exacerbated by Respondentâ€™s closed head injury and the confrontation with the workersâ€™ compensation nurse.Â  Dr. Healy also explained that it was his opinion that the changes in Respondentâ€™s lifestyle resulting from his inability to work ultimately led to Respondentâ€™s depression.Â  \r\n \r\nWhether there is any causal connection between employment and an injury is a question of fact for the Commission.Â  The Commissionâ€™s decision must be affirmed if the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 159-60, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999).Â  Substantial evidence is that evidence which, in considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Commission reached. Id. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the Commissionâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nBased on Respondentâ€™s medical records, the opinion of Respondentâ€™s treating neurosurgeon, and reports of Respondentâ€™s confrontation with the workersâ€™ compensation nurse, we find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s conclusion that Respondent sustained a physical brain injury, stroke, and developed a psychological condition in conjunction with an accident arising out of and in the scope of his employment.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Respondentâ€™s injuries are compensable under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in failing to decide the issue of jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  Furthermore, we affirm the Commissionâ€™s findings and hold that the Commission had jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  Finally, we affirm the decision of the circuit court finding that Respondent suffered compensable injuries under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that the circuit court erred in failing to address the jurisdictional issue, but would hold there is no evidence that Respondent was hired in South Carolina.Â  The drug testing, road testing, and orientation conducted in Alabama were not â€œsimply incidentalâ€ to Respondentâ€™s hiring, but in fact the determinative acts.Â  Had Respondent failed either test, or failed to complete orientation, he would not have been hired. In fact, he was not hired, until his successful completion of these tasks.Â  Moreover, in determining whether the â€œbase of operationsâ€ is in South Carolina, the focus is the employerâ€™s base, not the employeeâ€™s.Â  By focusing on the employeeâ€™s residency, the majority ignores the legislative decision in adopting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-10 (1985) to reject the â€œdomicile and employmentâ€ rule.Â  See Holman v. Bulldog Trucking Co., 311 S.C. 341, 346Â Â  428 S.E.2d 889, 892 fn. 2 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n\r\nÂ Accordingly, I would hold that South Carolina lacks jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n[1] This employee received a $500 referral bonus from Employer for recruiting Respondent.\r\n[2] Employer argues that Respondent could not have been hired over the phone because the Department of Transportation (DOT) prohibits hiring truck drivers before the administration of a drug test.Â  This argument is misapplied.Â  Although the federal government requires a person seeking to drive a commercial vehicle to pass a drug test and a road test before driving a commercial vehicle, there is no obligation on an employer to perform these tests before hiring a truck driver employee.Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 391.41 (2006).Â  See also 49 C.F.R. Â§ 382.301(a) (requiring that drug testing be done â€œprior to the first time a driver performs safety-sensitive functions for an employerâ€).\r\n[3] Respondentâ€™s neurologist explained that subarachnoid hemorrhaging occurs when there is bleeding&nbsp;between the middle membrane covering of the brain and the brain itself.Â Â Â \r\n \r\n[4] Additionally, we note Dr. Healyâ€™s efforts to settle the matter between Respondent and the workersâ€™ compensation nurse.Â  Although the nurse claimed a need to stay in the room during the doctorâ€™s visit in order to â€œgather information,â€ Dr. Healy informed the nurse that by law, the patient had the right to see the doctor alone.Â Â  Dr. Healy noted in his office records, â€œThe Workmanâ€™s Comp is very confrontational which I think is very inappropriate.â€Â  \r\n \r\n[5] Respondentâ€™s neurologist described a transient ischemic attack as a condition indicating the patient has nearly had a stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26331","title":"Oxendine v.

Lockemy, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26331\r\nHeard November 15, 2006 - Filed May 21, 2007Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tF. Reid Warder, Jr., and Jason A. Williams, both of Wood, Porter &amp; Warder, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tJames C. Rushton, III, of the Hyman Law Firm, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the single commissioner determined that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (â€œthe Commissionâ€) had jurisdiction over Dwight Oxendineâ€™s (â€œRespondentâ€™sâ€) workersâ€™ compensation claim because his employment was located in South Carolina.Â  This ruling was affirmed on appeal.Â  Respondentâ€™s employer, Christine Davis d/b/a Johnny Davis Construction Company, and the employerâ€™s insurance carrier (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) argue this conclusion was incorrect.Â  We disagree and affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â Â  Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent was injured in an accident arising out of his employment with Johnny Davis Construction Company (â€œEmployerâ€).Â  Respondent resided in Rowland, North Carolina.Â  During the four to six years preceding his injury, Respondent framed houses for Employer during warm months and performed sheetrock work for other employers during cold months.Â  Employer was based at a home/office in Mullins, South Carolina, and nearly all of Respondentâ€™s work for Employer was performed in South Carolina.Â  Respondent was most often paid by Employer while at jobsites, but Respondent occasionally went to Employerâ€™s home office in Mullins to receive payment.Â  Respondent often received work assignments at Employerâ€™s home office and was always accountable to Employer.\r\nIn the spring of 2004, Respondent ran into Employer at a barbeque in North Carolina.Â  Employer offered him a job framing a house in Ocean Isle, North Carolina.Â  Respondent started work the following Monday and was injured six weeks later when he fell and sustained an ankle fracture which required surgery.Â  Employer took Respondent to the emergency room, and then transported him to Employerâ€™s home in Mullins.Â  \r\n \r\nDuring the six-week period prior to his injury, Respondent worked only on the house in North Carolina.Â  Respondentâ€™s co-worker transported him to and from his residence and the jobsite, both located in North Carolina.Â  However, Respondent visited Employerâ€™s home in South Carolina for social purposes and to help Employer fix his water pump, a task for which Respondent was not paid.Â  Respondent also traveled to Employerâ€™s home to receive payment at least once during this period.Â Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim in North Carolina and was denied coverage.Â  Respondent then filed for medical and compensation benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.[1]Â  Appellants denied entitlement to benefits.Â  At a hearing before the single commissioner, the primary issue was whether Respondent met the statutory requirement for filing a workerâ€™s compensation claim in South Carolina; specifically, whether Respondent was hired in South Carolina, injured in South Carolina, or whether his employment was located in South Carolina.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-10 (1976). \r\n \r\nBoth parties agree that Respondent was hired and injured in North Carolina.Â  The parties disagree, however, on the location of Respondentâ€™s employment.Â  Respondent argued the Commission had jurisdiction because his employment was located in South Carolina. Â The single commissioner agreed.Â  Both the full commission and the circuit court affirmed, and this appeal followed.Â  We certified this case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and Appellants raise the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the circuit court err in affirming the Commissionâ€™s holding that Respondentâ€™s employment was located in South Carolina?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellate review of workersâ€™ compensation decisions is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp;(2000); see also Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  The Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act. No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006), a reviewing court determines whether the Full Commissionâ€™s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43 (2006).Â  \r\n \r\nWhen the Commissionâ€™s jurisdiction is at issue, this Courtâ€™s review is governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 181, 528 S.E.2d 435, 439 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, 94, 447 S.E.2d 841, 842&nbsp;(1994) (â€œ[W]hen the Commissionâ€™s jurisdiction is at issue, as in this case, the reviewing court is not bound by the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact upon which jurisdiction is dependent.â€).Â  â€œIn determining jurisdictional questions, doubts of jurisdiction will be resolved in favor of inclusion of employees within workersâ€™ compensation coverage rather than exclusion.â€Â  Wilson, 316 S.C. at 94, 447 S.E.2d at 842 (citing White v. J.T. Strahan Co., 244 S.C. 120, 135 S.E.2d 720 (1964)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the Commission did not have jurisdiction because Respondentâ€™s employment was located in North Carolina.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nAn employee covered by the provisions of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is authorized to file his claim under the laws of the state where he is hired, the state where he is injured, or the state where his employment is located.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-10 (1976).Â  In order to determine where a claimantâ€™s employment is located, South Carolina has adopted the â€œbase of operations rule.â€Â  Voss v. RAMCO, Inc., 325 S.C. 560, 482 S.E.2d 582 (Ct. App. 1997); Holman v. Bulldog Trucking Co., 311 S.C. 341, 428 S.E.2d 889 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Under the base of operations rule, â€œthe workerâ€™s employment is located at the employerâ€™s place of business to which he reports, from which he receives his work assignments, and from which he starts his road trips, regardless of where the work is performed.â€Â  Holman, 311 S.C. at 346, 428 S.E.2d at 892 (citing Holland v. W.C.A.B. (Pep Boys), 586 A.2d 988 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1990)).\r\nIn Holman, our court of appeals held a truck driverâ€™s employment was located in Georgia.Â  The driver resided in South Carolina and worked out of a flatbed trailer terminal in Savannah, Georgia.Â  Id. at 343, 428 S.E.2d at 890.Â  The driver was both hired and injured in Georgia.Â  The driver argued that under Â§ 42-15-10, an employeeâ€™s employment could be located in more than one state when the employee travels into other states and conducts substantial business there.Â  Id. at 345, 428 S.E.2d at 892.Â  The court disagreed and held the driverâ€™s employment was located in Georgia because that is where the driver â€œreported to his employerâ€™s place of business for duty, where he picked up and returned his company truck, where he received his work assignments and from which he was dispatched, where he called in during the course of his work, and where he returned weekly when he had completed his work.â€Â  Id. at 346-47, 428 S.E.2d at 893.Â  \r\n \r\nIn Voss, the court of appeals held a traveling salesmanâ€™s employment was located in South Carolina.Â  The salesman, a Texas resident, was hired in Dallas by a representative for a South Carolina company.Â  Voss, 325 S.C. at 563, 482 S.E.2d at 583.Â  The company shipped equipment to the city in which the salesman was located and the salesman would negotiate sales requiring him to call the company office in South Carolina two to five times a day.Â  Id. at 564, 482 S.E.2d at 584.Â  The salesman was paid by either retaining a portion of the sales price or by receiving payment sent by the company.Â  Id. at 565, 482 S.E.2d at 584.Â  The salesman never sold equipment in South Carolina and traveled to this State only once.Â  Id.Â  He was injured in Washington.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Voss analysis was based on Holmanâ€™s proposition that the employeeâ€™s place of employment can only be in one state.Â  Id. at 570, 482 S.E.2d at 589.Â  The court distinguished Holman because it applied the base of operations rule in order to fit â€œneatly within the employment ritual of the employee truck driver in that case.â€Â  Id.Â  Under the Holman base of operations analysis, the Voss salesman would have no place of employment because he did not report to any place of business, nor did he receive work assignments from a particular place, or start his road trips from a particular locale.Â  In light of the legislatureâ€™s intent to broaden the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act by amending S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-10 in 1974,[2] the court reasoned that a personâ€™s employment must be located in some state.Â  Id. at 572, 482 S.E.2d at 588.Â  The court determined the Voss salesman was principally employed in South Carolina because it was the only state in which he had any base of operation.Â  Id.Â  The court noted that although this situation did not fit squarely within the base of operations test, South Carolina was the state where the salesman was employed considering the high degree of control exerted over him by his superiors who were located in South Carolina.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nLike the Voss salesman, Respondentâ€™s situation does not fit squarely within the base of operations test.Â  Respondent received his work assignment in North Carolina and began his road trips from his North Carolina residence.Â  His work-related contact with Employerâ€™s South Carolina home/office was limited during the six-week employment period prior to his injury.Â  Despite this, we believe the following factors are illustrative: (1) Respondent regularly worked for Employer in South Carolina during warm months for a number of years; (2) Respondent went to Employerâ€™s home/office in South Carolina on occasions to be paid, including at least once during the last interval of his work; (3) Respondent often met co-workers at the place of employment to go to jobs; and (4) Respondent performed work at Employerâ€™s home immediately before his injury.Â  Respondent was also taken back to Employerâ€™s home/office in South Carolina immediately following his injury.Â  Although none of these factors are individually determinative, they all lend support to the conclusion that South Carolina was the location of Respondentâ€™s employment.Â  This conclusion is underscored by the amount of control exerted over Respondent by Employer who was located in South Carolina.Â  See Voss, 325 S.C. 560, 482 S.E.2d 582.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we look not only at Respondentâ€™s six-week employment term, but also at his broad employment history with Employer.Â  Respondentâ€™s regular and recurring employment with Employer for several years prior to his injury was nearly entirely based in South Carolina.Â  The fact that Respondent was working in North Carolina on this particular occasion does not transport the Employerâ€™s base of operations from South Carolina to North Carolina.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants contend the base of operations rule does not apply to this case because Respondent is not a transient worker like the truck driver in Holman or the salesman in Voss.Â  We disagree.Â  This case presents a classic example of nomadic employment.Â  Respondent, an itinerant construction worker, did not work at a single location.Â  Rather, he traveled to jobsites wherever he was needed.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellants also argue that if the base of operations rule applies, the relevant base of operation was North Carolina because it is the employeeâ€™s base, and not the employerâ€™s base, that should be considered.Â  Appellantsâ€™ reasoning directly contradicts both Voss and Holman; cases which apply the base of operations rule to determine the location of nomadic employment based on the employerâ€™s place of business, â€œregardless of where the work is performed.â€Â  Holman, 311 S.C. at 346, 428 S.E.2d at 892.Â  In the instant case, Employer clearly operated his business out of his home in South Carolina.Â  Therefore, Employerâ€™s base of operation was in South Carolina.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nApplying the base of operations rule, we find Respondentâ€™s location of employment was South Carolina. Â Therefore, we hold that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission has jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  The decision of the circuit court is affirmed.Â \r\n \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, concur.\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-1-10 to 42-19-50 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005).\r\n[2] Prior to the 1974 amendment to Â§ 42-15-10, an employee injured outside the State could file a claim in South Carolina only if (1) his contract of employment was made in this State; (2) the employerâ€™s place of business was in this State; (3) the employeeâ€™s residence was in this State; and (4) the contract of employment was for services to be performed not exclusively outside this State.Â  The amended statute liberalizes the requirements by making the conditions for filing alternative rather than conjunctive.Â  See Holman, 311 S.C. at 345, 428 S.E.2d at 891-92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Harrison v.

Jenkins, Sr.\r\nAnderson County\r\nTrial Court Case No.Â Â  2007-DR-04-0000B\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRaymond Harrison, Appellant, is currently incarcerated.Â  He sought to file for a divorce from his wife.Â  He filed a summons and complaint with the county clerk of court, as well as a motion and affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis.Â  He did not include any filing fees with his summons and complaint or the motion.Â  The motion to proceed in forma pauperis was denied.Â  Appellant then filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  He received from the Chief Deputy Clerk of Court for Anderson County a letter that read:\r\n\r\n  We forwarded your Motion for Reconsideration to the Honorable Robert N. Jenkins, Jr., who had denied your Motion for In Forma Pauperis.Â  Judge Jenkins returned your Motion for Reconsideration to our office and states he will not amend his decision.\r\n\r\nAppellant filed this appeal with a caption that reads Ex Parte Raymond Harrison v. The State, In re Raymond Harrison v. Sherry Diane Harrison.[1]Â  Appellant also has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis in this court in which he indicates he has no means of earning an income while incarcerated and has no assets with which he can pay the filing fees.\r\nIn Lakes v. State, 333 S.C. 382, 510 S.E.2d 228 (Ct. App. 1998), this court found the order denying Lakesâ€™ request to proceed in forma pauperis effectively discontinued the action because Lakesâ€™ only means of bringing the action was in forma pauperis, and therefore, the order was immediately appealable.Â  In Ex Parte: Martin v. State, 321 S.C. 533, 471 S.E.2d 134 (1995), the supreme court addressed when an inmate may proceed in forma pauperis.Â Â  The supreme court held: â€œIn the absence of a statutory provision allowing the general waiver of filing fees, we conclude motions to proceed in forma pauperis may only be granted where specifically authorized by statute or required by constitutional provisions.â€Â  Id. at 535, 471 S.E.2d at 134-35 (citations omitted).Â Â  The supreme court went on to state:Â  â€œFurther, where certain fundamental rights are involved, the Constitution requires that an indigent be allowed access to the courts.Â  Id. at 535, 471 S.E.2d at 135 (citing as an example Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) (an indigent must be given access to courts in divorce action)).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court stated in Boddie:Â  â€œdue process requires, at a minimum, that absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard.â€Â  Boddie, 401 U.S. at 377.Â  The court summarized its position by stating:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n  [G]iven the basic position of the marriage relationship in this societyâ€™s hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship, due process does prohibit a State from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who seek judicial dissolution of their marriages.Â Â  \r\n\t \r\n\r\nId. at 374.\r\nThe facts of this case indicate Appellant is indigent and seeks access to this court to appeal the denial of his motion to proceed in forma pauperis in the family court.Â  Boddie clearly requires Appellant be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis both in this court and in the family court.\r\nAppellantâ€™s motion to proceed in forma pauperis in this appeal is granted.Â  Additionally, we reverse the family courtâ€™s order and remand this case to the family court to allow Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis in his family court action.Â  \r\n \r\nAND IT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    C.
