Gaffney Ledger, 333 S.C. 651, 511 S.E.2d 383 (Ct. App.\r\r\n\r\r\n1999). We reverse.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.274\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFACTS\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThis is a defamation case. Respondent Wayne Elder, was Chief of Police\r\r\n\r\r\nfor the town of Blacksburg. 1  On May 17, 1995, Petitioner, the Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n(Newspaper), printed the following in its \"What's Your Beef?\" 2 column:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAre the drug dealers paying?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI'd like to know what the people think about this. The Chief of the\r\r\n\r\r\nBlacksburg Police Department knows that these people are selling\r\r\n\r\r\ndrugs and they have been selling them many years and he hasn't\r\r\n\r\r\ndone anything about it. Now I often wonder if the drug dealers are\r\r\n\r\r\npaying the Chief of Blacksburg. And too, I would like to know why\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Gaffney police have to go over there and work in the police\r\r\n\r\r\ndepartment and do their work because they work here in Cherokee\r\r\n\r\r\nCounty. Don't they have enough money over there to hire\r\r\n\r\r\nBlacksburg police to do their jobs?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe editor of the paper, Cody Sossamon, made the decision to publish the above\r\r\n\r\r\nitem which was phoned into the Newspaper by an anonymous caller. Although\r\r\n\r\r\nSossamon wrote the caption, he testified he did not intend to suggest an answer\r\r\n\r\r\nto readers. However, Sossamon testified he himself believed drug dealers could\r\r\n\r\r\nbe paying the chief.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter publication of the column, Elder brought this libel action. The jury\r\r\n\r\r\nawarded him $10,000 in actual damages and $300,000 in punitive damages\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nISSUE 3\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1 He retired voluntarily in 1995 after twenty-five years of service.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2 \"What's Your Beef?\" is an opinion column in which readers are invited\r\r\n\r\r\nto telephone the newspaper and express their opinion or \"tell [the paper] what\r\r\n\r\r\n[they] think\" on an answering machine. Callers need not identify themselves.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3  In light of our holding, we find it unnecessary to address Newspaper's\r\r\n\r\r\ncontention that the phrase \"Now I often wonder if the drug dealers are paying\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Chief' is incapable of a defamatory meaning.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.274\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe sole issue we need address is whether there was sufficient\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence of constitutional actual malice to withstand Newspaper's\r\r\n\r\r\nmotion for directed verdict.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDISCUSSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn defamation actions involving a \"public official\" or \"public figure,\" the\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiff must prove the statement was made with \"actual malice,\" i.e., with\r\r\n\r\r\neither knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard for its truth. New York\r\r\n\r\r\nTimes Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S.\r\r\n\r\r\n323 (1974). See also Holtzscheiter v. Thomson News, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 506\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 497 (1998)(Toal, J., concurring). Whether the evidence is sufficient to\r\r\n\r\r\nsupport a finding of actual malice is a question of law. Harte-Hanks\r\r\n\r\r\nCommunications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 685 (1989). When\r\r\n\r\r\nreviewing an actual malice determination, this Court is obligated to\r\r\n\r\r\nindependently examine the entire record to determine whether the evidence\r\r\n\r\r\nsufficiently supports a finding of actual malice. Miller v. City of West\r\r\n\r\r\nColumbia, 322 S.C. 224, 471 S.E.2d 683 (1996).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nActual malice is a subjective standard testing the publisher's good faith\r\r\n\r\r\nbelief in the truth of his or her statements. Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting,\r\r\n\r\r\nInc., 324 S.C. 261, 478 S.E.2d 282 (1996). The constitutional actual malice\r\r\n\r\r\nstandard requires a public official to prove by clear and convincing evidence\r\r\n\r\r\nthat the defamatory falsehood was made with the knowledge of its falsity or\r\r\n\r\r\nwith reckless disregard for its truth. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra;\r\r\n\r\r\nBotchie v. O'Dowd, 315 S.C. 126, 432 S.E.2d 458 (1993). A \"reckless disregard\"\r\r\n\r\r\nfor the truth, however, requires more than a departure from reasonably prudent\r\r\n\r\r\nconduct. \"There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his\r\r\n\r\r\npublication.\" St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968)(emphasis\r\r\n\r\r\nsupplied). There must be evidence the defendant had a \"high degree of\r\r\n\r\r\nawareness of ... probable falsity.\" Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74\r\r\n\r\r\n(1964) (emphasis supplied).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFailure to investigate before publishing, even when a reasonably prudent\r\r\n\r\r\nperson would have done so, is not sufficient to establish reckless disregard. See\r\r\n\r\r\nSt. Amant, supra; Hunt v. Liberty Lobby, 720 F.2d 631, 642 (11th Cir. 1983);\r\r\n\r\r\nSchultz v. Newsweek, Inc., 668 F.2d 911, 918 (6th Cir. 1982). Actual malice may\r\r\n\r\r\nbe present, however, where one fails to investigate and there are obvious\r\r\n\r\r\nreasons to doubt the veracity of the informant. St. Amant, supra.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.275\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe actual malice standard is not satisfied merely through a showing of\r\r\n\r\r\nill will or `malice' in the ordinary sense of the term. Harte-Hanks, 491 U.S. at\r\r\n\r\r\n666. It is insufficient to show the defendant made an editorial choice or simply\r\r\n\r\r\nfailed to investigate or verify information; there must be evidence at least that\r\r\n\r\r\nthe defendant purposefully avoided the truth. Gaylord Broadcasting v. Francis,\r\r\n\r\r\n7 S.W.3d 279 (Tex. 1999); ABC, Inc. v. Gill, 6 S.W.3d 19 (Tex. 1999). Erasure\r\r\n\r\r\nof a tape recording when done as part of a routine practice is not evidence of\r\r\n\r\r\nactual malice. Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting, 324 S.C. 261, 478 S.E.2d 282\r\r\n\r\r\n(1996). Although evidence concerning motive or care may bear some relation\r\r\n\r\r\nto the actual malice inquiry; however, \"courts must be careful not to place too\r\r\n\r\r\nmuch reliance on such factors.\" Harte-Hanks, 491 U.S. at 668.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe evidence relied upon in this case to demonstrate actual malice is as\r\r\n\r\r\nfollows: 1) that Sossamon failed to investigate or verify the information left by\r\r\n\r\r\nthe anonymous caller; 2) that the phone recording of the anonymous caller was\r\r\n\r\r\n\"erased\" by Newspaper; 3) that Sossamon pled guilty to manufacturing\r\r\n\r\r\nmarijuana in 1991; and 4) that Sossamon had been \"rude\" to Chief Elder's wife\r\r\n\r\r\non one occasion when she was at the Newspaper to place an ad for her husband.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis evidence is patently insufficient to demonstrate Sossamon in fact\r\r\n\r\r\nentertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication. 4\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAs to the first item, the failure to investigate, while there was expert\r\r\n\r\r\ntestimony that reporters verify the accuracy of news articles, and Sossamon\r\r\n\r\r\ntestified he did not have sufficient evidence to develop a news story that Elder\r\r\n\r\r\nwas being bribed, there was no testimony that the same verification procedures\r\r\n\r\r\napply to editorials or opinion columns. In fact, the experts called by Elder did\r\r\n\r\r\nnot write editorials. The only testimony with respect to columns such as\r\r\n\r\r\n\"What's Your Beef?\" came from Sossamon who testified that, although some\r\r\n\r\r\nnewspapers have a policy against publishing anonymous items, he knew of a\r\r\n\r\r\nnumber which do, in fact, publish such items. Moreover, as noted previously,\r\r\n\r\r\na mere failure to investigate is not tantamount to actual malice. St. Amant,\r\r\n\r\r\nsupra. The fact that Sossamon did not investigate the anonymous phone call\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n 4 Elder also contends the fact that Newspaper failed to list Sossamon as\r\r\n\r\r\na witness who could corroborate the truth of the statement in its answers to\r\r\n\r\r\ninterrogatories constitutes evidence of constitutional actual malice. We fail to\r\r\n\r\r\nsee how a party's failure to list a witness in answers to interrogatories\r\r\n\r\r\ndemonstrates actual malice in the publication of the article. Moreover,\r\r\n\r\r\nSossamon was listed as a witness in Newspapers' answers to interrogatories;\r\r\n\r\r\nhe was simply not listed in response to interrogatory number 6.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.276\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nsimply does not demonstrate that he \"purposefully avoided\" the truth. 5\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Court of Appeals also suggested that the failure of Newspaper to\r\r\n\r\r\nintroduce the tape of the phone call was evidence of the possibility that Editor\r\r\n\r\r\nmanufactured the entire piece. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' insinuation,\r\r\n\r\r\nthere was simply no evidence that Sossamon fabricated the phone call, or that\r\r\n\r\r\nthe tape was non-existent. 6  In relying upon the absence of the tape to\r\r\n\r\r\nestablish evidence of Sossamon's possible motive, the Court of Appeals\r\r\n\r\r\neffectually switched the burden to Newspaper to introduce the recording. This\r\r\n\r\r\nwas error. See Tucker v. Reynolds, 268 S.C. 330, 233 S.E.2d 402 (1977) (burden\r\r\n\r\r\nto prove his case is always on plaintiff). Given that counsel for Elder was in\r\r\n\r\r\npossession of a copy of the tape, and its authenticity was not an issue at trial,\r\r\n\r\r\nwe find the Court of Appeals erred in relying upon its absence to demonstrate\r\r\n\r\r\nan inference of malice. 7\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Court of Appeals also cited the fact that Sossamon had a 1991\r\r\n\r\r\nconviction for manufacturing marijuana, concluding that he may have been\r\r\n\r\r\nmotivated by his own problems with law enforcement to discredit Elder. In our\r\r\n\r\r\nview, the Court of Appeals placed undue emphasis on this conviction. There\r\r\n\r\r\nwas no evidence Elder had anything whatsoever to do with Sossamon's arrest;\r\r\n\r\r\non the contrary, it appears from the record that Sossamon was arrested by a\r\r\n\r\r\nDetective Burgess. Moreover, Sossamon repeatedly testified that he owed his\r\r\n\r\r\nlife to the fact that he was arrested, and in fact had called and thanked the\r\r\n\r\r\nSheriff who had arrested him. In sum, there was simply no testimony linking\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n5 The Court of Appeals made much of the fact that Sossamon conceded\r\r\n\r\r\nhe did not have sufficient information to develop a news story. 511 S.E.2d at\r\r\n\r\r\n388. This is simply another way of stating he failed to investigate. The fact\r\r\n\r\r\nthat he did not have enough information to transform an editorial/opinion\r\r\n\r\r\ncolumn into a news story simply does not demonstrate he had substantial doubt\r\r\n\r\r\nas to its truth.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n6  The message was left on what Sossamon described as a \"computer\r\r\n\r\r\nrecording.\" When Sossamon went to retrieve it for Elder the day following the\r\r\n\r\r\npublication, he was told it had been \"killed\" off the computer (or recorded over).\r\r\n\r\r\nNewspaper was subsequently able to retrieve the original message from a\r\r\n\r\r\nmirror recording, a copy of which was given to counsel for Elder prior to trial.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n7 Moreover, this Court has recognized that erasure of a tape recording is\r\r\n\r\r\nnot evidence of actual malice. Peeler, supra.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.277\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSossamon's 1991 arrest to any ill motive toward Chief Elder such that its\r\r\n\r\r\nrelevance in this case is questionable.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWith regard to Mrs. Elder's testimony that Sossamon was \"rude\" to her,\r\r\n\r\r\nalthough we agree with the Court of Appeals that evidence of ill will may, in\r\r\n\r\r\nsome circumstances, be relevant to demonstrate motive, we fail to see the\r\r\n\r\r\nrelevance of Mrs. Elder's testimony in this case. The mere fact that Sossamon\r\r\n\r\r\nspoke to her in a \"very smart, rude\" manner on one occasion more than a year\r\r\n\r\r\nprior to the publication of the column is simply irrelevant to demonstrate malice\r\r\n\r\r\nby Sossamon toward Elder. It is possible Sossamon is generally a rude person,\r\r\n\r\r\nor was in a bad mood on the day in question, or perhaps has a dislike of Mrs.\r\r\n\r\r\nElder. Accordingly, we find Mrs. Elder's testimony irrelevant.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMoreover, even if Sossamon's conviction and his \"rudeness\" toward Mrs.\r\r\n\r\r\nElder are somehow relevant to a determination of \"ill will\" toward Chief Elder,\r\r\n\r\r\nthey are insufficient to demonstrate the requisite constitutional actual malice\r\r\n\r\r\nin publishing the item. As noted by the United States Supreme Court, the\r\r\n\r\r\nactual malice standard is not satisfied merely through a showing of ill will or\r\r\n\r\r\n\"malice\" in the ordinary sense of the term. Harte-Hanks, supra, 491 U.S. at\r\r\n\r\r\n666, 109 S.Ct. at 2685, n. 7 (phrase \"actual malice\" is unfortunately confusing\r\r\n\r\r\nin that it has nothing to do with bad motive or ill will). See also Chapin v.\r\r\n\r\r\nKnight-Ridder, 993 F.2d 1087,1092, n. 5 (4th Cir.1993)(\"actual malice\" does not\r\r\n\r\r\nrefer to \"ill will\"); Sanders v. Prince, 304 S.C. 236, 403 S.E.2d 640 (1991)(jury\r\r\n\r\r\nmay not impose liability on basis of defendant's hatred, spite, ill will, or desire\r\r\n\r\r\nto injure as \"[i]ll will toward the plaintiff, or bad motives, are not elements of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe New York Times standard\"); Beckley Newspapers Corp. v. Hanks,, 389 U.S.\r\r\n\r\r\n81, 88 S.Ct. 197, 19 L.Ed.2d 248 (1967). Although it cannot be said that\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence concerning motive or care never bears any relation to the actual malice\r\r\n\r\r\ninquiry, courts should be careful not to place too much reliance on such factors.\r\r\n\r\r\nHarte-Hanks, supra. \"Bad motive or hostility is not what is meant by malice\r\r\n\r\r\nin the New York Times sense.\" Pacella v. Milford Radio Corp., 462 N.E.2d 355,\r\r\n\r\r\n361 (Mass. 1984). Since evidence of ill will is not part of the actual-malice test,\r\r\n\r\r\nits admission could cause unnecessary jury confusion and arguably restrict the\r\r\n\r\r\nspeech rights of adversaries without commensurate proof that the defendant\r\r\n\r\r\nknew or suspected a falsehood. See Pendleton v. City of Haverhill, 156 F.3d 57,\r\r\n\r\r\n65 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming exclusion of evidence of libel defendant's animus\r\r\n\r\r\ntoward plaintiff on the ground that \"[i]n the defamation context, 'malice' does\r\r\n\r\r\nnot relate to the defendant's motive for speaking or even to whether the\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant made the challenged statement out of ill will\"). Even where such\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence is admitted (as, for example, to show that the defendant had a motive\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.278\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v. Gaffney Ledger\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nto lie about the plaintiff), it has been observed that it does not approach a\r\r\n\r\r\nshowing of the mordant unconcern with the truth of a particular statement\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich is crucial to the claim of defamation by a public figure. Nat'l Ass'n of\r\r\n\r\r\nGov't Employ Inc. v. Central Broadcasting Corp, 396 N.E.2d 996, 1003\r\r\n\r\r\n(Mass. 1979).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nUnder the facts of this case,'even if we assume Sossamon's conviction and\r\r\n\r\r\nalleged \"rudeness\" tend to demonstrate that he in fact held some ill will toward\r\r\n\r\r\nChief Elder, those factors far fall short of the requisite clear and convincing\r\r\n\r\r\nstandard of demonstrating he deliberately published \"What's Your Beef?\" with\r\r\n\r\r\na \"high degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity.\" Garrison v. Louisiana,\r\r\n\r\r\nsupra.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFinally, Sossamon testified that he believed the information contained in\r\r\n\r\r\n\"What's Your Beef?\" could be true because Chief Elder knew some people in\r\r\n\r\r\nBlacksburg who had been selling drugs for many years and had not done\r\r\n\r\r\nanything about it, 8  and because Elder had at one time called Sossamon to\r\r\n\r\r\nadvise him that a Newspaper employee had been hanging out with a known\r\r\n\r\r\ndrug dealer. Sossamon took the fact that Chief Elder had \"tipped him off\" as an\r\r\n\r\r\nindication that he \"could have tipped anyone off.\" Given this is the only\r\r\n\r\r\ntestimony regarding Sossamon's subjective belief concerning the publication, we\r\r\n\r\r\nsimply cannot say he \"purposefully avoided the truth\" in printing the column.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nCONCLUSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nEssentially, the evidence of actual malice in this case boils down to\r\r\n\r\r\nSossamon's failure to investigate an anonymous phone call prior to publishing\r\r\n\r\r\nit in a clearly designated editorial/opinion column, 9  and some speculative\r\r\n\r\r\ntestimony that Sossamon could possibly have harbored some ill will toward\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n8  Elder essentially conceded this fact at trial.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n9  The fact that the item was published in \"What's Your Beef?\" militates\r\r\n\r\r\nagainst a finding of actual malice. The column was clearly labeled as an\r\r\n\r\r\neditorial/opinion column, and plainly advised readers they could call the\r\r\n\r\r\nnewspaper and \"get it off your chest\" without leaving their name. The \"form\r\r\n\r\r\nand content of the story are relevant not only to the falsity and neutral\r\r\n\r\r\nreportage questions, but also to the question of actual malice.\" Harte-Hanks,\r\r\n\r\r\nsupra, 491 U.S. at 695, 109 S.Ct. at 2699 (Blackmun, J., concurring).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.279\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v.

Sossamon's claim he believed the\r\r\n\r\r\nanonymous recording was true because Chief Elder had previously notified\r\r\n\r\r\nhim a newspaper employee was \"hanging out\" with a drug dealer who was\r\r\n\r\r\ngoing to be arrested does not support the recording's assertion Chief Elder\r\r\n\r\r\nwas taking bribes from drug dealers. In fact, it suggests the contrary: that\r\r\n\r\r\nChief Elder was actively arresting drug dealers. In that the United States\r\r\n\r\r\nSupreme Court has recognized the danger inherent in relying on anonymous\r\r\n\r\r\nsources, St. Amant, 390 U.S. 727, Sossamon's failure to take any steps to\r\r\n\r\r\ncorroborate the accuracy of the recording suggests a purposeful avoidance of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe truth tantamount to reckless disregard for the truth. Harte-Hanks, 491\r\r\n\r\r\nU.S. at 692 (\" [a]lthough failure to investigate will not alone support a finding\r\r\n\r\r\nof actual malice, purposeful avoidance of the truth is in a different\r\r\n\r\r\ncategory.\") (internal citations omitted).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMoreover, Sossamon's attitude towards Chief Elder's wife prior\r\r\n\r\r\nto the publication of the recording indicates a degree of apparent hostility\r\r\n\r\r\ntowards Chief Elder. Further, notwithstanding his claims to the contrary,\r\r\n\r\r\nSossamon's own arrest and conviction for manufacturing marijuana are\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence of his motive for publishing the recording without regard to\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether its assertions were true. Id. at 668 (italic added) (\"[a]lthough courts\r\r\n\r\r\nmust be careful not to place too much reliance on such factors, a plaintiff is\r\r\n\r\r\nentitled to prove the defendant's state of mind through circumstantial\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence, and it cannot be said that evidence concerning motive or care never\r\r\n\r\r\nbears any relation to the actual malice inquiry.\") (internal citations omitted).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.282\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nElder v.

The former husband\r\r\n\r\r\nborrowed the car while they were there. The former husband knew the location\r\r\n\r\r\nof the victim's home because petitioner previously had taken the former\r\r\n\r\r\nhusband there to meet an ex-girlfriend.

State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 530-31, 466 S.E.2d 364,\r\r\n\r\r\n367 (1996); see also Arizona v.

Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80\r\r\n\r\r\nL.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \"To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\r\r\n\r\r\ncounsel, a PCR applicant has the burden of proving counsel's representation fell\r\r\n\r\r\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness and, but for counsel's errors,\r\r\n\r\r\nthere is a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been\r\r\n\r\r\ndifferent ....

However, an appellate court will not affirm the\r\r\n\r\r\ndecision when it is not supported by any probative evidence. Holland v. State,\r\r\n\r\r\n322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe conclude the PCR judge erred in denying petitioner's claim\r\r\n\r\r\nbecause no probative evidence supports his decision. Petitioner has shown error\r\r\n\r\r\nin counsel's failure to object to the detective's testimony and the prosecutor's\r\r\n\r\r\ncomments, as explained by the above cases.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe further conclude petitioner has shown that the error prejudiced\r\r\n\r\r\nhim. In Johnson, supra, we held that counsel was not ineffective in failing to\r\r\n\r\r\nobject to the solicitor's closing comment that \"You have seen that the defendant\r\r\n\r\r\nhas not put up a defense, he's not testified, and you will hear shortly, after I\r\r\n\r\r\nargue and after Mr. Pough argues and his honor, Judge Whetstone, you cannot\r\r\n\r\r\neven consider the fact that this man has not testified in this trial . . . .\" Id. at\r\r\n\r\r\n186, 480 S.E.2d at 734 (emphasis in original).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe found that the PCR judge's conclusion that the jury could have\r\r\n\r\r\ndrawn an adverse inference from the solicitor's comment was not supported by\r\r\n\r\r\nthe evidence. \"In context, the comment was simply a statement of the evidence\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich was before the jury, rather than a comment on Johnson's failure to\r\r\n\r\r\ntestify. As such, it is distinguishable from the typical 'comment' in which the\r\r\n\r\r\nclear implication is that the defendant has failed to explain the circumstances\r\r\n\r\r\nof the crime or has shown no remorse.\" Id. at 187, 480 S.E.2d at 735.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurthermore, the judge's curative instruction nullified any error. Id. 3\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3  In limited exceptions to the general rule, the State may point out a\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant's silence prior to arrest, or his silence after arrest but prior to the\r\r\n\r\r\ngiving of the Miranda warnings, in order to impeach the defendant's testimony\r\r\n\r\r\nat trial. \"Such silence is probative and does not rest on any implied assurance\r\r\n\r\r\nby law enforcement authorities that it will carry no penalty.\" Brecht v.\r\r\n\r\r\nAbrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 628, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1716, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).\r\r\n\r\r\nThe State also may in limited instances raise a defendant's silence when the\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant or his counsel \"open the door\" by asserting the State never has given\r\r\n\r\r\nhim an opportunity to tell his side of the story. United States v. Robinson, 485\r\r\n\r\r\nU.S. 25,108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988) (where defendant's counsel stated\r\r\n\r\r\nseveral times in closing argument that the Government had not allowed\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant to explain his side of the story, prosecutor's closing comment that (3 con't...)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.291\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nEDMOND v. STATE\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJohnson is easily distinguished from the present case. The\r\r\n\r\r\ndetective's testimony and the prosecutor's closing argument at petitioner's trial\r\r\n\r\r\nwere direct and improper references to the exercise of his constitutional rights.\r\r\n\r\r\nJurors may have used the improper testimony and comments to infer petitioner\r\r\n\r\r\nwas guilty simply because he exercised his rights. In addition, petitioner's\r\r\n\r\r\ncounsel did not request and the trial judge did not give a curative instruction.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn deciding the prejudice prong in this PCR action, we examine the\r\r\n\r\r\nfollowing factors, which are the same ones analyzed in deciding on direct appeal\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether a similar error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Such an error\r\r\n\r\r\nwill not be deemed prejudicial when the record shows the reference to the\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant's right to silence or to an attorney was a single reference, which was\r\r\n\r\r\nnot repeated or alluded to; the prosecutor did not tie the defendant's exercise\r\r\n\r\r\nof his right directly to his exculpatory story; the exculpatory story was totally\r\r\n\r\r\nimplausible; and the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. See Pickens, 320 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\nat 530-31, 466 S.E.2d at 367. A court's confidence in the outcome of the trial\r\r\n\r\r\nlikely would not be undermined if those factors are met.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nPetitioner has shown prejudice because the record contains three\r\r\n\r\r\ndirect references to the exercise of his right to remain silent or be represented\r\r\n\r\r\nby counsel. Immediately after stating that petitioner had invoked his right to\r\r\n\r\r\ncounsel, the prosecutor told jurors that the man at whom petitioner had pointed\r\r\n\r\r\nthe finger testified he did not commit the crimes. The prosecutor tied the\r\r\n\r\r\nexercise of the right to petitioner's exculpatory story, which was not totally\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(3 continued...)  defendant \"could have taken the stand and explained it to you\" did not violate\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because\r\r\n\r\r\nprosecutor's reference to defendant's opportunity to testify was a fair response\r\r\n\r\r\nto a claim made by defendant's counsel). However, the proper practice in a\r\r\n\r\r\ntypical case such as petitioner's is for the prosecutor to avoid any mention of the\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant's exercise of constitutional rights. See Holliday, 333 S.C. at 340, 509\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d at 284 (stating that Supreme Court and Court of Appeals repeatedly\r\r\n\r\r\nhave warned against violation of the Doyle prohibition, and citing cases).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.292\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nEDMOND v.

McCann, of Charleston, for respondent.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nPER CURIAM: This case is before the Court on a writ of \r\r\n\r\r\ncertiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision in State v. Warren, 330 \r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 584, 500 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 1998). We reverse.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nRespondent was convicted of second degree criminal sexual \r\r\n\r\r\nconduct with a minor, his stepdaughter Christy. During Christy's cross-\r\r\n\r\r\nexamination, respondent's counsel elicited the fact that respondent had also \r\r\n\r\r\nallegedly sexually abused Christy's sister Brandy. When the State \r\r\n\r\r\nattempted to exploit this information, respondent's objection was sustained \r\r\n\r\r\nand a curative instruction was given. Never-the-less, respondent's counsel \r\r\n\r\r\ncontinued to elicit information about Brandy's allegations, and the State \r\r\n\r\r\ncontinued to exploit these opportunities and others. Respondent's counsel\r\r\n\r\r\nobjected to some, but not all, of the solicitor's questions. 1\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAt the close of the evidence, respondent's counsel asked for an \r\r\n\r\r\ninstruction telling the jury not to consider prior bad acts as proof of the crime \r\r\n\r\r\nwith which respondent was charged. The judge declined to give the charge, \r\r\n\r\r\nand respondent appealed. The Court of Appeals addressed this issue by \r\r\n\r\r\nreviewing numerous appellate decisions, some involving the use of prior bad \r\r\n\r\r\nacts as impeachment evidence 2\r\r\n  and others where the prior bad act was \r\r\n\r\r\nadmitted under Lyle 3\r\r\n as substantive proof that the defendant had committed \r\r\n\r\r\nthe crime charged. 4\r\r\n  The Court concluded the evidence of the alleged assault \r\r\n\r\r\non Brandy must have been admitted as substantive evidence under Lyle, and\r\r\n\r\r\ntherefore the limiting instruction should have been given pursuant to State \r\r\n\r\r\nv. Timmons, 327 S.C. 48, 488 S.E.2d 323 (1997). We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe fundamental problem with this case is that the \"bad act\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1\r\r\n The Court of Appeals' opinion contains a full recital of the facts.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2\r\r\n e.g., State v.

Kelly was sentenced to death for murder, thirty years consecutive \r\r\n  for armed robbery, and five years consecutive for possession of a knife during \r\r\n  the commission of a violent crime. This case consolidates his direct appeal \r\r\n  with the mandatory review provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985). We \r\r\n  affirm.\r\r\n  \r\r\nFACTS\r\r\n  \r\r\nOn the night of January 5, 1996, \r\r\n  police officer Stephen Clare drove by the Batesburg KFC and noticed in the parking \r\r\n  lot a car running with the driver's door open. Knowing that it was after the \r\r\n  restaurant's usual closing time and recognizing the car as belonging to Shirley \r\r\n  Shealy, the manager of the KFC, Officer Clare pulled in to investigate. Officer \r\r\n  Clare discovered Shealy's body in the KFC; her hands were taped behind her back, \r\r\n  and money was strewn all over the floor and stuck to her bloody body.\r\r\n  \r\r\n Kelly, a former KFC employee, had \r\r\n  visited the KFC earlier that day. After interviewing KFC employees, Batesburg-Leesville \r\r\n  Chief of Police William Oswald attempted to locate Kelly. On January 8, 1996, \r\r\n  Kelly's mother called Chief Oswald and told him that Kelly was in Lowell, Massachusetts. \r\r\n  Lowell police detectives found Kelly at his sister's residence in Lowell. Kelly, \r\r\n  who was seventeen years old at the time, was advised of his Miranda \r\r\n  (1) rights and made a statement to the detectives admitting that he \r\r\n  killed Shealy and stole money from the KFC. Kelly had in his possession money \r\r\n  stained with Shealy's blood. In addition, the Lowell detectives retrieved Kelly's \r\r\n  bloodstained clothing from his car.\r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly was indicted for murder, kidnapping, \r\r\n  armed robbery, and possession of a knife during the commission of a violent \r\r\n  crime. At trial, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy testified \r\r\n  that Shealy was stabbed thirty-one times and her neck was cut from ear to ear. \r\r\n  She bled to death. At the time of her death, Shealy was 23 weeks pregnant. The \r\r\n  jury convicted Kelly on all charges.\r\r\n  \r\r\nIn the sentencing phase, the trial \r\r\n  court instructed the jury on five statutory aggravating circumstances, to wit, \r\r\n  that the murder was committed while in the commission of: (1) kidnapping; (2) \r\r\n  burglary; (3) robbery while armed with a deadly weapon; (4) larceny with use \r\r\n  of a deadly weapon; and (5) physical torture. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) \r\r\n  (Supp. 1999). The jury was charged on three statutory mitigating circumstances: \r\r\n  (1) the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal conviction involving \r\r\n  the use of violence against another person; (2) the age of the defendant at \r\r\n  the time of the crime; and (3) the defendant was below the age of eighteen at \r\r\n  the time of the crime. Id. The jury found all five aggravating circumstances \r\r\n  and recommended the death penalty. Accordingly, the trial court imposed a sentence \r\r\n  of death for the murder conviction.\r\r\n  \r\r\nISSUES\r\r\n  \r\r\n1. Did the trial court err by refusing \r\r\n  to redact from Kelly's statement references to Shealy's pregnancy?\r\r\n  \r\r\n2. Did the trial court err by refusing \r\r\n  to charge the jury on parole ineligibility?\r\r\n  \r\r\n3. Did the trial court err by refusing \r\r\n  to charge the jury that future dangerousness was not at issue? \r\r\n  \r\r\n4. Was the testimony of Matthew McCormack \r\r\n  improperly bolstered by the State?\r\r\n  \r\r\n5. Did the trial court err by allowing \r\r\n  testimony from Shealy's sister about statements made by Shealy's son? \r\r\n  \r\r\n1. FAILURE \r\r\n  TO REDACT REFERENCES TO VICTIM'S PREGNANCY\r\r\nKelly raises only one issue regarding \r\r\n  the guilt phase of his trial. He argues that the trial court erred by not redacting \r\r\n  from his confession references to Shealy's pregnancy. We disagree.\r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly gave the Lowell police a written \r\r\n  statement which the State introduced at trial. In his statement, Kelly confessed \r\r\n  to slitting Shealy's throat and stabbing her repeatedly. Basically, Kelly's \r\r\n  explanation for why he killed Shealy was that his attack was in response to \r\r\n  Shealy's request for sex. He stated that while he worked at the KFC, Shealy \r\r\n  would \"always\" proposition him sexually. Kelly stated that on January 5, 1996, \r\r\n  he went to the KFC after closing time and saw Shealy in the office. According \r\r\n  to Kelly, Shealy again propositioned him for sex, grabbed him, and asked him \r\r\n  not to leave. He stated that he duct-taped Shealy's hands behind her back so \r\r\n  she would not touch him. Kelly said that as he went to leave, Shealy got her \r\r\n  hands free, grabbed him and started hitting him. Kelly stated that he then took \r\r\n  out his knife, slit her throat and continued to stab her while she kept grabbing \r\r\n  at him. Kelly told the Lowell police that Shealy then fell to the floor and \r\r\n  was gasping for air. To keep her from getting up, Kelly said that he again taped \r\r\n  her hands behind her back. \r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly made two references to Shealy's \r\r\n  pregnancy in his statement. First, he stated that he \"did know that Shirley \r\r\n  was pregnant.\" Second, Kelly stated that Shealy asked him \"to stay and have \r\r\n  sex with her\" and that she told him \"since she was pregnant already\" he could \r\r\n  not get her pregnant if they had sex.\r\r\n  \r\r\nAt the outset of the guilt phase, \r\r\n  Kelly moved to exclude any evidence that Shealy was pregnant. The State informed \r\r\n  the trial court that it planned on introducing Kelly's statement which, as detailed \r\r\n  above, included references to the pregnancy. Kelly then moved to redact those \r\r\n  references. The trial court denied the motion. With the exception of Kelly's \r\r\n  statement, the State did not introduce any evidence about Shealy's pregnancy \r\r\n  during the guilt phase of the trial. Kelly presented no witnesses in his defense. \r\r\n  At Kelly's request, the jury was instructed on voluntary manslaughter. \r\r\n  \r\r\nIn the State's guilt phase closing \r\r\n  argument, Shealy's pregnancy was mentioned twice without objection. The State \r\r\n  argued that Kelly had \"the perfect victim. He's got a pregnant lady. Is she \r\r\n  going to do what he says? Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir.\" The State noted the pathologist's \r\r\n  testimony that there were no defensive wounds and no blood on Shealy's hands. \r\r\n  The State therefore argued that Kelly's statement that Shealy's hands were free \r\r\n  during the attack was not credible. Specifically, the State argued that if her \r\r\n  hands were free, \"What is she going to do? She's going to be covering up. She's \r\r\n  going to be trying to avoid it. She's pregnant.\"\r\r\n  \r\r\n Kelly contends that the trial court \r\r\n  should have redacted his statement to remove the references to Shealy's pregnancy \r\r\n  because the evidence was not relevant, or, alternatively, the probative value \r\r\n  of this evidence was outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial impact. We disagree.\r\r\n  \r\r\nEvidence is relevant and admissible \r\r\n  if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence \r\r\n  to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would \r\r\n  be without the evidence. Rules 401, 402, SCRE. Nevertheless, relevant evidence \r\r\n  may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \r\r\n  of unfair prejudice. Rule 403, SCRE. Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency \r\r\n  to suggest decision on an improper basis, such as an emotional one. State \r\r\n  v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991) (citation omitted). \r\r\n  The trial court is given broad discretion in ruling on questions concerning \r\r\n  the relevancy of evidence, and its decision will be reversed only if there is \r\r\n  a clear abuse of discretion. Id. at 380, 401 S.E.2d at 148.\r\r\n  \r\r\nThe jury was instructed on both murder \r\r\n  and voluntary manslaughter. (2) Thus, there was \r\r\n  an issue on the presence or absence of malice. See&nbsp;State v. Gandy, \r\r\n  283 S.C. 571, 573, 324 S.E.2d 65, 66-67 (1984) (voluntary manslaughter is distinguished \r\r\n  from murder because \"the vital element of malice is missing\") implicitly \r\r\n  overruled on other grounds by Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 \r\r\n  (1991); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-10, 16-3-50 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999). \"'Malice' \r\r\n  is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved \r\r\n  spirit intent on doing wrong.\" State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 \r\r\n  S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998).\r\r\n  \r\r\nWe believe the evidence of Shealy's \r\r\n  pregnancy was relevant to the issue of intent, i.e., whether Kelly acted with \r\r\n  malice. The State's theory of the case was that Kelly planned his crimes. \r\r\n  (3) Because Kelly knew Shealy was pregnant, and thus, particularly \r\r\n  vulnerable, the jury could infer that Kelly had consciously selected a \"perfect \r\r\n  victim.\" Such evidence of planning certainly negates voluntary manslaughter \r\r\n  which requires a showing of provocation. Additionally, although the evidence \r\r\n  of Shealy's pregnancy came directly from Kelly's own statement, this evidence \r\r\n  tended to refute Kelly's version of how the attack occurred. Therefore, Kelly's \r\r\n  references to the pregnancy made it less probable that he committed voluntary \r\r\n  manslaughter. See Rule 401, SCRE. Moreover, the fact that Kelly killed \r\r\n  a pregnant woman, in our opinion, \"indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent \r\r\n  on doing wrong.\" State v. Kelsey, supra. The evidence was, therefore, \r\r\n  probative on the issue of whether Kelly acted with malice.\r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly argues that this evidence undeniably \r\r\n  had an emotional impact on the jury, and thus should have been excluded because \r\r\n  it was unfairly prejudicial. As discussed above, the evidence was relevant to \r\r\n  the only real issue in the guilt phase-the presence or absence of malice. Accordingly, \r\r\n  we believe the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. \r\r\n  Compare State v. Garner, 304 S.C. 220, 403 S.E.2d 631 (1991) (prejudicial \r\r\n  effect of evidence of other crimes outweighs its probative value when purpose \r\r\n  for which it is admitted is not a contested issue) with State v. Simmons, \r\r\n  310 S.C. 439, 427 S.E.2d 175 (1993) (probative value of other-crimes evidence \r\r\n  outweighed its prejudicial effect where the issue of intent was a contested \r\r\n  one), reversed on other grounds by Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. \r\r\n  154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994). (4)\r\r\n  \r\r\nWe hold that the trial court did \r\r\n  not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Shealy's pregnancy in the \r\r\n  guilt phase. State v. Alexander, supra. Accordingly, Kelly's convictions \r\r\n  are affirmed.\r\r\n  \r\r\n2. REFUSAL \r\r\n  TO GIVE PAROLE INELIGIBILITY INSTRUCTION\r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly argues that the trial court \r\r\n  erred in the sentencing phase when it refused to instruct the jury that he would \r\r\n  be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life. Kelly contends that since the \r\r\n  State presented evidence of Kelly's future dangerousness, due process and Simmons \r\r\n  v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994), \r\r\n  required the parole ineligibility charge. We hold that Simmons does not \r\r\n  apply to this case, and therefore, the trial court correctly declined to give \r\r\n  the instruction.\r\r\n  \r\r\nIn the sentencing phase, the State \r\r\n  presented several witnesses who testified about Kelly's actions while he was \r\r\n  incarcerated at the Lexington County Detention Center. The jail administrator \r\r\n  testified that an attempted escape charge had been filed against Kelly because \r\r\n  a mortar joint around a cinder block in his cell had been gouged out. \r\r\n  (5) Matthew McCormack, who had twice been Kelly's cellmate at the \r\r\n  jail, testified that he and Kelly often spoke of escaping and that Kelly had, \r\r\n  at one point, taken action on an escape plan. McCormack stated that Kelly made \r\r\n  a shank and planned to take a female correctional officer hostage. Although \r\r\n  Kelly called the correctional officer to their cell, McCormack stated that Kelly \r\r\n  backed out of going through with the plan. The State also questioned correctional \r\r\n  officer Mark Wharton who testified that he discovered a shank in Kelly's possession. \r\r\n  Finally, Edward Bryant, who had been in jail with Kelly, testified that he heard \r\r\n  Kelly talk about escape. In addition, Bryant testified that Kelly bragged about \r\r\n  his crime, requested that he be called \"KFC,\" and walked around with a cup which \r\r\n  had a drawing of a chicken with its head cut off and a knife on it.\r\r\n  \r\r\nAt the conclusion of the sentencing \r\r\n  phase, Kelly requested the following jury charge:\r\r\n  \r\r\n \r\r\n  I charge you that the term \"life \r\r\n    imprisonment\" means imprisonment until the death of the offender. No person \r\r\n    sentenced to life imprisonment is eligible for parole, community supervision, \r\r\n    or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work \r\r\n    credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that \r\r\n    would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by law.\r\r\n\r\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. \r\r\n  1999). The State objected to the charge and stated that because it was not going \r\r\n  to argue future dangerousness, the charge was not required by Simmons. Ruling \r\r\n  that the State's evidence went to Kelly's character and characteristics and \r\r\n  not to future dangerousness, the trial court denied the request to charge. \r\r\n  (6) \r\r\n  \r\r\nIn closing argument, the State argued \r\r\n  that the death penalty was \"the punishment that fits the crime.\" The State argued \r\r\n  that Kelly had planned his crime and that he was a \"master murderer.\" Because \r\r\n  Kelly had no prior record, the State argued that a person who commits \"an unpredictable \r\r\n  crime is more frightening than a serial killer, more frightening than a career \r\r\n  criminal. . . . You kind of trust them a little bit.\" Further, the State argued \r\r\n  that Kelly was intelligent, quick-witted and did not have any mental illness. \r\r\n  Thus, the State argued that made Kelly \"a little more dangerous . . . for this \r\r\n  lady, this crime on January the 5th, doesn't that make him more unpredictable \r\r\n  for Shirley Shealy.\" Finally, the State recounted, over objection, the evidence \r\r\n  regarding Kelly's attempted escapes from jail and that he had a shank. The State \r\r\n  then argued that \"murderers will be murderers. And he is the cold-blooded one \r\r\n  right over there.\" \r\r\n  \r\r\nOn appeal, Kelly contends that: (1) \r\r\n  the State's evidence about escape attempts, possession of a shank, and his behavior \r\r\n  in jail raised the issue of future dangerousness; (2) the State argued future \r\r\n  dangerousness in its closing; and therefore, (3) the trial court erred in refusing \r\r\n  to charge the jury regarding Kelly's parole ineligibility. Kelly argues he was \r\r\n  denied due process because the jury instruction was mandated by Simmons. \r\r\n  \r\r\n  \r\r\nIn Simmons, a plurality of \r\r\n  the United States Supreme Court held that when a capital defendant would be \r\r\n  ineligible for parole if sentenced to life in prison and the State argues the \r\r\n  defendant's future dangerousness as a basis for imposing the death penalty, \r\r\n  the defendant is entitled to have the jury informed of his parole ineligibility \r\r\n  through either defense argument or instruction by the trial judge. Simmons, \r\r\n  supra. (7) The Simmons Court explained \r\r\n  that the \"Due Process Clause does not allow the execution of a person 'on the \r\r\n  basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain.'\" Id. at \r\r\n  161, 114 S.Ct. at 2192, 129 L.Ed.2d at 141 (quoting Gardner v. Florida, \r\r\n  430 U.S. 349, 362, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1207, 51 L.Ed.2d 393, 404 (1977)). Thus, the \r\r\n  Court ruled that the \"State may not create a false dilemma by advancing generalized \r\r\n  arguments regarding the defendant's future dangerousness while, at the same \r\r\n  time, preventing the jury from learning that the defendant never will be released \r\r\n  on parole.\" Id. at 171, 114 S.Ct. at 2198, 129 L.Ed.2d at 147.\r\r\n  \r\r\nTo be entitled to a Simmons charge, \r\r\n  two prongs must be met. First, the State must put the defendant's future dangerousness \r\r\n  in issue. Second, the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment \r\r\n  without possibility of parole. Id. at 178, 114 S.Ct. at 2201, 129 L.Ed.2d at \r\r\n  151 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see&nbsp;also State v. McWee, 322 S.C. \r\r\n  387, 391-92, 472 S.E.2d 235, 238 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1061, 117 S.Ct. \r\r\n  695, 136 L.Ed.2d 618 (1997) (due process requires parole ineligibility charge \r\r\n  \"only if appellant's future dangerousness was an issue and only if appellant \r\r\n  would have been ineligible for parole upon the imposition of a life sentence\"). \r\r\n  Kelly has not met either prong of the Simmons test.\r\r\n  \r\r\nFirst, we agree with the trial court \r\r\n  that the State's evidence at sentencing did not implicate future dangerousness. \r\r\n  Evidence that Kelly took part in escape attempts and carried a shank simply \r\r\n  is not the type of future dangerousness evidence contemplated by Simmons. \r\r\n  (8) The underlying principle of the Simmons holding is that \r\r\n  if evidence of future dangerousness is presented by the State, the defendant \r\r\n  must be allowed to rebut this evidence by showing that he will never \r\r\n  be eligible for parole, i.e., that he will never legally be let out of \r\r\n  prison. In the instant case, however, Kelly argues that the evidence he is an \r\r\n  escape threat (and thus a risk to the general public) required that the jury \r\r\n  be instructed on parole ineligibility. The flaw in Kelly's argument is that \r\r\n  a Simmons charge would not rebut this evidence. Telling a jury that a convicted \r\r\n  murderer will never be eligible for parole simply does not respond to the State's \r\r\n  evidence that he presents an escape risk.\r\r\n  \r\r\nIn our opinion, the evidence presented \r\r\n  by the State in the penalty phase was designed to show that Kelly would not \r\r\n  adapt to prison life because in jail he had been caught carrying a weapon and \r\r\n  planning or participating in escape attempts. Kelly was allowed to rebut this \r\r\n  evidence, through both cross-examination of the State's witnesses and the witnesses \r\r\n  presented in his defense. (9) Thus, Kelly was \r\r\n  given the opportunity to deny or explain the State's evidence, in accordance \r\r\n  with due process requirements.\r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly further contends that the State \r\r\n  argued future dangerousness to the jury and thus misled the jury in violation \r\r\n  of his due process rights. Specifically, Kelly argues that the State's argument \r\r\n  that Kelly is worse than a serial killer and that \"murderers will be murderers\" \r\r\n  constituted argument on future dangerousness. We disagree. A fair reading of \r\r\n  the State's closing argument shows that the State consciously avoided any implication \r\r\n  of future dangerousness. Not once did the State suggest to the jury that it \r\r\n  should impose the death penalty because Kelly would be a future danger to the \r\r\n  general public. Cf. Simmons, supra (where the Court found the following \r\r\n  arguments to be generalized argument of future dangerousness: \"what to do with \r\r\n  [petitioner] now that he is in our midst\" and that the death penalty would be \r\r\n  \"a response of society to someone who is a threat. Your verdict will be an act \r\r\n  of self-defense\"). Instead, the State argued Kelly should be given the death \r\r\n  penalty primarily as retribution for the heinous nature of the murder and because \r\r\n  of the status of Shealy, the pregnant victim.\r\r\n  \r\r\nWe hold that future dangerousness \r\r\n  was not an issue in this case. It was neither a logical inference from the evidence \r\r\n  nor was it injected into the case through the State's closing argument.\r\r\n  \r\r\nAdditionally, the second prong of \r\r\n  the Simmons test was not met. The Simmons rule is applicable when the \r\r\n  only alternative to a death sentence is life imprisonment without parole. See \r\r\n  Simmons, 512 U.S. at 178, 114 S.Ct. at 2201, 129 L.Ed.2d at 151 (O'Connor, \r\r\n  J., concurring); State v. McWee, 322 S.C. at 391-92, 472 S.E.2d at 238. \r\r\n  Because Kelly was tried under the new sentencing scheme which became effective \r\r\n  on January 1, 1996, he could have been sentenced to either (1) death; (2) life \r\r\n  without the possibility of parole; or (3) a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence. \r\r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 1999). The mandatory minimum sentence \r\r\n  of thirty years is available only if the jury returns with no finding of aggravating \r\r\n  circumstances. Id. \r\r\n  \r\r\nThis Court recently held that Simmons \r\r\n  is inapplicable under the new sentencing scheme because life without the possibility \r\r\n  of parole is not the only legally available sentence alternative to death. State \r\r\n  v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000); State v. Shafer, \r\r\n  340 S.C. 291, 531 S.E.2d 524 (2000), cert. granted, 2000 WL 1057649 (Sept. \r\r\n  26, 2000). The logic behind this holding is that a Simmons charge is \r\r\n  designed to answer the State's evidence that the defendant will be a future \r\r\n  danger to society by telling the jury that if sentenced to life in prison, the \r\r\n  defendant will never be paroled. In other words, a Simmons charge informs \r\r\n  the jury that by rejecting the death penalty, the defendant will spend the rest \r\r\n  of his natural life in prison. However, if another sentence other than life \r\r\n  without parole is available to the defendant as an alternative to the death \r\r\n  penalty, then a Simmons charge would actually mislead the jury by representing \r\r\n  that the defendant would never be released from prison, when in fact, a thirty-year \r\r\n  sentence is a potential sentence for the defendant. See Starnes, 340 \r\r\n  S.C. at 329, 531 S.E.2d at 916 (\"Contrary to a sentence of life imprisonment \r\r\n  without parole, a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence does not rebut the \r\r\n  State's argument regarding the defendant's threat to society.\"). Accordingly, \r\r\n  Simmons should not, and does not, apply when as a matter of law \r\r\n  another sentence other than death or life without parole is available to a capital \r\r\n  defendant. (10)\r\r\n  \r\r\nNonetheless, Kelly contends that \r\r\n  the thirty-year minimum sentence was not available to him because the jury would \r\r\n  have violated its oath if it had not found at least one aggravating circumstance. \r\r\n  Thus, Kelly argues that Simmons applies to the instant case. In Starnes, \r\r\n  however, we stated that it is \"inappropriate to assume the jury will find a \r\r\n  statutory aggravating circumstance.\" Id. at 330, 531 S.E.2d at 917. Although \r\r\n  we granted Kelly's motion to argue against the recent precedent set in Starnes \r\r\n  and Shafer, we adhere to that precedent and hold it is not appropriate \r\r\n  to presume that in certain cases a jury will always find particular statutory \r\r\n  aggravating circumstances. Cf. State v. Riddle, 301 S.C. 68, 71, 389 \r\r\n  S.E.2d 665, 667 (1990) (where this Court found error in submitting to resentencing \r\r\n  jury convictions from previous trial as evidence of aggravating circumstances; \r\r\n  the Court stated that the convictions from the guilt phase were not \"binding \r\r\n  upon the resentencing jury\" as it was the sentencing \"jury's responsibility \r\r\n  to find the existence, or not, of a statutory aggravating circumstance\") (emphasis \r\r\n  added). Therefore, Kelly cannot satisfy the second prong of the Simmons \r\r\n  test. \r\r\n  \r\r\nWe hold the trial court correctly \r\r\n  refused to give the jury a Simmons charge. (11)\r\r\n  \r\r\n3. REFUSAL \r\r\n  TO CHARGE THAT FUTURE DANGEROUSNESS WAS NOT AT ISSUE\r\r\n  \r\r\nAfter his request on the parole ineligibility \r\r\n  charge was denied, Kelly requested the following jury charge:\r\r\n  \r\r\n \r\r\n  I have instructed you on the \"aggravating\" \r\r\n    factors that you may consider as reasons to impose the death penalty. I tell \r\r\n    you now that you may not consider, as a reason to impose the death penalty, \r\r\n    any possibility that the defendant may be dangerous in the future unless he \r\r\n    is executed. In this case, there is no evidence that the defendant will be \r\r\n    dangerous if he does not receive the death penalty but is instead sentenced \r\r\n    to life imprisonment. The state does not contend that he will be dangerous \r\r\n    in the future. Therefore, any consideration about future dangerousness is \r\r\n    not a legal factor for you to consider as a reason to sentence the defendant \r\r\n    to death. This subject may not be considered by you at all in deciding whether \r\r\n    the death penalty should be imposed, and should not even be mentioned by you \r\r\n    during you deliberations as to the sentence to be imposed.\r\r\n    At the same time, you should \r\r\n    understand that your consideration of reasons not to impose the death penalty \r\r\n    is unlimited. Thus, if you find from the evidence that the defendant's future \r\r\n    behavior is likely to be good, that would be a proper factor for you to consider \r\r\n    as a reason to sentence him to life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.\r\r\n\r\r\n  \r\r\nBecause the State agreed not to argue \r\r\n  future dangerousness, Kelly maintains that the trial court erred in failing \r\r\n  to give the charge. We disagree.\r\r\n  \r\r\n\"The purpose of instructions is to \r\r\n  enlighten the jury and to aid it in arriving at a correct verdict.\" State \r\r\n  v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133, 137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1987). The law to be \r\r\n  charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at trial. E.g., \r\r\n  State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 380 S.E.2d 834 (1989). Furthermore, a trial \r\r\n  court should not give jury instructions which do not fit the facts of the case \r\r\n  as such charges may tend to confuse the jury. Id.; see&nbsp;also State v. \r\r\n  Leonard, supra (a trial court commits error when it provides instructions \r\r\n  which are calculated to confuse or mislead the jury).\r\r\n  \r\r\nWe hold that the trial court correctly \r\r\n  denied the requested charge because the evidence did not support the charge \r\r\n  as written. The State is permitted to argue that a capital defendant might pose \r\r\n  a future danger to those within prison. This type of evidence and argument is \r\r\n  distinguishable from what is considered \"future dangerousness\" under Simmons, \r\r\n  i.e., a future danger to society. Cf. State v. Rogers, 320 S.C. 520, \r\r\n  466 S.E.2d 360 (1996) (where the Court indicated that if prosecution had argued \r\r\n  only that defendant posed a danger to other prison inmates, and had not included \r\r\n  danger to society argument, then Simmons would not apply); Allridge \r\r\n  v. Scott, 41 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 \r\r\n  U.S. 1108, 115. S.Ct. 1959, 131 L.Ed.2d 851 (1995) (where the court noted that \r\r\n  Simmons is inapplicable where the State argues that the defendant poses \r\r\n  a danger to everybody, including fellow inmates) (citing Simmons, 512 \r\r\n  U.S. at 165 n.5, 114 S.Ct. at 2194 n.5). Therefore, the requested charge was \r\r\n  clearly incorrect because it instructed the jury \"there is no evidence that \r\r\n  the defendant will be dangerous if he does not receive the death penalty but \r\r\n  is instead sentenced to life imprisonment.\" This charge thus would have precluded \r\r\n  the jury from considering evidence of Kelly's future danger to others within \r\r\n  prison, evidence which was clearly presented by the State and appropriate for \r\r\n  the jury to consider. \r\r\n  \r\r\nMoreover, the charge as written is \r\r\n  extremely confusing. It simply would not have aided the jury in making its sentencing \r\r\n  determination. State v. Leonard, supra.\r\r\n  \r\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did \r\r\n  not err by denying this request to charge.\r\r\n  \r\r\n4. BOLSTERING \r\r\n  OF STATE'S WITNESS\r\r\n  \r\r\nKelly argues that the State improperly \r\r\n  bolstered Matthew McCormack's testimony thereby impermissibly vouching for McCormack's \r\r\n  credibility. We agree.\r\r\n  \r\r\nAs recounted above in Issue 2, McCormack \r\r\n  had been Kelly's cellmate. McCormack testified about Kelly making a shank and \r\r\n  how he said he was going to use it to abduct a female correctional officer. \r\r\n  In addition, McCormack testified that Kelly had frequently spoken about his \r\r\n  crimes. McCormack stated that Kelly told him that he and Shealy had planned \r\r\n  to rob the KFC but that Shealy had turned on him during the robbery. McCormack \r\r\n  testified that Kelly told him that he came up behind Shealy and cut her throat \r\r\n  and had tried to decapitate her.\r\r\n  \r\r\nToward the end of McCormack's direct \r\r\n  examination, the following colloquy took place:\r\r\n  \r\r\n \r\r\n  [Assistant Solicitor]: What did \r\r\n    I tell you that I absolutely required regarding your testimony to this jury \r\r\n    today?\r\r\n  [McCormack]: Uh - excuse me?\r\r\n  [Assistant Solicitor]: Did I tell \r\r\n    you to tell the truth to this jury -\r\r\n  [McCormack]: Of course.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt that point, Kelly objected on \r\r\n  the grounds that the assistant solicitor was bolstering the witness's testimony \r\r\n  and was making himself a witness. After the trial court overruled the objection, \r\r\n  the assistant solicitor continued:\r\r\n \r\r\n  [Assistant Solicitor]: What did \r\r\n    I tell you regarding your testimony to this jury today? The only thing the \r\r\n    State wanted from your testimony was what?\r\r\n  [McCormack]: The truth.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn cross-examination, Kelly questioned \r\r\n  McCormack about his prior criminal record which included grand larceny, burglary \r\r\n  and forgery convictions. Kelly also elicited testimony from McCormack, who was \r\r\n  a federal inmate, regarding how in the federal system an inmate could get a \r\r\n  sentence reduction if he provides helpful testimony to the government. McCormack \r\r\n  acknowledged that the potential for a sentence reduction was \"one of [his] main \r\r\n  reasons for\" testifying against Kelly.\r\r\nKelly argues that the State's questioning \r\r\n  impermissibly bolstered McCormack's credibility because it placed the prestige \r\r\n  of the government behind McCormack, a jailhouse informant. Kelly also maintains \r\r\n  that the assistant solicitor effectively became a witness in the case and vouched \r\r\n  for McCormack's credibility.\r\r\nIn United States v. Walker, \r\r\n  155 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 1998), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit discussed \r\r\n  generally the concept of vouching:\r\r\n \r\r\n  Vouching constitutes an assurance \r\r\n    by the prosecuting attorney of the credibility of a Government witness through \r\r\n    personal knowledge or by other information outside of the testimony before \r\r\n    the jury. . . . A prosecutor's vouching for the credibility of a government \r\r\n    witness raises two concerns: (1) such comments can convey the impression that \r\r\n    evidence not presented to the jury but known to the prosecutor, supports the \r\r\n    charges against the defendant and can thus jeopardize the defendant's right \r\r\n    to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury; and \r\r\n    (2) the prosecutor's opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government \r\r\n    and may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than its \r\r\n    own view of the evidence.\r\r\n\r\r\nId. at 184 (citations omitted).\r\r\nTypically, vouching occurs when the \r\r\n  prosecution comments on a witness's credibility in its opening statement or \r\r\n  closing argument. See id. at 185-87 (discussion of Third Circuit case \r\r\n  law on vouching). In the instant case, however, Kelly's argument is targeted \r\r\n  at the State's questioning of McCormack. At least one court has held that this \r\r\n  type of questioning is improper. See&nbsp;Mitchell v. State, 549 P.2d \r\r\n  96 (Okla. 1976) (where the prosecutor asked witness whether they had \"talked \r\r\n  about this case\" and witness responded \"Yes, sir. You instructed me to tell \r\r\n  the truth,\" the court found improper bolstering).\r\r\nIn our opinion, the State's questions \r\r\n  served to improperly bolster McCormack's credibility. Id. Although perhaps \r\r\n  not technically vouching, the manner of questioning (12) \r\r\n  by the State raises the second concern outlined by the Walker court: the jury \r\r\n  could have perceived that the assistant solicitor held the opinion that McCormack \r\r\n  was, in fact, telling the truth. Thus, McCormack's testimony carried with it \r\r\n  the imprimatur of the government, and this bolstering may have induced the jury \r\r\n  to trust the State's judgment about McCormack. Because a jury must make its \r\r\n  own assessment on the credibility of witnesses, it is inappropriate for the \r\r\n  State to assure the jury of a government witness's credibility. Accordingly, \r\r\n  the trial court erred in overruling Kelly's objection.\r\r\nNevertheless, we believe that this \r\r\n  error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Gaskins, 284 \r\r\n  S.C. 105, 127, 326 S.E.2d 132, 145 (erroneous admission of evidence in sentencing \r\r\n  phase reviewed for harmless error), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1120, 105 \r\r\n  S.Ct. 2368, 86 L.Ed.2d 266 (1985), overruled in part on other grounds State \r\r\n  v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). In our opinion, Kelly's \r\r\n  cross-examination effectively impeached McCormack's credibility by eliciting \r\r\n  information about his motive for testifying. Moreover, given the overwhelming \r\r\n  evidence of aggravation in this case, we do not believe that the State's bolstering \r\r\n  of McCormack materially influenced the jury's decision to impose the death penalty.\r\r\nAccordingly, because the error was \r\r\n  harmless, Kelly is not entitled to resentencing on this issue.\r\r\n \r\r\n  5. TESTIMONY \r\r\n    FROM VICTIM'S SISTER\r\r\n\r\r\nKelly argues that the trial court \r\r\n  erroneously admitted hearsay testimony from Shealy's sister Cynthia Slade. We \r\r\n  disagree.\r\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, the \r\r\n  State called Slade who presented victim impact testimony. The State questioned \r\r\n  Slade about Shealy's son Alex, who was six years old when Shealy was killed:\r\r\n \r\r\n  [Solicitor]: Have you seen Alex \r\r\n    since his mother was murdered?\r\r\n  [Slade]: Yes, sir.\r\r\n  [Solicitor]: Has there been a change \r\r\n    in him?\r\r\n  [Slade]: Oh, yeah.\r\r\n  [Solicitor]: Does he talk about \r\r\n    it?\r\r\n  [Slade]: Yeah. He talks about it \r\r\n    a lot [sic]. We were at a wedding and he told basically everybody-\r\r\n\r\r\nKelly's attorney objected on the \r\r\n  basis of hearsay. The trial court overruled the objection. When the State asked \r\r\n  what Alex had said, Slade responded:\r\r\n \r\r\n  He told everybody in the - at the \r\r\n    wedding that a bad man had killed his mommy.\r\r\n\r\r\nKelly argues Slade's testimony that \r\r\n  Alex said \"a bad man had killed his mommy\" was impermissible hearsay and should \r\r\n  have been excluded.\r\r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Evidence \r\r\n  define hearsay as \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying \r\r\n  at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter \r\r\n  asserted.\" Rule 801(c), SCRE. By that definition, we believe Slade's testimony \r\r\n  was not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter \r\r\n  asserted. That is, the evidence was not introduced to prove that a bad man killed \r\r\n  Shealy. Instead, the testimony clearly was offered to show the impact the murder \r\r\n  had on Shealy's young child and the rest of her family. As such, it was properly \r\r\n  offered as victim impact evidence. See, e.g., State v. Byram, 326 S.C. \r\r\n  107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (victim's sister's testimony about the effect of \r\r\n  the victim's death upon herself and the victim's three children was relevant \r\r\n  for the jury to meaningfully assess appellant's moral culpability and blameworthiness).\r\r\nAccordingly, the trial court correctly \r\r\n  allowed this evidence to be admitted.\r\r\nKelly's remaining issue \r\r\n  (13) is affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2) and the following authorities: \r\r\n  State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 519, cert. denied, 2000 WL \r\r\n  697435 (2000) (autopsy photograph may be relevant to showing physical torture); \r\r\n  State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998) (the determination \r\r\n  of the relevancy, materiality, and admissibility of a photograph is left to \r\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge); State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. \r\r\n  281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 940, 107 S.Ct. 1592, \r\r\n  94 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987) (photographs which depict the bodies of the murder victims \r\r\n  in substantially the same condition in which the defendant left them are admissible \r\r\n  in sentencing phase of capital trial).\r\r\n \r\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\r\n\r\r\n Kelly's \r\r\n  convictions and sentences are affirmed. We have conducted the proportionality \r\r\n  review required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (1985). The death sentence in \r\r\n  this case is proportionate to that in similar cases and is neither excessive \r\r\n  nor disproportionate to the crime. State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d \r\r\n  328 (1998); State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209, cert. denied, \r\r\n  525 U.S. 1022, 119 S.Ct. 552, 142 L.Ed.2d 459 (1998); State v. Powers, \r\r\n  331 S.C. 37, 501 S.E.2d 116, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1043, 119 S.Ct. 597, \r\r\n  142 L.Ed.2d 539 (1998).\r\r\n \r\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, \r\r\n    JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting and concurring in part in a separate \r\r\n    opinion.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n  \r\r\n  \r\r\n\r\r\nJustice Pleicones: \r\r\n  I concur in the majority opinion with the exception of that portion which affirms \r\r\n  the trial judge's refusal to give the requested parole ineligibility instruction. \r\r\n  I would, therefore, affirm the convictions of the appellant, and reverse and \r\r\n  remand for a new sentencing proceeding. It is my view that a per se \r\r\n  rule should be adopted, requiring that, when requested, a parole ineligibility \r\r\n  instruction be given to the jury deciding sentencing in a capital case. \r\r\nIn this case, appellant requested \r\r\n  the following charge at the end of the sentencing phase:\r\r\n \r\r\n   I charge you that the term \"life \r\r\n    imprisonment\" means imprisonment until the death of the offender. No person \r\r\n    sentenced to life imprisonment is eligible for parole, community supervision, \r\r\n    or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work \r\r\n    credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that \r\r\n    would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by law.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe majority affirms the trial judge's \r\r\n  denial of this legally correct charge which is taken virtually verbatim from \r\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1999). The majority relies upon our decisions \r\r\n  in State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000), and State \r\r\n  v. Shafer, 340 S.C. 291, 531 S.E.2d 524 (2000), (14) \r\r\n  which hold that most capital defendants in South Carolina are no longer entitled \r\r\n  to a parole ineligibility charge under Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 \r\r\n  U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed. 2d 133 (1994). Under State v. Starnes, \r\r\n  supra, and State v. Shafer, supra, Simmons did not apply because \r\r\n  appellant would not necessarily have received a sentence of life imprisonment \r\r\n  had the jury failed to find a statutory aggravating circumstance. \r\r\n  (15) Appellant, as the majority points out, could have received a \r\r\n  mandatory minimum sentence of at least thirty years without the possibility \r\r\n  of parole. \r\r\nFurther, the majority adheres to \r\r\n  this Court's recent ruling in State v. Starnes, supra, that it is inappropriate \r\r\n  to presume that juries will always find the existence of aggravating circumstance.\r\r\nI propose a rule that is not dependent \r\r\n  upon the shifting grounds of constitutional interpretation, is simple to apply, \r\r\n  and has the result of fully informing the jury of its options. We have taken \r\r\n  great pains to advise the jury that it is the final sentencing authority in \r\r\n  a capital case. (16) That being the case, the \r\r\n  jury should be equipped with the same knowledge in terms of sentencing as a \r\r\n  sentencing judge. In my opinion, we should take this opportunity to clarify \r\r\n  and simplify the rule for charging capital juries on the defendant's ineligibility \r\r\n  for parole or early release.\r\r\nUnder our current capital sentencing \r\r\n  scheme, if the defendant has been previously convicted of a \"serious\" or \"most \r\r\n  serious\" offense (17) he faces only two possible \r\r\n  sentences: death, or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. S.C. Code \r\r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 1999).\r\r\nIf the defendant has not been previously \r\r\n  convicted of a \"serious\" or \"most serious\" offense, the potential sentences \r\r\n  depend upon the jury's finding of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance. \r\r\n  If the jury finds a statutory aggravating circumstance, the only sentencing \r\r\n  choice to be made is whether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment \r\r\n  without possibility of parole. Should the jury fail to find the existence of \r\r\n  a statutory aggravating circumstance, the sentence rests in the discretion of \r\r\n  the trial judge. Her choices are life imprisonment, or a mandatory minimum term \r\r\n  of at least thirty years. The defendant is parole ineligible in either circumstance. \r\r\n  (18) \r\r\nIn my opinion, the unique circumstances \r\r\n  of a capital case require that the sentencing authority - whether judge or jury \r\r\n  - be fully informed with regard to sentencing options, including the convicted \r\r\n  offender's parole ineligibility.\r\r\nI would hold that where requested \r\r\n  by the defense, a properly phrased parole ineligibility charge must be given \r\r\n  to the jury in a capital case.\r\r\nThe jury would be instructed that \r\r\n  should they find the existence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of one of more aggravating \r\r\n  circumstances, there would be but two potential punishments: life imprisonment \r\r\n  or the death penalty. The jury would further be informed that life imprisonment \r\r\n  means until death, and that the defendant would be ineligible for parole or \r\r\n  other early release. This is the charge requested by appellant here.\r\r\nThe jury would also be informed that \r\r\n  should it fail to find the existence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of at least \r\r\n  one statutory aggravating circumstance, the punishment would be solely within \r\r\n  the province of the trial judge. The jury would be told that the sentencing \r\r\n  options would be limited to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, \r\r\n  or, assuming the defendant were a non-recidivist, a mandatory minimum of at \r\r\n  least thirty years, also without the possibility of parole.\r\r\nI agree with Justice Blackmun's plurality \r\r\n  opinion in Simmons v. South Carolina, supra, wherein he discussed the \r\r\n  perceptions of most jurors regarding parole:\r\r\n \r\r\n  It can hardly be questioned that \r\r\n    most juries lack accurate information about the precise meaning of 'life imprisonment' \r\r\n    as defined by the States. . . . An instruction directing juries that life \r\r\n    imprisonment should be understood in its 'plain and ordinary' meaning does \r\r\n    nothing to dispel the misunderstanding reasonable jurors may have about the \r\r\n    way in which any particular State defines 'life imprisonment'.\r\r\n\r\r\nId. at 169-70, 114 S.Ct. at \r\r\n  2197, 129 L.Ed. 2d at 146. The Simmons plurality noted that, at the time \r\r\n  it was decided, twenty-six states empowered juries in capital sentencing and \r\r\n  provided for life imprisonment without parole as an alternative punishment. \r\r\n  Of those states, seventeen required that the jury be expressly informed of the \r\r\n  defendant's parole ineligibility. See id. at n. 7. The Commonwealth of \r\r\n  Virginia recently joined that number with its Supreme Court's decision in Yarborough \r\r\n  v. Commonwealth, 519 S.E.2d 602 (Va. 1999). In my opinion, this State should \r\r\n  likewise adopt the practice.\r\r\nIn its search for an appropriate \r\r\n  sentence, the jury should have the benefit of clear and accurate instructions \r\r\n  regarding its options. A \"plain meaning\" instruction does not adequately inform \r\r\n  the jury. Without the knowledge that, if aggravators are found, a life sentence \r\r\n  is not subject to being reduced by parole, or any other method of early release, \r\r\n  the jury is likely to speculate unnecessarily on the possibility of early release, \r\r\n  and impose a sentence of death based upon \"fear rather than reason.\" Yarborough \r\r\n  v. Commonwealth, supra, citing Farris v. Commonwealth, 209 \r\r\n  Va. 305, 307, 163 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1968). A parole ineligibility charge would \r\r\n  eliminate any speculation. Since such a charge was not given in this case despite \r\r\n  appellant's request, I would reverse the sentence and remand for a new sentencing \r\r\n  proceeding.  \r\r\n1. Miranda \r\r\n  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  \r\r\n\r\r\n2. Murder is \"the \r\r\n  killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.\" \r\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (1985). Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing \r\r\n  of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation. \r\r\n  E.g., State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 508 S.E.2d 29 (1998); see&nbsp;also \r\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-50 (1985) (manslaughter is \"the unlawful killing of another \r\r\n  without malice\").  \r\r\n3. For example, \r\r\n  the State established that the type of latex gloves and duct tape used in the \r\r\n  attack were not used by the KFC and that they were used at the McDonald's where, \r\r\n  at the time of his crimes, Kelly was working as a cook.  \r\r\n4. Additionally, \r\r\n  we note that the manner in which the evidence was introduced minimized its prejudicial \r\r\n  effect. The State did not elicit testimony about Shealy's pregnancy from any \r\r\n  witness in the guilt phase. The only evidence admitted on the fact came in through \r\r\n  Kelly's statement. Likewise, in the State's guilt phase closing argument, Shealy's \r\r\n  pregnancy was mentioned only twice.  \r\r\n5. On cross-examination, \r\r\n  Kelly emphasized he was only one of three inmates housed in that cell and it \r\r\n  had not been proven he was the one who actually had dug out the mortar around \r\r\n  the cinder block.  \r\r\n6. The jury was \r\r\n  given a plain meaning charge.  \r\r\n7. Shortly after \r\r\n  Simmons was decided, this Court held that the trial judge must charge \r\r\n  a capital defendant's parole ineligibility when future dangerousness is at issue \r\r\n  and either the defendant requests such a charge or the jury inquires about the \r\r\n  meaning of \"life imprisonment.\" State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. 377, 387, \r\r\n  447 S.E.2d 862, 868 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1166, 115 S.Ct. 1136, \r\r\n  130 L.Ed.2d 1096 (1995), overruled on other grounds State v. Chapman, \r\r\n  317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995).  \r\r\n8. When the State \r\r\n  argues future dangerousness, it \"urge[s] the jury to sentence the defendant \r\r\n  to death so that he will not be a danger to the public if released from prison.\" \r\r\n  Simmons, 512 U.S. at 163, 114 S.Ct. at 2193, 129 L.Ed.2d at 142 (emphasis \r\r\n  added).  \r\r\n9. Kelly presented \r\r\n  expert testimony from a clinical psychologist, Dr. Steven Shea, and a correctional \r\r\n  management consultant, James Aiken. Dr. Shea testified that Kelly could adjust \r\r\n  to prison. Aiken testified that Kelly could be \"adequately managed, housed and \r\r\n  secured without endangerment in a correctional facility within the South Carolina \r\r\n  Department of Corrections.\"  \r\r\n10. We note that \r\r\n  the second prong of the Simmons test may be satisfied under certain circumstances. \r\r\n  For example, if the recidivist statute is applied, there will be no third alternative \r\r\n  sentence as a matter of law. See S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 1999) \r\r\n  (imposing mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole where defendant \r\r\n  has prior convictions of a most serious nature). If section 17-25-45 is invoked \r\r\n  and future dangerousness is argued, Simmons is applicable because the \r\r\n  only available sentences are life without parole or death. In the instant case, \r\r\n  however, Kelly had no previous convictions, and therefore, section 17-25-45 \r\r\n  does not affect our analysis of this issue.  \r\r\n11. Kelly also \r\r\n  contends that the requested instruction was required because of James Aiken's \r\r\n  testimony regarding good time credits. Aiken, Kelly's expert witness on prison \r\r\n  management, testified on direct examination that prisoners may be sanctioned \r\r\n  for disciplinary infractions by \"taking good time away.\" On cross-examination, \r\r\n  the State questioned Aiken further, and Aiken stated that he was speaking hypothetically, \r\r\n  not about this particular case. \r\r\nKelly argues that the testimony about \r\r\n  good time credits raised the inference that he would be released from prison, \r\r\n  and therefore, he should have been able to rebut the evidence with the parole \r\r\n  ineligibility charge. We believe Kelly's contention is without merit. Aiken's \r\r\n  testimony merely discussed, in general terms, internal prison procedures for \r\r\n  dealing with disciplinary violations committed by inmates. Kelly was not denied \r\r\n  the opportunity to rebut this evidence; therefore, his due process rights were \r\r\n  not compromised. Moreover, we note his own counsel elicited this testimony on \r\r\n  direct examination. State v. Washington, 315 S.C. 108, 110, 432 S.E.2d \r\r\n  448, 449 (1992) (appellant may not complain about the admission of evidence \r\r\n  elicited by his own counsel).  \r\r\n12. Although \r\r\n  the assistant solicitor did not comment that he had personal knowledge McCormack \r\r\n  was telling the truth or had outside evidence indicating the truthfulness of \r\r\n  McCormack's testimony, the assistant solicitor improperly phrased his questions \r\r\n  in the first person. (\"What did I tell you that I absolutely required \r\r\n  regarding your testimony to this jury today?\" and \"Did I tell you to \r\r\n  tell the truth to this jury?\") (emphasis added).  \r\r\n13. Kelly argues \r\r\n  that the trial court erred in admitting two of the State's photographic exhibits. \r\r\n  As to Exhibit 116, an autopsy photograph, we note Kelly maintains that the exhibit \r\r\n  \"shows the fetus in the decedent's stomach.\" On the contrary, it is clear from \r\r\n  both the photograph and the testimony at trial that this exhibit depicts Shealy's \r\r\n  gaping neck wound.  \r\r\n14.  Appellant \r\r\n  was granted permission to argue against these precedents. The United States \r\r\n  Supreme Court has granted certiorari in State v. Shafer, supra, \r\r\n  2000 WL 1057649 (Sept. 26, 2000).  \r\r\n15. Appellant \r\r\n  had no previous convictions of either \"serious\" or \"most serious\" offenses. \r\r\n  See S.C. Code Ann.

We reverse the dismissal of petitioner's post-conviction relief (PCR) application and\r\nvacate his convictions on these counts.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 1993, petitioner pled guilty to three counts of distribution of crack cocaine, three counts of distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a school, and\r\none count of trafficking in crack cocaine.  He was sentenced as a second offender to twenty years on each distribution count, ten years on each distribution\r\nwithin proximity of a school count, and twenty-five years on the trafficking count.  The trial court ordered all sentences to run concurrent.  Petitioner did not\r\ndirectly appeal.  \r\n\r\nThe instant matter concerns petitioner's second PCR application wherein one allegation was lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Initially, the application was\r\nsummarily dismissed as successive.  On petition for certiorari, petitioner argued that there was no subject matter jurisdiction because of erroneous code sections\r\nlisted in the indictments.  This Court stated that the PCR court should not have dismissed the application as successive because subject matter jurisdiction may\r\nbe raised at any time.  The Court found no prejudice, however, and denied certiorari.\r\n\r\nBecause of some procedural irregularities in the initial handling of petitioner's application, the PCR court ordered a hearing after this Court issued its denial of\r\ncertiorari.  At the hearing, petitioner again raised a subject matter jurisdiction argument regarding the erroneous code sections in the indictments.  The PCR\r\ncourt dismissed the application as successive, and specifically found that this Court had ruled on the subject matter jurisdiction argument that petitioner raised\r\nat the hearing.\r\n\r\nPetitioner then filed another petition for certiorari and raised a new subject matter jurisdiction argument.  For the first time, petitioner questioned whether the\r\ntrial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty pleas to the three counts of distribution within proximity of a school where the indictment\r\nalleged that petitioner distributed crack cocaine while within the grounds of \"Anne's Day Care Center.\"  The Court granted the petition on that question.\r\n\r\nThe indictments state that petitioner distributed a quantity of crack cocaine \"while within a radius of one-half mile of the grounds of Anne's Day Care Center,\r\nin violation of Â§ 44-53-445.\"\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court lack subject matter jurisdiction on the charges for distribution within proximity of a school?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty pleas to the three counts of distribution of crack cocaine within\r\nproximity of a school because the indictments stated that the distribution took place within proximity of \"Anne's Day Care Center.\"  Petitioner contends that\r\nbecause day care centers are not schools, the indictments fail to state the necessary elements of the offense.  We agree.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note that the State argues petitioner is precluded from raising a subject matter jurisdiction argument because the issue of subject matter jurisdiction\r\nhas been litigated once before and ruled upon by this Court.  We are unpersuaded by the State's procedural argument.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter of a proceeding is fundamental.  Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 115, 382 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1989). \r\n\"Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even by consent of the parties, and should be taken notice of by this Court.\"  Id.  It is well-settled that\r\nissues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including for the first time on appeal in this Court.  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495\r\nS.E.2d 773 (1998); State v. Funderburk, 259 S.C. 256, 191 S.E.2d 520 (1972).  Furthermore, \"[t]he acts of a court with respect to a matter as to which it has no\r\njurisdiction are void.\"  Funderburk, 259 S.C. at 261, 191 S.E.2d at 522.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that both this Court and the PCR court have addressed subject matter jurisdiction arguments related to the code sections in the indictments,\r\nneither this Court nor the PCR court has addressed the precise challenge now at issue.  Since subject matter jurisdiction is an issue which is fundamental and\r\nmay be raised at any time, we decline to find that our review of this issue is precluded on procedural grounds.  Carter v. State, supra;\r\n\r\nAnderson v. Anderson, supra. (1)\r\n\r\nTurning to the merits of petitioner's argument, we hold that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the three counts of distribution within\r\nproximity of a school.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear a guilty plea unless:  (1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2)\r\nthere has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included charge of the crime charged in the indictment.  Carter v. State, supra.  \"The true test\r\nof the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense\r\nintended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.\"  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358,\r\n359 (1995) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe statute criminalizing distribution of a controlled substance within proximity of a school provides in pertinent part:  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a separate criminal offense for a person to unlawfully distribute, sell, purchase, manufacture, or to unlawfully possess with intent to distribute, a controlled\r\nsubstance while in on or within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school; a public playground or\r\npark; a public vocational or trade school or technical educational center; or a public or private college or university.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (Supp. 1992). (2)  To prove distribution of crack cocaine under this section, the State must establish the following elements:  (1) the\r\ndefendant had actual control, or the right to exercise control over the crack cocaine; (2) he knowingly distributed or delivered the crack cocaine; (3) the\r\nsubstance upon analysis was, in fact, crack cocaine; and (4) the distribution occurred within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of an elementary, middle,\r\nsecondary or vocational school; public playground or park; or college or university.  See id.; State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 168, 467 S.E.2d 272, 278 (Ct. App.\r\n1996).\r\n\r\nThe State maintains that the indictments conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court because section 44-53-445 includes day care centers. \r\nSpecifically, the State contends that day care centers (1) are encompassed by the term \"elementary school,\" and (2) include playgrounds.  Basic rules of\r\nstatutory construction, however, refute the State's arguments.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, a penal statute must be construed strictly against the State and in favor of the defendant.  Williams v. State, 306 S.C. 89, 91, 410 S.E.2d 563,\r\n564 (1991).  \"'The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly . . . is founded . . . on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the\r\nlegislative, not in the judicial department.  It is the legislature, not the court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment. . . .'\"  Id. (quoting United\r\nStates v. Wiltberger, (18 U.S.) 5 Wheaton 76, 95-96, 5 L.Ed. 37, 42 (1820)).\r\n\r\nThe Court's primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature.  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662\r\n(1991).  When the terms of a statute are clear and unambiguous, the Court must apply them according to their literal meaning.  Id.  Furthermore, \"in construing\r\na statute, words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nLooking at the clear and unambiguous terms of section 44-53-445, day care centers are not covered by the statute.  The plain and ordinary meaning of\r\n\"elementary school\" simply does not encompass a day care center.  Cf. State v. Roland, 577 So. 2d 680 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991) (where the court held that a\r\nstatute prohibiting drugs within 1,000 feet of a \"public or private elementary, middle or secondary school\" did not apply to a kindergarten/preschool).  \r\n\r\nIn Roland, the Florida court found that the common meaning of the term \"elementary school\" is a school including the first through the sixth or the eighth\r\ngrades.  Id. at 681 (citing Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (1981)).  Thus, the court held that the statute did not apply to kindergartens or preschools.  We\r\nagree with the reasoning in Roland.  To hold otherwise and find that a day care center is encompassed by the term elementary school would amount to a \"forced\r\nconstruction\" which would improperly expand the statute's operation.  Blackmon, supra.\r\n\r\nMoreover, section 44-53-445 does not simply criminalize distribution within proximity of a \"school,\" but instead very specifically lists the types of schools\r\ncovered.  See Â§ 44-53-445 (criminalizing distribution of drugs within \"public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school; . . . a public vocational or\r\ntrade school or technical educational center; or a public or private college or university\").  Thus, the maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the\r\nexpression of one thing implies the exclusion of another) applies to exclude day care centers from falling within the statute since day care centers are not\r\nexpressly included.  Accord State v. Roland, supra.  Certainly, if the Legislature had intended day care centers to be covered, it could have amended the statute\r\nto include such facilities.  See Blackmon, supra (in interpreting a statute, the Court's primary function is to ascertain the intention of the legislature). (3)\r\n\r\nWe are similarly unpersuaded by the State's argument that day care centers include a playground or park.  Listing a day care center in an indictment does not\r\nput a defendant on notice of the element of proximity within a public playground or park.  See Â§ 44-53-445.\r\n\r\nIt is the Legislature, not this Court, which defines a crime under a penal statute, and thus, we are bound to construe section 44-53-445 strictly against the State\r\nand in favor of the defendant.  Williams v. State, supra.  We hold that section 44-53-445 does not apply to day care centers.  Hence, the indictments on their\r\nface failed to include a necessary element of the offense, and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept petitioner's pleas to these charges.  See\r\nBrowning, 320 S.C. at 368, 465 S.E.2d at 359 (an indictment is sufficient only when it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, petitioner's convictions and sentences on the three counts of distribution in violation of section 44-53-445 must be vacated. See Funderburk, 259\r\nS.C. at 261, 191 S.E.2d at 522 (\"The acts of a court with respect to a matter as to which it has no jurisdiction are void.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe reverse the PCR court's order of dismissal and vacate petitioner's convictions on the three counts of distribution within proximity of a school. (4)\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. The State couches its procedural argument in terms of res judicata.  However, in a PCR action, the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to issues of subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction.  Accord State v. Parham, 2000 WL 1176529, *2 (Ohio Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2000) (\"A petitioner for post-conviction relief is not precluded by\r\nres judicata where the claim is that the conviction is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\") (citing State v. Wilson, 652 N.E.2d 196, 200 n.6 (Ohio\r\n1995)).\r\n2. Initially, section 44-53-445 covered only \"elementary, middle, or secondary\" schools.  See 1984 S.C. Acts No. 504.  An amendment in 1990 expanded the\r\nstatute very specifically to cover drug violations within proximity of a \"public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school; a public playground or park;\r\na public vocational or trade school or technical educational center; or a public or private college or university.\"  See 1990 S.C. Acts No. 579 (emphasis on\r\nadded terms).  Subsequent amendments to the statute in 1994 and 1996 do not impact this case.\r\n3. See also footnote 2, supra, detailing the relevant legislative history of Â§ 44-53-445.\r\n4.

The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's finding that respondent (JUA)\r\nremained obligated under the agreement. (1)  We granted a writ of certiorari and now reverse.  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioners (the Pruitts) are the family members of Linda Faye Pruitt who died as the result of allegedly negligent medical care.  In December 1984, the Pruitts\r\nsettled their medical malpractice case against defendants who were insured by JUA.  The Pruitts agreed to release defendants and JUA in exchange for a lump\r\nsum payment of $293,000 plus monthly payments for thirty years or life, whichever was longer, in the following amounts:  Roy Pruitt, the deceased's husband,\r\n$510 per month; and Anthony and Pamela Pruitt, the deceased's children, $500 per month each.  The release includes a provision that JUA would purchase a\r\nsingle premium annuity policy from Executive Life Insurance Company (Executive) for the benefit of each of the Pruitts to guarantee these monthly payments.  \r\n\r\nIn 1991, Executive was placed in conservatorship and its assets ultimately transferred to Aurora Life Insurance Company (Aurora).  While in conservatorship,\r\nExecutive sent JUA an election package to choose whether to continue the same monthly payments originally promised by Executive or to opt-out of the policy. \r\nThe election package indicated that annuitants would receive 100% of the originally scheduled payments if electing to continue under a new contract with\r\nAurora.  The election decision would be irrevocable once received by Executive.  In order to opt out, both the owner of the policy (JUA) and the annuitants (the\r\nPruitts) had to consent.  No action was required to continue the policy.  \r\n\r\nJUA forwarded the election package to each of the Pruitts along with a letter advising:  \"You may remain in the plan under the current terms of the annuity\r\ncontract or you may choose the 'opt out' option and receive a lump sum distribution in cash.\"  In response, counsel for the Pruitts wrote JUA: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter you wrote [the Pruitts] seemed to imply that they were under some obligation to make an election regarding the Executive Life Plan.  My review of\r\nthe Executive Life/Aurora documents convinces me that the owner of these annuities . . [is the one] to make this election. . . . [The Pruitts] continue to look to\r\nyou for payment of the sums promised them.  \r\n\r\nI further note that the election documents sent to [the Pruitts] do require their consent.  Please be advised [the Pruitts] will not stand in the way of whatever\r\nelection [you] wish to make.  They will, however, not accept any modification of your obligation to them and their actions should not be taken by you as any\r\nagreement to any modification of the obligation of the JUA to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUA responded only that it had no obligation to make an election for the Pruitts but would endorse whatever option they chose.  \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, JUA received completed opt-out forms from the Pruitts which it forwarded to Executive on January 18 and 27, 1994.  Each opt-out form\r\nsigned by the Pruitts includes the underscored language:  \"I understand that once I elect to opt out and this form is received by [Executive], my decision is\r\nirrevocable.\"  On February 25, 1994, the Pruitts sought to revoke their election decision.  Although JUA attempted to intervene on their behalf, the Pruitts'\r\nrequest to change their election was denied under Executive's court-ordered election plan. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, the Pruitts commenced this action against JUA asserting that JUA had disclaimed any further liability under the settlement agreement and seeking a\r\ndeclaration that JUA remained obligated to them.  The Pruitts claimed that although the payouts they had received from the Executive opt-out amounted to\r\nmore than was presently due them under the settlement agreement, ultimately they would receive less than they would have had the monthly payments\r\ncontinued. (2)  \r\n\r\nJUA raised several defenses asserting the Pruitts had voluntarily agreed to the Executive opt-out.  The trial court rejected JUA's arguments and held it remained\r\nobligated under the settlement agreement. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed finding the Pruitts had waived any right to the monthly payments by\r\nelecting the Executive opt-out. \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any evidence to support the trial court's finding that JUA remained obligated under the settlement agreement?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pruitts claim the Court of Appeals misconstrued their cause of action as one for specific performance and erred in applying an equitable standard of review. \r\nThe Pruitts contend their action was actually one at law and therefore the scope of review on appeal was limited to determining whether there was any evidence\r\nto support the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\nWe agree the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of review in this case.  According to the Pruitts' complaint, they were asking for a determination of\r\nJUA's liability under the settlement agreement and not specific performance.  An action to construe a contract is an action at law reviewable under an \"any\r\nevidence\" standard.  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781  (1991).   \r\n\r\nFurther, we find there is evidence to support the  trial court's finding that JUA remained obligated to the Pruitts under the settlement agreement.  The settlement\r\nagreement recites as consideration for the Pruitts' release \"the payments specified herein below.\"  The agreement then itemizes the monthly amounts that \"shall\r\nhereafter be paid\" the Pruitts and states that these payments:\r\n\r\n\r\nare to be guaranteed by the Executive Life Insurance Company throught (sic) its issuance of appropriate companion instruments in the form of a single premium\r\nannuity policy, the original of such policy to be owned and retained by [JUA]. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nRead as a whole, the agreement provides that JUA is released from liability by payment of the specified monthly amounts and not upon simply purchasing the\r\nannuity policy.  The provision that these payments were to be \"guaranteed\" by Executive is not an essential term of the  agreement between the Pruitts and JUA\r\nbut is a collateral undertaking with Executive.  See In re: W.B. Easton Const. Co., 320 S.C. 90, 463 S.E.2d 317 (1995) (guaranty of payment is separate from\r\noriginal obligation to pay); Carroll County Sav. Bank v. Strother, 28 S.C. 504, 6 S.E. 313 (1888) (guaranty is collateral undertaking).  Since the settlement\r\nagreement obligates JUA to pay these monthly amounts, the question then becomes whether the Pruitts' acceptance of the Executive opt-out waived their right\r\nto these payments under the settlement agreement.  See Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 415 S.E.2d 384 (1992) (waiver\r\nis a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right); Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 443 S.E.2d 388 (1994) (waiver may be\r\nexpressed or implied from a party's conduct).  \r\n\r\nIn finding a waiver, the Court of Appeals focused on the Pruitts' execution of the opt-out forms and summarily concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though [the Pruitts'] counsel's letter to [JUA] purported to impose some continuing obligation on JUA, [the Pruitts'] actions in executing the opt-out\r\nforms clearly waived their right to monthly payments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' analysis discounts the impact of counsel's letter which stated that the Pruitts were not obligated to make an election, they would continue\r\nto look to JUA for the monthly payments, and they would accept no modification of JUA's obligation.  By this letter, the Pruitts expressly stated their intent not\r\nto waive any rights under the settlement agreement.  \r\n\r\nFurther, the Pruitts' subsequent conduct in executing the opt-out forms was not so inconsistent with this assertion of their rights under the settlement agreement\r\nthat waiver can be implied.  See Mende v. Conway Hosp., Inc., 304 S.C. 313, 404 S.E.2d 33 (1991) (waiver may result from action inconsistent with intent to\r\ninsist on right); Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 451 S.E.2d 924 (Ct. App. 1994).  Before the Pruitts executed the opt-out forms,\r\nJUA never responded to counsel's disclaimer of any waiver.  Further, JUA had previously treated the Pruitts as if it were obligated under the settlement\r\nagreement for the monthly payments irrespective of the status of the annuity policy when it supplemented Executive's reduced monthly annuity payments\r\nduring Executive's conservatorship. (3)  JUA's silence in the face of the Pruitts' disclaimer of any waiver and the parties' course of dealings support the\r\nconclusion the Pruitts had no reason to believe their execution of the opt-out forms would be a waiver of their rights under the settlement agreement.  Under\r\nthese circumstances, an intentional waiver cannot fairly be implied. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we find there is evidence to support the trial court's ruling the Pruitts did not waive their right to monthly payments under the settlement\r\nagreement and that JUA remained obligated to them for such payments.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the trial court's order\r\nis reinstated.

We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner (Mother) and respondent (Father) married in 1976.  They lived in Marion with their three minor children until they separated in June 1995.  By order\r\nfiled October 2, 1996, the family court granted a divorce on the ground of Mother's post-separation adultery, awarded Mother custody of the children, and\r\nordered Father to pay child support in the amount of $678.00 per month. (1)\r\n\r\nMother appealed the divorce decree but did not challenge the child support award.  She then filed this action in June 1997 seeking an increase in child support\r\nand various other relief.  By order filed December 10, 1997, the family court dismissed Mother's complaint and ordered her to pay Father's attorney's fees in\r\nthe amount of $4,000.00.  Mother appealed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR.  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Did the family court err in denying an increase in child support on the ground of Father's misrepresentation of income and subsequent increase in income?\r\n\r\n2.   Did the family court err in denying an increase in child support on the ground of increased childcare costs?\r\n\r\n3.   Did the family court err in awarding Father attorney's fees in the amount of $4,000.00?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Father's income\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the 1996 divorce hearing, Father submitted a financial declaration indicating his monthly income was $2,960.99, or $35,531.88 annually, which the family\r\ncourt relied on in computing child support. (2)  At the hearing in the present case, Mother introduced into evidence Father's 1995 W-2 form indicating his annual\r\nincome at the time of the divorce hearing was actually $38,553.55.\r\n\r\nFurther, although Father testified his current annual income was $3,224.00 monthly, which equals an annual income of $38,688.00, his 1996\r\nW-2 form indicates his annual income had actually risen to $42,267.43.  In addition, Father testified he received a 2.5% raise in October 1997.  His annual\r\nincome would then have been $43,112.78.  In other words, the evidence indicates that at the time of the hearing in this case, Father's annual income was\r\n$7,580.90 more than the amount originally used by the family court to calculate child support in 1996. (3) \r\n\r\nThe family court found the evidence insufficient to show Father attempted to mislead the court by his financial declaration since Mother had subpoenaed\r\nFather's earnings records at the time of the original hearing.  Further, it found Mother's income had also increased and the ratio between the parties' respective\r\nincomes (Father 60% and Mother 40%) had remained the same.  Accordingly, the court denied an increase on this ground.\r\n\r\nFirst, as the family court found, Mother subpoenaed Father's earnings records, including his tax returns, at the time of the original hearing.  Mother could have\r\ncontested the amount of Father's income in the original proceeding and she is not entitled to a retroactive increase to the time of the original divorce decree.  Cf.\r\nHarris v. Harris, 307 S.C. 351, 415 S.E.2d 391 (1992) (family court has jurisdiction to order retroactive increase in child support where party misrepresented\r\nincome).  On the issue of a prospective increase, however, whether Father misled the family court in the original proceeding is irrelevant.  Our inquiry is simply\r\nwhether Father's income has increased from the figure used in the original order to calculate child support.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the amount of Father's annual income used to calculate child support in 1996 ($35,531.88) and the amount of his annual income at the\r\ntime of the hearing in this case ($43,112.78) represents an increase of 21%.  Since Mother's income increased by only 8%, (4) the actual ratio of their 1997\r\nincomes is:  Father 63% and Mother 37%.  \r\n\r\nThe increase in the parties' combined income also impacts the calculation of child support under the Child Support Guidelines, 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 114-4720 (Supp. 1999). (5)  Under these guidelines, using the correct 1997 income figures for both parties, (6) and factoring in the allowable offsets for $65.00 in\r\nmonthly insurance premiums paid by Father and $130.00 monthly childcare paid by Mother, (7) Father's monthly child support obligation would be $817.00, or\r\n$139.00 more per month than the original amount ordered. (8)    \r\n\r\nApplication of the child support guidelines results in a significant increase in monthly child support based on the evidence of Father's increased income.  We\r\nfind the family court abused its discretion in denying Mother's request for an increase on this ground.  Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a recalculation\r\nof child support.  See Cudd v. Arline, 277 S.C. 236, 285 S.E.2d 881 (1981) (family court order denying increase will be reversed for abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\n2.  Childcare costs\r\n\r\n\r\nMother introduced evidence she was paying monthly childcare costs of $420.00 for the two younger children.  The family court noted Mother had incurred a\r\n\"substantial increase\" in childcare costs, which were originally calculated at $130.00 per month in the 1996 divorce decree, (9) but denied an increase in child\r\nsupport.  The only reason given for this denial is that \"Mother's own mother is not working, lives close by, and admittedly cares for the children at times.\"  \r\n\r\nMother testified her mother was receiving Social Security disability checks for crippling arthritis and could not handle the children.  Further, there is no\r\nobligation that a grandparent provide free childcare.  The family court's conclusion that these costs were avoidable is unsupported by the evidence.\r\n\r\nUnder the Child Support Guidelines, based on Father's increased income discussed in Issue 1 above, factoring in Mother's increased childcare in the amount of\r\n$420.00, and allowing an offset for Father's monthly insurance premium of $65.00, the child support owed by Father would be $953.00 monthly, a total\r\nincrease of $275.00 over the amount he is presently obligated to pay.  Mother's increased childcare costs substantially affect the calculation of Father's child\r\nsupport obligation under the guidelines.  Accordingly, we direct the family court to consider these increased costs in recalculating child support.\r\n\r\n3. Attorney's fees\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family court awarded Father $4,000.00 on his counterclaim for attorney's fees based on the observation that \"this action should not have been initiated.\"  \r\n\r\nFirst, we note the amount of attorney's fees awarded here represents approximately 16% of Mother's annual income at the time this case was heard.  A party's\r\nability to pay is an essential factor in determining whether an attorney's fee should be awarded, as are the parties' respective financial conditions and the effect\r\nof the award on each party's standard of living.  Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 427 S.E.2d 665 (1993).  This award is excessive in light of these factors.  \r\n\r\nFurther, since the beneficial result obtained by counsel is a factor in awarding attorney's fees, when that result is reversed on appeal, the attorney's fee award\r\nmust also be reconsidered.  Id.  In light of our remand on the issue of child support, we remand the issue of attorney's fees for reconsideration as well.\r\n\r\nMother's remaining arguments are without merit and we affirm the remainder of the family court's order under Rule 220(b), SCACR.  See Smith v. Smith, 272\r\nS.C. 294, 275 S.E.2d 797 (1980) and Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue must be raised to and ruled on by family court\r\nto be preserved for review); Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 384 S.E.2d 715 (1989) (generally, changes in circumstances within the contemplation of the parties\r\nat the time of the initial decree do not provide a basis for modifying a child support award); Shambley v. Shambley, 296 S.C. 405, 373 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App.\r\n1988) (family court order requiring maintenance of health insurance will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion). \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. (10)\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. This amount was ordered by supplemental order dated November 8, 1996, amending the original amount due to a scrivener's error.\r\n2. Mother's monthly income was $1,967.00.\r\n3. Our figures are slightly higher than those stated in Mother's brief because she relied on the amount of wages in box 1 of the federal W-2 forms.  Actually, the\r\ngreater amount of wages in box 5 (medicare wages) reflects the taxpayer's total gross income.\r\n4. Mother's annual income at the time of the original hearing was $23,607.  Her annual income at the time of the hearing in this case was $25,416.00. \r\n5. These guidelines govern child support awards as provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-852 (Supp. 1999):\r\n\r\n\r\n(A)  In any proceeding for the award of child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of\r\nthe guidelines required under Section 43-5-580(b) is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.  A different amount may be awarded upon a showing\r\nthat application of the guidelines in a particular case would be unjust or inappropriate.  When the court orders a child support award that varies significantly\r\nfrom the amount resulting from the application of the guidelines, the court shall make specific, written findings of those facts upon which it bases its conclusion\r\nsupporting that award.  Findings that rebut the guidelines must state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and include a\r\njustification of why the order varies from the guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 471 S.E.2d 154 (1996). \r\n6. Father's monthly income is $3,592.73; Mother's monthly income is $2,118.00.\r\n7. The 1996 divorce decree ordered Father to carry health insurance for the three children and found Mother's childcare expenses were $130.00 per month. \r\n8. We used the Child Support Obligation Calculator on the Department of Social Services website to obtain this figure.  The calculator is located at:\r\nhttp://www.state.sc.us/dss/csed/calculator.htm. \r\n9. Apparently, this amount was erroneously calculated since the evidence indicates Mother was actually paying $400.00 per month at the time.  Since we are\r\nconcerned here only with the family court's denial of a prospective increase, however, the question is simply whether Mother has shown an increase in the cost\r\nof childcare over that allowed in the divorce decree, regardless of whether she challenged the original calculation.\r\n10. We are aware that Mother has remarried and moved since the hearing in this case.  The family court retains jurisdiction to consider any new request for\r\nmodification by either party in light of these changed circumstances.  See Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 384 S.E.2d 715 (1989) (family court has the authority\r\nto modify the amount of child support upon a showing of substantial or material change of circumstances).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25230","title":"State v.

Salisbury, Jr. (\"Salisbury\") appeals the Court of Appeals' decision he was not entitled to a circumstantial evidence jury\r\ncharge at his trial for driving under the influence (\"DUI\"). We affirm.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Salisbury's trial for DUI, the State's case consisted of the following evidence.  In Dorchester County on December 23, 1995, three Highway Patrol troopers\r\nobserved Salisbury exceeding the speed limit in his pickup truck and crossing the center line of the road on three occasions.  When Salisbury was stopped,\r\nOfficer Link observed Salisbury had an odor of alcohol on his breath, he was unsteady on his feet, his eyes were bloodshot, and he had the general appearance\r\nof being under the influence.  Salisbury acknowledged he had been drinking.  Salisbury failed three field sobriety tests administered by Officer Link.  Salisbury\r\nwas unable to complete the alphabet, unable to complete the \"walk and turn\" test, and, according to one officer, when asked to do the \"one leg stand\" test, he\r\nresponded he was \"too drunk to do that shit.\"  Salisbury was arrested for DUI and transported to the patrol office where Trooper Robert Beres administered a\r\nbreathalyzer test that indicated he had a blood alcohol level of .21.  \r\n\r\nSalisbury presented a defense case that consisted of the following evidence.  Salisbury testified at trial that a back injury contributed to his behavior the night he\r\nwas arrested.   He claimed he was driving to buy pain pills for his back condition when he was stopped.  Salisbury admitted to drinking four beers between 8:00\r\nand 12:00 p.m.  He claimed he was crossing the center line of the road because he was unfamiliar with the truck he was driving and was having difficulty with\r\nthe defroster.  To explain his failure of the field sobriety tests, Salisbury claimed: (1) he was unable to recite the alphabet because he had not been in school\r\nsince the 1970s; (2) he was unable to walk heel-to-toe or walk in a straight line because of his back condition; and (3) he could not stand on one foot because,\r\nweighing three hundred pounds, he \"could not stand all that weight on one leg.\"  Salisbury also denied making the statement he was \"too drunk to do that shit\"\r\nafter he was asked to perform the \"one leg stand\" test.  According to Salisbury, he said \"I guess you think I can't do this shit because I'm drunk; but it's because\r\nof my back.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 1996, Salisbury was found guilty of DUI and was sentenced to one year and a $2,000 fine, suspended upon the service of sixty days or twenty days\r\nof public service and payment of $1,500 with two years probation.  The trial judge refused to give a charge on circumstantial evidence.  The Court of Appeals\r\naffirmed his conviction and sentence on February 17, 1998.  State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 498 S.E.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1998).  Salisbury appeals to this Court\r\non the following issue:\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judge's refusal to charge the jury on circumstantial evidence?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nSalisbury argues the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the trial court's refusal to give a charge on circumstantial evidence.  Salisbury contends the trial judge\r\nwas required to give the jury a circumstantial evidence charge where the State relied entirely, or at least substantially, on circumstantial evidence to prove\r\nSalisbury was driving while impaired.  Specifically, Salisbury argues he was entitled to the circumstantial evidence jury charge outlined in State v. Grippon,\r\n327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997).  We disagree.\r\n\r\nSalisbury was not entitled to a circumstantial evidence charge under the facts of this case.\r\nSalisbury was tried in May 1996, more than one year\r\nprior to this Court's opinion in Grippon. Accordingly, Grippon is inapplicable to this case,\r\nand whether Salisbury was entitled to a traditional\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge is dependent upon the law in effect at the time of his trial.  Prior to Grippon, if a request was made for a\r\ncircumstantial evidence instruction, it was within the trial judge's discretion to deny the request when the crime and the identity of the\r\nperpetrator were established by direct evidence and the circumstances introduced were merely corroborative. See State v. Carroll, 277 S.C.\r\n306, 286 S.E.2d 382 (1982); State v. Jenkins, 270 S.C. 365, 242 S.E.2d 420 (1978); State v. Simmons, 269 S.C. 649, 239 S.E.2d 656 (1977).\r\n\r\n  Prior to Grippon, a circumstantial evidence charge was required, even in the absence of a request, if the State relied solely on\r\ncircumstantial evidence to support a conviction.  State v. Langston, 265 S.C. 74, 216 S.E.2d 875 (1975); State v. Fuller, 227 S.C. 138, 87\r\nS.E.2d 287 (1955); State v. Baker, 208 S.C. 195, 37 S.E.2d 525 (1946).  In the absence of such a request, where there was any direct\r\nevidence supporting the conviction, the failure to give a circumstantial evidence charge was not error.  State v. Moorer,\r\n241 S.C. 487, 129\r\nS.E.2d 330 (1963); State v. White, 211 S.C. 276, 44 S.E.2d (1947).  However, if requested, as in the present case, such a charge was not required\r\nwhere the State relied upon direct evidence to prove the acts of the crime and the identity of the perpetrator, and circumstantial evidence\r\nwas merely corroborative or offered to demonstrate intent.  State v. Carroll, supra; State v. Jenkins, supra; State v. Simmons, supra.      \r\n\r\nIn the instant case, there was sufficient direct evidence (1) establishing the elements of DUI and the identity of the perpetrator, such that the circumstantial\r\nevidence was merely corroborative.   In South Carolina, the corpus delicti of DUI must be established by proof that a person's ability to drive has been\r\nmaterially and appreciably impaired by the use of alcohol and/or drugs. (2)  Przybyla v. South Carolina Dep't. of Highways and Pub. Transp., 313 S.C. 116, 437\r\nS.E.2d 70 (1993) (citing City of Orangeburg v. Carter, 303 S.C. 290, 400 S.E.2d 140 (1991)); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930 (Supp. 1999).  In other\r\nwords, the State has to prove: (1) Salisbury's ability to drive was materially and appreciably impaired; and (2) this impairment was caused by the use of drugs\r\nor alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe evidence produced at trial included the testimony of two police officers, Officer Link and Officer Woods, that Salisbury was speeding\r\nand weaving over the center line.  Officer Link testified Salisbury smelled of alcohol, was unsteady on his feet, had bloodshot eyes, could\r\nnot recite the alphabet, and could not do the one-leg stand test.  In Link's opinion, Salisbury was grossly intoxicated and his faculties were\r\n\"very much so impaired\" that Salisbury could not operate a motor vehicle safely.  Similarly, Officer Woods testified as to Salisbury's\r\nunsteadiness on his feet, the fact he was leaning on his truck, could not say his ABC's, or do the one-leg stand test.  There was \"no doubt\r\nin [Officer Woods'] mind Salisbury was intoxicated\" and was \"in no condition to operate a motor vehicle safely.\"  The breathalyzer\r\noperator, Officer Beres, testified Salisbury was unsteady on his feet, had slurred speech, and bloodshot eyes; in Beres' opinion, Salisbury\r\nwas intoxicated and unable to operate a motor vehicle safely.  In addition to the three police officers' testimony, Salisbury admitted he had\r\nbeen drinking, had gotten \"tripped up\" saying the ABC's, could not perform the one-leg stand test, and could not walk a yellow line.\r\n\r\nThe officers' personal observations and opinions of Salisbury's actions, appearance, and condition constitute direct evidence because it is\r\nbased on the officers' actual knowledge of the situation and requires no inference by the jury.\r\nSee generally New York v. Walters, 623 N.Y.S.2d 396\r\n(1995); Nichols, supra;  South Dakota v. Edmundson, 379 N.W.2d 835 (S.D. 1985); Nebraska v. Lewis, 128 N.W.2d 610 (Neb. 1964);\r\nConnor v. Duffy, 652 A.2d 372 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1994); Murray  v. Texas, 689 S.W.2d 247 (Tex. Ct. App. 1985); Minnesota v. Stokes, 354\r\nN.W.2d 53, 56 (Minn. Ct. App.1984); California v. Garcia, 197 Cal. Rptr. 277 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983); Tennessee v. Wiggs, 1995 WL 324602\r\n(Tenn. 1995). Accordingly, we find the direct evidence in this case is sufficient to establish the elements of the crime and the identity of the\r\nperpetrator such that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a circumstantial evidence charge. State v. Carrol, supra.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Court of Appeals' decision is AFFIRMED as modified.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Evidence can be divided into two basic categories: direct and circumstantial.  Direct evidence is evidence based on actual knowledge and proves a fact\r\nwithout inference or presumption.  See Black's Law Dictionary 577 (7th ed. 1999).  Direct evidence immediately establishes the main fact to be proved. \r\nNichols v. Indiana, 591 N.E.2d 134 (Ind. 1992) (citing Herrick, Underhill's Criminal Evidence Â§ 15 (Supp. 1970)).  Circumstantial evidence immediately\r\nestablishes collateral facts from which the main fact may be inferred, and is typically characterized by inference or presumption.

Financing for the District's operation was effected by\r\nvesting in the School Board the power to impose an annual tax levy.  Act No. 340, 1967 S.C. Acts 470 (the \"Act\").  In 1972, three\r\nyears after the 1969 Act, the General Assembly amended section 10 of the Act.  The present Act now provides in section 11:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trustees of the Charleston School District shall prepare and submit to the Charleston County Legislative\r\nDelegation, as information, on or before the fifteenth day of August of each year beginning in 1968, a proposed budget for the\r\nensuing school year.  In order to obtain funds for school purposes the board is authorized to impose an annual tax levy,\r\ncommencing in 1968, not to exceed Ninety mills, exclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service.\r\nIn the event the Board\r\ndetermines that the annual tax levy should exceed Ninety mills, the Board shall hold a public hearing on the question at least two\r\nweeks prior to submitting such request to the legislative delegation.  Notice of such public hearing shall be advertised in a\r\nnewspaper of general circulation in the county, and shall state the date, time and place of the hearing as well as a clearly worded\r\nstatement of the requested annual tax levy.  Upon certification by the Board to the county auditor of the tax levy to be imposed\r\nthe auditor shall levy and the county treasurer shall collect the millage so certified upon all taxable property in the district.\r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. 1602, Â§ 11, 1972 S.C. Acts 3131, 3134 (emphasis added) (\"section 11\").\r\n\r\nThe School Board adopted a budget for its fiscal year 2001 and determined the annual tax levy must exceed ninety mills,\r\nexclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service, in order to fund the budget.  On March 20, 2000, after complying with\r\nthe notice requirements in section 11, the School Board held a public hearing.  On May 1, 2000, the School Board certified to the\r\nCounty Auditor that the tax levy for general operations of the School District for its fiscal year 2001 should be set at a level\r\nsufficient to generate $86,571,171.  The School Board estimated this would require a tax levy for school district operations of\r\napproximately ninety-nine and four tenths (99.4) mills.  The School Board also submitted the proposed budget for 2001 and a\r\ncopy of its request to impose a tax levy in excess of ninety mills to the Charleston County Legislative Delegation (\"Charleston\r\nDelegation\"), as required by section 11.\r\n\r\nThe County Auditor claims she will levy sufficient taxes to fund in full the local share of the School District's budget for the\r\nfiscal year 2001.  However, she refuses to levy more than ninety mills without a directive by this Court.  The County Auditor\r\nasks the Court to: (1) dismiss all claims and actions against her in this matter; (2) declare section 11 requires approval by the\r\nCharleston Delegation as a condition precedent to the School Board imposing an annual tax levy in excess of 90 mills; and (3)\r\ndeclare the School Board cannot independently raise school tax millage over 90 mills.\r\n\r\nThe School District and the Petitioners request that the Court direct the County Auditor to levy the amount certified by the\r\nSchool Board in its May 1, 2000 letter, 99.4 mills.  The following issues are before this Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Do the Petitioners have standing?\r\n    \r\n  Does section 11 require approval by the Charleston Delegation as a condition precedent to the School Board imposing an\r\nannual tax levy in excess of ninety mills, exclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service?\r\n    \r\n  If section 11 requires approval by the Charleston Delegation as a condition precedent to the School Board imposing an annual\r\ntax levy in excess of ninety mills, exclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service, is this condition precedent\r\nunconstitutional or otherwise legally invalid?\r\n    \r\n  If section 11 does not require approval by the Charleston Delegation as a condition precedent to the School Board imposing\r\nan annual tax levy in excess of ninety mills, does it require the County Auditor to levy the millage set by the School Board,\r\neven if such millage exceeds ninety mills, exclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service, so long as the School\r\nDistrict complies with the requirements?\r\n    \r\n  If section 11 does not require the County Auditor to levy the millage set by the School Board if such millage exceeds ninety\r\nmills, exclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service, does the Education Improvement Act of 1977, the Education\r\nFinance Act of 1977, or other State spending mandates require the County Auditor to levy sufficient millage so the School\r\nDistrict is in compliance with the spending requirements of those acts, even if the millage levied exceeds ninety mills,\r\nexclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service?  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Standing and Joinder\r\n\r\nAll parties concede Petitioners have standing because the issue is one of public importance that requires resolution for future\r\nguidance. Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999);\r\nsee Thompson v. South Carolina Comm'n on Alcohol\r\n&amp; Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463, 229 S.E.2d 718 (1976) (holding the plaintiffs had standing because the questions involved were of\r\nsuch wide concern, both to law enforcement personnel and to the public); Berry v. Zahler, 220 S.C. 86, 66 S.E.2d 459 (1951)\r\n(holding the question of public interest originally encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance).\r\n\r\nThe County Auditor argues the case should be dismissed because Petitioners failed to join the Charleston Delegation as an\r\nindispensable party pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe County Auditor asserts the Charleston Delegation is the \"most vitally interested party\" in this litigation and should be\r\njoined in the case.  She claims this Court must dismiss the Complaint for failure to join the Charleston Delegation as an\r\nindispensable party.  First, the remedy under Rule 19, SCRCP is for the Court to make the Charleston Delegation a party, not\r\nto dismiss the action.  According to Rule 19, SCRCP: \"If [an indispensable party] has not been so joined, the court shall order\r\nthat he be made a party.  If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case,\r\nan involuntary plaintiff.\"  (emphasis added).  Second, the Charleston Delegation is not an indispensable party under Rule 19,\r\nSCRCP because complete relief can be accorded to the Petitioners and the School District without the joinder of the Charleston\r\nDelegation, and the Charleston Delegation has not claimed an interest in the subject of the action.\r\n\r\nII.  The Charleston Delegation's Approval of the Millage Rate\r\n\r\nPetitioners argue section 11 authorizes the School Board to impose an annual tax levy in excess of ninety mills provided the\r\nSchool Board: (1) advertises notice of the public hearing; (2) states the date, place, and time of the hearing; (3) states the\r\nrequested annual tax levy; and (4) holds a public hearing at least two weeks before sending the request to the Charleston\r\nDelegation.  Petitioners argue the language of section 11 does not require the Charleston Delegation's approval before the\r\nCounty Auditor sets the millage rate.  We agree.   \r\n\r\nThe primary concern in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.  Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492\r\nS.E.2d 777 (1997).  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the rule that legislative intent must prevail if it can\r\nreasonably be discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the\r\nstatute. Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994).  As in this case, where a\r\nstatute is complete, plain, and unambiguous, legislative intent must be determined from the language of the statute itself.\r\nWhitner, 328 S.C. at 6, 492 S.E.2d at 779.\r\n\r\nThe heart of this dispute concerns the language used in section 11.  The current Act authorizes the School Board to impose an\r\nannual tax levy not to exceed ninety mills, exclusive of any millage imposed for bond debt service.  Section 11 adds the following\r\ntwo sentences to the Act:  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event the Board determines that the annual tax levy should exceed Ninety mills, the Board shall hold a public hearing on\r\nthe question at least two weeks prior to submitting such request to the legislative delegation. Notice of such public hearing shall\r\nbe advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, and shall state the date, time and place of the hearing as well\r\nas a clearly worded statement of the requested annual tax levy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing in the plain language of section 11 requires approval from the Charleston Delegation before the County Auditor sets\r\nthe millage rate.  Section 11 indicates the contingency occurs only \"[i]n the event the Board determines the annual tax levy\r\nshould exceed Ninety mills . . . .\"  1972 S.C. Acts at 3134 (emphasis added).  In other words, the School Board determines\r\nwhether an annual tax levy should exceed ninety mills, not the Charleston Delegation.  Furthermore, no provision of section 11\r\nauthorizes the Charleston Delegation to vote on, authorize, or reject the School District's budget.  Section 11 is silent concerning\r\nany intervening action by the Charleston Delegation or any need for the School Board to await the Charleston Delegation's\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nWhen the General Assembly has intended to give a legislative delegation budgetary oversight of another entity, it has done so\r\nin explicit terms.  In Thomas v. Cooper River Park, 322 S.C. 32, 471 S.E.2d 170 (1996), the respondents challenged the\r\nconstitutionality of legislation requiring the St. Andrew's Public Service District to submit its budget to the county's legislative\r\ndelegation for approval.  The Court held the following provision, which required the delegation's involvement in the budgeting\r\nand taxing functions of the St. Andrew's Public Service District, violated the separation of powers doctrine:\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he County Auditor of Charleston County  shall annually levy, and the County Treasurer of Charleston County shall collect, a\r\ntax of such number of mills on the dollar on all taxable property in the territorial limits of [District] as shall be fixed,\r\ndetermined and directed by a written resolution of the St. Andrew's Public Service District Commission duly transmitted to the\r\nsaid County Auditor . . . ; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no tax shall be levied by the County Auditor hereunder unless and until\r\nthe resolution fixing, determining and directing the same shall have been approved in writing by the Senator and a majority of\r\nthe Members of the House of Representatives for Charleston County and for the purpose of consideration of the same the said\r\ncommission shall present all such resolutions to the said Senator and Members of the House of Representatives together with the\r\nitemized budget of the district upon which the same is based.\r\n\r\n\r\nId.    at 33-34, 471 S.E.2d at 171 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  This Court held the provisions requiring approval by the\r\nlegislative delegation for the St. Andrew's Public Service District was unconstitutional, but severable.  Id.    \r\n\r\nThe Act in Thomas manifests a clear intent on the part of the legislature to subject St. Andrews to budgetary oversight.  This\r\nintent is revealed by the explicit wording of the Act: \"[N]o tax shall be levied by the County Auditor hereunder unless and until\r\nthe resolution fixing, determining and directing the same shall have been approved in writing by [the Charleston County\r\nLegislative Delegation].\" Id.  Section 11 does not contain a comparable clause requiring  written approval.  All section 11\r\nrequires is for the School Board to submit a request to the legislative delegation, it does not require any form of acceptance or\r\nrejection by the Charleston Delegation.\r\nOther Acts giving legislative delegations budgetary oversight include specific provisions requiring such approval and explaining\r\nhow such approval should be obtained.  For example, in 1969, the General Assembly amended Act No. 685, to include a\r\nlimitation upon the power of the Board of Trustees to fix the amount of the annual tax levy for school taxes to operate the\r\nschools in Cherokee County.  The amendment states, \"[N]o such tax levy shall be increased in any year without the approval of\r\na majority of the resident members of the Cherokee County Legislative Delegation.\"\r\nGunter v. Blanton, 259 S.C. 436, 440, 192\r\nS.E.2d 473, 474 (1972) (emphasis added).  The Court held the language was unconstitutional because it assigned to the\r\nCherokee County Legislative Delegation a dual role in violation of the separation of powers clause in the South Carolina\r\nConstitution, S.C. Const. art I, Â§ 8.\r\n\r\nSimilar language was held unconstitutional as a violation of separation of  powers in Aiken County Board of Education v.\r\nKnotts, 274 S.C. 144, 262 S.E.2d 14 (1980).  The right of the Aiken County Board of Education to authorize the assessment of\r\nmillage to meet its budget was limited by the following provision:\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided, however, that if a majority of the members of the board conclude that the tax millage for operating school purposes in\r\nthe district should be increased, they shall, on or before the first day of July, submit a request for such increase to the members\r\nof the Aiken County Legislative Delegation and if a majority of the members approve such increase the auditor shall levy and the\r\ntreasurer shall collect the additional millage to provide for such an increase.  If a majority of the members of the legislative\r\ndelegation refuse to approve the proposed increase, the chairman of the board of education, with the approval of a majority of\r\nthe members of the board, may call for a referendum in the next general election.\r\n\r\n\r\nId.   at 147, 262 S.E.2d at 17 (emphasis added).  As in Gunter, the Court held the statute was unconstitutional because it violated\r\nthe separation of powers doctrine.  The clear language in Gunter demonstrates that if the General Assembly intends for a\r\nlegislative delegation to have budgetary oversight, they will explicitly require the approval of the legislative delegation and will\r\nexplain exactly how such approval is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe County Auditor also argues the use of the word \"request\" implies the Charleston Delegation has the power to approve or\r\ndisapprove the millage rate.  Section 11 states: \"[T]he Board shall hold a public hearing on the question at least two weeks prior\r\nto submitting such request to the legislative delegation.\" (emphasis added).  However, the first sentence of section 11  states:\r\n\"The Board of Trustees of the Charleston County School District should prepare and submit to the Charleston County\r\nLegislative Delegation, as information, on or before the fifteenth day of August of each year beginning in 1968, a proposed\r\nbudget for the ensuing school year.\" (emphasis added).  When section 11 is read in the context of the entire Act, the language\r\nindicates the School Board must submit its proposed budget to the Charleston Delegation simply for informational purposes.\r\nThe plain language of section 11 indicates the General Assembly did not intend for the Charleston Delegation to have approval\r\npower over the millage rate as determined by the School Board.  The General Assembly intended for the Charleston Delegation\r\nto serve only as advisors in this matter.\r\n\r\nBecause we find the General Assembly did not intend for the Charleston Delegation to have oversight powers, we do not address\r\nthe constitutionality of section 11. \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp;\r\nCounty Auditor's Duty to Levy the Millage Requested by the Board\r\nAccording to Petitioners, section 11 requires the County Auditor to levy the millage set by the School Board, even if such\r\nmillage exceeds ninety mills.  Petitioners argue the language in section 11 is direct and mandatory, and the County Auditor\r\ncannot refuse to carry out the directive by the School Board.  We agree.  \r\n\r\nThe words used in a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction\r\nwhich limits or expands the statute's operation.  State v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (1999).  Ordinarily, the use of\r\nthe word \"shall\" in a statutory provision indicates the provision is mandatory. See TNS Mills Inc. v. South Carolina Dep't of\r\nRevenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998); South Carolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Dickinson, 288 S.C. 189, 341\r\nS.E.2d 134 (1986).  The final sentence in the relevant portion of section 11 contains an absolute directive that requires the\r\nCounty Auditor to levy the amount determined by the School Board: \"Upon certification by the Board to the county auditor of\r\nthe tax levy to be imposed the auditor shall levy and the county treasurer\r\nshall collect the millage so certified upon all taxable\r\nproperty in the district.\"  Act No. 1602, 1972 S.C. Acts 3131, 3134 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nBecause we find the plain language of section 11 is direct and mandatory and indicates the General Assembly intended for the\r\nCounty Auditor to levy the taxes once the School Board duly complies with the Act, we do not address the School Board's\r\nauthority to exceed 90 mills in order to comply with the Education Improvement Act of 1984, the Education Finance Act of\r\n1977, or other State spending mandates. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe direct the County Auditor to levy the millage sufficient to generate  $86,571,171, even if such millage exceeds 90 mills,\r\nbecause: (1) the plain language of section 11 is direct and mandatory and requires the County Auditor to levy the taxes once the\r\nSchool Board has duly complied with the other portions of the Act; and (2) nothing in the plain language of section 11 requires\r\nthe Charleston Delegation's approval before the millage rate can be increased.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. A mill is a unit of property taxation.  It is one tenth of one percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25232","title":"In the Matter of Eugene Charles Fulton, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25232","description":"Attorney Disciplinary matter involving non payment of physician's court appearance fee and failure to respond to Disciplinary Counsel inquiry.","date":"2001-01-16","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n        In the Matter of Eugene Charles \r\n        Fulton, Jr., Respondent. &nbsp;  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25232\r\n  Submitted December 7, 2000 - Filed January 16, 2001\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., Deputy Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  Susan M. Johnston, and Debbie S. McKeown, all of Columbia, for the Office of \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nEugene C. Fulton, Jr., of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In \r\nthis attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered \r\ninto an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, \r\nSCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public \r\nreprimand. We accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent. The facts \r\nas admitted in the agreement are as follows. \r\nFacts\r\n\r\nIn 1996, respondent was retained to represent a \r\n  client in a personal injury matter. A lawsuit was filed and the case went to \r\n  trial in August 1998. The client's treating physician testified at respondent's \r\n  request. The case was subsequently settled. On September 2, 1998, physician \r\n  sent respondent an invoice for $750 for the court appearance. On September 14, \r\n  1998, respondent disbursed the settlement proceeds to the client but failed \r\n  to pay physician's court appearance fee. Although physician contacted respondent \r\n  on numerous occasions to secure payment, the court appearance fee was never \r\n  paid. \r\n\r\nIn April 2000, physician's medical records supervisor \r\n  filed a Complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. On April 25, 2000, \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel notified respondent about the Complaint and requested a \r\n  response. He did not reply. Disciplinary Counsel wrote respondent again on June \r\n  13, 2000, requesting a response to the Complaint. When respondent failed to \r\n  respond, Disciplinary Counsel served him with a Notice of Full Investigation \r\n  on August 1, 2000. Respondent failed to submit a response to the Notice of Full \r\n  Investigation and was ultimately served with a subpoena pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), \r\n  RLDE, requiring him to appear on October 26, 2000, to respond to questions under \r\n  oath concerning the Complaint. Respondent appeared but failed to provide the \r\n  client file and trust account records to Disciplinary Counsel as required by \r\n  the subpoena. Respondent finally submitted the documents after a second request.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (reasonable \r\n  diligence and promptness in representing clients); Rule 1.15 (upon receiving \r\n  funds in which a third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify \r\n  the third person); Rule 4.4 (respect for the rights of third persons); Rule \r\n  8.1 (knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary \r\n  authority); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule \r\n  7(a)(1) (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 7(a)(3) (willfully failing to comply with a subpoena issued under these \r\n  rules, or knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary \r\n  authority to include a request for a response under Rule 19); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bringing the \r\n  legal profession into disrepute, and engaging in conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon \r\n  admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nSince respondent cannot provide a reasonable explanation \r\n  for his failure to satisfy physician's court appearance fee, his failure to \r\n  respond to Disciplinary Counsel's inquiries or his failure to timely provide \r\n  the subpoenaed documents to Disciplinary Counsel and since he has been previously \r\n  sanctioned for misconduct, (1) we accept the \r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to \r\na public reprimand. We accept the Agreement and impose a public reprimand. The \r\nfacts as admitted in the Agreement are as follows. \r\nFacts\r\n\r\nRespondent attached a voice activated tape recorder \r\n  to the telephone at his residence. Over a period of several weeks, respondent \r\n  recorded all telephone calls to and from his house without knowledge and consent \r\n  of the parties. This resulted in the recording of several conversations in which \r\n  respondent was not a party.\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to reveal the existence of these \r\n  audio tapes during the discovery portion of domestic litigation between respondent \r\n  and his estranged wife. Respondent submitted a \"self-report\" to Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel in which he failed to disclose that he recorded conversations with anyone \r\n  other than his wife.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1)(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the \r\n  courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6)(violating the oath of office taken upon admission \r\n  to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.4 (unlawfully \r\n  obstructing another party's access to evidence); Rule 8.1 (knowingly making \r\n  a false statement of material fact, failing to disclose a fact needed to correct \r\n  a misapprehension, or failing to respond to a lawful demand for information \r\n  regarding a disciplinary matter); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on \r\n  the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging \r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that his actions \r\n  were in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents \r\n  to a definite suspension from the practice of law for sixty (60) days. We accept \r\n  the agreement. The facts as admitted in the agreement are as follows. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nRespondent represented a client who was involved \r\n  in foreclosure proceedings against real estate owned by third parties. The third \r\n  parties filed for bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nRespondent made numerous misrepresentations to \r\n  his client, and to his client's son and daughter, regarding the status of the \r\n  bankruptcy proceeding, including misrepresentations related to the filing of \r\n  the Proof of Claim, the filing of a motion to lift the automatic stay, the scheduling \r\n  of hearings, the execution of a consent agreement, and the receipt of payment \r\n  from the bankruptcy trustees. Respondent also failed to file an objection to \r\n  the Bankruptcy Plan which led to the plan being approved and his client's foreclosure \r\n  rights being materially impaired. After the client terminated respondent's representation, \r\n  respondent continued in his representation of the client by delivering a copy \r\n  of a consent agreement to the third parties' lawyer.\r\n\r\nRespondent also failed to disclose to his client \r\n  the fact that at the same time that he was representing his client, the third \r\n  parties' lawyer was personally representing respondent in an ongoing legal matter. \r\n  Finally, respondent failed to respond to inquiries and requests for information \r\n  from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a \r\n  lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer \r\n  shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, \r\n  and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); \r\n  Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence in representing a client); \r\n  Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep clients reasonably informed about the status of \r\n  their cases, promptly comply with clients' reasonable requests for information, \r\n  and explain matters to clients to the extent reasonably necessary for them to \r\n  make informed decisions regarding representation); Rule 1.7 (a lawyer shall \r\n  not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially \r\n  limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, \r\n  or by the lawyer's own interests); Rule 1.16 (a lawyer shall not represent a \r\n  client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation \r\n  of a client if the lawyer is discharged); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); \r\n  Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly \r\n  make a false statement of material fact to a third person); Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer \r\n  in connection with a disciplinary matter shall not knowingly fail to respond \r\n  to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule \r\n  8.4(d) (misconduct to engage in conduct involving misrepresentation); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (misconduct to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (knowingly failing \r\n  to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority to include a request \r\n  for a response); and Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the \r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into \r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n We accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and suspend respondent from the practice of law for sixty (60) days. Respondent \r\n  has also tendered his resignation to the South Carolina Bar. The resignation \r\n  will be accepted at the conclusion of the sixty day suspension.

Miller, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  We granted \r\n  certiorari to the Court of Appeals to consider the jury charge in this automobile \r\n  negligence case. Boan v. Blackwell, Op. No. 99-UP-270 (S.C. Ct. App filed \r\n  April 29, 1999). We now hold that \"loss of enjoyment of life\" and \"pain and \r\n  suffering\" are separately compensable elements of damages, and overrule Boan \r\n  v. Blackwell, supra, and Stroud v. Stroud, 299 S.C. 394, 385 \r\n  S.E.2d 205 (Ct. App. 1989), to the extent they hold otherwise. Accordingly, \r\n  we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as modified.\r\n\r\nPetitioners admitted liability, and the only issue \r\n  for the jury was the amount of damages to be awarded to respondent. In the course \r\n  of charging the jury on damages, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In determining the amount of compensation for personal \r\n    injuries, it is proper to take into consideration past and present aspects \r\n    of that injury. This would include, as I have told you, physical and mental \r\n    pain and suffering endured, expenses incurred for necessary medical treatment, \r\n    loss of time and income which resulted from the impairment of the ability \r\n    to work, the loss of enjoyment of life suffered as a result of the injury, \r\n    and any other losses which are reflected by the character of the injury. Now \r\n    in this connection, I charge you that mental pain and suffering, sometimes \r\n    called mental distress, is a proper element of actual damages where it is \r\n    the natural and proximate consequence of a negligent act committed by another.\r\n\r\n  Now an injured party may also recover for such \r\n    future damages as it is reasonably certain will of necessity result from the \r\n    injury received. The principal underlying compensation for future damages \r\n    is that only one action can be brought, and, therefore, only one recovery \r\n    had. It is proper to include in the estimate of future damages compensation \r\n    for pain and suffering which will with reasonable certainty result.\r\n    (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioners objected to the charge, stating, \"[Y]ou \r\n  charged on both lost enjoyment of life and pain and suffering. Our courts have \r\n  indicated that that is basically the same element of damages, and we don't believe \r\n  they should be able to recover for it twice.\" The trial judge declined to act \r\n  on petitioners' objection.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals held the single \r\n  reference to \"loss of enjoyment of life\" in the damages charge \"simply indicated \r\n  to the jury what it could consider when assessing damages for pain and suffering.\" \r\n  Boan v. Blackwell, supra. The court acknowledged its holding in \r\n  Stroud v. Stroud, supra, that loss of enjoyment of life is merely \r\n  a component of pain and suffering and not a separately compensable element of \r\n  damages. After reviewing the entire charge in this case, however, the court \r\n  found no violation of Stroud and consequently held there was no reversible \r\n  error. Boan v. Blackwell, supra.\r\n\r\nWe granted certiorari, and now hold that where \r\n  there is evidence of \"loss of enjoyment of life,\" South Carolina juries should \r\n  be charged that this loss is a compensable element, separate and apart from \r\n  pain and suffering, of a damages award. Although this Court has never directly \r\n  decided this issue, we have acknowledged \"loss of enjoyment of life\" as a basis \r\n  for a damages award in previous cases. See Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, \r\n  165 S.E.2d 797 (1969) (paraplegic's loss of social and business activities is \r\n  compensable intangible injury); Cabler v. L. V. Hart, Inc., 251 S.C. \r\n  576, 164 S.E.2d 574 (1968) (proper to consider how pain, suffering, and disability \r\n  \"decrease and diminish the joys and pleasures of a normal life\" in awarding \r\n  damages); see also Vinson v. Jackson, 317 S.C. 166, 452 S.E.2d 16 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994), rev'd on the other grounds, 327 S.C. 290, 491 S.E.2d 249 \r\n  (1997); Gethers v. Bailey, 306 S.C. 179, 410 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 1991); \r\n  Gasque v. Heublein, Inc., 281 S.C. 278, 315 S.E.2d 556 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\n\r\nIn Stroud v. Stroud, supra, the Court \r\n  of Appeals held, \"[l]oss of enjoyment of life is not a separate species of damage \r\n  deserving a distinct award, but instead is only an element of general damages \r\n  for pain and suffering.\" Id. at 396, 385 S.E.2d at 206. We disagree, and find \r\n  more persuasive the decisions of the United States District Court for the district \r\n  of South Carolina which permit a separate recovery for loss of enjoyment of \r\n  life. See McNeill v. United States, 519 F. Supp. 283 (D.S.C. 1981); see \r\n  also, e.g., Schumacher v. Cooper, 850 F. Supp. 438 (D.S.C. 1994); \r\n  Bates v. Merritt Seafood, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 915 (D.S.C. 1987); Kapuschinsky \r\n  v. United States, 259 F. Supp. l (D.S.C. 1966).\r\n\r\nAn award for pain and suffering compensates the \r\n  injured person for the physical discomfort and the emotional response to the \r\n  sensation of pain caused by the injury itself. Separate damages are given for \r\n  mental anguish where the evidence shows, for example, that the injured person \r\n  suffered shock, fright, emotional upset, and/or humiliation as the result of \r\n  the defendant's negligence. See, e.g., Turner v. A B C Jalousie Co. \r\n  of North Carolina, Inc., 251 S.C. 92, 160 S.E.2d 528 (1968)(physical and \r\n  emotional injuries may be compensable even where there is no threat of physical \r\n  violence).\r\n\r\n On the other hand, damages for \"loss of enjoyment \r\n  of life\" compensate for the limitations, resulting from the defendant's negligence, \r\n  on the injured person's ability to participate in and derive pleasure from the \r\n  normal activities of daily life, or for the individual's inability to pursue \r\n  his talents, recreational interests, hobbies, or avocations. \r\n  (1) See Overstreet v. Shoney's, Inc., 4 S.W.3d 694 (Tenn. Ct. \r\n  App. 1999); Sawyer v. Midelfort, 595 N.W.2d 423 (Wis. 1999); K. M. \r\n  Leasing, Inc. v. Butler, 749 So. 2d 310 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999). For example, \r\n  an award for the diminishment of pleasure resulting from the loss of use of \r\n  one of the senses, or for a paraplegic's loss of the ability to participate \r\n  in certain physical activities, falls under the rubric of hedonic damages. In \r\n  our view, \"loss of enjoyment of life\" damages compensate the individual not \r\n  only for the subjective knowledge that one can no longer enjoy all of life's \r\n  pursuits, but also for the objective loss of the ability to engage in these \r\n  activities.\r\n\r\nWe hold that, where supported by the evidence, \r\n  the jury shall be charged that the injured person is entitled to recover damages \r\n  for loss of enjoyment of life. In our view, a separate charge on hedonic damages \r\n  will minimize the risk that a jury will under- or over-compensate an injured \r\n  person for her noneconomic losses. While there are cases in which it is difficult \r\n  to segregate the various components of these types of damages, we conclude that \r\n  a separate charge will clarify for the jurors the issues they should consider \r\n  in awarding money for injuries which are not readily reducible to specific amounts. \r\n  In situations where the differences may be difficult to discern, defendants \r\n  may request the submission of a special interrogatory. See Rule 49, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that there \r\n  was no error in the charge given in this trial.

We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe instant case concerns a September 1, 1995 fall \r\n  at Baptist Medical Center (BMC) (1) where Respondent/Petitioner \r\n  Catherine Anderson (Anderson) was employed. The case is factually complicated \r\n  by Anderson's involvement in two previous accidents: a 1988 on-the-job injury \r\n  and a 1993 automobile accident. \r\n\r\nIn 1988, while working in a clerical position at \r\n  Providence Hospital, Anderson injured her lower back and legs. She was treated \r\n  conservatively by Dr. James Bethea, the carrier-approved orthopedic surgeon, \r\n  for four years. Anderson left Providence Hospital and took a similar position \r\n  with BMC in December of 1989. During this time period, Anderson received counseling \r\n  and began taking anti-depressants. After four years of continued back pain, \r\n  Anderson eventually sought treatment from Dr. Gal Margalit, who referred her \r\n  to Dr. John Williams, a neurosurgeon in Augusta, Georgia. In July of 1992, Dr. \r\n  Williams performed surgery on Anderson for a herniated disk. \r\n\r\nIn 1993, Anderson was involved in a serious, non-work-related \r\n  automobile accident in which she injured her neck, head, and teeth, and aggravated \r\n  prior back, shoulder, and knee injuries. Dr. Margalit referred Anderson to Dr. \r\n  Robert Peele, who performed surgery on June 10, 1995 on Anderson's left knee \r\n  related to the automobile accident. Anderson also began seeing Dr. Sale Estefano, \r\n  a psychiatrist, after her automobile accident. Dr. Estefano diagnosed Anderson \r\n  with post-traumatic stress disorder with severe depression, panic disorder without \r\n  agoraphobia, and adjustment reaction with depressed mood. \r\n\r\nAfter a hearing on June 15, 1995, Anderson was \r\n  awarded workers' compensation benefits for the 1988 accident at Providence Hospital \r\n  with a 42% impairment to her back. At the time of this hearing, she was out \r\n  of work due to the recent knee surgery related to her automobile accident. However, \r\n  immediately prior to the surgery, she had been working approximately thirty \r\n  hours per week. Her claim for psychological injuries was not addressed by the \r\n  hearing commissioner, and an appeal was not perfected.\r\n\r\nAfter Anderson recovered from her knee surgery, \r\n  she resumed her work schedule of approximately thirty hours per week. On September \r\n  1, 1995, less than three months after her knee surgery and workers' compensation \r\n  hearing, Anderson fell at work, precipitating the instant case. Anderson claimed \r\n  injury to her \"left knee, right knee, left arm and shoulder, right hand and \r\n  arm, back, neck, psychological injury, and all other areas of the body directly/indirectly \r\n  effected [sic].\" BMC admitted injury to Anderson's left knee only. The Hearing \r\n  Commissioner found Anderson sustained an injury by accident to her left knee \r\n  only and \"failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained \r\n  an aggravation of her pre-existing right knee, back, and right and left arm \r\n  injuries.\" The Commissioner also found Anderson \"failed to prove that she sustained \r\n  a mental injury or an aggravation of a pre-existing mental injury/condition \r\n  as a result of her admitted accidental injury.\" Furthermore, the Commissioner \r\n  rejected Anderson's argument that fringe benefits should be included in the \r\n  average weekly wage calculation. The Full Commission affirmed and adopted the \r\n  Hearing Commissioner's order in its entirety. The Circuit Court also affirmed. \r\n  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed on all issues except \r\n  Anderson's claim of psychological injury, which it reversed and remanded. Anderson \r\n  v. Baptist Medical Center and Palmetto Hospital Trust Fund, Op. No. 99-UP-335 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 1, 1999). The parties filed cross-appeals.\r\n\r\nISSUES \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the Commission's finding Anderson \r\n  did not aggravate her pre-existing psychological condition when she fell? \r\n   II. Did the Court of Appeals err in holding \r\n    no statement of maximum medical improvement was necessary regarding Anderson's \r\n    left shoulder and back?\r\n\r\n  III. Should fringe benefits be included in calculating \r\n    average weekly wage?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Psychological Injury\r\n\r\nBMC argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing \r\n  the Commission's finding Anderson did not aggravate her pre-existing psychological \r\n  condition as a result of the September 1, 1995 fall. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed \r\n  correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Rodney \r\n  v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357 (1996). Substantial \r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering \r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion \r\n  the agency reached. Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, \r\n  454 S.E.2d 320 (1995). Where there is a conflict in the evidence, either by \r\n  different witnesses or in the testimony of the same witness, the findings of \r\n  fact of the Commission are conclusive. Glover v. Columbia Hospital of Richland \r\n  County, 236 S.C. 410, 114 S.E.2d 565 (1960).\r\n\r\nMental injuries are compensable if they are induced \r\n  either by physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment. \r\n  Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 335 S.C. 77, 81, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  104, 106 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Kennedy v. Williamsburg County, 242 \r\n  S.C. 477, 131 S.E.2d 512 (1963) and Stokes v. First Nat'l Bank, 306 S.C. \r\n  46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991)). The right of a claimant to compensation \r\n  for aggravation of a pre-existing condition arises only where there is a dormant \r\n  condition which has produced no disability but which becomes disabling by reason \r\n  of the aggravating injury. Hines v. Pacific Mills, 214 S.C. 125, 51 S.E.2d \r\n  383 (1949). Aggravation of pre-existing psychiatric problems is compensable \r\n  if that aggravation is caused by a work-related physical injury. Toler v. \r\n  Black &amp; Decker, 518 S.E.2d 547, 551 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999); see Adams \r\n  v. Texfi Industries, 320 S.C. 213, 217, 464 S.E.2d 109, 112 (1995) (decisions \r\n  of North Carolina courts interpreting that state's workers' compensation statute \r\n  are entitled to weight because the South Carolina statute was fashioned after \r\n  North Carolina's).\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on BMC's stop payment motion, Anderson \r\n  testified her depression had worsened since her fall at BMC and her dosage of \r\n  Prozac had been doubled. Anderson's husband corroborated her testimony. Anderson's \r\n  treating psychiatrist, Dr. Sale Estefano, stated in a letter dated May 2, 1996 \r\n  that he was treating Anderson for her fall of September 1, 1995, which \"aggravated \r\n  her pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis.\" These contentions are, if not supported, \r\n  at least not contradicted by the notes of Dr. Robert Peele, the carrier-approved \r\n  treating physician. Dr. Peele noted on September 25, 1995 Anderson \"will see \r\n  Dr. Estefano for depression. Certainly another factor here.\" On November 6, \r\n  1995, Dr. Peele stated that Anderson could return to work from his perspective, \r\n  but since Dr. Estefano had her out of work for psychological problems, \"that \r\n  will be Dr. Estefano's call.\" On December 26, 1995, Dr. Peele noted Anderson \r\n  had a \"difficult combination of problems orthopaedically and psychologically.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly reversed the Commission's \r\n  finding Anderson's psychological condition was not aggravated by her September \r\n  1, 1995 fall. Although Anderson was receiving treatment for depression prior \r\n  to this accident, the only substantial evidence in the record clearly shows \r\n  her condition was aggravated by the work-related fall.\r\n\r\nII. Maximum Medical Improvement\r\n\r\nAnderson argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding \r\n  no statement of maximum medical improvement (MMI) was necessary with regard \r\n  to injuries to Anderson's left shoulder and back. (2) \r\n  We disagree. \r\n\r\nBarbara Griffin, BMC's workers' compensation nurse, \r\n  testified that Dr. Peele was authorized to treat Anderson's left shoulder, knee, \r\n  and back as a consequence of the September 1, 1995 fall. However, BMC only admitted \r\n  injury to Anderson's left knee. Dr. Peele's letter attached to BMC's stop payment \r\n  application certified he believed Anderson had \"most probably reached maximum \r\n  medical improvement relative to her left knee\" and gave her an 11% impairment \r\n  rating to her left lower extremity. He made no mention of Anderson's left shoulder \r\n  or back.\r\n\r\n Anderson argues the Commission erred in determining \r\n  she reached MMI with regard to injuries to her left shoulder and back. However, \r\n  the Commission did not find Anderson reached MMI as to those injuries. Rather, \r\n  it found Anderson \"sustained an accidental injury only to her left knee\" and \r\n  \"failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained an aggravation \r\n  of her pre-existing right knee, back, and right and left arm injuries.\" \r\n\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed \r\n  correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Rodney \r\n  v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357 (1996). The final determination \r\n  of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to \r\n  the Commission and it is not the task of this Court to weigh the evidence as \r\n  found by the Commission. Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, \r\n  160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105(1999).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly affirmed because \r\n  substantial evidence supports the Commission's decision in this case. \r\n\r\nIII. Average Weekly Wage Calculation\r\n\r\nAnderson argues the $95.02 per week BMC paid for \r\n  her medical, disability, and life insurance should be included in the calculation \r\n  of her average weekly wage. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThis is a question of statutory construction. The \r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent \r\n  of the legislature. Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget and Control \r\n  Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993). In construing a statute, its \r\n  words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle \r\n  or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation. First \r\n  Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  592, 593 (1992). Construction of a statute by an agency charged with its administration \r\n  will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled \r\n  absent compelling reasons. Glover by Cauthen v. Suitt Constr. Co., 318 \r\n  S.C. 465, 469, 458 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1995). The Workers' Compensation Act is \r\n  entitled to a liberal construction in furtherance of the beneficial purposes \r\n  for which it was designed. Carter v. Penney Tire &amp; Recapping Co., \r\n  261 S.C. 341, 349, 200 S.E.2d 64, 67 (1973).\r\n\r\nThe Act defines \"average weekly wage\" to mean \"the \r\n  earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at \r\n  the time of the injury. . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999). \r\n  The definition goes on to state: \"Whenever allowances of any character made \r\n  to an employee in lieu of wages are a specified part of a wage contract they \r\n  are deemed a part of his earnings.\" Id. Thus, before an allowance will be included \r\n  in the average weekly wage calculation, it must (1) be made in lieu of wages, \r\n  and (2) be a specified part of a wage contract.\r\n\r\nThis Court has not had occasion to address the \r\n  definition of \"average weekly wage.\" The Court of Appeals has held that compensation \r\n  should be determined based on the employee's net taxable income. Thus, the average \r\n  weekly wage should be calculated based only on \"the actual sum paid to the employee \r\n  as his wages, not the totality of payments including reimbursements.\" Stephen \r\n  v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 347, 478 S.E.2d 74, 81 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  The Court of Appeals has also held that mileage deductions taken by the employee \r\n  on his federal income tax form were not includable in the employee's income \r\n  for purposes of computing workers' compensation benefits. Wright v. Wright, \r\n  306 S.C. 331, 334, 411 S.E.2d 829, 830-31 (Ct. App. 1991). Relying primarily \r\n  on Stephen, the Court of Appeals held in this case that fringe benefits \r\n  should not be considered in calculating the average weekly wage.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' holding is consistent with \r\n  the majority view. See Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's \r\n  Workers' Compensation Law, Â§ 93.01[2][b] (2000). In the leading case of \r\n  Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs, \r\n  461 U.S. 624 (1983), the United States Supreme Court held that employer contributions \r\n  to union trust funds for health and welfare, pensions, and training are not \r\n  \"wages\" for the purpose of calculating benefits under the District of Columbia \r\n  Act. (3) However, the definition at issue in \r\n  Morrison-Knudsen was very different from that in our Act.\r\n\r\nSeven other states have statutes containing the \r\n  language at issue in this case. (4) Of the seven, \r\n  four have addressed issues similar to the one before us. In Kirk v. State \r\n  of North Carolina Dep't of Correction, 465 S.E.2d 301 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995), \r\n  the North Carolina Court of Appeals, whose interpretation of workers' compensation \r\n  law is given great weight in this state, held the employer's contributions to \r\n  the employee's health insurance plan should not be included in the employee's \r\n  average weekly wage because there was no evidence health insurance contributions \r\n  were made \"in lieu of wages.\" The Supreme Court of Tennessee reached the same \r\n  result, noting any broadening of the definition of average weekly wage should \r\n  come from the legislature, not the courts. Pollard v. Knox County, 886 \r\n  S.W.2d 759 (Tenn. 1994). In Gajan v. Bradlick Co., 355 S.E.2d 899, 901 \r\n  (Va. Ct. App. 1987), the Virginia court held that even where insurance was specifically \r\n  bargained for as part of the employment contract, payment of premiums was still \r\n  not \"in lieu of wages.\"\r\n\r\nThe only state with a similar statute to reach \r\n  a different result is Alabama, where the supreme court held in Ex parte Murray, \r\n  490 So.2d 1238 (Ala. 1986), that fringe benefits such as insurance should be \r\n  included in the calculation of the claimant's average weekly wage. The Murray \r\n  court noted, however, that it was undisputed that fringe benefits in that case \r\n  were not provided gratuitously to the employee and were a specified part of \r\n  the wage contract. Id. at 1240. The Alabama Workers' Compensation Act, amended \r\n  in 1992, now defines \"wages\" to include fringe benefits when the employer does \r\n  not continue those benefits during the period for which compensation is paid. \r\n  Ala. Code Â§ 25-5-1(6) (1992).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals and those courts \r\n  holding fringe benefits should not be included in the average weekly wage. Anderson \r\n  has produced no evidence that BMC pays her insurance premiums \"in lieu of wages\" \r\n  or that they are \"a specified part of [her] wage contract,\" as required by the \r\n  statute. She relies entirely on generalized statements about the importance \r\n  of insurance benefits in today's job market. Furthermore, insurance premiums \r\n  are not \"wages\" or \"earnings\" under the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms. \r\n  For example, Anderson does not claim to include the company-paid insurance premiums \r\n  as income on her tax returns. Finally, including fringe benefits such as insurance \r\n  in the calculation of average weekly wage would dramatically alter the practice \r\n  in this state. We defer to the Commission's longstanding interpretation of the \r\n  Workers' Compensation Act in this regard. See Glover by Cauthen v. Suitt \r\n  Constr. Co., 318 S.C. 465, 469, 458 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1995) (construction \r\n  of a statute by an agency charged with its administration will be accorded the \r\n  most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons). \r\n  We agree with the Virginia Court of Appeals that even a liberal construction \r\n  of the Workers' Compensation Act \"does not authorize the amendment, alteration \r\n  or extension of its provisions beyond its obvious meaning.\" Gajan, 355 S.E.2d \r\n  at 902. Any such significant change in the definition of average weekly wage \r\n  is the prerogative of the legislature.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.  \r\n1.  We \r\n  refer to Petitioners/Respondents collectively as BMC.  \r\n2.  At \r\n  the time of the hearing, Regulation 67-507 required an employer to attach \"a \r\n  medical certificate of the authorized health care provider stating the claimant \r\n  has reached maximum medical improvement\" to its application to terminate compensation. \r\n  S.C.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                  FACTS\r\n                  \r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nOn December 28, 1993, petitioners (the Munozes)\r\nsigned an installment contract and security agreement with Gerald Sealy\r\n(Builder) to finance home improvements in the amount of $15,000 secured by a\r\nmortgage on their home. Builder assigned the agreement the same day to\r\nrespondent Green Tree Financial Corporation (Creditor).\r\nIn December 1996, the Munozes commenced this\r\naction against Creditor and Builder. The Munozes claimed they had been\r\n&quot;grossly overcharged for materials and work performed&quot; and alleged\r\nseveral causes of action including an unconscionable consumer credit\r\ntransaction, violations of the South Carolina Consumer Protection Code,\r\nnegligent misrepresentation, fraud, and unfair trade practices.\r\nCreditor moved to compel arbitration pursuant to\r\nthe arbitration clause in the agreement which provides:\r\n\r\n  All disputes, claims, or controversies arising\r\n  from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this\r\n  contract, or the validity of this arbitration clause or the entire contract,\r\n  shall be resolved by binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by us with\r\n  consent of you. This arbitration contract is made pursuant to a transaction in\r\n  interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act\r\n  at 9 U.S.C. section 1. . . . THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY\r\n  RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL, EITHER PURSUANT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS\r\n  CLAUSE OR PURSUANT TO A COURT ACTION BY US (AS PROVIDED HEREIN). The parties\r\n  agree and understand that all disputes arising under case law, statutory law,\r\n  and all other laws including, but not limited to, all contract, tort, and\r\n  property disputes, will be subject to binding arbitration in accord with this\r\n  contract. . . . Notwithstanding anything hereunto the contrary, we retain\r\n  an option to use judicial or non judicial relief to enforce a mortgage,\r\n  deed of trust, or other security agreement relating to the real property\r\n  secured in a transaction underlying this arbitration agreement, or to enforce\r\n  the monetary obligation secured by the real property, or to foreclose on the\r\n  real property. Such judicial relief would take the form of a lawsuit. The\r\n  institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief in a court to\r\n  foreclose upon any collateral, to obtain a monetary judgment or to enforce the\r\n  mortgage or deed of trust shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any\r\n  party to compel arbitration regarding any other dispute or remedy subject\r\n  to arbitration in this contract, including the filing of a counterclaim in\r\n  a suit brought by us pursuant to this provision.\r\n\r\n(underscoring added).\r\nThe trial judge found this arbitration clause was\r\nunconscionable, essentially because it was part of an adhesion contract, it\r\nlacked mutuality, and it did not comply with statutory provisions of South\r\nCarolina law specifically relating to consumer transactions and arbitration\r\nclauses. He concluded the arbitration clause was unenforceable and denied the\r\nmotion to compel arbitration. Creditor appealed.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed finding\r\nthat a contract of adhesion is not per se unconscionable, mutuality is not\r\nrequired, and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts state law because the\r\ntransaction involved interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Does the FAA apply? If so, what is its effect?\r\n    \r\n  Is the arbitration clause unconscionable as an\r\n    adhesion contract?\r\n    \r\n  Is the arbitration clause invalid for lack of\r\n    mutuality?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n1. The FAA\r\na. Does the FAA apply?\r\n\r\nThe trial judge ruled the arbitration agreement\r\nviolated the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10\r\n(Supp. 1999).1 The Court of Appeals reversed holding\r\nthe FAA applies to this agreement and therefore preempts our state Arbitration\r\nAct. The Munozes contend this was error. We disagree.\r\n\r\n  Title 9 U.S.C. Â§ 2 of the FAA provides in\r\n  pertinent part:\r\n  [A] written provision in any . . . contract\r\n  evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a\r\n  controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid,\r\n  irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in\r\n  equity for the revocation of any contract.\r\n\r\nUnless the parties have contracted to the\r\ncontrary,2 In Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way\r\nEnvtl., Inc., 323 S.C. 454, 476 S.E.2d 149 (1996), we found an arbitration\r\nagreement that did not comply with the technical notice requirements of Â§\r\n15-48-10(a) was nonetheless valid because the FAA included no such notice\r\nrequirement. We did not address the impact of the partiesâ€™ agreement that the\r\nstate Arbitration Act would apply. We now clarify that the result in Soil\r\nRemediation hinged on the fact that application of state law would have\r\nrendered the arbitration agreement completely unenforceable under Â§ 15-48-10(a)\r\nwhich provides that a contract failing to comply with statutory notice\r\nrequirements shall not be subject to arbitration. State law was therefore\r\npreempted to the extent it would have invalidated the arbitration agreement.\r\nThe parties to a contract are otherwise free to agree that our state Arbitration\r\nAct will apply and this agreement shall be enforceable even if interstate\r\ncommerce is involved. the FAA applies in federal or state court to any\r\narbitration agreement regarding a transaction that in fact involves interstate\r\ncommerce, regardless of whether or not the parties contemplated an interstate\r\ntransaction. Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Dobson, 513 U.S.\r\n265 (1995); Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc., 323 S.C. 454,\r\n476 S.E.2d 149 (1996).3\r\nHere, the arbitration agreement, which applies to\r\n&quot;this contract and the relationships which result from this contract,&quot;\r\nprovides it shall be governed by the FAA. Arbitration agreements, like other\r\ncontracts, are enforceable in accordance with their terms. Volt Info.\r\nSciences, Inc. v. Bd. of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., 489 U.S.\r\n468, 478 (1989).\r\nFurther, the transaction in this case in fact\r\ninvolves interstate commerce. Both the Munozes and Builder are domiciled in\r\nSouth Carolina. Builder, however, assigned all its rights under the agreement to\r\nCreditor, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in\r\nMinnesota. Creditor actually prepared the agreement in Minnesota and forwarded\r\nit to Builder in South Carolina. The proceeds of the loan were disbursed from a\r\nbank in Minnesota. Although the Munozes may not have contemplated an interstate\r\ntransaction, their contractual relationship with Creditor in fact involves\r\ninterstate commerce and therefore the FAA applies.\r\n\r\nb. Effect of the FAA\r\n\r\nGeneral contract principles of state law apply to\r\narbitration clauses governed by the FAA. Doctorâ€™s Assoc., Inc. v. Casarotto,\r\n517 U.S. 681, 685 (1996); Allied-Bruce, 513 U.S. at 281; Moses H. Cone\r\nMem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983); see also Keystone,\r\nInc. v. Triad Systems Corp., 971 P.2d 1240 (Mont. 1998) (applying general\r\nstate law to arbitration clause governed by FAA). State law remains applicable\r\nif that law, whether legislative or judicial, arose to govern issues concerning\r\nthe validity, revocability, and enforceability of all contracts generally. Perry\r\nv. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 492 n. 9 (1987). A state law that places\r\narbitration clauses on an unequal footing with contracts generally, however, is\r\npreempted if the FAA applies. Allied-Bruce, 513 U.S. at 281. Accordingly,\r\nour state Arbitration Act, which applies specifically and exclusively to\r\narbitration agreements, is preempted in this case. Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way\r\nEnvtl., Inc., supra.\r\nIn addition to our state Arbitration Act, the\r\nMunozes assert various statutory provisions of our state Consumer Protection\r\nCode4 invalidate the arbitration clause. We find\r\nthis argument without merit.\r\nUnder the FAA, an arbitration clause is separable\r\nfrom the contract in which it is embedded and the issue of its validity is\r\ndistinct from the substantive validity of the contract as a whole. Prima\r\nPaint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 (1967). An\r\narbitration clause may be invalidated under a state law only if that law governs\r\nthe enforceability of all contracts generally. Perry v. Thomas, supra.\r\nThe Consumer Protection Code does not govern contracts generally but applies\r\nonly to certain consumer transactions. While the requirements of the Consumer\r\nProtection Code may be raised on the merits of the contractâ€™s enforceability\r\nas a consumer credit transaction, these requirements do not apply to determine\r\nthe validity of the arbitration clause itself.\r\nFurther, we quote from the United States Supreme\r\nCourtâ€™s most recent decision regarding application of the FAA:\r\n\r\n  We have . . . rejected generalized attacks on\r\n  arbitration that rest on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the\r\n  protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants. . . .[E]ven\r\n  claims arising under a statute designed to further important social policies\r\n  may be arbitrated because so long as the prospective litigant effectively may\r\n  vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the\r\n  statute serves its functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph,\r\n69 U.S.L.W. 4023, 4026 (filed December 11, 2000) (internal quotations and\r\ncitations omitted). Although the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision involved a federal\r\nstatutory claim and is not directly applicable here, we are guided by the same\r\nliberal policy favoring arbitration. Accordingly, we find the arbitration clause\r\nin this case is not invalid under our state Consumer Protection Code.\r\n\r\n2. Adhesion contract\r\n\r\nThe Munozes contend the arbitration clause is\r\nunconscionable because it is part of an adhesion contract and they were not\r\nadvised it was included in the contract.\r\nGenerally, an adhesion contract is a standard\r\nform contract offered on a take-it or leave-it basis with terms that are not\r\nnegotiable. Lackey v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 330 S.C. 388, 498 S.E.2d 898\r\n(Ct. App. 1998). Under state law, an adhesion contract is not per se\r\nunconscionable. Fanning v. Fritzâ€™s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, Inc., 322\r\nS.C. 399, 472 S.E.2d 242 (1996) (unconscionability is the absence of meaningful\r\nchoice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions together\r\nwith terms that are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them\r\nand no fair and honest person would accept them); Lackey v. Green Tree Fin.\r\nCorp., 330 S.C. 388, 498 S.E.2d 898 (Ct. App. 1998) (fact that a contract is\r\none of adhesion does not render it unconscionable).5\r\nFurther, a person who can read is bound to read an agreement before signing it. Hood\r\nv. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Tennessee, 173 S.C. 139, 175 S.E. 76 (1934).6\r\nWe find the arbitration clause is not unconscionable as an adhesion contract.\r\n3. Mutuality\r\n\r\nThe Munozes contend the arbitration clause lacks\r\nmutuality and is therefore invalid because it allows Creditor to seek\r\nforeclosure on the mortgage given by the Munozes and denies the Munozes the\r\nright to litigate any counterclaim in the foreclosure action.\r\nWe find the doctrine of mutuality of remedy does\r\nnot apply here. An agreement providing for arbitration does not determine the remedy\r\nfor a breach of contract but only the forum in which the remedy for the\r\nbreach is determined. Ex parte McNaughton, 728 So.2d 592, 598 (Ala.\r\n1998). The Munozes have not been deprived of a remedy -- they simply must seek\r\ntheir remedy through arbitration rather than through the judicial system.\r\nMoreover, under state law, a lack of mutuality of remedy does not invalidate a\r\ncontract. Lackey v. Green Tree, supra.7\r\n\r\nThe Munozes further complain that in light of the\r\nallegation they were unaware they were giving a mortgage on their home, it is\r\nunconscionable to compel arbitration on their claims while Creditor may pursue\r\nforeclosure in the courts. We note, however, that although the arbitration\r\nclause requires the Munozes to arbitrate any counterclaim they may have,\r\nthere is nothing prohibiting them from litigating in court any defense to\r\nforeclosure which would include the alleged invalidity of their mortgage. See,\r\ne.g., Livingston Holding Co. v. Avinger, 183 S.C. 1, 189 S.E. 806\r\n(1937) (defense that mortgage obtained by duress or fraud raised as defense in\r\nforeclosure action); Whittle v. Jones, 79 S.C. 205, 60 S.E. 522 (1908)\r\n(defense that mortgage void on ground of fraud and misrepresentation raised as\r\ndefense in foreclosure action). Accordingly, we find no reason to invalidate the\r\narbitration clause on this ground.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals reversing\r\nthe denial of the motion to compel arbitration is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting\r\nJustice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n1This section requires\r\nnotice that a contract is subject to arbitration be &quot;typed in underlined\r\ncapital letters, or rubber-stamped prominently, on the first page of the\r\ncontract.&quot;\r\n2As\r\nthe United States Supreme Court recognized in Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v.\r\nBd. of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., 489 U.S. 468 (1989), the\r\nparties are free to enter into a contract providing for arbitration under rules\r\nestablished by state law rather than under rules established by the FAA. The FAA\r\npreempts state laws that invalidate the partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate\r\n&quot;[b]ut it does not follow that the FAA prevents the enforcement of\r\nagreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the [FAA]\r\nitself.&quot; Id. at 478. Such a result would be inimical to the FAAâ€™s\r\nprimary purpose of ensuring that arbitration agreements are enforced according\r\nto their terms. Id.; see also Ford v. NYLcare Health Plans of the Gulf\r\nCoast, Inc., 141 F.3d 243 (5th Cir. 1998); Wolsey, Ltd. v.\r\nFoodmaker, Inc., 144 F.3d 1205 (9th Cir. 1998); Ackerberg v.\r\nJohnson, 892 F.2d 1328 (8th Cir. 1989).\r\nIn Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc.,\r\n323 S.C. 454, 476 S.E.2d 149 (1996), we found an arbitration agreement that did\r\nnot comply with the technical notice requirements of Â§ 15-48-10(a) was\r\nnonetheless valid because the FAA included no such notice requirement. We did\r\nnot address the impact of the partiesâ€™ agreement that the state Arbitration\r\nAct would apply. We now clarify that the result in Soil Remediation\r\nhinged on the fact that application of state law would have rendered the\r\narbitration agreement completely unenforceable under Â§ 15-48-10(a) which\r\nprovides that a contract failing to comply with statutory notice requirements\r\nshall not be subject to arbitration. State law was therefore preempted to the\r\nextent it would have invalidated the arbitration agreement. The parties to a\r\ncontract are otherwise free to agree that our state Arbitration Act will apply\r\nand this agreement shall be enforceable even if interstate commerce is involved.\r\n3We overrule Mathews\r\nv. Fluor Corp., 312 S.C. 404, 440 S.E.2d 880 (1994), to the extent it\r\nconsidered whether the parties contemplated interstate commerce as a factor in\r\ndetermining if the FAA applied.\r\n4S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n37-1-101 et seq. (1989 &amp; Supp. 1999).\r\n5Similarly, federal\r\nsubstantive law under the FAA holds an arbitration clause is not invalid simply\r\nbecause it is part of an adhesion contract. Cohen v. Wedbush, Noble, Cooke,\r\nInc., 841 F.2d 282 (9th Cir. 1988). Inequality of bargaining\r\npower alone will not invalidate an arbitration agreement. Gilmer v.\r\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20 (1991); Harris v. Green Tree\r\nFin. Corp., 183 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 1999).\r\n6This rule is\r\nconsistent with federal cases holding that arbitration agreements governed by\r\nthe FAA will not be set aside on the ground the arbitration clause was not\r\nnoticed or explained since the party signing the agreement is presumed to have\r\nread it. Adams v. Merill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, 888 F.2d 696\r\n(10th Cir. 1989); Cohen v. Wedbush, Noble, Cooke, Inc., 841\r\nF.2d 282 (9th Cir. 1988).\r\n7This rule has been\r\nadopted by the majority of courts. See, e.g., Sablosky v. Edward S.\r\nGordon Co., 535 N.E.2d 643 (N.Y. 1989) (collecting cases); Restatement\r\nSecond of Contracts, Â§ 363 comment c (no requirement of mutuality of remedy).\r\nOur conclusion is also consistent with federal cases holding an arbitration\r\nagreement governed by the FAA need not equally bind each party to arbitration if\r\nconsideration has been given beyond the agreement to arbitrate. Harris v.\r\nGreen Tree, 183 F.3d at 180 (holding valid exact arbitration agreement in\r\nquestion here); Doctorâ€™s Assocs., Inc. v. Distajo, 66 F.3d 438 (2d Cir.\r\n1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25241","title":"Duke Power Company v.

Whitt, of Austin, Lewis &amp; Rogers, of Columbia, and Jefferson D. Griffith, III, of Duke Power, of Charlotte, North\r\nCarolina, for appellant.\r\n\r\nF. David Butler, of the Public Service Commission, and Steven W. Hamm and Mary Sowell League, of Richardson, Plowden,\r\nCarpenter &amp; Robinson, all of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  This is an appeal from an order of the Circuit Court affirming the order of the Public Service\r\nCommission (Commission) ordering Duke Power Company n/k/a Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation (Duke)\r\nto cease and desist from attempting to provide power to the Nason Corporation (Nason), a new construction located within\r\nterritory assigned to Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Blue Ridge).  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn April 1969, Duke constructed a 44kv power line that ran from Westminster to Walhalla.  The line was built temporarily on a\r\n100kv double circuit line and was named the Darby Line.  That same year, the General Assembly enacted the Territorial\r\nAssignment Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-610 through -670 (1976), effective July 1, 1969.  The Act required the\r\nCommission to assign \r\n\r\n\r\nbeginning as soon as practicable after January 1, 1970, to electric suppliers, all areas, by adequately defined boundaries which\r\nmay be by reference to boundaries drawn on maps or otherwise, that are outside the corporate limits of municipalities, and that\r\nare more than three hundred feet from the lines of all electric suppliers as such lines exist on the dates of the assignments;\r\nprovided, that the Commission may leave unassigned any area in which the Commission, in its discretion, determines the\r\nabsence of assignment is justified by public convenience and necessity.  \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 58-27-640.  Pursuant to this section, Duke, Blue Ridge, and Haywood Electric Membership Corporation submitted to the\r\nCommission a joint application for the assignment of electric service areas in Oconee County.  The application included a map\r\nof Oconee County (Exhibit A) designating areas to be assigned to the applicants and areas to be left unassigned.  The\r\nCommission approved the application and incorporated the map into its order (1972 Order).  The order was a form order used\r\nby the Commission statewide.  It stated, in its entirety:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Commission on Joint Application of Duke Power Company, Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative,\r\nInc. and Haywood Electric Membership Corporation, under the provision of Section 24-15 of the Code of Laws of South\r\nCarolina for the assignment of electric service areas in Oconee County, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe verified Application and attached map, Exhibit A, indicate the areas in Oconee County to be assigned to each applicant and\r\nthe areas to be left unassigned.  The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the approval of this Application is in the\r\npublic interest and that each of the applicants is able to provide adequate service in the territory assigned;\r\n\r\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Application is approved, and the areas in\r\nOconee County situated more than three hundred (300') feet from the lines of any electric supplier and outside the corporate\r\nlimits of any municipality are assigned to the respective applicants or designated unassigned, all as shown on Exhibit A\r\nincorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Order as fully as if set out herein.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuke's Darby line ran through territory assigned to Blue Ridge.\r\n\r\nIn October 1973, Duke added a 100kv circuit to the existing towers and constructed a new 44kv line along the same right of\r\nway to replace the 44kv line that had been temporarily strung on the towers.  This new line was named the Bear Swamp 44kv\r\nline.  Poles for the Bear Swamp line have 1974 \"birthmarks.\" (1)  In 1981, Duke began serving its first and only customer off the\r\nBear Swamp line pursuant to a statutory exception permitting out-of-territory service to industrial customers with an initial load\r\ngreater than 750 kilowatts.   See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-620(2) (1976).\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Nason decided to build a new plant in Oconee County and asked Duke to be its electrical supplier.  Duke began\r\nconstructing new underground lines with which to serve Nason, and Blue Ridge filed an Emergency Petition for Rule to Show\r\nCause and Petition for Immediate Cease and Desist Order with the Commission.  After a hearing on the merits, the Commission\r\ngranted the requested cease and desist order against Duke.  The Commission subsequently filed a second order denying Duke's\r\nmotion to reconsider.  Duke appealed to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the Commission's orders.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Circuit Court err in affirming the Commission's\r\n finding Duke has no right to serve the customer in question?\r\n\r\nDuke asks us to reverse the Commission's determination, affirmed by the Circuit Court, that it has no right to serve the Nason\r\nplant.  We agree with the Circuit Court and Commission that Duke may not serve a customer located wholly within territory\r\nassigned to Blue Ridge.\r\n\r\nThis Court employs a deferential standard of review when reviewing a decision of the Public Service Commission and will\r\naffirm that decision when substantial evidence supports it.  Porter v. South Carolina Public Service Comm'n,  333 S.C. 12, 507\r\nS.E.2d 328 (1998).  This Court may not substitute its judgment for the Commission's on questions about which there is room\r\nfor a difference of intelligent opinion.  Id.  Because the Commission's findings are presumptively correct, the party challenging\r\na Commission order bears the burden of convincingly proving the decision is clearly erroneous, or arbitrary or capricious, or an\r\nabuse of discretion, in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record. Id., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp.\r\n1999).\r\n\r\nDuke's reasons why it should be allowed to serve the customer in dispute are essentially twofold.  First, Duke argues the statute\r\npermits Nason to choose its electric supplier under the circumstances present here.  Second, Duke argues the 1972 Order\r\ncreates a swath of unassigned territory around its Bear Swamp line.  We address each of these arguments in turn.\r\n\r\nA.  The Statute \r\n\r\nDuke asserts it has a right to serve Nason because the customer is located partially within three hundred feet of its Bear Swamp\r\nline, thus creating a customer choice situation pursuant to Â§ 58-27-620(1)(d)(iii).  This subsection provides that a customer\r\nlocated partially within three hundred feet of certain lines of an electric supplier and partially within a service area assigned to\r\nanother electric supplier may choose its supplier.  \r\n\r\nWe disagree this subsection applies to give Duke the right to serve Nason.  In order for Â§ 58-27-620(1)(d)(iii) to apply to\r\nDuke's Bear Swamp line, the line must meet certain criteria: it must have been in existence on July 1, 1969 and it must be a\r\ndistribution line.  Â§ 58-27-610(3).  In order for a 44kv line like Duke's Bear Swamp line to be a distribution line, the parties\r\nmust agree it is such or the Commission must find the line's \"primary purpose and use\" is distribution.  See Â§ 58-27-610(3). \r\nThe Commission determined Duke's Bear Swamp line is not a distribution line, but a transmission line, with no appurtenant\r\nservice rights.  There is abundant evidence in the record to support this determination, including the fact that the line was\r\noriginally constructed as a transmission tie line, the original Darby 44kv line never served any customers, and the current Bear\r\nSwamp line has served only one customer in its history, pursuant to a specific statutory exception.  Moreover, Duke's\r\ntestimony reveals that in order to serve the Nason plant, a new distribution line would have to be built, a fact which suggests\r\nthe Bear Swamp line is not, in fact, a distribution line. \r\n\r\nDuke argues the Commission is without authority in this case to determine the nature of its line because the parties agreed the\r\nline was a protected distribution line when they drew it on the 1972 map.  We find no evidence in the record to support Duke's\r\nassertion that mere depiction of the line has any significance as to its nature as a distribution or transmission line.  On the\r\ncontrary, the 1972 Order states that the map \"indicate[s] the areas  in Oconee County to be assigned to each applicant and the\r\nareas to be left unassigned\" (emphasis added).  Nothing in the language of the Order indicates an intent to establish all depicted\r\nlines as protected distribution lines.  We conclude the map merely depicts the existence of Duke's transmission line through\r\nBlue Ridge's territory and does not constitute an agreement of the parties that the line is a protected distribution line.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we reject Duke's argument the Commission is without authority to determine the nature of Duke's line.  On the\r\ncontrary, the statute gives the Commission express authority to determine the nature of a disputed line.  Â§ 58-27-610(3).  As\r\nnoted above, the Commission's determination the disputed line is a transmission line is completely supported by the record. \r\nThus, Duke has no right under the statute to serve the Nason plant.\r\n\r\nB.  The 1972 Order\r\n\r\nDuke asserts the 1972 Order creates a six hundred foot wide swath of unassigned territory within territory assigned to Blue\r\nRidge, and that since Nason is located partially within that swath, it may choose its electric supplier.  Duke bases its argument\r\non the following language in the 1972 Order:\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he areas in Oconee County situated more than three hundred (300') feet from the lines of any electric supplier and outside\r\nthe corporate limits of any municipality are assigned to the respective applicants or designated unassigned, all as shown on\r\nExhibit A.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuke's interpretation is unpersuasive.  The language of the Order merely tracks the language of the statute, which provides the\r\nCommission shall assign \"all areas . . . that are outside the corporate limits of municipalities, and that are more than three\r\nhundred feet from the lines of all electric suppliers as such lines exist on the dates of the assignments.\"  Â§ 58-27-640.  As\r\nexplained above, in order for the Bear Swamp line to qualify as a \"line\" under the statute, it must be a distribution line.  Â§\r\n58-27-610(3).  Distribution lines in place prior to July 1, 1969 were protected by \"corridor rights,\" that is, the right to serve all\r\npremises located \"wholly within three hundred feet\" of the supplier's line.  Â§ 58-27-620(1)(b) &amp; (c). (2)  \r\n    Pursuant to its statutory\r\nmandate, the Commission could not assign territory within protected corridors.  Thus, we read the disputed language of the\r\n1972 Order as merely clarifying that territorial assignment does not abrogate existing corridor rights.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation urged by Duke would require this Court to interpret the 1972 Order in a way that is in direct conflict with the\r\nTerritorial Assignment Act.  We see no basis in either the Order or the statute to interpret the Order as creating a corridor of\r\nunassigned territory along Duke's Bear Swamp line.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.   PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion, in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent.  In 1972, these parties (3) filed a joint application with the Public Service\r\nCommission (PSC) seeking the assignment of territory in Oconee County.  In connection with this application, the parties\r\nsubmitted, as a joint exhibit, a map identifying the areas they sought to be assigned to each, and the areas which they asked to\r\nbe designated as unassigned.  The line at issue in this case, as well as other lines, are depicted on the map.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the fact that this power line is represented on the joint exhibit is determinative of the issue whether the line is a\r\ndistribution line or a transmission line.  The purpose of the map was to establish territorial assignments:  only distribution lines\r\nare relevant to determining these assignments since service rights depend, in part, on proximity to such lines.  See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§Â§ 58-27-610(3); 58-27-620(1976).  There was simply no reason for a transmission line to be included in the map, and no\r\nevidence that any were.  Further, there is no  dispute that the line qualifies to be a distribution line, since it was in existence on\r\nJuly 1, 1969, (4) as required under Â§ 58-27-620, and since its voltage level is within the parameters of a distribution line. Â§ 58-27-610(3).  Under these circumstances, the only conclusion which can be drawn is that when the parties submitted their joint\r\nmap and included the line at issue here, they manifested their agreement that this line was, in fact, a distribution line.  Id.   To\r\nreopen these territorial assignment consent orders, many of which like the one at issue here are more than twenty-five years old,\r\nand permit electric suppliers to litigate their intentions anew, is to encourage uncertainty where there is now stability.\r\nI would hold that the 1972 PSC order approving the joint application assigning territory \"as shown on [the joint map]\r\nincorporated herein by reference and made a part of this order\" constitutes an agreement by the parties that Duke's Bear\r\nSwamp line is a distribution line.  Further, since the Nason Corporation plant is partially located within 300 feet of this line, it\r\nhas the right to choose its electric supplier. Â§ 58-27-620(1)(d)(iii).  Accordingly, I would reverse the circuit court order\r\naffirming the PSC's cease and desist order.   \r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n1.  Birthmarks are markings or tags attached to poles indicating the date the equipment was erected or placed at a particular site.\r\n2.  Duke concedes it does not have corridor rights here. \r\n3.  The application was also made by a third party, which has no interest in the present dispute.\r\n4.  The fact that the line was changed out and renamed in 1974 is of no consequence here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25242","title":"State v.

McIntosh; Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka; Assistant\r\nAttorney General Jeffrey A. Jacobs, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: Appellant was convicted of two counts of murder, first degree burglary, armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy.  He received two\r\ndeath sentences for the murders, (1) concurrent sentences of thirty years each on the burglary and armed robbery charges, and a concurrent five year sentence for\r\nconspiracy.  Finding four errors in the guilt phase of the trial, we reverse appellant's convictions and sentences, and remand. \r\n\r\nA.  Facts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe victims were bludgeoned to death with a hammer and a piece of brick in the West Columbia home they shared.  Victim John Pipkin was 63, physically\r\nhandicapped, legally blind, and in poor health.  The other victim, Susan Furman, was in her forties and in poor health.  Money was taken from the home, most\r\nprobably an amount between 700 and 1,000 dollars.  No physical evidence other than a bloody boot print was found at the scene.\r\n\r\nAppellant was employed by Pipkin as a line cook in the canteen at the Strom Thurmond Federal Building in Columbia.  On Friday, February 2, 1996, appellant\r\nwas angry at Pipkin because he believed that Pipkin had deducted an excessive amount from his paycheck for snacks and drinks consumed on the job.  It was\r\ncommon knowledge among the employees that Pipkin ran a cash business, and usually took the profits home with him on Fridays.  \r\n\r\nDoris Moore called her friend Susan Furman at the home Furman shared with Pipkin at about 6:30 p.m. on Friday, February 2, 1996.  While they were on the\r\nphone, the doorbell rang at the Pipkin home.  Furman told Moore she was not expecting company, and that Pipkin had gone to answer the door.  Moore heard a\r\nstrange man's voice, followed by Furman's scream, and scuffling and knocking noises.  After about twenty seconds the phone went dead.  Moore called a\r\nneighbor of Furman's and Pipkin's, and asked her to check them.  The neighbor called John Orr, Pipkin's stepson.\r\n\r\n  Orr  went to the house to check on Pipkin and Furman.  He noticed lights that were usually turned on were off, and rang the doorbell several times.  When no\r\none answered the door, Orr looked in the windows and saw Furman's body.  He entered the house through the storm door, which he was surprised to find\r\nunlocked.  He then saw Pipkin's body and the blood, and asked another neighbor to call 911.  Orr testified that because of the condition of the house's contents,\r\nit was clear there had been a struggle. \r\n\r\nThe victims were killed by blunt trauma to the head, consistent with having been beaten with a hammer.  Furman had defensive on wounds on her arms.\r\n\r\nThe State's case against appellant rested entirely on the testimony of  appellant's friend, roommate, and self-confessed accomplice, James Brown.   Brown\r\ntestified that after he and appellant finished smoking crack late on the afternoon of February 2, appellant suggested going to Pipkin's home and robbing him. \r\nBrown was familiar with Pipkin and Furman because his girlfriend had worked at the canteen, and Brown had been a frequent visitor.  Brown testified both he\r\nand appellant had been to the Pipkin home before February 2. \r\n\r\nAccording to Brown, he and appellant planned the robbery in the room appellant rented in Brown's parents' house in Cayce.  Brown took stockings from his\r\nmother's room for disguises, and he and appellant left on foot, headed for Pipkin's West Columbia home.  Along the way, Brown and appellant ran into a friend\r\nof Brown's, Darryl Good.  Good testified that he recalled meeting Brown late that afternoon, and identified appellant as the man with Brown.  Good's testimony\r\nis the only evidence independent of Brown's testimony placing the two together in the vicinity of the Pipkin home on Friday, February 2.\r\n\r\nBrown testified that as they approached the area where Pipkin lived, appellant gave him a hammer which Brown recognized as belonging to his parents.  A few\r\nminutes later, appellant picked up a brick and broke it, telling Brown he was bringing it along because there were \"some dogs down through there.\" \r\n\r\nBrown testified he and appellant entered Pipkin's fenced yard and walked up on the front porch.  Brown pointed out to appellant that Furman, visible through a\r\nwindow, was on the phone.  Appellant knocked on the door, and Brown pulled down the stocking he had on his head.  Appellant wore gray mittens.  Appellant\r\nidentified himself (2) through the door, and when Pipkin opened it, appellant knocked him down and ran to Furman and began hitting her with the piece of brick. \r\nBrown shut the front door and sat down next to Pipkin.  \r\n\r\nAccording to Brown's testimony, he hit Pipkin in the head with the hammer once, then gave it to appellant.  Brown held Furman's arms while appellant\r\nrepeatedly hit her in the head.  Brown took Furman's wallet and ransacked a back bedroom while appellant remained in the living room area, apparently hitting\r\nPipkin with the hammer.  Appellant came back to the bedroom, told Brown to take the now bloody hammer, and \"mess with the lock on the back door\" to give\r\nthe appearance of a burglary.  Meanwhile, appellant, still wearing mittens,  went through Pipkin's briefcase and took the money bag.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brown, he and appellant left through the back door, scaled the fence, and began walking on this rainy night, going from West Columbia across the\r\nJarvis Klapman Boulevard bridge into Columbia. Brown testified he dropped the hammer near Pipkin's home, and that appellant put his mittens in a storm\r\nwater drain.  Following his arrest, Brown led police to the hammer; the mittens were never recovered. \r\n\r\nAfter returning to Brown's parents' home where they changed clothes and divided the money, Brown testified he and appellant partied through the night.   The\r\nnext day they were smoking crack at a friend's house when someone called to say the police were surrounding Brown's parents' home.  Appellant went to\r\ncheck on the situation, then returned to the friend's house.  Appellant and Brown later went to the parents' house, and were told to leave.  They walked most of\r\nthe way from Columbia to Sumter that night in a snowstorm.  Video tapes from two convenience stores along the Sumter Highway show appellant and Brown\r\ntogether in the stores on Saturday, February 3.\r\n\r\nThe police were looking for appellant based on information given them by Pipkin's stepson, John Orr.  They learned appellant and Brown were often together. \r\nThey located Brown in Sumter on Tuesday, February 6, and he returned with officers to Lexington.  In his first statement, he denied any involvement in the\r\ncrimes.  He was then arrested, and gave a second statement which was largely consistent with his trial testimony.  Appellant was later arrested.\r\n\r\nAppellant raises six issues on appeal, four alleging error in the guilt phase, and two in the penalty phase.\r\n\r\nB.  Guilt Phase Issues\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant claims he is entitled to a new trial based on three evidentiary errors and one jury charge error.  We agree.  These four issues are:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Whether the trial judge erred in limiting appellant's cross-examination of Brown?;\r\n\r\n(2) Whether the trial judge erred in admitting expert testimony of the \"barefoot insole impression\" found inside the boot which left the bloody print at the crime\r\nscene?;\r\n\r\n(3) Whether the trial judge erred in allowing witness Orr to testify he had given police officers appellant's name when they asked if Orr knew anyone who\r\nmight harbor a grudge against victim Pipkin?; and, \r\n\r\n(4) Whether the trial judge erred in altering the reasonable doubt charge given the jury after appellant had given his closing argument in reliance upon the\r\noriginal charge?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Impeachment\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown had an extensive criminal record dating back to 1976, and a history of plea bargaining.

Brown testified he faced the death penalty for his role in these crimes and that he had not\r\nbeen promised anything in exchange for his testimony.  He acknowledged that the solicitor's office would decide after this trial whether to pursue the death\r\npenalty against him.  He was asked why, with full knowledge of the charges against him, and full knowledge of the possibility of the death penalty, he was\r\ntestifying at this trial.  Brown replied, \"Well, I can't save my life, but I can at least save my soul.\"  He then proceeded to narrate his version of the crimes,\r\nidentifying appellant as the leader and himself as the follower, and minimizing his own participation in the horrific assaults that killed the victims.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, appellant sought to question Brown about his prior plea bargains, to show his knowledge of the system and the ways it could be\r\nmanipulated, and to show bias and motive in his trial testimony and its manner of presentation. Appellant's attorney pointed out that he intended to emphasize\r\nthe past deals Brown had made with the Lexington County Solicitor's office, the same office that would decide Brown's fate in this current case.  The judge\r\ndeclined to allow appellant to explore this issue before the jury.  Appellant contends this limitation of impeachment pursuant to Rule 608(c), SCRE, was\r\nreversible error.  We agree.\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 608(c), \"Bias, prejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness either by examination of the witness or by evidence\r\notherwise adduced.\"  This subsection of Rule 608 preserves South Carolina precedent holding that generally, \"anything having a legitimate tendency to throw\r\nlight on the accuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity of a witness may be shown and considered in determining the credit to be accorded his testimony.\" State v.\r\nBrewington, 267 S.C. 97, 226 S.E.2d 249 (1976)(citing 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§460).  Brown's credibility was the central issue in this case. \r\n\r\nAppellant's defense was that, rather than acting as appellant's less culpable accomplice, Brown was the sole perpetrator of the offenses. (3)  Brown also chose to\r\npresent himself to the jurors as motivated solely by concern for his salvation, and not by hope of receiving a lesser sentence. Significantly, Brown's most\r\nfavorable deal had been made with this same solicitor's office.  \r\n\r\nThis situation is unlike that presented in State v. Aleskey, Op. No.25212 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 13, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.41 at 1).  In State v.\r\nAleskey, supra, the defendant sought to impeach an eyewitness about specific charges which had been dismissed against her in New Jersey.  That witness was\r\nneither the self-confessed accomplice to the murder for which the defendant was on trial, nor was there any evidence of her participation in the crime other than\r\na retracted confession by the defendant.  Obviously, there was no connection between the prosecutor's office in New Jersey which had dismissed the charges\r\nand the solicitor's office which was prosecuting the defendant\r\n\r\nIn this case, appellant sought to explore past dealings between Brown and the office prosecuting the current charges, not to impeach Brown through those\r\ndismissed charges, but rather to expose Brown's bias and prejudice in the present case.  This excluded evidence had \"a legitimate tendency to throw light on the\r\naccuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity\" of Brown's testimony.  State v. Brewington, supra.  We hold the trial judge committed reversible error under Rule 608(c)\r\nin refusing to permit appellant to conduct this cross-examination.  In light of this holding, we need not reach appellant's argument that he should have been\r\npermitted to cross-examine Brown about the dismissed charges under Rule 608(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\n2.  Expert Testimony\r\n\r\n\r\nA single boot print was found on Pipkin's bloody kitchen floor.  The \"steel toe\" boots which made the impression, as well as another pair of \"high-top\" boots,\r\nwere found in the room appellant rented at Brown's parents' home.  Brown claimed appellant wore the \"steel toe\" boots connected to the crime, while he wore\r\nthe pair of high-top boots also found in the room.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the State was permitted to introduce testimony that the \"barefoot impressions\" left on the \"steel toe\" boots' insoles were consistent with the boots\r\nhaving been worn by appellant.  Appellant contends this \"barefoot insole impression\" evidence is not scientifically reliable, and further that SLED agent\r\nDerrick who conducted the examination was not a qualified expert.  Finally, he argues that even if there exists such a science, and even if Derrick were\r\nqualified, the prejudicial impact of the testimony outweighed its probative value.  We find this \"science\" unreliable, and reverse the trial court's decision to\r\nadmit this evidence.\r\n\r\nScientific evidence is admissible under Rule 702, SCRE, if the trial judge determines: (1) the evidence will assist the trier of fact; (2) the expert witness is\r\nqualified; (3) the underlying science is reliable, applying the factors found in State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979); and (4) the probative value of\r\nthe evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999).  The trial judge's decision to admit or exclude the evidence\r\nis reviewed on appeal under an abuse of discretion standard.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe central thesis of \"barefoot insole impression\" evidence is that the primary wearer of footwear, over time, begins to leave an impression of the wearer's foot\r\nin the footwear's insole.   Inked impressions of the suspected wearer's feet, photos of the suspected wearer's known insoles, and a standing cast of the suspected\r\nwearer's foot are compared to the impressions in the boots, both visually and by using calipers to compare distances between toes and other features among the\r\nvarious exhibits.   A Canadian researcher (Kennedy), who testified for the State at trial, is currently conducting a study following R.C.M.P. (4) troopers and their\r\nnew boots throughout the training process.  Kennedy has compared the insole impressions made in some 200 Canadian army boots with the feet of the wearers. \r\nHe began research in the area in 1989 after earlier work done by Dr. Louise Robbins was discredited. (5)  \r\n\r\n  Kennedy testified that different researchers use different methods in making these type comparisons, but that he felt his method (the one used by Agent\r\nDerrick)  was the best.  He also testified that he has revised some of his statements, but none of his methods, based on comments received after publication of\r\nhis peer-reviewed articles.\r\n\r\n  In conducting the tests here, Agent Derrick relied upon a talk he heard several years earlier, three books, two of which were published before 1989, and a phone\r\nconversation with Kennedy.\r\n\r\nWe agree with appellant that the \"scientific\" evidence admitted at his trial does not meet the requirements for admissibility, and therefore need not address his\r\ncontentions that Agent Derrick was not a qualified expert, and that the prejudicial impact of this evidence outweighed whatever probative value it may have\r\nhad.  State v. Council, supra.  The Jones reliability factors take into consideration:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the publications and peer reviews of the technique;\r\n\r\n(2) prior application of the method to the type of evidence involved in the case;\r\n\r\n(3) the quality control procedures used to ensure reliability; and\r\n\r\n(4) the consistency of the method with recognized scientific laws and procedures.  State v. Council, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State relies most heavily on Kennedy to establish that there is a science underlying \"barefoot insole impressions.\"  While Kennedy testified that he had\r\npublished several peer-reviewed articles, he also testified that he was still in the process of collecting data in order to determine which standards were\r\nappropriate for comparison purposes.  Further, he candidly acknowledged that earlier work in this area had been discredited. \r\n\r\n  We find the evidence presented here insufficient to meet the Jones' requirements that: (1) the technique be published and peer-reviewed; (2) the method has\r\nbeen applied to this type evidence; and (3) the method be consistent with recognized scientific laws and proceedings.  In our opinion, it is premature to accept\r\nthat there exists a science of \"barefoot insole impressions.\"\r\n\r\nAn additional issue arises here as the result of the Jones requirement that the quality control procedures used ensure reliability.  Neither Agent Derrick nor\r\nanyone connected with SLED had ever done this type of test before.  Further, Agent Derrick admittedly had not conducted the testing in conformity with\r\nSLED's quality control precautions.  The director of the SLED laboratories testified that SLED requires a written protocol on all laboratory procedures, which\r\nmust be \"thoroughly tested to prove their scientific validity, accuracy and repeatability.\"  Here, there was no written protocol in existence (6) when Agent Derrick\r\nconducted his testing, much less one which had been subjected to SLED's quality control policies.\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, that the trial judge erred in permitting expert testimony purporting to demonstrate that \"barefoot insole impression\" testing revealed\r\nappellant's foot to be consistent with the impression made by the primary wearer of the \"steel toe\" boot.  The admission of this evidence mandates reversal of\r\nappellant's convictions.\r\n\r\n3.  Identification\r\n\r\n\r\nVictim Pipkin's stepson John Orr, who discovered the bodies, remained at the scene until the police arrived.  Over appellant's in camera objection that the\r\nevidence improperly put appellant's character in issue, the trial judge allowed this series of questions and answers:\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.: Now, Mr. Orr, I was askin' you that night after all the law enforcement officers got there, did you give the police officers the name of a person they should\r\ntalk to about what happened to [the victims]?\r\n\r\nA.: He had asked me if I knew anyone who might have a grudge against [Pipkin]. (7)\r\n\r\nQ.: Did you give 'em a name?\r\n\r\nA.: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ.: And what name did you give 'em?\r\n\r\nA.: Jeff.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge then instructed the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, I've allowed this testimony in only for the purpose of allowing the testimony later in which the police officers will explain\r\nwhy they began to look for Mr. Jones particularly.  It is not for the purpose of the truth of the allegation itself.  Those [sic] aren't the issue.  The issue is why the\r\npolice officers began to look for Mr. Jones.  You will hear testimony from them on that later.  That is the only reason that it's introduced at this time.  Alright. \r\nGo ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends this identification of him as the immediate suspect in the double homicide constitutes reversible error.  We agree.  In German v. State, 325\r\nS.C. 25, 478 S.E.2d 687 (1996), this Court reversed a conviction where there were references to a police officer receiving tips that the defendant was selling\r\ncrack cocaine.  We held these references were improper comments on the defendant's character, and distinguished State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888\r\n(1994).  Evidence that police began an investigation because of reports of criminal activity are admissible under State v. Brown, supra.  However, identification\r\nof an individual as the suspect of a criminal investigation, based upon speculation and effectively calling into question that individual's character, is not. \r\nGerman v. State, supra.\r\n\r\nThe State argues any error in admitting Orr's testimony was harmless.  First, they point out the trial judge gave a \"limiting\" instruction.  We decline to hold that\r\na limiting instruction always cures an evidentiary error.  Cf. State v. Smith, 290 S.C. 393, 350 S.E.2d 923 (1986) (curative instruction not always sufficient to\r\nalleviate prejudice).  Second, the State contends Orr's testimony was merely cumulative to other evidence that appellant was angry on the day of the murders\r\nbecause he felt victim Pipkin had \"shorted\" him on his pay.  Orr's identification of appellant as an individual with a grudge sufficient to commit a double\r\nhomicide is qualitatively much more damning than the statement that appellant thought Pipkin had shorted him.  Under the circumstances of this case, given the\r\nextent to which the State's case depended upon the credibility of an admitted accomplice and the defense theory which sought to convince the jury that the\r\naccomplice acted alone, we find the admission of this improper character evidence reversible error. \r\n\r\n4.  Reasonable doubt charge\r\n\r\nAt the charge conference prior to the guilt phase closing arguments, neither appellant nor the State objected to the trial judge's indication that he planned to give\r\nthe reasonable doubt charge outlined in State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d 372 (1991).  In Manning, this Court suggested that the jury be charged, \"A\r\nreasonable doubt is the kind of doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.\"  Id. at 417, 409 S.E.2d at 375.\r\n\r\nAppellant's closing argument was designed to exonerate him and inculpate Brown.  It focused on the fact the crime could have been committed by a single\r\nindividual; on the dearth of evidence of appellant's participation other than Brown's inconsistent statements; and on Brown's credibility problems and criminal\r\nrecord.  After reviewing the evidence, appellant's attorney turned to the law: \r\n\r\n\r\nNow I am gonna talk to you about a couple of concepts that we have in the law.  And one is the burden of proof that the state has.  Why do we have that?  The\r\nstate goes first.  They go first and they get to present their evidence first, and the reason for that is they have the burden of proof.  That's the way it should be. \r\nBecause you know, a lot of times it's impossible or if not impossible to prove that you didn't - - that you weren't somewhere.  They have a positive burden of\r\nproving that.\r\n\r\nThe judge is gonna define reasonable doubt, and he's gonna tell you that reasonable doubt, and he's gonna tell you that reasonable doubt is a doubt that would\r\ncause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.  Well, when you go through this testimony and this evidence in this case, you're gonna hesitate and you're gonna\r\nhesitate and you're gonna talk and it's gonna get slow and you're gonna hesitate and you're finally gonna have to stop.  And when you stop you're gonna have\r\nto say that, you know, he's innocent.  The state hasn't carried their burden.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe emphasized again:\r\n\r\n\r\nI want you to listen real carefully to the law.  I want you to listen particularly carefully when [the judge] talks about reasonable doubt and the burden of proof\r\nand the presumption of innocence 'cause those are the concepts . . . .  I'm gonna ask you and I'm gonna urge you to listen to the law as the judge charges you;\r\napply it and use your common sense . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing counsel's argument and appellant's brief statement to the jury, the jury was excused.  The solicitor then asked the judge to excise from his reasonable\r\ndoubt charge the language:\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . .cause a person to hesitate to act based on [appellant's attorney's] closing argument to tell the jury to go in there and discuss the evidence and deliberate you\r\nhesitate to act.\r\n\r\nNow that's not what the law is.  We would request that you not charge reasonable doubt to hesitate to act because based on that argument it's telling that jury\r\nwell if ya'll deliberate you're hesitating and it's not guilty.  So based on the context of the closing argument by [appellant's attorney], that particular piece of\r\nlaw . . . . I think in the context of the closing argument and what was said to the jury it would be extremely prejudicial to charge hesitate to act. \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant's attorney responded he had merely argued the law, and that if he had been inaccurate, then the solicitor should have objected during his closing,\r\nrather than trying to change the charge after the fact.  The solicitor continued to argue the 'hesitate to act' language was \"prejudicial out the window\" in light of\r\nappellant's counsel's argument.  The judge took the solicitor's request under advisement and called a recess.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, the judge stated that he would excise the \"hesitate to act\" language in order not to \"confuse\" the jury.  Appellant's attorney argued that his\r\nclosing argument had been structured around the Manning charge given the parties the night before.  The judge agreed there was nothing improper about the\r\nclosing argument, but stated that he wanted the jury to \"feel alright\" about engaging in deliberation and discussion.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that it was fundamentally unfair to alter the reasonable doubt charge after he structured and delivered his argument around the \"hesitate to act\"\r\nlanguage.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe Manning charge, although not required, is a correct statement of South Carolina law.  Appellant reasonably relied upon the judge's representation that he\r\nintended to give that charge to the jury.  The decision to alter the charge, after the argument, was fundamentally unfair.  See United States v. Kostoff, 585 F.2d\r\n378 (9th Cir. 1978); compare State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996)(no fundamental unfairness where judge declined to give charge originally\r\nagreed to because there was no reliance upon original charge); see also State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170, 284 S.E.2d 357 (1981) subsequent history omitted\r\n(where defendant was induced to take stand under promise of limited questioning, reversible error to subject him to full examination because he relied upon\r\nlimitation); cf. State v. Day, Op. No. 25167 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 6, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 28 at 21) (judge's refusal to charge self-defense where\r\nwarranted unfairly hamstrung counsel's closing argument); cases construing Fed. R. Crim. P. 30, which provides in part, \"The court shall inform counsel of its\r\nproposed action upon the requests [to charge] prior to their arguments to the jury.\"  \r\n\r\nAppellant's attorney told the jury that the judge would charge them reasonable doubt meant a doubt which would cause a reasonable person to \"hesitate to act.\" \r\nThe effect of the judge's after the fact decision to excise the hesitate to act language from his charge was to diminish appellant's attorney's credibility in the\r\neyes of the jury.   Compare State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 447 S.E.2d 186 (1994)(new trial ordered where judge's comments on counsel's age and gender\r\nimpugned counsel's credibility in jury's eyes); State v. Simmons, 267 S.C. 479, 229 S.E.2d 597(1976)(new trial where judge threatened defense counsel with\r\njail because conduct affected jury's view of counsel's credibility).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge erred when he acceded to the solicitor's demand that the reasonable doubt charge be altered.  We again remind prosecutors that they are\r\n\"ministers of justice and not mere advocates.\"  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).  Their special \"responsibility carries with it specific\r\nobligations to see the defendant is accorded procedural justice. . . .\"  Comment, Rule 3.8 of Rule 407, SCACR.  It does not serve justice nor instill public\r\nconfidence when we are required to reverse convictions because of errors such as these.\r\n\r\nC.  Penalty Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant raises two penalty phase issues.  First, he complains the trial court committed reversible error in admitting four color photos of the victims, and a\r\ncolor video tape of the crime scene.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nTwo of the still photos show victim Pipkin's body at the scene.  These photos were properly admitted in the sentencing phase since they accurately \"depict the\r\nvictim's body in substantially the same condition\" in which it was left by the defendant.  State v. Powers, 331 S.C. 37, 501 S.E.2d 116 (1998).  The other two\r\nphotos depict the wounds to victim Furman's head, with her head shaved at the autopsy.  While stark, they are no more disturbing than other photos of\r\nFurman's wounds introduced without objection.  The number and severity of her injuries are shown by these photos, which were properly admitted to\r\n\"demonstrate the circumstances of crime and the character of the defendant.\" State v. Powers, supra.  The crime scene video was also properly admitted to show\r\nthe jury the circumstances of the crime.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn his second penalty phase argument, appellant contends the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury that, if it found an aggravating circumstance, its\r\nsentencing choices would be either death or life without possibility of parole.  For the reasons given in my dissent in State v. Kelly, Op. No. 25226 (S.C. Sup.\r\nCt. filed January 8, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 13, I would require this charge be given at appellant's retrial.  Such a charge is not, however,\r\nappropriate under this Court's precedents. Id.; State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907 (2000); State v. Shafer, 340 S.C. 291, 531 S.E.2d 524 (2000)\r\ncertiorari granted 2000 WL 1057649 (September 26, 2000).\r\n\r\nD.  Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, appellant's convictions and sentences are reversed, and the matter remanded for a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  The jury found the following four statutory aggravating circumstances with reference to both victims:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) committed while in the commission of a burglary;\r\n\r\n(b)  committed while in the commission of a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon;\r\n\r\n(c)  committed while in the commission of a larceny while armed with a deadly weapon; and\r\n\r\n(d)  two or more persons were murdered by one act pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury found an additional aggravator in the murder of victim Susan Furman:  The murder was committed while in the commission of physical torture.  \r\n2. Why he did so after he and Brown had prepared disguises is unclear from the record.\r\n3. This was not an incredible defense.  It is feasible that one person could have overwhelmed the two disabled victims. Further, the woman on the phone with\r\nFurman heard only one male voice, only one shoe print was found at the scene, and Brown led the police officers to the hammer.\r\n4. Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\r\n5. Kennedy is hoping to establish that each human foot is unique, but at present the most that can be said is that a foot may be \"consistent\" with a barefoot\r\nimpression.\r\n6. An assistant solicitor created a protocol, in anticipation of trial, after Agent Derrick had done the testing here.\r\n7. Nowhere in the in camera hearing did the witness indicate the question had been posed as \"who had a grudge.\"  He rephrased the inquiry in open court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25243","title":"State v.

Dudek, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior \r\nAssistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, and Solicitor W. Barney Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: A jury convicted appellant of murder, and the trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment.  He directly appeals the conviction and\r\nsentence.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn December 31, 1995, the partially-clothed body of  fifty-year-old Patricia Huffstetler (\"victim\") was discovered in the tunnel below Interstate 26, near\r\nElmwood Avenue in Columbia (\"the tunnel\").  She had been stabbed four times in the chest.  Approximately 20 feet from the body, there were signs of a\r\nstruggle, a pair of broken eyeglasses, and drag marks which led to the body.\r\n\r\nAs part of the investigation, Detective Robert Benson was questioning people at the Salvation Army on January 3, 1996.  Appellant approached Detective\r\nBenson saying that the detective would want to talk with him.  Because of the late hour, Detective Benson asked appellant to come to the police station the next\r\nday.  Appellant arrived at the station the following morning, and Detective Steve Rice interviewed appellant.  Appellant gave Detective Rice a statement in\r\nwhich appellant said that he knew the victim and had last seen her a few days before Christmas.  Appellant denied that he had ever been physically involved\r\nwith the victim.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about the victim in the news on New Year's Day, the victim's former boyfriend, Greg Hiers, contacted police.  Hiers told Detective Benson that,\r\nbased on information from his Caller ID, he believed the victim had called him from a pay phone at 10:59 a.m. on December 31. (1)    \r\n\r\nThe pay phone was located outside an Exxon station on Elmwood Avenue.  On January 4, 1996, Detective Rice obtained the surveillance tape from the\r\nconvenience store at the Exxon station for the day of December 31, 1995.  That evening, Detective Rice viewed the videotape which showed the victim,\r\ntogether with appellant, in the convenience store from 10:48 to 10:52 a.m.  Detective Rice testified that he recognized appellant because he had just interviewed\r\nhim that morning.\r\n\r\nRealizing that appellant had lied about when he last saw the victim, the police located appellant and again questioned him at the station.  After being confronted\r\nwith the videotape, appellant initially denied, but then admitted the tape reflected that he and the victim were together the morning of December 31. \r\n\r\nPolice searched appellant's room at the Salvation Army.  In the room, police seized three trash bags and a duffel bag. (2)  A damp, black sweatshirt was retrieved\r\nfrom one of the bags. (3)  In addition, police discovered a knife under the pillow of the unoccupied bunk.\r\n\r\nThe State presented evidence that robbery was appellant's motive for the crime.  In the videotape, the victim paid for her purchase at the Exxon convenience\r\nstore from a white purse, and the cashier testified that the victim paid with a $50 or $100 bill.  The police discovered the white purse, without any money in it,\r\nin a cemetery located between the Exxon and the tunnel.  Police searched appellant's car and found a bill of sale for the car dated January 3, 1996.  The seller of\r\nthe car testified that appellant had purchased the car for $270, using mostly large bills.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the State presented evidence which linked appellant to the knife discovered on the bunk at the Salvation Army.  Walter Armstrong testified that\r\napproximately four years before trial he gave appellant a knife similar to the one discovered and that he saw appellant with the knife as recently as November\r\n1995.  The pathologist testified that the knife was consistent with the weapon which caused the victim's stab wounds.\r\n\r\nFinally, the State presented significant forensic evidence linking appellant to the crime.  An expert in shoe print identification stated that appellant's Nike\r\nsneakers were consistent with a shoe print found near the body in the tunnel. An expert in trace evidence testified that a hair from inside the victim's coat was\r\nconsistent with appellant's hair.  An expert in forensic serology testified that blood stains found on appellant's jacket and his black sweatshirt were consistent\r\nwith the victim's blood type and also stated that human blood was found on the knife.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, an expert in DNA analysis testified that the blood found on the black sweatshirt matched the victim's DNA blood profile.  The DNA expert also\r\ntestified that semen found inside the victim's body matched appellant's DNA profile. (4)  In the DNA expert's opinion, the blood on appellant's sweatshirt was\r\nthe victim's blood and the semen was from appellant.  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Did the trial court err in excluding evidence of third party guilt?\r\n\r\n2.  Did the trial court err by admitting a photograph of the victim and her former boyfriend?\r\n\r\n3.  Did the trial court err in not considering a minimum thirty-year sentence pursuant to the version of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) which was in effect at the\r\ntime of sentencing?   \r\n\r\n\r\n1.  THIRD PARTY GUILT\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that third party guilt evidence related to Louis Metz was improperly excluded by the trial court.\r\n\r\nAppellant sought to introduce evidence related to Metz in two different ways.  First, through various proffers, appellant sought to introduce the following\r\nevidence about Metz.  Hiers, the victim's former boyfriend, testified in camera that the victim and Metz lived together and that Metz told Hiers many times that\r\nhe was going to kill the victim.  Hiers stated that Metz relayed this threat to him even on the date of the victim's death.  However, Hiers recalled that Metz said\r\nhe was going to kill the victim in phone conversations at 5:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on December 31, and the victim's body had been discovered at approximately\r\n4:00 p.m. that day.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, appellant proffered testimony that in police interviews: (1) Metz admitted that he argued with, hit, and had sex with the victim on December 31;\r\n(2) Betty Jackson stated that Metz told her he hit the victim during an argument on December 31 because the victim had taken $300 from him and that she saw\r\nMetz's knuckles were swollen on January 1, 1996.\r\n\r\nAppellant also sought to admit evidence that blood and hair samples were taken from Metz.  Significantly, however, the forensic experts concluded that none of\r\nthe evidence matched Metz.  After the various proffers, the trial court did not allow appellant to introduce the evidence about Metz.\r\n\r\nSecond, there was evidence about Metz in appellant's statement to police.  Specifically, in his statement, appellant told police that  (1) Metz was someone\r\n\"special\" in the victim's life; (2) the victim talked about how Metz would \"beat on her;\" (3) appellant saw the victim beaten up; (4) the victim told appellant\r\napproximately 20 times in six months that Metz had beaten her up and it was all she could talk about when she was drunk; and (5) the victim acted as if she was\r\nscared of Metz.  Although the State introduced appellant's statement, it moved to redact the references to Metz.  Reasoning that the evidence about Metz did\r\nnot meet the standard for admissibility of third party guilt evidence, the trial court allowed the redactions.\r\n\r\nIt is well-settled that the admission and rejection of proffered testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court and its exercise of such discretion will\r\nnot be disturbed by this Court on appeal unless it can be shown that there has been an abuse of discretion, a commission of legal error in its exercise, and that\r\nthe rights of the appellant have been thereby prejudiced.  E.g., State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941).  \r\n\r\nEvidence offered by a defendant as to the commission of the crime by another person is limited to facts which are inconsistent with the defendant's guilt.  State\r\nv. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); State v. Parker, 294 S.C. 465, 366 S.E.2d 10 (1988); Gregory, supra.  In Gregory, this Court explained that:\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another person must be limited to such facts . . . as raise a reasonable inference or\r\npresumption as to his own innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as\r\nto the commission of the crime by another, is not admissible. . . .   [B]efore such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such\r\na train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other person as the guilty party.\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d at 534-35 (internal quotes and citations omitted).  Furthermore, this Court has held that evidence of a third party's\r\nmotive and opportunity to kill the victim is properly excluded where the appellant nonetheless fails to show that the proffered evidence is inconsistent with his\r\nguilt.  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 335, 468 S.E.2d 626, 631, cert.&nbsp;denied, 519 U.S. 891, 117 S.Ct. 230, 136 L.Ed.2d 161 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe trial court found that given the totality of the evidence against appellant and the nature of the evidence proffered regarding Metz, the evidence was not\r\ninconsistent with appellant's guilt and thus would serve merely to cast suspicion upon Metz.  In our opinion, the trial court properly exercised its discretion. \r\nSee Gregory, supra.\r\n\r\nIn view of the strong evidence of appellant's guilt - especially the forensic evidence - and the fact that the forensic experts found that the samples from Metz\r\ndid not match any evidence gathered in this case, the proffered evidence about Metz did not raise \"a reasonable inference\" as to appellant's own innocence. \r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 104, 16 S.E.2d at 534.  Moreover, while the proffered evidence about Metz may have established evidence of motive and opportunity for\r\nMetz to kill the victim, the evidence simply was not inconsistent with appellant's guilt.  Williams, supra.\r\n\r\nRegarding the evidence about Metz in appellant's statement to police, appellant argues that the trial court erred in allowing his statement to be redacted. \r\nAppellant contends Rule 106, SCRE, required that the entire statement be admitted.\r\n\r\nRule 106, SCRE, provides that \"[w]hen a writing, or recorded statement, or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction\r\nat that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\"  In State v. Taylor,\r\n333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998), the Court stated that \"[o]nly that portion of the remainder of a statement which explains or clarifies the previously\r\nadmitted portion should be introduced.\"  Id. at 171, 508 S.E.2d at 876.\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not violate Rule 106 by admitting appellant's statement because the redacted portion would not have explained or clarified that part of the\r\nstatement which was admitted.  See id.  The admitted portion outlined how appellant knew the victim and other general information about the victim, for\r\nexample the fact that she drank \"quite a lot\" of alcohol.  The redacted portion addressed the victim's relationship with Metz and therefore did not impact the\r\nportion the State admitted. (5)  Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, we agree with the trial court that the redacted portion would have been improperly\r\nadmitted as third party guilt evidence.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision to exclude evidence regarding Metz is affirmed.\r\n\r\n2.  ADMISSIBILITY OF PHOTOGRAPH\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erroneously admitted a photograph of the victim and her former boyfriend Greg Hiers because the photograph was\r\nirrelevant and was only offered to arouse sympathy for the victim.\r\n\r\nDuring Hiers's testimony, the State admitted a photograph of Hiers and the victim taken in 1993.  The photograph shows the two sitting on a bench with Hiers's\r\narm around the victim and city lights in the background.  The State established, through testimony from Hiers, that the victim was wearing her eyeglasses in the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nAppellant maintains that this Court's decision in State v. Livingston, 327 S.C. 17, 488 S.E.2d 313 (1997), establishes that the admission of the photograph was\r\nimproper.  The Livingston Court reversed a conviction for felony driving under the influence (DUI) of marijuana where the appellant had caused a car accident,\r\nkilling a woman in the other car.  The woman's husband testified at trial, and a photograph of the two was admitted.  This Court held that the photograph was\r\nirrelevant to the trial since DUI was the only charge at issue.  The Court stated that \"a photograph should be excluded if it is calculated to arouse the sympathy\r\nor prejudice of the jury or is irrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate facts.\"  Id. at 20, 488 S.E.2d at 314 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe State argues that the photograph was relevant to establish the broken eyeglasses which were found in the tunnel 20 feet away from the body were actually\r\nthe victim's eyeglasses.  We agree.  This fact was relevant to establishing that a struggle had occurred in the tunnel.  See Rule 401, SCRE (evidence is relevant\r\nif it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy).  In our opinion, the admission of the photograph\r\nwas not \"calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury;\" instead, it was admitted to \"substantiate facts\" surrounding the circumstances of the\r\nmurder.  Livingston, 327 S.C. at 20, 488 S.E.2d at 314.  Moreover, the probative value of the photograph was not outweighed by any unfair prejudicial value. \r\nSee Rule 403, SCRE (relevant evidence may be excluded if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value).\r\n\r\nWe therefore affirm the trial court's admission of the photograph. (6)\r\n\r\n3.  SENTENCING UNDER S.C. CODE ANN. Â§ 16-3-20(A)\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in sentencing him to a mandatory life sentence where S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) allows a minimum sentence of\r\nthirty years imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe murder was committed on December 31, 1995.  At that time, section 16-3-20(A) read in pertinent part:  \"[a] person who is convicted of . . . murder must be\r\npunished by death or by imprisonment for life . . . .\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1995).  Appellant was sentenced on September 26, 1997.  An\r\namendment to section 16-3-20(A) which took effect on January 1, 1996, changed the section to read, in relevant part:  \"[a] person who is convicted of . . .\r\nmurder must be punished by death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A)\r\n(Supp. 1995) (emphasis added); see&nbsp;also 1995 S.C. Acts No. 83, Â§ 10 (\"the Act\").\r\n\r\nAppellant maintains that because the statute in effect at the time of sentencing allowed a thirty-year sentence, whereas the statute in effect at the time of the\r\ncrime mandated life imprisonment, the trial court should have considered the statute in effect at the time of sentencing. (7)  Specifically, appellant relies on this\r\nCourt's decision in State v. Varner, 310 S.C. 264, 423 S.E.2d 133 (1992).  In Varner, the Court stated that \"[i]n the absence of a controlling statute, the\r\ncommon law requires that a convicted criminal receive the punishment in effect at the time he is sentenced, unless it is greater than the punishment provided for\r\nwhen the offense was committed.\"  Id. at 265, 423 S.E.2d at 133.  \r\n\r\nAppellant argues that Varner applies, and therefore, the trial court should have considered a thirty-year sentence.  However, the Varner Court indicated that the\r\nLegislature could state its intent for new, lesser penalties to take effect based on the date of the crime rather than the date of sentencing.  See Varner, 310 S.C. at\r\n266 n.3, 423 S.E.2d at 134 n.3.  The Act which amended section 16-3-20 specifically addressed its effective date.  Section 62 states that the Act \"takes effect\r\nJanuary 1, 1996, and applies prospectively to all crimes committed on or after that date . . . .\"  1995 S.C. Acts No. 83, Â§ 62 (emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nBecause the Legislature expressly stated its intent for prospective application based upon the date of the crime's commission, the general rule of Varner does\r\nnot apply.  The crime in this case was committed on December 31, 1995, one day before the amended statute's effective date; therefore, the trial court correctly\r\nsentenced appellant to a mandatory life imprisonment term.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1995).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, appellant's life sentence is affirmed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Hiers also testified that he and the victim had problems with alcohol, they had met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and after he went to jail for a DUI\r\nconviction, the victim began living with Louis Metz.\r\n2. Appellant was not in the room at the time police conducted their search.  There were six bunks in the room; with the exception of one, all the beds were\r\noccupied when police arrived.  Police concentrated their search in and around the unoccupied bed.  The trash bags had papers with appellant's name on them,\r\nthus indicating that the belongings were his.  \r\n3. From the videotape, appellant appeared to be wearing a black sweatshirt on December 31.\r\n4. Semen found outside the victim's vaginal area was analyzed and found to be a mixture of appellant's and another unknown male's semen.\r\n5. We note that one part of the admitted statement referenced \"Lewie\" (i.e. Metz); however, because there was testimony that the victim lived with Metz, this\r\nisolated reference did not require any explanation from the redacted portion.\r\n6. Even assuming that the trial court erroneously allowed the photograph into evidence, its admission was harmless.  See State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 647-48,\r\n515 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1999) (the erroneous admission of irrelevant evidence may constitute harmless error if the evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial).\r\n7. The trial court decided that a life sentence was mandatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25239","title":"In the Matter of Terry A.

Condon and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the\r\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nRichard A. Blackmon, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:     This is an attorney disciplinary matter involving multiple uncontested charges of misconduct, including\r\ncriminal conduct. (1) \r\n\r\n1.  The Geneva Frances Matter\r\n\r\nGeneva Frances retained Respondent on August 22, 1996 to represent her regarding an automobile accident.  The retainer\r\nagreement specified a one-third contingency fee.  In addition, Respondent drew up a contract for expenses which provided,\r\namong other things, for research and investigation at the rate of $65.00 per hour and secretarial services at the rate of $10.00\r\nper hour.  This document was dated August 22, 1996.  Respondent forged Ms. Frances's signature on the contract and notarized\r\nher forged signature. \r\n\r\nRespondent settled Ms. Frances's case in March of 1997 for $30,000 and received a partial disbursement of settlement funds. \r\nRespondent immediately wrote himself a check for $15,000, claiming the extra $5,000 was for investigative services.  An\r\nundated Disbursement Sheet showed funds for investigative services in the amount of $5,427.50.  However, at the time of\r\ndisbursement, no detailed itemization of the investigative work was presented to Ms. Frances.  The undated Disbursement\r\nSheet showed only \"legal assistant expense, 83.5 hours - $65.00 per hour.\"  The Disbursement Sheet also included a charge of\r\n$536.50 for paper, fax, stamps, copies, gasoline and mileage, phone, electricity, and the investigator's expense to review the\r\naccident scene.  These bills were improper because Respondent's fee was based on a contingency agreement.  A copy of this\r\ndocument was not given to Ms. Frances at the time of disbursement.  Respondent disbursed only $3,195.60 to Ms. Frances, and\r\nno disbursement was made to medical providers at that time.  When Ms. Frances met with an attorney from the South Carolina\r\nBar's Fee Dispute Resolution Board, she saw for the first time a document bearing her forged signature, stating that she\r\n\"received and approved\" the personal injury disbursement from her case on March 26, 1997.\r\n\r\nToumey Hospital treated Ms. Frances for her injuries related to the automobile accident.  Ms. Frances's medical expenses\r\ntotaled $9,430.54.  Respondent did not pay Toumey out of the settlement.  A collection agency contacted Ms. Frances\r\nconcerning her unpaid bill at Toumey.  Ms. Frances contacted Respondent's office, requesting information and a copy of her\r\nfile.  Respondent provided Ms. Frances with a copy of her file, but tried to charge her $91.25 for the copy, including one hour's\r\nwork at $65.00 per hour, as opposed to the $10.00 per hour fee for secretarial service set forth in the Settlement Costs and\r\nExpenses Agreement.  Respondent eventually paid Ms. Frances's medical bills on May 15, 1997.  During the time of delay,\r\nRespondent allowed the balance of his trust account to drop as low as $6,326.60 during two months.  Payment of Ms. Frances's\r\nmedical bills was therefore made with funds owed to other clients.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of representation, Respondent advanced $1,000 and $100 to Ms. Frances.  These advances were made from\r\nfunds owed to other clients.  Respondent later claimed these advances were to pay specified medical bills in even amounts of\r\n$1,000 and $100, even though no such bills existed.\r\n\r\nRespondent claimed to have employed Robert Moore as an investigator regarding the Geneva Frances matter.  Mr. Moore had\r\nno prior investigative experience and no experience researching medical matters.  Mr. Moore stated he made approximately 407\r\ncopies of documents at the Medical University of South Carolina regarding hand injuries.  Mr. Moore testified he made a hand-written summary of his investigation, but no copy was located and no correspondence from Respondent to Ms. Frances's\r\ninsurance carrier or physician reflects any such research.  Mr. Moore's cellular telephone records, for at least one of the days he\r\nclaimed to be in Charleston doing research, showed calls attributable to a cell tower that did not serve the Charleston area. \r\nRespondent falsely testified before the Commission on Lawyer Conduct that the documents supposedly obtained by Mr. Moore\r\nwere used to enhance his position when negotiating Ms. Frances's case.  \r\n\r\nMr. Moore did not prepare itemized bills for his time and expenses on the Geneva Frances case.  Respondent and Mr. Moore\r\nboth testified at their Notices of Appearance that Respondent paid Mr. Moore over $5,000 in cash for his services.  Mr. Moore\r\ntestified he maintains no checking or savings account and did not deposit the money, but simply used it over the course of time.\r\n\r\nMs. Frances complained to Respondent about the disbursement of funds, payment owed to medical providers, and\r\ninvestigator's fee.  In response, Respondent wrote a letter to Ms. Frances dated June 13, 1997, stating that if she complained to\r\nthe South Carolina Bar and others, he would sue her for $500,000 for slander per se and intentional infliction of emotional\r\ndistress.  In a letter to Ms. Frances dated June 14, 1997, Respondent threatened to have her arrested and have criminal charges\r\nbrought against her, in addition to the civil actions for slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress, \"the next time\r\nyou do anything in relation to contacting my office or anyone else. . . .\"\r\n\r\nRespondent swore under oath at his Notice of Appearance that he saw Ms. Frances sign the August 22, 1996 contract and the\r\nMarch 26, 1997 approval of disbursement.   Investigators from the Attorney General's office found the Settlement Cost and\r\nExpense Agreement authorizing the hiring of an investigator, the undated Disbursement Sheet, the approval of the\r\ndisbursement, and Ms. Frances's letter of complaint to the Fee Dispute Board in the trunk of Respondent's car.  Among these\r\ndocuments was a letter dated July 21, 1997 with a simulation of Ms. Frances's signature on the reverse side.  Respondent\r\nadmitted making that signature at his Appearance.  Further examination revealed that there had been a tracing done over\r\n\"Geneva\" in Ms. Frances's signature on a copy of the original fee agreement of August 22, 1996.  The Questioned Documents\r\nsection of the State Law Enforcement Division confirmed that Ms. Frances's signature, taken from a copy of the original fee\r\nagreement, was traced or forged on the March 26, 1997 document approving the settlement of Ms. Frances's case and the\r\nAugust 22, 1996 contract approving the hiring of an investigator.  Respondent not only committed forgery, he notarized the\r\nforgeries, and lied about them under oath at his Appearance.\r\n\r\n2.  The James Richard Bryant Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent conducted a real estate closing for James Richard Bryant on October 23, 1997.  Respondent neglected this matter,\r\nnot recording the deed or paying the survey fee until February of 1998.  During the period between Respondent's receipt of\r\nclosing funds and payment of the survey fee, Respondent allowed his trust account to reach a negative balance.\r\n\r\n3.  The Arthur H. Wilder, Jr. Matter\r\n\r\nArthur H. Wilder, Jr., the Solicitor for the Third Judicial Circuit, was prosecuting Dean McElveen for rape, kidnapping, and\r\nbuggery, in a case where the alleged victim was McElveen's former wife, Robin McElveen.  Attorney John Miles represented\r\nDean McElveen.  Mr. McElveen had brought contempt charges against Mrs. McElveen in the family court.  She was found in\r\ncontempt and sentenced to pay $500 or serve ninety days in jail.  Respondent telephoned Mr. Miles and told Mr. Miles that he\r\nwas representing Mrs. McElveen.  Respondent stated that the criminal charges against Mr. McElveen would be dropped in\r\nexchange for Mr. McElveen dropping the family court contempt charges and paying Mrs. McElveen $10,000 in cash.  Mr.\r\nMiles requested this demand in writing.  When he did not receive anything in writing, Mr. Miles eventually went to\r\nRespondent's office and asked if he could prepare an affidavit memorializing their telephone conversation.  Respondent agreed\r\nand he and Mr. Miles both signed the resulting affidavit, which attested to the content of the telephone conversation described\r\nabove, and notarized each other's signatures.  At the subsequent family court hearing, Mrs. McElveen appeared represented by\r\nan attorney other than Respondent.  She testified at the hearing that Respondent was not her lawyer, she did not want money,\r\nand she never authorized Respondent to call Mr. Miles.  Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and\r\ninvestigation by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.\r\n\r\n4.  The Annette Briggs Matter\r\n\r\nAnnette Briggs hired Respondent in December of 1996 to represent her concerning a probate court matter.  Opposing counsel\r\nwas John C. Land, III.  Mr. Land represented Respondent in a disciplinary matter.  Ms. Briggs first learned that Mr. Land was\r\nrepresenting Respondent when she read a public reprimand issued to Respondent on September 22, 1997.  At no time did\r\nRespondent disclose to Ms. Briggs that opposing counsel represented him in another matter.  Further, Respondent failed to\r\nrespond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation into this matter.\r\n\r\n5.  The Second James Richard Bryant Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent made payments out of his escrow account on behalf of one client from funds deposited into that account on behalf\r\nof another client or personal funds deposited by himself.  On January 6, 1998, Respondent wrote a check from his escrow\r\naccount to Les Boles, marked \"closing,\" in the amount of $1,121.36.  On the same day, Respondent wrote a check from his\r\nescrow account to Mark McCoy and Beckie McCoy for settlement of a personal injury case in the amount of $2,331.  The\r\nbalance the day before, January 5, was $2,076.04.  The balance on January 7 was $76.04, due to a $2,000 check being written. \r\nOn January 8, Respondent deposited personal funds, drawn upon a personal account shared by Respondent and his mother, in\r\nthe amount of $3,700, less $1,539 cash, for a net deposit of $2,161.  This brought the balance in the escrow account to\r\n$2,237.04 as of January 8, 1998.  On January 9, 1998, the checks to Mr. Boles and the McCoys were posted and returned due to\r\ninsufficient funds.  The posting of these two checks, plus return fees of $23.00 each, brought the balance to -$1,261.32 on\r\nJanuary 9, 1998.  On January 12, 1998, Respondent deposited $6,000, causing the checks to Mr. Boles and the McCoys to clear\r\nand restoring a positive balance.  The source of the $6,000 was a settlement consisting of six checks arising from a personal\r\ninjury case payable to Mark McCoy and Becky Hogue.  Thus, Respondent used the McCoy/Hogue money to pay both the\r\nMcCoy/Hogue claims and the Boles closing.  In addition or in the alternative, Respondent used his own funds to pay these\r\nclaims.  Respondent failed to respond to subsequent inquiries and investigation into this matter.\r\n\r\n6.  The Disciplinary Counsel Matter \r\n\r\nApril Pearson was a foster child living with Sara and Theodis Coulter in Sumter.  She is disabled, with a low I.Q. and classified\r\nas educable retarded.  Lexington County Department of Social Services supervised April Pearson.  In 1984, when April was\r\nabout thirteen years old, she became entitled to $20,882.61 in back payments from the Social Security Administration as a\r\nresult of a class action lawsuit.  Following the directives of her supervisor, Amber McMillan, a social worker with Lexington\r\nCounty DSS, contacted the Coulters for the name of an attorney to establish a trust or similar savings fund in which to deposit\r\nthis money.  The Coulters had used Respondent on two prior occasions, so they recommended him to Ms. McMillan.  Ms.\r\nMcMillan met with Respondent and he prepared a trust document on January 21, 1994, appointing himself Trustee.  \r\n\r\nThe trust document was executed by Ms. McMillan and witnessed by two individuals.  In Article II, Respondent was appointed\r\nTrustee.  In Article IV, the trust principal was identified as the $20,882.61.  Article V of the trust relieved the Trustee from the\r\nprovisions of the \"Uniform Trustee's Accounting Act\" and other such restrictive legislation which may be in effect.  The\r\nUniform Trust Act had not been enacted in South Carolina.  The \"Uniform Trustee's Accounting Act\" did not exist.\r\n\r\nArticle VI of the trust provided that the Trustee could pay himself from the trust such compensation as was usual and\r\nreasonable, and may pay attorney's fees or other expenses incurred.  Other than Article VI of the trust, there was no fee\r\nagreement between Respondent and the Coulters, Ms. McMillan, Lexington County DSS, or South Carolina\r\nDSS.\r\n\r\nLexington County DSS issued a check for $20,882.61 on February 1, 1994 to \"Drexler [sic] Law Firm\" to establish the April\r\nPearson trust account.  Respondent deposited the check into his escrow account and opened a mutual fund on behalf of April\r\nPearson with Washington Mutual Investors Fund in the name of \"Terry A. Trexler, Trustee, April Pearson Trust, DTD\r\n1/31/94.\"  Respondent only deposited $15,000 of the April Pearson money into the trust when he opened it and\r\nmisappropriated the remaining $5,882.61.  \r\n\r\nWithout notice to or knowledge of the Coulters, Amber McMillan, or Lexington County or South Carolina DSS, Respondent\r\nmade a telephone redemption of $5,000 from the mutual fund on February 1, 1995 and deposited the money into his escrow\r\naccount.  Respondent then misappropriated this money, loaning it to a private investigator, Robert Lee Moore.  \r\n\r\nOn July 25, 1995, Respondent wrote himself a check for $285 from his escrow account labeled \"April Pearson\" as a fee.  This\r\nwas done without notice to or knowledge of the Coulters, Amber McMillan, or Lexington County or South Carolina DSS.  If it\r\nwas a fee, Respondent provided no bill, invoice, or statement.\r\n\r\nRespondent unilaterally executed a loan agreement, stating that he would borrow $9,510 from the April Pearson Trust on July\r\n7, 1995 and July 20, 1995.  The document went on to provide that a lump sum payment of $13,000 would be paid back to the\r\ntrust \"during the year 1998.\"  Respondent then withdrew $6,510 on July 7, 1995 and $3,000 on July 20, 1995 from the trust\r\naccount, deposited the funds into his escrow account, and subsequently spent the money.  Respondent did not:  (1) enter into a\r\ntransaction with his client with terms of interest set forth therein, (2) enter into a transaction with his client with terms that were\r\nreasonable and fair to his client, (3) enter into a transaction with his client with terms that were fully disclosed and transmitted\r\nin writing to the client in a manner that could be reasonably understood by the client, (4) give the client a reasonable\r\nopportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction, or (5) require the client to consent in writing to the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nDespite April's mental disability, Respondent did not maintain a normal lawyer-client relationship with her.  He did not seek\r\nthe appointment of a guardian or take other protective action with respect to her regarding the management of the trust, and\r\nspecifically the taking of the $9,510 loan and the $5,000 loaned to the private investigator.\r\n\r\nAlthough the trust was intended primarily for April's future, it was understood that the Coulters could withdraw money from\r\nthe trust for the benefit of April.  On November 17, 1994, the Coulters received $1,777.81 from the trust to purchase a\r\ncomputer for April.  The Coulters also received from Respondent $580 in July 1995 to purchase bedroom furniture for April\r\nand $1,000 in July 1997 for a vacation ($500) and a fee to adopt April ($450).  The adoption did not take place.  In addition,\r\nwhen Mr. Coulter was out of work due to an on-the-job injury, the family requested, and received from Respondent, $1,500 to\r\napply toward family bills.  The checks for $580, $1,000, and $1,500 were not withdrawn from April's trust account, but were\r\ntaken from Respondent's personal funds or law firm funds.\r\n\r\nWhen the investigation into the April Pearson trust began, in September of 1998, the balance in the trust's mutual fund was\r\nonly $790.59.  After Respondent learned about the investigation, he paid $13,000 back into the trust on October 1, 1998.  The\r\n$13,000 check was drawn on a personal account maintained by Respondent and his mother.  Washington Mutual Investors\r\ncalculated that if Respondent had simply deposited the initial $15,000 on May 11, 1994 and taken no withdrawals from that\r\nsum, the value of the fund on October 1, 1998 would have been $34,471.99.  In the alternative, if Respondent had deposited the\r\nentire $20,882.61, taken the withdrawals described above, and deposited the $13,000 on October 1, 1998, the value of the fund\r\non October 1, 1998 would have been $22,885.25.  As an additional alternative, if Respondent had deposited the full $20,882.61\r\non May 11, 1994, together with the deposit of $13,000 on October 1, 1998, and deducted the withdrawals of his loan and the\r\nsums paid to the Coulters, the balance as of October 1, 1998 would have been $34,057.78.  The actual balance on October 1,\r\n1998, after the $13,000 deposit, was $13,105.34.\r\n\r\nRespondent did not respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation into this matter. \r\n\r\n7.  The Fike Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Fike in a civil action against a residential builder and its owners for a fee of about $3,300. \r\nAfter a length of time with minimal action, Respondent failed to respond to Fike's repeated requests for information regarding\r\nthe case.  Fike gave Respondent specific directions as to strategy and decisions about the action, which Respondent refused to\r\nfollow.  Respondent initially misled Fike about the overall conditions and timing of the action, resulting in personal hardship to\r\nFike.  Respondent lacked the requisite legal competence to pursue the action for which Fike hired him.  Respondent delayed\r\nFike's legal action through his deliberate refusal to respond to discovery requests.  Respondent failed to respond to opposing\r\ncounsel, even though documents required for the discovery process were provided to Respondent and were in his possession. \r\nRespondent failed to provide an accounting to Fike for the use of the fees received and the performance of legal services. \r\nRespondent failed to provide Fike any information regarding his practice and availability to continue the action on Fike's\r\nbehalf.  Respondent was placed on interim suspension on October 2, 1998.  Thereafter, he failed to comply with this Court's\r\ndirectives and did not adequately protect Fike's interests.  Fike filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer\r\nConduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n8.  The Brown Matter\r\n\r\nBrown retained Respondent to handle a domestic matter and paid Respondent a $750 fee.  Respondent failed to act with\r\ndiligence and did not communicate with his client about the action.  Respondent gave erroneous advice to Brown and made\r\nmisrepresentations about Brown's rights.  Brown filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n9.  The Callen Matter\r\n\r\nCallen retained Respondent on a child visitation matter and paid Respondent a $1,000 fee.  Respondent failed to act with\r\ndiligence and did not perform the contracted legal services for his client.  Respondent failed to communicate with his client in a\r\ntimely fashion about this action.  Respondent made misrepresentations about both the services performed and the charges being\r\nassessed against Callen's retainer.  Callen filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent\r\nfailed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n10.  The Berry Matter\r\n\r\nBerry retained Respondent in a domestic matter.  Berry filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n11.  The Huff Matter\r\n\r\nHuff retained Respondent in a domestic matter.  Huff filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n12.  The Ervin Matter\r\n\r\nErvin retained Respondent regarding a divorce.  Respondent accepted a $550 fee but performed virtually no legal services for\r\nErvin.  Respondent advised Ervin the action could be completed within sixty days, when he had reason to know the statement\r\nwas false, for reasons including the fact that the opposing party would have to be served by publication.  The client file has\r\nsince been returned to Ervin, but Respondent has made no accounting as to how the fee was earned. \r\n\r\nRespondent was suspended from the practice of law on October 2, 1998, and thereafter became inaccessible to his client.  Ervin\r\nmade many unsuccessful attempts to contact Respondent about her options for alternative representation and retrieval of her\r\nfile.  Respondent's mother directed Ervin to another attorney, who had already received Ervin's file, but without Ervin's\r\npermission and without any consultation to seek Ervin's approval prior to the transfer of her file.  Ervin filed a letter of\r\ncomplaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n13.  The Yates Matter\r\n\r\nYates retained Respondent in a domestic matter and paid Respondent a fee of approximately $650.  Respondent failed to\r\nperform adequate legal services, failed to act diligently, and did not communicate with his client.  Yates filed a letter of\r\ncomplaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n14.  The Wilson Matter\r\n\r\nWilson retained Respondent to seek Social Security benefits and paid Respondent a fee of approximately $500.  Respondent\r\nfailed to act with diligence, did not respond to Wilson's inquiries, and performed inadequate legal services in relation to the\r\nlegal fee charged.  Wilson filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to\r\nrespond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n15.  The Collins Matter\r\n\r\nCollins retained Respondent for a family court matter and paid Respondent a fee of approximately $1,100.  Respondent was\r\nplaced on interim suspension while the matter was pending, but did not provide notice of his suspension to his client.  Collins\r\nattempted to contact Respondent about the family court matter, and finally received a reply from Respondent's mother. \r\nRespondent either directed or caused the transfer of Collins's file to another attorney, without Collins's knowledge,\r\nconsultation, or permission.  Collins filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed\r\nto respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n16.  The Neubert Matter\r\n\r\nNeubert retained Respondent to file suit against a bank, among other matters.  Respondent failed to file the suit in a timely\r\nmanner, causing Neubert's action to be barred by the statute of limitations.  Neubert filed a letter of complaint with the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n17.  The Johnson Matter\r\n\r\nJohnson retained Respondent to file a child custody action on Johnson's behalf.  Johnson filed a letter of complaint with the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n18.  The Harris Matter\r\n\r\nHarris retained Respondent in a domestic matter and paid Respondent fees of approximately $1,500.  Harris filed a letter of\r\ncomplaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n19.  The Stewart Matter\r\n\r\nStewart retained Respondent in a family court matter and paid Respondent fees of approximately $750 plus costs of $130. \r\nStewart filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the\r\nsubsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n20.  The Bryant Matter\r\n\r\nRosa Bryant retained Respondent to get a court date for her and her husband in a grandparent visitation matter and paid\r\nRespondent a legal fee.  No court date was ever provided.  After approximately three months, Respondent summoned the\r\nBryants to his office and told them he had filed a lawsuit on their behalf.  Mrs. Bryant told Respondent that was not what they\r\nhad hired him to do.  Mrs. Bryant later learned that Respondent had copied another attorney's work, hired by Mrs. Bryant's\r\nson.  Respondent never appeared in court at any time on the Bryants' behalf.  Respondent never made any refund or accounting\r\nto the Bryants as to how he applied their attorney's fees.  Bryant filed a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer\r\nConduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n21.  The Solesbee Matter\r\n\r\nSolesbee retained Respondent in a domestic matter and paid Respondent fees of approximately $1,000.  Approximately three\r\nmonths after being retained, Respondent notified Solesbee that another attorney had been associated on the case.  Respondent\r\ndid not consult with, nor request approval from his client prior to this association, nor did Respondent have Solesbee's\r\npermission to engage another attorney.  \r\n\r\nRespondent was unable to timely obtain a hearing on Solesbee's behalf.  Respondent, through his staff, told Solesbee that the\r\nreason for delay was difficulty in serving the pleadings on Solesbee's spouse.  Respondent attended a hearing on this matter,\r\nand at the hearing, improperly prompted Solesbee on the witness stand to agree to certain matters concerning marital debt to\r\nwhich Solesbee had not originally agreed.\r\n\r\nAs the one-year mark approached for a final hearing, Respondent represented to Solesbee that a hearing had been scheduled. \r\nBefore the purportedly scheduled hearing, Respondent was arrested for a criminal violation and placed on interim suspension. \r\nPrior to his suspension, Respondent had never requested a hearing on Solesbee's behalf.  Respondent failed to file the parties'\r\nagreement with the court and took no action to have the agreement approved by the family court.  Solesbee was forced to\r\nobtain other legal counsel to obtain a divorce.  Respondent did not respond to inquiries from Solesbee and provided little\r\nrepresentation to his client.  Following the interim suspension, Respondent did not properly notify Solesbee.  Solesbee filed a\r\nletter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n22.  The Smith Matter \r\n\r\nSmith retained Respondent to pursue an action for grandparent visitation rights.  Respondent explained to Smith that he\r\nrequired payment of approximately $2,000 for fees and an additional $500 to hire a detective.  Respondent failed to hire a\r\nprivate detective and failed to respond to Smith's inquiries regarding the private detective's report.  Instead, Respondent\r\nmisappropriated the money to his own personal use.  \r\n\r\nRespondent failed to provide any substantial legal services to Smith in return for the fees he collected, and failed upon request\r\nto provide an itemized bill for legal services rendered.\r\n\r\nThere was at least one family court hearing scheduled.  Respondent did not contact Smith to prepare for this hearing. \r\nRespondent failed to respond to Smith's inquiries concerning the matter for which he had been retained.  Smith filed a letter of\r\ncomplaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n23.  The Wroble Matter\r\n\r\nWroble, who lived out of state, retained Respondent in a divorce and custody matter and paid Respondent fees of\r\napproximately $3,500, plus an additional $500 to hire a private investigator.  After a period of months, Wroble asked\r\nRespondent for a report on the investigator's findings.  Respondent failed to adequately answer his client's inquires, instead\r\nproviding vague answers, such as that Wroble's \"husband was slick . . .\"  Respondent contacted Wroble to explain that there\r\nhad been a hearing in the matter, that Respondent had been present at the hearing and represented Wroble.  Respondent did not\r\nnotify Wroble of the hearing in advance.  As a result of Respondent's lack of diligence, Wroble did not receive the family\r\ncourt's order directing her to pay child support until she was already in violation of the order.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of representation, Respondent failed to obtain available evidence of prior criminal domestic violence by\r\nWroble's spouse or of Wroble's spouse's adulterous relationship, committed in the presence of Wroble's children.  Respondent\r\nfailed to prepare adequately for trial and used coercive tactics to have Wroble sign an agreement for joint custody of the\r\nchildren.  Respondent failed to adequately protect his client's interests in this agreement.  \r\n\r\nRespondent failed to respond to Wroble's request for an itemized bill.  Wroble filed a letter of complaint with the Commission\r\non Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent inquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\n24.  The Shirah Matter\r\n\r\nShirah retained Respondent to represent her in a divorce case and paid Respondent fees of approximately $1,300 and costs of\r\napproximately $125.  Respondent first notified Shirah about a hearing only a few days prior to its scheduled date.  Respondent\r\nmet with Shirah the morning of the hearing, but then had the hearing continued.  Shirah's spouse requested a second hearing,\r\nand Respondent did not notify his client.  Respondent explained to his client that there had been no hearing on that date, and\r\nthe hearing was in fact scheduled for later in the month.  Prior to the hearing date, Respondent was arrested and placed on\r\ninterim suspension.  Shirah learned of Respondent's arrest through newspaper accounts and attempted without success to find\r\nout about her case by multiple telephone calls to Respondent's family and to the family court.  Shirah learned from the family\r\ncourt that Respondent had never scheduled a hearing, as he had previously represented to her.  Shirah learned from her spouse\r\nthat Respondent had attended a hearing without notifying her.  Respondent failed to provide a copy of the order arising from\r\nthat hearing to his client.  Respondent failed to notify Shirah that the family court had directed her to pay child support; instead,\r\nShirah learned this from her husband.  Respondent failed to notify Shirah that he was placed on interim suspension. \r\nRespondent's mother tried to refer Shirah to another attorney, even setting up an appointment with that attorney, without\r\nknowledge or permission from Shirah.  Shirah's file was provided to that other attorney without Shirah's permission.  Shirah\r\nfiled a letter of complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and Respondent failed to respond to the subsequent\r\ninquiries and investigation.\r\n\r\nThe Panel's Findings (2)\r\n\r\nRegarding all matters, the panel found violations of Rules 7(a) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR: (1) violating a Rule of Professional Conduct; (3) willful failure to appear personally for a Notice to Appear as directed\r\nunder Rule 19(c)(4), willful failure to comply with the subpoena issued under Rule 413, and failure to respond to a lawful\r\ndemand from a disciplinary authority; (5) engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the\r\ncourts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law; and (6) violating the oath of\r\noffice taken upon admission to practice law in this state.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, the panel found with regard to all matters violations of Rule 8.4,\r\nmisconduct, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e).  For all matters, the panel found a failure to act competently (Rule 1.1),\r\nfailure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client (Rule 1.3), failure to keep a client reasonably\r\ninformed about the status of the matter and comply promptly with reasonable requests for information (Rule 1.4), and charging\r\nan unreasonable fee or a fee inconsistent with a previous agreement for the fee (Rule 1.5(a) and (b)).\r\n\r\nSpecifically regarding the Geneva Frances matter, the panel found Respondent misappropriated his client's funds to his own\r\nuse, failed to deliver to his client funds she was entitled to receive, and failed to promptly render a full accounting regarding\r\nproperty (Rule 1.15).  Moreover, Respondent was untruthful in statements to others (Rule 4.1), threatened criminal prosecution\r\n(Rule 4.5), did not act with candor toward a tribunal, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Rule 3.4), and failed to respond to a\r\nlawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority, as well as misleading a disciplinary authority (Rule 8.1(b)). \r\nFurther, by his forgeries, Respondent committed felonies in violation of the criminal laws of South Carolina, a violation of\r\nRule 8.4.\r\n\r\nThe panel found violations of Rule 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.15, and 8.4  with regard to the James Richard Bryant matter, the Arthur H. Wilder, Jr. matter, the Annette Briggs matter, the second James\r\nRichard Bryant matter, the Disciplinary Counsel matter, the Fike matter, the Brown matter, the  Callen matter, the Berry matter, the Huff matter, the Ervin matter, the Yates matter, the Wilson matter, the Collins matter, the\r\nNeubert matter, the Johnson matter, the Stewart matter, the Bryant matter, the Solesbee matter, the Smith matter, the Wroble\r\nmatter, and the Shirah matter.  In addition, the panel found Respondent at the very least attempted to obstruct justice, in\r\nviolation of the criminal law of this state, and in violation of Rule 8.4 in the Arthur H. Wilder, Jr. matter, a violation of Rule\r\n1.15 with regard to the misappropriation of funds due April Pearson in the Disciplinary Counsel matter, and a violation of Rule\r\n4.1, truthfulness in statements to others, in the Shirah matter.  The panel also found repeated failure to respond to demands\r\nfrom disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8.1(b).\r\n\r\nWe concur with the panel's findings.  We have deemed disbarment the appropriate sanction in similar cases involving multiple\r\nacts of misconduct, including criminal violations.  See, e.g.,\r\nIn re Courtney, Op. No. 25200 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 9, 2000)\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 38 at 1); In re Gibbes, 323 S.C. 80, 450 S.E.2d 588 (1994).\r\n\r\nRespondent is disbarred, effective as of the date of this Opinion.  We also order Respondent to make restitution to all injured\r\nparties, including clients, organizations, and the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection and to pay the costs of all these\r\nproceedings.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel shall determine the amount of restitution, with due consideration to the\r\nCircuit Court's findings at Respondent's restitution hearing, and implement a plan for restitution.  Within fifteen days of the\r\ndate of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\nRLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\ns/ Jean H.

Ariail, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:   On May 10, 2000, this Court granted Harry Wesley Lollis' (\"Lollis\") petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\nCourt of Appeals' decision in State v. Lollis, Op. No. 99-UP-488 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 29, 1999).  We reverse.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background \r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 19, 1998, at 9:05 a.m.,the Liberty Fire Department responded to a fire at Lollis' mobile home. Later that day, the South\r\nCarolina Law Enforcement Division (\"SLED\") Arson Hotline received an anonymous tip concerning the fire.  David Tafaoa (\"Agent\r\nTafaoa\"), a SLED arson investigator, investigated the tip and opined the fire was intentionally set.\r\n\r\nAgent Tafaoa's investigation revealed there were two areas of fire origination, the kitchen stove and another unconnected fire in the\r\nhallway.  At the kitchen stove origination site, some type of paper product was rolled and placed between the skillet and the electric coil of\r\nthe stove, and the eye of the skillet was turned to \"high.\"  Agent Tafaoa was further convinced the fire was intentionally set because many\r\npersonal items were missing from the mobile home.  For example, there were nails and screws in the walls, but there was nothing hanging\r\non them or located on the floor beneath them.  Also, a gun rack and a soft gun case were found in the master bedroom, but neither\r\ncontained a gun.  Furthermore, there was nothing in the night stand drawers, there was only one pair of shoes in the closet, and there was\r\nno VCR, even though a VCR cable and a few tapes were found in the mobile home.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the fire, Lollis' common law wife, Tammy Burgess (\"Burgess\"), confessed in a statement to Agent Tafaoa that she was\r\ndepressed about her husband's financial condition and intentionally started the fire by leaving a pan of grease on a hot eye of the stove. \r\nBurgess admitted Lollis was unaware of her plans to burn their home.  She further confessed she took most of their valuables and placed\r\nthem in a storage room they rented five days prior to the fire.  According to Agent Tafaoa, Burgess burned the mobile home so the\r\ninsurance company would pay the mortgage, their largest debt.\r\n\r\nLollis denies he had any involvement with the fire.  He claims he never asked, encouraged, or aided Burgess in the burning of their home.  \r\nAccording to Lollis, he had no reason to burn his home because it was being extensively remodeled when the fire occurred.  Lollis claims\r\nhe placed his personal items in the storage room on the day of the fire because he did not want his valuables ruined by drywall dust while\r\nhe remodeled his home.\r\n\r\nThe State offered no evidence of Lollis' alleged financial trouble.  On cross examination, the State's witness from the finance company\r\ntestified Lollis was current on his mortgage payment at the time of the fire.  Lollis also testified he was current on his accounts to\r\nCommercial Credit, Friendly Loans, State Farm Insurance, and Macy's Credit.\r\n\r\nLollis had an outstanding mortgage at the time of the fire.  In October 1997, Lollis financed his home in order to pay for carpeting,\r\ndelinquent taxes, and other matters.  Because Lollis did not have homeowner's insurance, the finance company required that insurance be\r\nplaced on the home in order to cover its mortgage.  After the fire, the insurance company fully paid Lollis' mortgage.  However, Lollis did\r\nnot receive any money for his personalty destroyed in the fire because the items were not insured.\r\n\r\nAgent Tafaoa was convinced Lollis conspired with his wife to commit arson because Lollis possessed the key to the storage room, which\r\ncontained many of their valuable personal items, when he accompanied Burgess to the law enforcement center.  Lollis was arrested a\r\nweek after the fire and charged with second degree arson.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1998, Lollis was convicted of second degree arson and sentenced to six years incarceration.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the\r\ndecision of the trial court.  State v. Lollis, Op. No. 99-UP-488 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 29, 1999).  The Court of Appeals denied Lollis'\r\nPetition for Rehearing on November 16, 1999.  Lollis now seeks an order reversing the Court of Appeals' decision and vacating his\r\nsentence.  The following issue is before this Court on certiorari:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals err by affirming the trial court's denial of  Lollis' directed verdict motion?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nLollis argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's denial of his directed verdict motion because the State did not\r\npresent substantial circumstantial evidence Lollis was guilty of second degree arson. (1)   We agree.\r\n\r\n  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.  State v.\r\nBurdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999); State v.Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998). A defendant is entitled to a directed\r\nverdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.  State v. Brown, 103 S.C. 437, 88 S.E. 21 (1916).  If there is any\r\ndirect evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must\r\nfind the case was properly submitted to the jury.  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000); State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597,\r\n533 S.E.2d 572 (2000).  Accordingly, a trial judge should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion the\r\naccused is guilty.  State v. Martin, supra; see also State v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. 22, 524 S.E.2d 637 (Ct. App. 1999).  \"Suspicion\" implies a\r\nbelief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.  State v. Hyder, 242 S.C. 372, 131 S.E.2d 96\r\n(1963).\r\n\r\nNo direct evidence was adduced at trial linking Lollis to the fire.  The State's case depended entirely on circumstantial evidence.  When a\r\nmotion for a directed verdict is made in a criminal case where the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence, \"[t]he trial judge is\r\nrequired to submit the case to the jury if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or\r\nfrom which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.\"  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 535 S.E.2d 126 (2000);  see also State v. Stokes,\r\n299 S.C. 483, 484, 386 S.E.2d 241 (1989); State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989); State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89\r\nS.E.2d 924 (1955).  The trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of the evidence, not with its weight. Mitchell, 341 S.C.\r\nat 406, 535 S.E.2d at 127 (citing Edwards, supra).\r\n\r\nThe circumstantial evidence relied upon by the State is not substantial and merely raises a suspicion of guilt.  The key pieces of\r\ncircumstantial evidence relied upon by the State are: (1) the marital relationship between Burgess and Lollis; (2) Lollis' alleged financial\r\ntrouble; (3) his placement of valuables in the storage room; and (4) his possession of the storage key on the day of the fire. According to the\r\ntrial judge, Lollis' possession of the storage key is the most significant piece of circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that there's some substantial circumstantial evidence or sufficient circumstantial evidence, taking everything in the light most\r\nfavorable to the State, the things that you mentioned, the relationship, the fact that he owned the property.  But I think one of the\r\nstrongest things, facts, is that I think I heard testimony that Mr. Lollis had the keys to the storage locker in his pocket where all the stuff\r\nthat was taken from the house was stored.  And I think that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence.  I'd be required to submit it to the\r\njury for their determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nEven viewing the circumstantial evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence presented does not reasonably tend to\r\nprove Lollis' guilt.  First, Burgess admitted to starting the fire without assistance from Lollis, and without his knowledge. The State\r\npresented no evidence of an agreement between them.  Second, the State presented no evidence of Lollis' alleged financial trouble.  To the\r\ncontrary, Lollis' testimony he was current on his debts at the time of the fire was uncontradicted.  The State's witness from the finance\r\ncompany also testified Lollis was current on his mortgage payments.  Furthermore, Lollis did not have insurance on his personal property\r\nlost in the fire.  Finally, Lollis presented a plausible explanation for placing valuables in the storage room on the day of the fire - he was\r\ntrying to protect them from drywall dust as he remodeled his home.\r\n\r\nLollis' mere possession of a storage key is not substantial circumstantial evidence he asked, aided, or procured Burgess to burn the\r\ndwelling.  The possession of the key only indicates Lollis had access to the storage room on the day of the fire, it in no way demonstrates\r\nhe aided Burgess with the fire.  Lollis fully admits he was visiting the storage room when the fire occurred that morning. However, placing\r\nvaluables in a storage room, without any other evidence linking him to the fire, does not indicate he aided his wife in destroying their\r\nhome, especially when he offered a valid reason for placing the items in storage, and Burgess confessed she acted alone. Therefore, the\r\npossession of the key does nothing more than arouse suspicion of Lollis' guilt, and is an improper basis to deny a motion for directed\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nFinally, in similar arson cases relying on circumstantial evidence, appellate courts have affirmed denials of directed verdict motions when\r\nthere is clear circumstantial evidence of financial trouble, such as a pending foreclosure proceeding or a significant change in an insurance\r\npolicy prior to the fire.  The instant case does not contain the same quantum of evidence because the State presented no evidence of Lollis'\r\nfinancial difficulty, and no evidence Lollis would receive some financial gain as a result of the fire.  See State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 468\r\nS.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1996) (directed verdict motion denied where there was evidence the fire was intentionally set, defendant purchased\r\n$25,000 homeowners' insurance two weeks prior to fire, and defendant provided his insurer with false information concerning his losses);\r\nCarter v. Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 218, 375 S.E.2d 356 (Ct. App. 1988) (trial judge correctly denied motion for directed verdict\r\nwhere there was evidence of defendant's financial difficulties, two mortgages on home, outstanding federal and state tax liens, and trouble\r\npaying credit card accounts); see also State v. Chisholm, 187 S.C. 275, 197 S.E. 308 (1938) (arson conviction affirmed where there was\r\ncircumstantial evidence of a mortgage on the house, commencement of a foreclosure proceeding prior to the fire, and changes in insurance\r\ncoverage by defendant's mother to include all personalty).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the Court of Appeals' decision.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Second degree arson is defined as:\r\n\r\n\r\nA person who wilfully and maliciously causes an explosion, sets fire to, burns, or causes to be burned or aids, counsels, or procures the\r\nburning of a dwelling house, church or place of worship, a public or private school facility, a manufacturing plant or warehouse, a building\r\nwhere business is conducted, an institutional facility, or any structure designed for human occupancy to include local and municipal\r\nbuildings, whether the property of himself or another, is guilty of arson in the second degree and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned not\r\nless than five nor more than twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C.

Conits, of\r\nGreenville, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' opinion in Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Systems, 338 S.C. 572, 527\r\nS.E.2d 371 (Ct. App. 2000).  We affirm in result, as modified.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a case in which respondents, minority shareholders in a closely held family corporation, claim the majority shareholders have acted in a manner which is\r\nfraudulent, oppressive and unfairly prejudicial. (1)  They seek a buyout of their shares under South Carolina's judicial dissolution statutes.   A rather detailed\r\nrecitation of the facts is necessary to an understanding of the plaintiffs' claims.  \r\n\r\nRespondents are 72-year-old John Kiriakides and his 74-year-old sister Louise Kiriakides.  John and Louise are the minority shareholders in the family\r\nbusiness, Atlas Food Systems &amp; Services, Inc. (Atlas).  Petitioners are their older brother, 88-year-old Alex Kiriakides, Jr., and the family business and its\r\nsubsidiaries, Marica Enterprises, Ltd. (MEL), (2) and Marica, Inc. (Marica). (3)  \r\n\r\nAtlas is a food vending service which provides refreshments to factories and other businesses. The business began prior to World War II but slowed down while\r\nAlex was away during the war.  After the war, Alex, John, and their father Alex, Sr., began working together to build the family business. (4)  Alex, Sr. died in\r\n1949.  Atlas was incorporated in 1956.  Currently, Alex is the majority stockholder, owning 57.68%; John owns 37.7%, and Louise owns 3%.\r\n\r\nThroughout Atlas' history, Alex has been in charge of the financial and corporate affairs of the family business; he has had overall control and is Chairman of\r\nthe Board of Directors.  John is also on the three member Board.  In 1986, John became President of Atlas, after years of running client relations and field\r\noperations.  Two of Alex' children are also employed by Atlas, his son Alex III, and his daughter Mary Ann. (5)  Alex III is (since John's departure as discussed\r\nbelow) President and is on the Board;  Mary Ann is a CPA who performs accounting and financial functions; their brother Michael worked for Atlas in the past,\r\nbut is no longer employed there. (6)  \r\n\r\nFor years, Atlas operated as a prototypical closely held family corporation. Troubles developed, however, in 1995, when a rift began between Alex and John. \r\nThe initial dispute arose over property owned by John and Alex in Greenville.  Alex convinced John to transfer his interest in the property to his son Alex III for\r\na price less than it was worth.  John signed the deed prepared by Alex believing he was conveying only a small portion of his interest in the property to Alex III. \r\nAfter discovering his entire interest had been transferred to Alex III, John became distrustful of Alex and began requesting documents and records concerning\r\nthe family business.  The relationship between the two became very strained. (7)  Several subsequent incidents served to heighten the tension.\r\n\r\nIn December 1995, the Board and shareholders of Atlas decided to convert Atlas from a subchapter C corporation to a subchapter S corporation.  However, in\r\nMarch 1996, Alex, without bringing a vote, unilaterally determined the company would remain a C corporation.  Later, in mid-1996, a dispute arose over Atlas'\r\ncontract to purchase a piece of commercial property.  Notwithstanding the contract, John, Alex III and William Freitag (Senior Vice President of Finance and\r\nAdministration) decided not to go through with the sale.  Alex however, without consulting or advising John, elected to go through with the sale.  When John\r\nlearned of Alex' decision, he became extremely upset and allegedly advised Alex III he was quitting his job as President. (8)  The next day, Alex III made plans\r\nwith managers to continue operations in John's absence; John, however, went to the Atlas office in Greenville and visited Atlas offices in Columbia,\r\nOrangeburg and Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe following Monday, John went to work at Atlas doing \"business as usual.\"  He was told later that day (by Alex' son Michael) that management was\r\nplanning John would no longer be President of Atlas.  John circulated a memo indicating he intended to remain President; Alex III replied in a memo prepared\r\nwith the aid of his father, refusing to allow John to continue as president of the company.  The following day, Alex refused to allow John to stay on as president\r\nof Atlas, and designated Alex III as President. John was offered, but refused a position as a consultant.\r\n\r\nIn September 1996, Atlas offered to purchase John's interest in Atlas, MEL and K Enterprises, (9) for one million dollars, plus the cancellation of $800,000\r\nobligations owed by John.  John refused this offer, believing it too low. (10)  John filed this suit in November 1996, seeking to obtain corporate records.  The\r\ncomplaint was subsequently amended, naming Louise as a plaintiff , and adding claims for fraud under the judicial dissolution statute.  The  complaint sought\r\nan accounting, a buyout of John and Louise's shares, and damages for fraud.  The trial was bifurcated on the issues of liability and damages.\r\n\r\nAfter a five day hearing, the referee found Alex had engaged in fraud in numerous respects, and found Atlas had engaged in conduct which was fraudulent,\r\noppressive and unfairly prejudicial toward John and Louise.  The referee held a buyout was the appropriate remedy under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-300(2)(ii)\r\nand Â§ 33-14-310(d)(4). (11)  The referee found that, at the bifurcated damages hearing, it would be determined whether John and Louise had suffered any\r\ndamages from the fraud in this regard. (12)  The Court of Appeals affirmed in result.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Did the Court of Appeals apply the correct standard of review to the referee's findings of fraud?\r\n\r\n2.  Did the Court of Appeals properly affirm the referee's finding that 21% of the Marica stock had been transferred to K Enterprises?\r\n\r\n3.  Did the referee properly find Atlas had engaged in oppressive behavior under the South Carolina judicial dissolution statute? \r\n\r\n\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  STANDARD OF REVIEW / FINDINGS OF FRAUD\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlas contends the Court of Appeals applied an improper standard of review to the referee's findings of fraud.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nAn appellate court's scope of review in cases of fraud, where the proof must be by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, is limited to determining whether\r\nthere is any evidence reasonably supporting the circuit court's findings.  Burns v. Wannamaker, 286 S.C. 336, 333 S.E.2d 358 (Ct. App.1985) aff'd as modified\r\n288 S.C. 398, 343 S.E.2d 27 (1986).  See&nbsp;also Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976) (in an action at law tried\r\nwithout a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports them).  Cf. Cook v.\r\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Co., 186 S.C. 77, 194 S.E. 636 (1938) (in law action for fraud and deceit, the question of fraud was for the trier of fact if more than\r\none reasonable inference could be drawn from the evidence).   It is not for the appellate court to weigh the evidence to determine whether it is sufficient to meet\r\nthe burden of proof.  5A C.J.S. Appeal &amp; Error Â§ 1656(2) n. 71 at 447 (1958).  See Southeastern PVC Pipe, Mfg. v. Rothrock Construction Co., 280 S.C. 498,\r\n313 S.E.2d 50 (Ct App. 1984).  \r\n\r\nAlex challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that he committed fraud regarding the transfer of the 21% of Marica stock, Louise's ownership of 271 shares of\r\nAtlas stock, and the handling of Louise's 1990 distribution. \r\n\r\nContrary to Alex' contention, it is not the province of this Court to re-weigh the evidence to determine whether it is clear, cogent and convincing but, rather, we\r\nmust determine whether there is evidence supporting the lower court's findings.  We find evidentiary support in the record for each of the referee's findings of\r\nfraud. Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, supra; Burns v. Wannamaker, supra.  Accordingly, the referee's findings of fraud are affirmed. (13)    \r\n\r\n2.  TRANSFER OF MARICA STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlas contends the referee erred in finding  21% of Marica (14) stock was transferred to K Enterprises; it  claims John and Louise have no standing to challenge\r\nthe transfer, and the referee had no jurisdiction to find the stock was transferred as K Enterprises is not a party to the action.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nCiting Todd v. Zaldo, 304 S.C. 275, 403 S.E.2d 666 (Ct. App. 1991), Atlas contends John and Louise have no standing as a cause of action for recovery of\r\ncorporate assets belongs to the corporation, not the individual shareholders.  As noted by the Court of Appeals, however, K Enterprises is a partnership, not a\r\ncorporation, such that Todd v. Zaldo is inapplicable. (15)  We find John and Louise clearly have standing to contest the improper attribution of the 21% stock to\r\nAlex III and Michael.\r\n\r\nAtlas also asserts the referee was without jurisdiction to make a finding regarding the ownership of K Enterprises because a) Alex III and Michael were\r\nnecessary parties, and b) K Enterprises may not legally hold stock under the terms of the partnership agreement.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAlex III and Michael were not necessary parties because John and Louise did not seek any remedy against them; they merely sought damages from Atlas and\r\nAlex for the fraudulent transfer of the shares.  Moreover, Alex III and Michael were originally parties but were dismissed by consent of all parties.  See Rule\r\n12(h)(2), SCRCP (defense of failure to join indispensable parties is waived if not raised at trial).  Finally, Atlas' claim that K Enterprises may not legally hold\r\nstock is without merit.  Contrary to Atlas' contention, nothing in the partnership agreement prohibits K Enterprises from holding stock; it specifically permits\r\nthat the partnership may undertake any additional activities as decided by a majority interest.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the referee properly found the 21% of Marica stock,  which was being improperly attributed to Alex' children, was actually transferred to K\r\nEnterprises.\r\n\r\n3. BUYOUT DUE TO OPPRESSIVE CONDUCT\r\n\r\n\r\na.  Oppression Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-300\r\n\r\n\r\nThe referee found that, taken together, the majority's actions were \"illegal, fraudulent, oppressive or unfairly prejudicial,\" justifying a buyout of John and\r\nLouise's interests under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-300(2)(ii) and Â§ 33-14-310(d)(4). (16)  Accordingly, the referee held a buyout was in order under S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 33-14-300(2)(ii) and 33-14-310(d)4).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the referee's holdings.  In making this ruling, the Court of Appeals defined the statutory terms \"oppressive\" and \"unfairly\r\nprejudicial\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) A visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of fair play on which every shareholder who entrusts his money to a company is entitled\r\nto rely; or\r\n\r\n2) A breach of the fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing; or\r\n\r\n3) Whether the reasonable expectations of the minority shareholders have been frustrated by the actions of the majority; or\r\n\r\n4) A lack of probity and fair dealing in the affairs of a company to the prejudice of some of its members; or\r\n\r\n5) A deprivation by majority shareholders of participation in management by minority shareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlas contends the Court of Appeals' definitions of oppressive, unfairly prejudicial conduct are beyond the scope of our judicial dissolution statute.  We agree. \r\nIn our view, the Court of Appeals' broad view of oppression is contrary to the legislative intent and is an unwarranted expansion of section 33-14-300.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's judicial dissolution statute was amended in 1963 in recognition of the growing trend toward protecting minority shareholders from abuses by\r\nthose in the majority.  Section Â§ 33-14-300(2)(ii) now permits a court to order dissolution if it is established by a shareholder that \"the directors or those in\r\ncontrol of the corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, fraudulent, oppressive, or unfairly prejudicial either to the corporation or\r\nto any shareholder (whether in his capacity as a shareholder, director, or officer of the corporation).\" (17)  The official comment to section 33-14-300 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of these grounds for dissolution to specific circumstances obviously involves judicial discretion in the application of a general standard to\r\nconcrete circumstances.  The court should be cautious in the application of these grounds so as to limit them to genuine abuse rather than instances of\r\nacceptable tactics in a power struggle for control of a corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 33-14-300 cmt. 2(b).  Although the terms \"oppressive\" and \"unfairly prejudicial\" are not defined in section 33-14-300, the comment to S.C.Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 33-18-400 (1990), which allows shareholders in a statutory close corporation to petition for relief on the grounds of oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly\r\nprejudicial conduct provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to define oppression, fraud, or unfairly\r\nprejudicial conduct.  These are elastic terms whose meaning varies with  the circumstances presented in a particular case, and it is felt that existing case law\r\nprovides sufficient guidelines for courts and litigants. (18) \r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the Legislature's deliberate exclusion of a set definition of oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct, we find the Court of Appeals' enunciation of rigid\r\ntests is contrary to the legislative intent.  \r\n\r\nUnder the Court of Appeals' holding, a finding of fraudulent/oppressive conduct may be based upon any one of its alternative definitions.  We do not believe\r\nthe Legislature intended such a result.  In particular, we do not believe the Legislature intended a court to judicially order a corporate dissolution solely upon the\r\nbasis that a party's \"reasonable expectations\" have been frustrated by majority shareholders.  To examine the \"reasonable expectations\" of minority\r\nshareholders would require the courts of this state to microscopically examine the dealings of closely held family corporations, the intentions of majority and\r\nminority stockholders in forming the corporation and thereafter, the history of family dealings, and the like.  We do not believe the Legislature, in enacting\r\nsection 33-14-300, intended such judicial interference in the business philosophies and day to day operating practices of family businesses. \r\n\r\nIn adopting the \"reasonable expectations\" approach, the Court of Appeals cited the North Carolina case of Meiselman v. Meiselman, 307 S.E.2d 551 (N.C.\r\n1983). (19)  In Meiselman, a minority shareholder in a family-owned close corporation was \"frozen out\" of the family corporation in much the same fashion as\r\nJohn and Louise claim they have been frozen out of Atlas.  The minority shareholder brought an action requesting a buyout of his interests under N.C.G.S. Â§ 55-125.1(a)(4), which permits a North Carolina court to liquidate assets when it is \"reasonably necessary for the protection of the rights or interests of the\r\ncomplaining shareholders.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  \r\n\r\nIn holding the minority shareholder was entitled to relief, the Meiselman court noted that the trial court had focused on the conduct of the majority shareholder,\r\nusing standards of \"oppression,\" \"overreaching,\" \"unfair advantage,\" and the like.  307 S.E.2d at 567.  The Court found this was error because the North\r\nCarolina statute in question required the trial court to focus on the plaintiff's \"rights and interests\"- his \"reasonable expectations\"- in the corporate defendants,\r\nand determine whether those rights or interests were in need of protection.  Id. (20)  The focus in Meiselman, based upon the language of the North Carolina\r\nstatute, was upon the interests of the minority shareholder, as opposed to the conduct of the majority. \r\n\r\nUnlike the North Carolina statute in Meiselman, section 33-14-300 does not place the focus upon the \"rights or interests\" of the complaining shareholder but,\r\nrather, specifically places the focus upon the actions of the majority, i.e., whether they \"have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, fraudulent,\r\noppressive, or unfairly prejudicial either to the corporation or to any shareholder.\"  Given the language of our statute, a \"reasonable expectations\" approach is\r\nsimply inconsistent with our statute.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that a number of leading authorities, such as Dean Haynsworth, advocate a \"reasonable expectations\" approach to oppressive conduct:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third definition of oppression, initially derived from English case law and long advocated by close corporation experts like Dean F. Hodge O'Neal, is\r\nconduct which frustrates the reasonable expectations of the investors. . . . It has gained widespread acceptance in recent years, particularly in cases\r\ninvolving close corporations where all the shareholders expect to be employed by the corporation and to be actively involved in its management and one of the\r\nshareholders is fired and then 'frozen out' from any compensation or participation in management.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarry J. Haynsworth, Special Problems of Closely Held Corporations, C688 ALI-ABA 1, 53 (1991)(emphasis supplied; internal citations omitted).  \r\n\r\nAlthough several jurisdictions have adopted \"reasonable expectations\" as a guide to the meaning of \"oppression,\" (21) it has been noted by one commentator that\r\n\"no court has adopted the reasonable expectations test without the assistance of a statute.\"  Ralph A. Peeples, The Use and Misuse of the Business Judgment\r\nRule in the Close Corporation, 60 Notre Dame L. Rev. 456, 505 (1985) (hereinafter Peeples). (22)  One criticism of the \"reasonable expectations\" approach is that\r\nit \"ignores the expectations of the parties other than the dissatisfied shareholder.\"  See Lerner v. Lerner Corp., 750 A.2d 709, 722  (Md. 2000) (citing Robert W.\r\nHillman, The Dissatisfied Participant in the Solvent Business Venture: A Consideration of the Relevant Permanence of Partnerships and Close Corporations.,\r\n67 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 75-78 (1982)).  One recent commentator has suggested that a pure \"reasonable expectations\" approach overprotects the minority's interests. \r\nDouglas K. Moll, Shareholder Oppression in Close Corporations: The Unanswered Question of Perspective, 53 Vand. L. Rev. 749, 826 (April 2000)(hereinafter\r\nMoll).  Similarly, it has been suggested that the reasonable expectations approach is \"based on false premises, invites fraud, and is an unnecessary invasion of\r\nthe rights of the majority.\"  J.C. Bruno, Reasonable Expectations:- A Primer on An Oppressive Standard, 71 Mich. B. J. 434 (May 1992). (23)  See&nbsp;also Sandra\r\nK. Miller, How Should U.K. and U.S. Minority Shareholder Remedies for Unfairly Prejudicial or Oppressive Conduct Be Reformed?, 36 Am. Bus. L.J. 579,\r\n632 (Summer 1999)(suggesting the \"vague and uncertain reasonable expectation test undermines the institution of stare decisis and fails to foster judicial\r\naccountability.\").  \r\n\r\nWe find adoption of the \"reasonable expectations\" standard is inconsistent with section 33-14-300, which places an emphasis not upon the minority's\r\nexpectations but, rather, on the actions of the majority.  We decline to adopt such an expansive approach to oppressive conduct in the absence of a legislative\r\nmandate. (24)  We find, consistent with the Legislature's comment to section 33-18-400, that the terms \"oppressive\" and \"unfairly prejudicial\" are elastic terms\r\nwhose meaning varies with the circumstances presented in a particular case.  As noted by one commentator:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile business corporation statutes may attempt to provide certainty and clarity in the law to enhance the attractiveness of doing business, the definition of\r\noppression has been left to judicial construction on a case-by-case basis. Such an approach has been suggested by the Model Close Corporation Supplement\r\nwhich expressly indicates that no attempt has been made to statutorily define oppression, fraud or prejudicial conduct, leaving these \"elastic terms\" to judicial\r\ninterpretation. . . .  The judicial construction of the definition of oppressive conduct is well-suited to the diversified, fact-specific disputes among shareholders\r\nof closely-held corporations. However, the judicial development of a meaningful standard for defining oppressive conduct, apart from fraud or mismanagement,\r\nis a difficult task. \r\n\r\n\r\nSandra K. Miller, Should the Definition of Oppressive Conduct by the Majority Shareholders Exclude a Consideration of Ethical Conduct And Business\r\nPurpose, 97 Dick. L. Rev. 227, 229-230 (Winter 1993).  We find a case-by-case analysis, supplemented by  various factors which may be indicative of\r\noppressive behavior, to be the proper inquiry under S.C. Code Â§ 33-14-300. (25)  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' opinion is modified to the extent it adopted a\r\n\"reasonable expectations\" approach. \r\n\r\nb.  Oppression Under Circumstances of This Case\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question remains whether the conduct of Atlas toward John and Louise was \"oppressive\" and \"unfairly prejudicial\" under the factual circumstances\r\npresented.  We find this case presents a classic example of a majority \"freeze-out,\" and that the referee properly found Atlas had engaged in conduct which was\r\nfraudulent, oppressive and unfairly prejudicial.  Accordingly, the referee properly ordered a buyout of their shares pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-310(d)(4).\r\n\r\nThe particular problems encountered by those in the close corporation setting was noted in Meiselman, 307 S.E.2d at 559 (citing J.A.C. Hetherington, Special\r\nCharacteristics, Problems, and Needs of the Close Corporation, 1969 U.Ill.L.F. 1, 21 (1969)):\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right of the majority to control the enterprise achieves a meaning and has an impact in close corporations that it has in no other major form of business\r\norganization under our law.  Only in the close corporation does the power to manage carry with it the de facto power to allocate the benefits of ownership\r\narbitrarily among the shareholders and to discriminate against a minority whose investment is imprisoned in the enterprise.  The essential basis of this power in\r\nthe close corporation is the inability of those so excluded from the benefits of proprietorship to withdraw their investment at will. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis unequal balance of power often leads to  a \"squeeze out\" or \"freeze out\" \r\n(26) of the minority by the majority shareholders.  See F. Hodge O'Neal, Oppression\r\nof Minority Shareholders: Protecting Minority Rights, 35 Clev. St. L. Rev. 121, 125 (1986/1987) (hereinafter O'Neal's Oppression); Anthony and Borass,\r\nBetrayed, Belittled . . . But Triumphant: Claims of Shareholders in Closely Held Corporations, 22 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 1173, 1175 (1996).  In the close\r\ncorporation, a shareholder \r\n\r\n\r\n[F]aces a potential danger the shareholder of a public corporation generally avoids - the possibility of harm to the fair value of the shareholder's investment.  At\r\nits extreme, this harm manifests itself as the classic freeze out where the minority shareholder faces a trapped investment and an indefinite exclusion form\r\nparticipation in business returns.  The position of the close corporation shareholder, therefore, is uniquely precarious. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoll, 53 Vand. L. Rev. at 790-91.  Common freeze out techniques include the termination of a minority shareholder's employment, the refusal to declare\r\ndividends,  (27) the removal of a minority shareholder from a position of management, and the siphoning off of corporate earnings through high compensation to\r\nthe majority shareholder.  Often, these tactics are used in combination. \r\n(28)  Moll, 53 Vand. L. Rev. at 757-758.  In a public corporation, the minority shareholder\r\ncan escape such abuses by selling his shares; there is no such market, however, for the stock of a close corporation.  Id. \r\n(29)  \"The primary vulnerability of a\r\nminority shareholder is the specter of being 'locked in,' that is, having a perpetual investment in an entity without any expectation of ever receiving a return on\r\nthat investment.\"  Charles Murdock, The Evolution of Effective Remedies for Minority Shareholders and Its Impact Upon Valuation of Minority Shares, 65\r\nNotre Dame L. Rev. 425, 477 (1990).  \r\n\r\nThe present case presents a classic situation of minority \"freeze out.\"  The referee considered the following factors: 1) Alex' unilateral action to deprive Louise\r\nof the benefits of ownership in her shares in Atlas, and subsequent reduction in her distributions based upon the reduced number of shares, \r\n(30) 2) Alex' conduct\r\nin depriving John and Louise of the 21% interest of Marica stock, 3) the fact that there is no prospect of John and Louise receiving any financial benefit from\r\ntheir ownership of Atlas shares,  (31) 4) the fact that Alex and his family continue to receive substantial benefit from their ownership in Atlas, 5) the fact that Atlas\r\nhas substantial cash and liquid assets, very little debt and that, notwithstanding its ability to declare dividends, it has indicated it would not do so in the\r\nforeseeable future, 6) the fact that Alex, majority shareholder in total control of Atlas, is totally estranged from John and Louise, 7) Atlas' extremely low buyout\r\noffers to John and Louise, and 8) the fact that Atlas is not appropriate for a public stock offering at the present time. \r\n(32)\r\n\r\nThese factors, when coupled with the referee's findings of fraud, present a textbook example of a \"freeze out\" situation.  Short of a buyout of their shares, it is\r\nunlikely John and Louise will ever receive any benefit from their ownership interests in Atlas.  We find the referee properly concluded the totality of the\r\ncircumstances demonstrated that the majority had acted \"oppressively\" and \"unfairly prejudicially\" to John and Louise.  Accordingly, we affirm the referee's\r\nfinding that a buyout of John and Louise's shares is the appropriate remedy under the circumstances of this case.\r\n\r\nWe are constrained to note that this case cries out for settlement between the parties.  In fact, both parties conceded both in brief and at oral argument before\r\nthis Court that a buyout is in order; it is at this point simply a matter of price.  It is patent from the record before us that Atlas has an abundance of cash and\r\nliquid assets which would permit a buyout.  Given the parties' ages and the need for a resolution of this matter, we simply cannot fathom why an amicable\r\nsettlement cannot be reached between the parties.  \r\n\r\n CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina's judicial dissolution statute, the Court of Appeals erred in attempting to define oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct.  Further, we\r\nreject the \"reasonable expectations\" approach adopted by the Court of Appeals.  Under section 33-14-300, the proper focus is not on the reasonable\r\nexpectations of the minority but, rather, on the conduct of the majority.  Such an inquiry is to be performed on a case-by-case basis, with an inquiry of all the\r\ncircumstances and an examination of the many factors hereinabove recited.  We believe such an inquiry is in keeping with the Legislature's intention in\r\nenacting sections 33-14-300 and 33-14-310.\r\n\r\nUnder the factual circumstances presented here, we find the majority's conduct clearly constitutes oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct entitling John and\r\nLouise to a buyout of their shares.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' opinion is affirmed in result as modified and the case remanded to the referee to\r\ndetermine a valuation of the John and Louise's shares, and to ascertain any damages suffered as a result of Alex' fraud. \r\n(33)\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justices Henry F. Floyd and George T. Gregory, Jr., concur. \r\n1.   See&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 33-14-300 &amp; 33-14-310 (1990). \r\n2.   MEL is a limited partnership used for estate planning.\r\n3.   Marica is a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas and is primarily an investment arm of the corporation.\r\n4.   There is much dispute between the parties as to who did precisely what, but these matters are not dispositive of the issues on appeal.  Suffice to say that, by\r\nthe 1950's, Alex, John and their brother George, now deceased, were operating the family business.\r\n5.   Neither John nor Louise have any children; Alex has four children: Alex III, Michael, Mary Ann and Cathryn.\r\n6.   Louise worked for several years in the counting room but has not worked for the company since the 1970's.  She served as Secretary until 1988.  \r\n7.   Alex ultimately entered into an exchange of properties to settle this dispute, and John signed a release.    This incident, therefore, was not relied upon by the\r\nreferee with regard to his findings of fraud or his buyout order.  Although this incident is not an issue before this Court, it is conveyed to relate the factual\r\nbackground giving rise to the parties' dispute.  \r\n8.   The referee found John subsequently made it clear he had no intentions of quitting.\r\n9.   K Enterprises is a general partnership created in 1982 to invest profits in government exempt bonds.  It is owned by Alex (49%), John (32%), Alex III\r\n(12%), and Louise (7%). \r\n10.   In March, 1998, Atlas offered to buy the interests of John and Louise for four million dollars, less obligations of $825,000.  John was advised by a tax\r\nattorney in 1995 that his stock in Atlas was worth about ten million dollars.\r\n11.   Section 33-14-310(d)(4) permits a court to order a buyout of shares rather than dissolving the corporation.\r\n12.   The referee also ordered an accounting a) with respect to distributions made to Louise based upon her ownership of 271 shares of stock when she, in fact,\r\nowns 301 shares, and b) with respect to 21% of Marica stock, the ownership of which Alex caused to be attributed to his sons when, in fact, it was transferred to\r\nK Enterprises.  The referee held John and Louise are entitled to an accounting for distributions made to shareholders in 1988 and thereafter, and for payments to\r\nMarica shareholders in 1986 and thereafter, and for any payments in connection with the note signed by Michael and Alex III.  To the extent the Court of\r\nAppeals' opinion may be read as ordering a broader accounting than that ordered by the referee, its opinion is modified.  \r\n13.   For a more detailed analysis of the fraud issues, the reader is referred to the Court of Appeals' opinion at 338 S.C. at 585-591, 527 S.E.2d at 376-81.  We\r\nconcur with the Court of Appeals' treatment of the fraud issues.\r\n14.   In 1986, Atlas changed from a subchapter C corporation to a subchapter S corporation, necessitating a transfer, for tax purposes, of 21% of its ownership of\r\nMarica.  At trial, Atlas' records attributed this 21% ownership change as going to Alex III and Michael.  John and Louise contended they neither consented to\r\nnor had knowledge of this transfer.  The referee found that Alex had fraudulently caused the 21% to be attributed to Alex III and Michael when, in fact, it had\r\nbeen transferred to K Enterprises.\r\n15.   Moreover, even if Todd were applicable, John and Louise have standing to assert the loss of their personal percentage of partnership assets in K Enterprises\r\nas a result of the stock being attributed to Alex III and Michael.  Todd (individual stockholder may bring an action for loss of his personal assets). \r\n16.   Section 33-14-300(2)(ii) permits a court to order dissolution if it is established by a shareholder that \"the directors or those in control of the corporation\r\nhave acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, fraudulent, oppressive, or unfairly prejudicial either to the corporation or to any shareholder\r\n(whether in his capacity as a shareholder, director, or officer of the corporation).\"   Section Â§ 33-14-310(d)(4) permits a court to make such order or grant such\r\nrelief, other than dissolution, as in its discretion is appropriate, including providing for the purchase at their fair value of shares of any shareholder, either by the\r\ncorporation or by other shareholders.\r\n17.   Prior to 1963, dissolution could be based only upon illegal, fraudulent or oppressive conduct.  In an attempt to afford minority shareholders greater\r\nprotection, the legislature amended the statute in 1963 to include \"unfairly prejudicial\" conduct.  See 1963 S.C. Acts 282 Â§ 89; S.C. Code Â§ 12-22.15(a)(4)(1970).  The statute, as amended, \"broadens the scope of actionable conduct by providing the frozen-out minority shareholder a right of action based\r\non conduct by the majority shareholders which might not rise to the level of fraud.\"  Joshua Henderson, Buyout Remedy for Oppressed Minority Shareholders,\r\n47 S.C. L. Rev. 195, 199 (Autumn 1995) (hereinafter Henderson).  This trend arose due to the nationwide epidemic of unfair treatment of minority\r\nshareholders.  See Harry J. Haynsworth, The Effectiveness of Involuntary Dissolution Suits as a Remedy for Close Corporation Dissension, 35 Clev. St. L. Rev.\r\n25 (1986-87); F.H. O'Neal, Oppression of Minority Stockholders:  Protecting Minority Rights, 35 Clev. St. L. Rev. 121 (1986-87).   In the latter article, Prof.\r\nO'Neal observed:\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfair treatment of holders of minority interests in family companies and other closely held corporations by persons in control of those corporations is so\r\nwidespread that it is a national business scandal.  \r\n\r\nThe amount of litigation growing out of minority shareholder oppression--actual, fancied or fabricated--has grown tremendously in recent years, and the flood\r\nof litigation shows no sign of abating. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 121.\r\n18.   The courts of this state have only peripherally addressed the meaning of \"oppressive\" or \"unfairly prejudicial\" conduct.  In one of the earliest cases, Towles\r\nv. S.C. Produce Ass'n, 187 S.C. 290, 197 S.E. 305 (1908), the Court found the failure to pay dividends for three years did not warrant dissolution under the\r\nstatute since the lack of dividends had been in an attempt to rehabilitate a weak financial corporation.  The Towles court noted, however, \"this statute was\r\nintended to afford minority stockholders a method of relief against mismanagement of a corporation by majority stockholders, or the suspension of dividends\r\nfor the purpose of freezing out minority stockholders, or depressing the market value of the stock of the corporation. . .\"  187 S.C. at 295, 197 S.E. at 307.  In\r\nSegall v. Shore, 269 S.C. 31, 236 S.E.2d 316 (1977), the defendants had misappropriated over $1,000,000 of corporate profits in spite of an earlier opinion of\r\nthis Court directing them to restore profits and account.  The master found, and this Court upheld, that the defendants had acted oppressively and unfairly.  In\r\nRoper v. Dynamique Concepts, Inc., 447 S.E.2d 218 (Ct. App. 1994), the Court of Appeals held the issuance of additional shares of stock as a last ditch effort\r\nto raise capital for a financially troubled corporation was sufficient to overcome a claim of oppression, since the shares had been issued in good faith.  \r\n19.   Meiselman has been referred to as a \"leading case\" in adoption of this approach.  See Dean F. Hodge O'Neal, O'Neal's Close Corporations, Â§ 9.30 at 144\r\n(3d Ed. 1991) (hereinafter O'Neal); see&nbsp;also Robert S. McLean, Minority Shareholders' Rights in the Close Corporation Under New North Carolina Business\r\nCorporation Act, 68 N.C. L. Rev. 1109, 1114 (1989). \r\n20.   As in North Carolina, California also places the emphasis on the interests of the minority, as opposed to the actions of the majority.  See Cal. Corp. Code Â§\r\n1800 (cited in O'Neal, supra, Â§ 9.29 at 131, n. 8).  See&nbsp;also Kemp v. Beatley Inc., 473 N.E.2d 1173 (N.Y. 1984) (interpreting McKinney's Business Corporation\r\nLaw Â§ 1104-a which allows court to liquidate assets if a) it is the only feasible means whereby the petitioners may reasonably expect to obtain a fair return on\r\ntheir investment or b) it is reasonably necessary to protect rights and interests of shareholders).  \r\n21.   See O'Neal, supra at Â§ 9.30, pp. 142-143, citing Stefano v. Coppock, 705 P.2d 443, 446 (Alaska 1985); Fox v. 7L Bar Ranch Co., 645 P.2d 929 (Mont.\r\n1982); Bavlik v. Sylvester, 411 N.W.2d 383 (N.D. 1987); Masinter v. WEBCO, 262 S.E.2d 433, 442 (W.Va. 1980).\r\n22.   Peeples notes, \"[t]he most unique feature of the reasonable expectations analysis is the lack of a bad faith requirement. At most, the plaintiff is required to\r\nshow that he or she was not at fault, not that the defendant acted in bad faith.\"  60 Notre Dame L. Rev. at 504. \r\n23.   Bruno theorizes that adoption of the reasonable expectations standard 1) will create instability and uncertainty in the field of corporate law: 2) increase\r\nlitigation as every minority shareholder will assert reasonable expectations were frustrated, 3) discourage majority or wholly owned corporations from raising\r\ncapital through offerings to minority interests,and 4) is unnecessary as present safeguards are adequate.  Id.  \r\n24.   If the legislature wishes to afford such expansive rights to minority shareholders, it may amend the statute to include language similar to the statutes in\r\nNorth Carolina, California, and New York.  Accord Steinke v. SC Dep't of Labor, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).  \r\n25.   We agree with Professor Miller's suggestion that the best approach to the statutory definition of oppressive conduct may well be a case-by-case analysis,\r\naugmented by factors or typical patterns of majority conduct which tend to be indicative of oppression, such as exclusion from management, withholding of\r\ndividends, paying excessive salaries to majority shareholders, and analogous activities.  Sandra K. Miller, How Should U.K. and U.S. Minority Shareholder\r\nRemedies for Unfairly Prejudicial or Oppressive Conduct Be Reformed?, 36 Am. Bus. L.J. 579 , 585-586 (Summer 1999).  In this regard, we note that we do\r\nnot hold that a court may never consider the parties' reasonable expectations, or the other items enumerated by the Court of Appeals, as factors in assessing\r\noppressive conduct; such factors, however, are not to be utilized as the sole test of oppression under South Carolina law.&nbsp;\r\n26. &quot;Freeze out&quot; is\r\noften used as a synonym for &quot;squeeze out.&quot; The term squeeze out means\r\nthe use by some of the owners or participants in a business enterprise of\r\nstrategic position, inside information, or powers of control, or the utilization\r\nof some legal device or technique, to eliminate from the enterprise one or more\r\nof its owners or participants. 2 F. Hodge Oâ€™Neal &amp; Robert B. Thompson, Oâ€™Nealâ€™s\r\nOppression of Minority Shareholders, Â§ 1.01 at 1 (2d ed. 1999).\r\n\r\n27.&nbsp; Majority freeze out\r\nschemes which withhold dividends &quot;are designed to compel the minority to\r\nrelinquish stock at inadequate prices. When the minority stockholder agrees to\r\nsell out at less than fair value, the majority has won.&quot; Donahue v. Rodd\r\nElectrotype Co., 328 N.E.2d 505, 515 (Mass. 1975)(internal citations\r\nomitted). See&nbsp;also Robert B. Thompson, The Shareholderâ€™s\r\nCause of Action for Oppression, 48 Bus. Law, 699, 703-4 (1993) (noting that\r\nin a classic &quot;freeze out,&quot; the majority first denies the minority any\r\nreturn and then proposes to buy the shares at a very low price).28. \r\nA host of factors is identified in 1 F. Hodge Oâ€™Neal and Robert B. Thompson, Oâ€™Nealâ€™s\r\nOppression of Minority Shareholders, Chap. 3 (2d ed. 1999), including, but\r\nnot limited to, dividend withholding, eliminating minority shareholders from\r\ndirectorate and excluding them from employment, siphoning off corporate earnings\r\nvia high compensation, leases and loans favorable to majority shareholders,\r\nfailure to enforce contracts for the benefit of the corporation, appropriation\r\nor corporate assets, contracts or credit for personal use, usurping corporate\r\nopportunities, transactions between a parent corporation and a subsidiary,\r\nwithholding information from minority shareholders.29. \r\nEffectively, the minority shareholderâ€™s capital investment is &quot;held\r\nhostage by those in control of the corporation because there is no marketplace\r\nin which the minority may sell their shares.&quot; Sandra L. Schlafge, Comment,\r\nPedro v. Pedro: Consequences for Closely Held Corporations and the At-Will\r\nDoctrine in Minnesota, 76 Minn. L. Rev. 1071, 1076 (1992).30. \r\nAs detailed more fully in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, Atlas made a 1990\r\ndistribution to Louise based upon her ownership of 271 shares of Atlas stock\r\nwhen the referee found Louise, in fact, owns 301 shares of stock.31. \r\nThe referee considered a number of factors in determining they would receive no\r\nfinancial benefit including salary, retirement benefits, Johnâ€™s lack of status\r\nas President, the fact that John would no longer receive loans from the company\r\nsince he lost his employment, the loss of fringe benefits, the fact that John\r\nand Louise were paying their own attorneyâ€™s fees, and the fact that a sale of\r\nAtlas was not contemplated. The referee then weighed these factors against the\r\nbenefits still received by Alex and his family.32. \r\nThe referee ruled Atlas could not rely upon the &quot;Business Judgment\r\nRule&quot; to justify its treatment of John and Louise. The Business Judgment\r\nRule immunizes management from liability in corporate transactions undertaken by\r\nmanagement where there is a reasonable basis to indicate the transaction was\r\nmade in good faith. BLACKâ€™S LAW DICTIONARY 181 (5th Ed. 1979). See\r\nGoddard v. Fairways Dev. Gen. Partnership, 310 S.C. 408, 426 S.E.2d 828\r\n(Ct. App. 1992)(in dispute between directors of homeowners association and\r\naggrieved homeowners, conduct of directors should be judged by business judgment\r\nrule, and absent showing of bad faith, dishonesty, or incompetence, judgment of\r\ndirectors will not be set aside by judicial action). Given the ample evidence\r\ndemonstrating a lack of good faith in this case, we find the Business Judgment\r\nRule has no application here.\r\n33.  Atlas asserts the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing its counterclaim for the $133,932 negative balance in John's MEL account.  In brief, John concedes\r\nthe negative balance \"is, indeed, on the books and may be rightly taken into account in future valuation proceedings.\"  Accordingly, as John concedes the debt\r\nis owed there is nothing for this Court to review.  The referee may consider this fact during the valuation proceeding. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
