McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor David Michael Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  In 2004, a jury found appellant Bryan Lamb guilty of a murder committed in 1990.Â  The trial court sentenced Lamb to life imprisonment, and he directly appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 7, 1990, 13-year-old Crystal â€œCricketâ€ Surrell was seen walking to school toward a path that went through some woods in Dorchester County.Â  Cricket was found dead the next morning.Â Â  Her panties had been cut or ripped off and stuffed in her mouth.Â  Her jeans were pulled down to her ankles, and her bra and sweater were pulled up to her neck.Â  She had four stab wounds to her neck.Â  The cause of death was asphyxiation from the gag in her mouth and agonal aspiration on the blood in her throat from the stab wounds.Â  It was estimated that Cricket died the morning of November 7.Â  At the time of the murder, Lamb was 14 years old and went to middle school with Cricket.Â \r\n \r\nIn 2003, a juvenile petition was filed in family court against Lamb alleging that he murdered Cricket when he was a minor.Â  Thereafter, the solicitorâ€™s office filed a waiver motion requesting that a pre-waiver evaluation be done and the family court thereafter determine whether Lamb should be transferred to the court of general sessions.Â  Prior to the evaluation, however, the family court issued a â€œConsent Waiver Orderâ€ accepting Lambâ€™s consent to be waived from family court to the court of general sessions.Â  The court specifically found that Lamb, â€œafter being advised by competent counsel, knowingly and voluntarilyâ€ consented to the waiver.Â  After the case was transferred to general sessions court, a Dorchester County grand jury indicted Lamb for murder.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the court of general sessions have subject matter jurisdiction to try Lamb after the family court accepted Lambâ€™s consent to transfer?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nLamb argues that because a waiver evaluation and hearing were not conducted in the family court, the court of general sessions was without subject matter jurisdiction to try him as an adult for murder.Â  Basically, Lamb maintains the family court was not permitted to accept his consent to the waiver.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe statute governing the transfer of jurisdiction from family court to general sessions court in a murder case states as follows:\r\n\r\n\tWithin thirty days after the filing of a petition in the family court alleging the child has committed the offense of murderâ€¦, the person executing the petition may request in writing that the case be transferred to the court of general sessions with a view to proceeding against the child as a criminal rather than as a child coming within the purview of this article.Â  The judge of the family court is authorized to determine this request. Â If the request is denied, the petitioner may appeal within five days to the circuit court. Â Upon the hearing of the appeal, the judge of the circuit court is vested with the discretion of exercising and asserting the jurisdiction of the court of general sessions or of relinquishing jurisdiction to the family court. Â If the circuit judge elects to exercise the jurisdiction of the general sessions court for trial of the case, he shall issue an order to that effect, and then the family court has no further jurisdiction in the matter.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605(6) (Supp. 2006).[1]Â  \r\n \r\nIn a murder case, the Legislature intended to give the family court discretion to transfer jurisdiction â€œfor any juvenile, regardless of age.â€Â  State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 114, 529 S.E.2d 20, 24&nbsp;(2000).Â  On appellate review, the transfer order will be affirmed unless the family court has abused its discretion.Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 292, 509 S.E.2d 476, 481&nbsp;(1998).\r\nWe find it was well within the family courtâ€™s discretion to accept consent to the transfer of jurisdiction, especially given the unusual facts of the instant case.[2]Â  The record indicates that Lambâ€™s consent was intelligently and voluntarily given. Â Thus, the family court appropriately accepted Lambâ€™s consent to waiver.Â  In addition, because of the family courtâ€™s transfer order and the subsequent indictment, the general sessions court was properly vested with jurisdiction to try Lamb on the murder charge.\r\nLamb contends that under South Carolina law, the family court must conduct a waiver hearing after an evaluation has been performed, and only then issue its waiver order.Â  See, e.g., State v. Kelsey,&nbsp;331 S.C. 50, 65, 502 S.E.2d 63,&nbsp;70-71 (1998) (the family courtâ€™s waiver of jurisdiction order must sufficiently state the reasons for transfer and should demonstrate that the statutory requirement of full investigation has been met); State v. Avery, supra (same). Â We note, however, that the facts of those cases are inapposite since waiver of the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction was not at issue.Â  Furthermore, we simply see no reason why a defendant should not be permitted to consent to the transfer of jurisdiction provided the consent is knowing and voluntary.Â  Cf. Sanders v. State, 281 S.C. 53, 56, 314 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1984) (â€œThe jurisdiction of the family court over juveniles is a privilege rather than a matter of right.â€).\r\nAccordingly, Lambâ€™s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The predecessor transfer statute in effect at the time of this 1990 murder was S.C. Code Ann. 20-7-430 which was repealed in 1996 when the transfer of jurisdiction statute became section 20-7-7605.Â  See State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 112, 529 S.E.2d 20, 23&nbsp;(2000) (explaining that section 20-7-7605, enacted in 1996, is substantially similar to its predecessor statute, section 20-7-430, which was enacted in 1981 and repealed in 1996).Â  In both statutes, subsection 6 governed murder cases; the language of both versions is identical.\r\n[2] Although Lamb was only 14 years old at the time of Cricketâ€™s murder, he was 27 when the juvenile petition was filed.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26368","title":"Bass v.

Scalise Builders of South Carolina, Op. No. 2005-UP-340 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 18, 2005) (unpublished opinion).Â  The dissent in the court of appeals would have affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision on the grounds that the record failed to establish a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Id. (Kittredge, J., dissenting).\r\nThis Court granted certiorari and Petitioners raise the following issue for review: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tDid the court of appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment because Hansson failed to establish a prima facie case for his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim?Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\nWhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same&nbsp;standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and&nbsp;all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  David, 367 S.C. at 247, 626 S.E.2d at 3.\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioners argue that the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment because Hansson failed to establish a prima facie case for his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough this Court only recently formally recognized the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the theory regarding recovery for emotional damages has an extensive history in South Carolina.[1]Â  Prior to formal recognition of the tort, this Court had already indicated that willful and malicious conduct which proximately caused anotherâ€™s emotional distress, and without accompanying physical injury, may be actionable.[2]Â  The landscape dramatically changed when this Court expressly defined the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress - also known as the tort of â€œoutrageâ€ - in Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 276 S.E.2d 776 (1981).Â  In Ford, the Court held that in order to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the complaining party must establish that: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress, or was certain, or substantially certain, that such distress would result from his conduct; \r\n\t\r\n\t(2) the conduct was so â€˜extreme and outrageousâ€™ so as to exceed â€˜all possible bounds of decencyâ€™ and must be regarded as â€˜atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community;â€™\r\n\t(3) the actions of the defendant caused plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and \r\n\t\r\n\t(4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was â€˜severeâ€™ such that â€˜no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.â€™Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 162, 276 S.E.2d at 778 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 46, cmts. d, i, and j) (citations omitted).Â  Thus, in Ford, the Court expressly ruled that a party could recover damages for emotional distress in the absence of physical impact or physical injury.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nRecognition of this tort, however, did not come without qualification.Â  In Ford, the Court emphasized the heightened burden of proof articulated in the second and fourth elements of the tort, insisting that in order to prevail in a tort action alleging damages for purely mental anguish, the plaintiff must show both that the conduct on the part of the defendant was â€œextreme and outrageous,â€ and that the conduct caused distress of an â€œextreme or severe nature.â€Â  Id. at 161, 276 S.E.2d at 778 (quoting Hudson, 273 S.C. at 770, 259 S.E.2d at 814).Â  Chief Justice Littlejohn, writing for the Court, further reasoned that â€œwhere physical harm is lacking, the courts should look initially for more in the way of extreme outrage as an assurance that the mental disturbance claimed is not fictitious.â€Â  Id. at 166, 276 S.E.2d at 780 (citing William L. Prosser, The Law of Torts Â§ 12 (4th ed. 1971)).Â  In this vein, our courts have since noted â€œthe widespread reluctance of courts to permit the tort of outrage to become a panacea for wounded feelings rather than reprehensible conduct.â€Â  Todd v. S. C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 283 S.C. 155, 171, 321 S.E.2d 602, 611 (Ct. App. 1984), revâ€™d on other grounds, 287 S.C. 190, 336 S.E.2d 472 (1985).\r\nThe threshold issue raised by the parties in this case is whether a court must consider all four elements in a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress when ruling on a summary judgment motion.Â  Hansson contends that the court of appeals properly ended its summary judgment analysis with the determination that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Petitionersâ€™ conduct was â€œextreme and outrageous.â€Â  Thus, Hansson argues that the court correctly found that the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  Hanssonâ€™s argument primarily relies on prior pronouncements from this Court that in reviewing summary judgment for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, â€œit is for the Courtâ€™s determination whether the defendantâ€™s conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery, and only where reasonable persons&nbsp;might differ is the question one for the jury.â€Â  Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, 306 S.C. 297, 302, 411 S.E.2d 664, 666 (1991) (quoting Todd, 283 S.C. at 167, 321 S.E.2d at 609).Â  Although Hansson is correct in his recitation of precedent, his argument does not reach an accurate conclusion.\r\nBy narrowly construing the language used by the Court, Hansson misinterprets this Courtâ€™s pronouncement to mean that a court need only make a determination as to the extreme and outrageous conduct of the defendant - the second element of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress - when ruling on a motion for summary judgment.Â  Such a literal interpretation, however, stands in direct contradiction to the rules governing summary judgment.Â  This Court has established that â€œ[t]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the partyâ€™s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof.â€Â  Baughman v. Amer. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 116, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545-46 (1991) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).Â  Therefore, on a defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment such as the one at issue here, a court cannot properly deny the motion after only finding that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to one element of the plaintiffâ€™s claim; rather, under Baughman, the court must determine that a genuine issue of material fact exists for each essential element of the plaintiffâ€™s claim.Â  Accordingly, we hold that when ruling on a summary judgment motion, a court must determine whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case as to each element of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  \r\n \r\nApplying this principle to the instant case, we further hold that after finding that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Petitionersâ€™ alleged conduct was sufficiently â€œoutrageousâ€ to establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the court of appeals erred by not proceeding with a similar inquiry into whether Hanssonâ€™s resulting emotional distress was sufficiently â€œsevere.â€Â  In order to prevent claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress from becoming â€œa panacea for wounded feelings rather than reprehensible conduct,â€ Todd, 283 S.C. at 171, 321 S.E.2d at 611, the court plays a significant gatekeeping role in analyzing a defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 46 cmt. j (â€œIt is for the court to determine whether on the evidence severe emotional distress can be found; it is for the jury to determine whether, on the evidence, it has in fact existed.â€).Â  For this reason, our analysis must begin in large part where the analysis by the court of appeals ended.Â Â \r\n \r\nUnder the heightened standard of proof for emotional distress claims emphasized in Ford, a party cannot establish a prima facie claim for damages resulting from a defendantâ€™s tortious conduct with mere bald assertions.Â  To permit a plaintiff to legitimately state a cause of action by simply alleging, â€œI suffered emotional distressâ€ would be irreconcilable with this Courtâ€™s development of the law in this area.Â  In the words of Justice Littlejohn, the court must look for something â€œmoreâ€ - in the form of third party witness testimony and other corroborating evidence - in order to make a prima facie showing of â€œsevereâ€ emotional distress.[3]Â  See also Rhodes, 268 S.C. at 302, 233 S.E.2d at 105 (upholding the trial courtâ€™s grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the defendant in a plaintiffâ€™s claim for emotional distress because the plaintiff failed to show that the defendantâ€™s conduct was â€œunreasonable or abusive, nor that [the plaintiff]â€™s emotional upset was other than transient or trivialâ€).[4] Â Â \r\nHanssonâ€™s alleged emotional damages resulting from Petitionersâ€™ conduct rested on his testimony that he lost sleep at night and that he visited a dentist who told him he appeared to be grinding his teeth in his sleep.Â  He further testified that his condition necessitated a second trip to the dentist and â€œa couple hundred dollarsâ€ for fillings and a tooth cap.Â  Hansson admitted that he neither visited nor received treatment or medication from any other physician or counselor.Â  Additionally, Hansson stated that his coworkersâ€™ conduct did not cause him to lose any time from work.Â  Hansson also asserted that the conduct did not affect his relationship with his wife, or affect his ability to perform his job.Â  In fact, Hansson testified that he was generally satisfied with his employment and that, on a few occasions, he reciprocated Petitionersâ€™ jokes with sexually-oriented jokes of his own.Â  \r\n \r\nEven when considered in the light most favorable to Hansson, Hansson failed to provide any legally sufficient evidence in this case to show that his resulting emotional distress was â€œsevereâ€ within the contemplation of this Courtâ€™s mental anguish jurisprudence.Â  Assuming, without deciding, that Petitionersâ€™ conduct was sufficiently â€œoutrageousâ€ to come within the ambit of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Hanssonâ€™s passing references to fairly ordinary symptoms are nonetheless insufficient to create a jury question on the damages element of his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Petitioners. \r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that Hansson failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that he suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Petitionersâ€™ conduct.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Petitioners on Hanssonâ€™s action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The following cases offer a representative timeline of the development of case theory regarding recovery for emotional damages:Â  Mack v. South Bound R.R. Co., 52 S.C. 323, 335, 29 S.E. 905, 909 (1898) (holding that a plaintiff could not recover damages for mental suffering in the absence of bodily injury, but finding that injuries to the nervous system could be regarded as â€œan injury to the body rather than to the mind, even though the mind be at the same time injuriously affectedâ€ (quoting Sloane v. S. Calif. Ry. Co., 44 P. 320, 322 (1896))); Padgett v. Colonial Wholesale Distributing Co., 232 S.C. 593, 103 S.E.2d 265 (1958) (expressly rejecting any requirement of physical impact or tangible bodily injury to recover damages for bodily injury proximately caused by shock, fright, or emotional upset resulting from a tortfeasorâ€™s negligent and willful misconduct); Turner v. ABC Jalousie Co. of N.C., 251 S.C. 92, 160 S.E.2d 528 (1968) (holding that a plaintiffâ€™s allegation that she suffered a nervous breakdown after a defendant used vile, profane, and abusive language towards her was sufficient to state a cause of action); Rhodes v. Sec. Fin. Corp. of Landrum, 268 S.C. 300, 302, 233 S.E.2d 105, 105 (1977) (holding that a defendant is not liable for a plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress without a showing that the distress inflicted was â€œextreme or severeâ€); Hudson v. Zenith Engraving Co., Inc., 273 S.C. 766, 259 S.E.2d 812 (1979) (â€œIn order to prevail in a tortious action in which the sole damages alleged are those of mental anguish, plaintiff must show that the conduct on the part of defendant was extreme and outrageous, causing distress that is of an extreme or severe nature.â€ (citing Rhodes, 268 S.C. at 302, 233 S.E.2d at 105 and Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 46 (1965))).Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n[2] See supra note 1.\r\n[3] Fordâ€™s emphasis on the plaintiffâ€™s heightened standard of proof echoes the position of the Restatment (Second) of Torts, upon which this Court relied in adopting the rule of liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  According to the Restatement:\r\n\r\n\tEmotional distress . . . includes all highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and nausea. It is only where it is extreme that the liability arises. Complete emotional tranquility is seldom attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living among people.

Jennings, of Bishopville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 502, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand. Â We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand. The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 11, 2003, a State Transport Police officer issued two tickets to the driver of a truck owned by Lee County.Â  The officer reported to Disciplinary Counsel that respondent asked for help regarding the tickets, explaining that Lee County was a poor county.Â  The officer declined to help the county because he frequently received complaints from private carriers that government trucks ran overweight or without tarps, an offense for which private carriers routinely would be cited.Â  According to the officer, respondent then called the county maintenance department supervisor and advised him to make sure all drivers knew to put tarps on their loads.Â  The county supervisor assured respondent every driver would be briefed, and it would not happen again.Â  Respondent again asked the officer for help on the tickets, and the officer agreed.Â  The tickets were marked to indicate that the defendant appeared, a trial was held, and the verdict was not guilty.[1]Â  An employee in respondentâ€™s office then signed respondentâ€™s name in a box captioned â€œcertified correct.â€Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent informed Disciplinary Counsel he recalled being contacted by the driver and the driverâ€™s supervisor about receiving help on the tickets.Â  According to respondent, he remembered asking a State Transport Police supervisor for help regarding the tickets at a summary court seminar.Â  The police supervisor indicated he could help with the tickets if the driver to whom the tickets were issued attended a training class.Â  Respondent contended the tickets were marked not guilty by the officer before the officer arrived for court, and he assumed this was because the driver attended the class.Â  Respondent admitted his employee acted on his behalf in signing the ticket, notwithstanding the fact that at least some information was incorrect, but maintained this had been the common practice in his court.Â \r\n \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should maintain high standards of conduct and should personally observe those standards); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judgeâ€™s judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of the judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3B(2) (judge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon 3B(7) (judge shall not initiate ex parte communications); and Canon 3B(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters fairly).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  \r\n \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Apparently, this is the common practice of marking tickets when police elect not to prosecute a ticket because there is no option on the ticket to indicate that the case was nol prossed.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26371","title":"Young v.

Armstrong, brought a wrongful death and survival action against the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN) and the Fairfield/Newberry Disabilities Special Needs Board (Board).Â  The trial court granted Respondentâ€™s motion for partial summary judgment.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe decedent, Respondentâ€™s nine-year-old son, was severely disabled by cerebral palsy.Â  He lived at home and received services from Pam Gaither, the Boardâ€™s service coordinator.Â  After noticing complications with the decedentâ€™s semi-electric hospital bed, Respondent reported her concerns to Gaither and obtained a prescription for another bed.Â  Before the new bed arrived, Gaither attempted to secure the existing bed.Â  On July 13, 2000, the decedent suffocated to death in his bed.Â \r\n \r\nOn January 14, 2002, Respondent filed a wrongful death and survival action against DDSN.Â  DDSN asserted a general denial as well as sovereign immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.[1]Â  On September 20, 2002, after learning Gaither is not a direct employee of DDSN, but of the Board, Respondent filed an amended complaint which joined the Board as an additional party-defendant.Â  The Board asserted a statute of limitations defense.\r\n \r\nDDSN and the Board moved for summary judgment.Â  DDSN moved on the following bases: (1) a state agency cannot be held liable under the Tort Claims Act for the acts or omission of Gaither because Gaither is not its employee; (2) DDSN cannot be liable for the negligence of an independent contractor or its employees; (3) the doctrines of apparent agency and non-delegable duty do not apply; and (4) DDSN did not breach any duty of care owed to the decedent.Â  The Board moved on the basis of the statute of limitations.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent made a cross-motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a ruling as a matter of law that Gaither is in a master-servant relationship with both DDSN and the Board, and the statute of limitations does not prevent the addition of the Board as a party.Â  Respondent also sought summary judgment on the issue of apparent agency, claiming DDSN held out to the public that DDSN and the Board are interrelated such that DDSN has created an apparent agency relationship with the Board and consequently with Gaither.Â  Further, Respondent claimed DDSN has a duty to provide services to the community which is a non-delegable duty.Â  Finally, Respondent filed a motion for sanctions against DDSNâ€™s counsel for evasive and incomplete discovery responses, requesting the trial court estop DDSN from denying Gaither is its employee.Â \r\n \r\nThe trial court granted Respondentâ€™s motion for partial summary judgment.Â  Specifically, the trial court found: (1) the Board and Gaither are servants of DDSN and DDSN is estopped from denying the same; (2) DDSN is liable for torts committed by the Board and Gaither under apparent agency principles and the doctrine of non-delegable duty; (3) and the statute of limitations does not bar Respondentâ€™s claim against the Board under the relation back theory.Â  Finally, the trial court found there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Board breached the standard of care and ordered that issue to be presented to the jury.Â  Â Â \r\nDDSN and the Board filed motions to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Following a hearing, the trial court issued an order which reiterated its prior findings and, in effect, denied the 59(e) motions. Â DDSN and the Board filed this appeal, and we certified the case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 626 S.E.2d 1 (2006).Â  A trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005).Â  The appellate court, like the trial court, must view all ambiguities, conclusions, and all inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d 319 (2001).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfinding as a matter of law the Board and Gaither are employees or \r\n\t\t\tservants of DDSN?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfinding DDSN is liable for Gaitherâ€™s torts based upon apparent agency principles or the doctrine of non-delegable duty?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court abuse its \r\n\t\t\tdiscretion in sanctioning DDSN by estopping DDSN from denying an employment relationship with Gaither and in barring DDSN from raising an â€œimproper defendantâ€ defense?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\truling the statute of limitations did not bar Respondentâ€™s claim \r\n\t\t\tagainst the Board?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Master-Servant Relationship\r\nDDSN argues the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law the Board and Gaither are employees or servants of DDSN.Â  Based on an analysis of S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-20-20 and -375 to -385 (2002), we agree.Â \r\n \r\nSections 44-20-20 and -375 establish and recognize a statewide network of local boards of disabilities and special needs.Â  Section 44-20-385 describes the powers and duties of local boards.Â  It describes local boards as: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t[T]he administrative, planning, coordinating, and service delivery body for county disabilities and special needs services funded in whole or in part by state appropriations to the department or funded from other sources under the departmentâ€™s control. Â It is a body corporate in deed and in law with all the powers incident to corporation â€¦.\r\n\r\nAlso, Â§ 44-20-385(5) states:\r\n\r\n\t[Local boards] shall employ personnel and expend its budget for the direct delivery of services or contract with those service vendors necessary to carry out the county mental retardation, related disabilities, head injuries, and spinal cord injuries services program â€¦.\r\n\r\nOrdinances promulgated by Fairfield and Newberry Counties similarly grant the Board the authority to employ personnel.Â  The plain language of the statutes and ordinances establishes the Board as a separate entity from DDSN and grants the Board the authority to hire employees.Â  See Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997) (â€œ[W]here a statute is complete, plain, and unambiguous, legislative intent must be determined from the language of the statute itself.â€).Â \r\n \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s order made no reference to the statutes, focusing instead on the four-factor test used to determine whether a person is an employee of a particular entity.Â  Under that test, the court considers (1) who has the right to control the person; (2) who pays the person; (3) who furnishes the person with equipment; and (4) who has the right to fire the person.Â  Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 329, 566 S.E.2d 536, 543 (2002).Â  In determining the Board and Gaither are servants of DDSN, the trial court focused primarily on the amount of control DDSN exercises over the Board, noting specifically the guidelines followed by Gaither in exercising her duties as a service coordinator were promulgated entirely and directly by DDSN.Â  The trial court also referred to the degree of supervision DDSN exercised over the Board, noting DDSN is most often the final decision-maker and recognizing documents entitled â€œService Coordination Practices,â€ which require compliance with DDSN policies and procedures by all service coordinators.Â \r\n \r\nWhile there is evidence DDSN exercised control over Gaither, there is also evidence Gaither was hired by the Board and received her wages from the Board.Â  Whether a master-servant relationship existed between DDSN and the Board and Gaither is a question for the jury. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, it was error for the trial court to determine as a matter of law Gaither and the Board are servants of DDSN.Â \r\n \r\nII.Â  Agency and Non-delegable Duty\r\nDDSN argues the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law the Board and Gaither are agents of DDSN based on apparent agency principles and in finding DDSN is liable for torts committed by Gaither or other employees of the Board based on the doctrine of non-delegable duty.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe basis of apparent authority is representations made by the principal to the third party and reliance by the third party on those representations.â€Â  Moore v. North Am. Van Lines, 310 S.C. 236, 239, 423 S.E.2d 116, 118&nbsp;(1992).Â  In finding DDSN held out the Board and Gaither as its agents, the trial court relied on the definition of apparent agency stated in Simmons v. Tuomey Regional Medical Center, 341 S.C. 32, 51, 533 S.E.2d 312, 322&nbsp;(2000):\r\n\r\n\tOne who employs an independent contractor to perform services for another which are accepted in the reasonable belief that the services are being rendered by the employer or by his servants, is subject to liability for physical harm caused by the negligence of the contractor in supplying such services, to the same extent as though the employer were supplying them himself or by his servants.\r\n\r\nThe trial court solely relied on DDSNâ€™s description of its relationship with local boards on its website in finding Gaither and the Board are servants of DDSN based on apparent agency principles because DDSN holds itself out to the public as providing a service and, in turn, the public looks directly to DDSN for care, reasonably believing any caseworker providing service is an employee of DDSN.Â \r\n \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants, assuming there is evidence that DDSN made representations supporting a finding of an agency relationship between DDSN and the Board, there is no evidence in the record Respondent actually relied on representations made by DDSN.Â  The trial court, therefore, erred because the record is devoid of any evidence to support the conclusion DDSN has an apparent agency relationship with the Board and Gaither.\r\nDDSN also argues the trial court erred in finding DDSN liable for torts committed by the Board and Gaither under the doctrine of non-delegable duty.Â  The trial court held DDSN has been entrusted with important duties and cannot delegate those duties.Â  However, the duties exercised by the Board derive directly from the statutory scheme enacted by the General Assembly.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-20-20 and -375 to -385, the Board has been established as a separate entity with powers and duties separate from DDSN. Â Accordingly, the doctrine of non-delegable duty does not apply.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court erred in determining an apparent agency relationship existed between DDSN, the Board, and Gaither and in conferring liability on DDSN under the doctrine of non-delegable duty.Â  Further, based on the record and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants, we find the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law the Board and Gaither are servants of DDSN. Â Appellants presented sufficient evidence to create a jury question as to whether a master-servant relationship existed.Â  Therefore, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of partial summary judgment to Respondent and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  Our disposition of these issues makes it unnecessary to address Appellantâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\n \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  Respondent alleged her child died as the result of Pam Gaitherâ€™s negligence.Â  She brought a timely wrongful death and survival action against appellant South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (State Agency).Â  After the statute of limitations expired, respondent was permitted to amend her complaint under Rule 15(c), SCRCP, to add appellant Fairfield/Newberry Disabilities Special Needs Board (Local Board) as a defendant.\r\nThe circuit court filed an order granting summary judgment under Rule 56(d), SCRCP, holding:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1) \r\n\t\t\tGaither and Local Board are \r\n\t\t\temployees of State Agency;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2)\r\n\t\t\tGaither and Local Board are \r\n\t\t\tindependent contractors of State Board, which is liable for \r\n\t\t\tGaitherâ€™s negligence because the State Board is either Gaitherâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tâ€œostensible principalâ€ or because State Board owes a non-delegable \r\n\t\t\tduty to respondent;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3)\r\n\t\t\tState Agency is estopped from arguing that Local Board and Gaither are not its independent contractors;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4)\r\n\t\t\tRespondentâ€™s amended complaint \r\n\t\t\tadding Local Board as a defendant relates back to the original \r\n\t\t\tcomplaint under Rule 15(c), SCRCP; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5) \r\n\t\t\tWhether State Agency, Local \r\n\t\t\tBoard, and/or Gaither breached the applicable standard of care is a \r\n\t\t\tjury issue.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLocal Board and State Agency appealed.  \r\nLocal Board raises only one issue: whether the circuit court erred in permitting respondent to add it as a defendant after the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  Unlike the majority, I feel that we must address this issue and would reverse.Â  Jackson v. Doe, 342 S.C. 552, 537 S.E.2d 567 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  State Agency raises a number of issues, which I have addressed below.\r\nA.Â  Employer/Employee Relationship\r\nThe circuit court concluded that Gaither and Local Board are employees of State Agency by applying a four-part test traditionally used to distinguish an employee/employer (master/servant) relationship from a principal/independent contractor relationship in the context of workersâ€™ compensation cases.Â  E.g., Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002).Â  In my opinion, where as here the legislature has created governmental entities and defined their duties and responsibilities, we should examine the applicable statutes to determine the nature of their relationship.Â  Under these circumstances, there is no need to resort to the workersâ€™ compensation test. \r\n \r\nState Agency was created by the â€œSouth Carolina Mental Retardation, Related Disabilities, Head Injuries, and Spinal Cord Injuries Actâ€ (the Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-20-240 (2002).Â  It is authorized to coordinate and oversee programs, and to contract with other state and local agencies to provide services and programs, Â§ 44-20-250, and to employ its own staff.Â  Â§ 44-20-220.Â  The Act provides for the creation of, and continuation of, county-based special needs and disabilities boards, Â§ 44-20-375.Â  These local boards are â€œpublic entities,â€ Â§ 44-20-375(D), and, among other things, are authorized to employ personnel or contract with service vendors.Â  Â§ 44-20-385(5).\r\nIn my opinion, there is no evidence in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s holding that Local Board is an employee of the State Agency.Â  Moreover, I can find nothing to support the conclusion that Gaither was an employee of State Agency as opposed to Local Board.Â  To the extent the majority reverses the order granting summary judgment to respondent on her claim that Gaither and Local Board are the State Boardâ€™s employees, I concur.\r\nB.&nbsp; Agency\r\nI agree with the majority that the finding of a principal-agent relationship between State Agency and/or Local Board or Gaither must be reversed as there is simply no evidence respondent relied upon any representations by State Agency.\r\nC.&nbsp; Non-delegable Duty\r\nIn my opinion, the trial court erred in granting respondent summary judgment and holding that State Agency was vicariously liable for Gaitherâ€™s alleged negligence.Â  Unlike the majority, however, I would not hold that there is no evidence of such a duty, but would instead hold that there is a material question of fact whether such a duty may exist.Â  Compare Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 638 S.E.2d 650 (2006) (State Agency may be liable for negligent supervision by third party).Â  I would therefore reverse the summary judgment ruling with the understanding that the trial court may conclude upon remand that there is such a duty.\r\nD.&nbsp; Estoppel\r\nAs a sanction for perceived discovery abuses by State Agency the trial judge held State Agency was estopped from denying Local Board and Gaither are its independent contractors, a ruling which State Agency has appealed.Â  Unlike the majority, I believe that we must address the issue now.Â  If we leave it in effect, State Agencyâ€™s liability will be established by estoppel.Â  It then matters not that we have reversed the principal-agency holding, or the employer-employee/independent contractor-principal holding, or that we remain unconvinced at this juncture that there exists a non-delegable duty. For this reason, I would address the estoppel ruling, which I conclude must be reversed. \r\n\r\nIn estopping State Agency, the trial court relied on Rule 37, SCRCP.Â  Specifically, the court cites Rule 37(a)(3) for the proposition that â€œan evasive or incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer,â€ finds State Agencyâ€™s discovery responses were evasive and incomplete, and estops the Agency as a sanction, citing Rule 37.Â  As State Agency points out, however, the first clause of Rule 37(a)(3) provides â€œFor purposes of this subdivision,â€ thereby limiting its reach to situations where a party may move for an order compelling discovery [Rule 37(a)], and not affecting these situations in which a court may impose discretionary sanctions [Rule 37(b)].Â  I make no judgment whether State Agencyâ€™s discovery conduct was appropriate, but would merely hold that the trial judge cannot rely upon Rule 37(a)(3) to estop State Agency under Rule 37(b).\r\nE.&nbsp; Improper Defendant\r\nThe circuit court also held that State Agency waived its right to allege it was not the proper defendant because the defense of â€œimproper defendantâ€ is an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c), SCRCP, which the Agency failed to plead and thereby waived.Â  I agree with State Agency that there is no such â€œaffirmative defense:â€ it is the plaintiffâ€™s burden to prove her case against the defendant, not the defendantâ€™s obligation to prove he is not the proper party.Â  I would reverse the order to the extent it holds State Agency may not deny that it may be liable for Gaitherâ€™s alleged negligence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons given above, I concur in part and dissent in part.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C.

Ex parte Capital   U-Drive-It, Inc., 369 S.C. 1, 630 S.E.2d 464 (2006); Davis v.   Jennings, 304 S.C. 502, 405 S.E.2d 601 (1991). Therefore, with some few   exceptions,1 documents filed with this Court or the South Carolina Court of Appeals   (appellate court) are available to the public unless sealed by order of the   appellate court in which the matter is pending.\r\nSeveral commercial vendors have recently requested copies of   briefs filed with the appellate courts, and it is anticipated that these and   other appellate filings will be available electronically from both private and   public sources in the future. The ready availability of these documents raises   significant privacy concerns. While this problem is currently under review by   the Chief Justice's Task Force on Public Access to Court Records, we adopt the   following interim guidance regarding personal data identifiers and other   sensitive information in documents filed in the appellate courts.\r\nParties shall not include, or will partially redact where   inclusion is necessary, the following personal data identifiers from documents   filed with an appellate court:2\r\n\r\n  1. Social Security Numbers. If a social security number must be   included, only the last four digits of that number should be used.\r\n  2. Names of Minor Children. If a minor is the victim of a sexual   assault or is involved in an abuse or neglect case, the minor's name will be   completely redacted and a term such as &quot;victim&quot; or &quot;child&quot; should be used. In   all other cases, only the minor's first name and first initial of the last name   (i.e., John S.) should be used.\r\n  3. Financial Account Numbers. If financial account numbers are   relevant, only the last four digits of these numbers should be used.\r\n  4. Home Addresses. If a home address must be included, only the   city and state should be used.\r\n\r\nParties wishing to file documents containing the personal data   identifiers listed above may file unredacted documents under seal, together with   redacted versions for the public file. The sealed unredacted documents shall be   filed in a separate Appendix and the bottom of each page of the Appendix shall   be marked &quot;Sealed.&quot; No order of the appellate court will be required to file   this sealed Appendix. The number of copies of the Appendix to be served and   filed shall be the same as that required for the brief, record on appeal, motion   or other filing that includes the redacted documents. \r\n \r\nIf the caption of the case contains any of the personal data   identifiers listed above, the parties should file a motion to amend the caption   to redact the identifier. This should be done contemporaneously with the filing   of the notice of appeal or the commencement of the case with the appellate   court. Without a motion to the appellate court, the caption of a juvenile   delinquency matter from the family court shall be redacted to only use the   juvenile's first name and first letter of the juvenile's last name (i.e., In the   Interest of John S., a Juvenile.)\r\nA party seeking to seal material beyond those personal   identifiers listed above, must file a motion to seal with the appellate court in   which the matter is pending. This is true even if the lower court or   administrative tribunal may have issued an order sealing the record. Until the   motion is ruled on, the clerk of the appellate court shall treat the material as   if it is sealed. Parties and counsel are reminded that the standard established   in Ex parte Capital U-Drive-It, Inc. and Davis v. Jennings, supra, must be met before any request to seal all or a portion of a   record will be granted. Once sealed by order of an appellate court, the   materials will remain sealed before the appellate courts unless otherwise   ordered by the appellate court in which the matter is pending. \r\n \r\nParties should exercise caution in including other sensitive   personal data in their filings, such as personal identifying numbers, medical   records, employment history, individual financial information, proprietary or   trade secret information, information regarding an individual's cooperation with   the government, information regarding the victim of any criminal activity, or   national security information.\r\nAttorneys are expected to discuss this matter with their clients   so that an informed decision can be made about the inclusion of sensitive   information. The appellate courts and their staff will not review filings for   redaction or to determine if materials should be sealed; the responsibility for   insuring that information is redacted or sealed rests with counsel and the   parties.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

Â We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual /Procedural Background\r\nIn 2001, Mr. and Mrs. Doe discovered that their fourteen-year old daughter was involved in a sexual relationship with a substitute teacher from her school.Â  The substitute teacher was charged and convicted of criminal sexual conduct with a minor as a result of this inappropriate relationship.Â  Ultimately, Mr. and Mrs. Doe sued the School District alleging several causes of action based upon the alleged negligent supervision on the part of the School District.[1]Â  Specifically, Mr. and Mrs. Doe allege that the School District had prior complaints and warnings regarding the substitute teacher's inappropriate interest in young girls, and that the School District knew or should have known about the development of this relationship.\r\nThe School District filed a motion to dismiss all causes of action, and the trial court granted the motion.Â  Mr. and Mrs. Doe appealed, and this Court certified the case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Mr. and Mrs. Doe raise the following issue for this Court's review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the trial court err in granting the School District's motion to dismiss Mr. and Mrs. Doe's claims?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nGenerally, in considering a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon allegations set forth on the face of the complaint. Â Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 603 (1995). Â The motion may not be sustained if the facts alleged in the complaint and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief under any theory. Â Id.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nMr. and Mrs. Doe argue that the trial court erred in granting the School District's motion to dismiss.Â  We disagree with Mr. and Mrs. Doe's argument that the trial court erred in granting the School District's motion to dismiss the causes of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.Â  However, we agree that the trial court erred in granting the School District's motion to dismiss Mr. and Mrs. Doe's action for negligent supervision, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of an assumed duty in loco parentis.Â  \r\n \r\nA.&nbsp; Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nMr. and Mrs. Doe argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim against the School District for negligent infliction of emotional distress.Â  Specifically, Mr. and Mrs. Doe argue that the trial court mistakenly perceived their claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a bystander liability claim similar to that discussed in Kinard v. Augusta Sash &amp; Door Co., 286 S.C. 579, 582, 336 S.E.2d 465, 467 (1985).Â Â  Mr. and Mrs. Doe contend that their claim should have been regarded as another basis upon which emotional distress could be inflicted through negligent acts.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Kinard, this Court recognized that a parent may bring a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of injury to his or her child.Â  Kinard, 286 S.C. at 582, 336 S.E.2d at 467.Â  The Court instructed that such an action is strictly limited to the \"bystander liability\" scenario.Â  Id.Â  In order to prevail on this cause of action, a plaintiff must show that:\r\n\r\n\t(a) the negligence of the defendant caused death or serious physical injury to another;\r\n\t(b) the plaintiff bystander was in close proximity to the accident;\r\n\t(c) the plaintiff and the victim are closely related;\r\n\t(d) the plaintiff contemporaneously perceived the accident; and\r\n\t(e) the plaintiff's emotional distress manifests itself by physical symptoms capable of objective diagnosis and be established by expert testimony.\r\n\r\nId. at 582, 336 S.E.2d at 582-83.Â  This Court has not otherwise defined the parameters of a cause of action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress arising out of an injury to someone other than the plaintiff.Â Â  11 S.C. Jur. Damages Â§ 21 (1992).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn this case, Mr. and Mrs. Doe admit that they did not and cannot allege facts which would support a bystander liability cause of action.Â  Because South Carolina courts have limited the recognition of negligent infliction of emotional distress claims in circumstances such as the one presented in this case to bystander liability, Mr. and Mrs. Doe have not stated a claim which is cognizable under South Carolina law.Â \r\n \r\nTherefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing Mr. and Mrs. Doe's cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Loss of Consortium\r\nMr. and Mrs. Doe argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim for loss of consortium.Â  Mr. and Mrs. Doe contend that this Court's decision in Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 222, 479 S.E.2d 35, 47 (1996), is not dispositive in this case because Taylor dealt only with a child's claim for loss of parental consortium.Â  Additionally, Mr. and Mrs. Doe argue that the Court should acknowledge their claim because South Carolina has long acknowledged claims arising from the seduction of a child. Â We disagree.\r\nAt common law, a father possessed the right to maintain an action for the injuries of his minor child.Â  See Hughey v. Ashborn, 249 S.C. 470, 476, 154 S.E.2d 839, 841-42 (1967).Â  This right was based upon the concept that a father was entitled to compensation for the loss of services and earning capacity of his minor child.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the father could recover for other pecuniary losses, including medical expenses incurred as a result of the injury.Â  Id.Â  Conversely, the common law right of a husband to recover damages for loss of consortium resulting from the injury of his wife was more encompassing.Â  A spousal loss of consortium claim was based upon the husband's right to the companionship, aid, society, and services of his wife.Â  Cook v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 196 S.C. 230, 243-44, 13 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1941).Â  This common law right belonged only to the husband, and therefore, a wife could not recover similar damages resulting from the injury of her husband. Â Â In 1969, the South Carolina legislature adopted Code Â§ (56) 615, which is now codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (2005), to allow both spouses the right to recover for loss of consortium.Â  \r\n \r\nIn Taylor v. Medenica, this Court held that the determination of which relationships may give rise to a loss of consortium claim in South Carolina is one best left to the discretion of the legislature.Â  324 S.C. 200, 222, 479 S.E.2d 35, 47 (1996) (declining to recognize a cause of action for loss of parental consortium).Â  The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina adopted the Taylor analysis in finding that South Carolina law did not provide a cause of action for loss of consortium of a child or for filial consortium.Â  Kirkland v. Sam's East, Inc., 411 F.Supp.2d 639, 641 (D.S.C. 2005).Â  Today, we extend our Taylor analysis in holding that South Carolina law does not recognize claims for loss of filial consortium.Â  Such rights did not exist under the common law, and the legislature has not provided such a right by statute.Â  \r\n \r\nThe dissent would find that parents have a common law right to sue for loss of filial consortium despite the clear distinctions between a parent's claim for loss of services and a spouse's claim for loss of consortium found in our previous jurisprudence.Â  The cases which the dissent utilizes to support its conclusion that filial consortium claims existed at common law directly address parental claims for loss of services, not loss of filial consortium.Â  See Wright v. Colleton County, 301 S.C. 282, 289, 391 S.E.2d 564, 569 (1990) (providing that a parent's claim for loss of services and medical expenses resulting from the injury of a minor child is within the tort claims act statutory definition of \"loss\"); see also, e.g., Berger v. Charleston Consol. Ry. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 93 S.C. 372, 76 S.E. 1096 (1913) (addressing a father's action for medical expenses and loss of services of his injured child).Â  As discussed above, our common law only allowed a parent to maintain an action for the loss of a child's services and earning capacity.Â  These common law claims did not include the intangible losses of aid, companionship, and society which have traditionally defined loss of consortium claims.Â  Accordingly, in absence of some action from the legislature, this Court has no authority upon which it could rely in finding that South Carolina law recognizes claims for loss of filial consortium.\r\nAdditionally, Mr. and Mrs. Doe's claim that South Carolina's recognition of a cause of action for seduction is a valid basis for recognizing a claim for loss of filial consortium is misleading.Â  A claim for seduction requires the plaintiff to establish that the defendant, by promising to marry or through some other device, enticed the plaintiff, an unmarried chaste woman, to consent to unlawful sexual intercourse.Â  See 18 S.C. Jur. Seduction Â§ 2 (1993).Â  The right to sue upon an action for seduction belongs to the victim of the seduction.Â  See 18 S.C. Jur. Seduction Â§ 9.Â  However, traditionally, a claim for seduction was a father's (or mother's in the absence of the father) right of action for the loss of his daughter's services.Â  See 18 S.C. Jur. Seduction Â§ 8.Â  In either case, the defendant to the action must be the perpetrator of the seduction.Â  See 18 S.C. Jur. Seduction Â§ 2.Â Â  Clearly, the School District is not the perpetrator of the seduction in this case.Â  Accordingly, this Court's recognition of a claim for seduction would not lend support to Mr. and Mrs. Doe's argument that this Court should recognize a claim for loss of filial consortium.Â  \r\n \r\nBecause Mr. and Mrs. Doe's loss of consortium claim is based entirely upon their allegation of a change in their relationship with their child and not a claim for loss of services, we hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing Mr. and Mrs. Doe's claim for loss of filial consortium.\r\nC.&nbsp; Negligent Supervision\r\nMr. and Mrs. Doe contend that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim for negligent supervision.Â  We agree.Â \r\n \r\nThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act (\"TCA\") addresses the circumstances under which a governmental entity is liable for tortious conduct of its employees. Â Â The TCA states that \"a governmental entity [is] liable for [its] torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages, contained herein.\"Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005).Â Â  One limitation contained in the TCA provides that a governmental entity will not be liable for a loss resulting from any \"responsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement, or custody of any student, . . . except where the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25) (2005). Â \r\nGross negligence is defined as \"the failure to exercise slight care.\" Â Steinke v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 395, 520 S.E.2d 142, 153 (1999).Â  It has also been defined as \"the intentional, conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.\" Â Id.Â  Gross negligence \"is a relative term, and means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.\" Â Id. \r\n \r\nThe trial court found that this cause of action could survive a motion to dismiss, but only to recover for allowable damages, such as medical bills.Â  The trial court went on to find that Mr. and Mrs. Doe had not indicated any intention to present any medical bills.Â  Therefore, the trial court dismissed the claim.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Doe's complaint alleges that the School District acted with gross negligence in failing to protect their daughter from the known danger of the substitute teacher's inappropriate interest in young girls.Â  The complaint also alleges that Mr. and Mrs. Doe have incurred medical expenses as a result of the School District's negligence.[2]Â  Looking only at the face of the complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Doe's claim for negligent supervision was improperly dismissed.Â  In dismissing this claim, the trial court impermissibly looked beyond the complaint and made a determination on the facts of the case.Â  Whether Mr. and Mrs. Doe are able to show that they have incurred medical bills for which they have not already been compensated is not an issue to be determined upon a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\r\nAccordingly, based only on the allegations set forth in the complaint, the trial court erred in dismissing Mr. and Mrs. Doe's cause of action for negligent supervision.Â Â \r\n \r\nD.&nbsp; Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Assumed Duty In Loco Parentis\r\nMr. and Mrs. Doe argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claims for breach of fiduciary duty and for breach of an assumed duty in loco parentis.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn essential element in a cause of action based upon negligence is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Â Bishop v. South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998). Â Without a duty, there is no actionable negligence. Id.Â  The existence of a duty owed is a question of law for the courts.Â  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 323, 548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001).Â  \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, the trial court found that Mr. and Mrs. Doe's claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of an assumed duty in loco parentis were based only on their claim of negligent supervision.Â  The trial court further found that these causes of action were alleged as an attempt to heighten any duty owed by the School District in this situation. \r\n \r\nWe agree with the trial court's analysis of these causes of action.Â  The Legislature has clearly provided that the School District may be liable for negligent supervision of a student only if that duty was executed in a grossly negligent manner.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25).Â  Mr. and Mrs. Doe have not alleged any facts under which this Court could find another duty owed by the School District other than the duty of supervision as outlined by the Tort Claims Act.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of an assumed duty in loco parentis. \r\n \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's dismissal of Mr. and Mrs. Doe's causes of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of an assumed duty in loco parentis.Â  Additionally, we reverse the trial court's dismissal of Mr. and Mrs. Doe's causes of action for negligent supervision.Â  \r\n \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion. \r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that we should reverse the trial court's dismissal of the Does' negligent supervision claim, but I would also reinstate the loss of consortium claim.Â  Like the majority, I would uphold the trial court's dismissal of the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim and affirm the trial court's dismissal of the breach of fiduciary duty claim and the breach of an In loco parentis claim.Â  I have explained my reasoning for each of these conclusions using the order established in the majority opinion.\r\nA.&nbsp; Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nI would affirm the dismissal of this cause of action for the reasons given by the majority.\r\nB.Â  Loss of Consortium\r\nThe trial judge held that South Carolina does not recognize a cause of action for the parents' loss of their minor child's consortium.Â  The majority affirms.Â  I respectfully disagree.Â  As explained below, I believe this holding is based on a misapplication of the Court's decision in Taylor v. Medenica, Â­Â­324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996).\r\nAt common law, a man could sue for loss of his wife's consortium, but not vice-versa.Â  Berry v. Myrick, 260 S.C. 68, 194 S.E.2d 240 (1973).Â  Moreover, he could sue for loss of his minor child's services and his companionship, that is, his consortium.[3]Â  E.g., Berger v. Charleston Consol. Ry. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 93 S.C. 372, 76 S.E. 1096 (1913) (action by father for past and future medical expenses, and loss of his injured child's services); Webb v. Southern Ry. Co., 104 S.C. 89, 88 S.E. 297 (1916) (action by mother for loss of child's services and companionship); see also Wright v. Colleton County, 301 S.C. 282, 289, 391 S.E.2d 564, 569 (1990) (\"parent's claims for loss of [child's] services and [her] medical expenses are within the statutory definition of \"loss\" as contained in [tort claims act]â€¦\").Â  . Just as the common law did not permit a wife to sue for loss of her husband's consortium, it did not permit a child to sue for loss of parental services.Â  \r\n \r\nIn 1969, the General Assembly enacted what is now S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (2005), in order to abrogate the common law rule that a wife had no claim for loss of her husband's consortium.Â  See Berry v. Myrick (\"The obvious purpose of the General Assembly in enacting this provision was to extend to the wife the right to recover for the loss of consortium of her husband, which right existed only in favor of the husband under the common law\").Â  In Taylor v. Medenica, the Court was asked to recognize a cause of action by a child for loss of parental consortium claim, a claim not cognizable under common law.Â  The opinion states \"By enacting [Â§ 15-75-20] the legislature has provided for loss of consortium actions for spouses.Â  The statute has not been amended to provide for a similar cause of action for children.Â  Whether South Carolina should recognize a cause of action for loss of parental consortium is a matter best left to the General Assembly.\"Â  Taylor v. Medenica merely holds that any extension of consortium claims beyond that permitted at common law should be left to the General Assembly, not as the majority would read it, that by enacting Â§ 15-75-20 the General Assembly abolished the common law right of a parent to sue for loss of her child's consortium.\r\nSince a parent has the right to sue for loss of her child's consortium at common law,[4] a right preserved under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act,[5] I would reverse the trial court's dismissal of the Does' consortium claim.\r\nC.&nbsp; Neglect Supervision\r\nThe trial court held the Does' negligent supervision claim was proper, but noted that only medical expenses would be recoverable under this theory.Â  See Wright v. Colleton County, supra.Â  The trial court held, however, that the Does' claim must be dismissed because they pleaded no such damages.Â  I agree with the Does that they did plead these damages in paragraph 38 of their complaint.Â  I would therefore reverse the dismissal of this claim.\r\nD.&nbsp; Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Assumed Duty In Loco Parentis\r\nThe trial judge also dismissed the Does' claims for breach of an assumed duty In loco parentis and breach of fiduciary duty, finding no such heightened duties exist in a school-student setting.Â  The question of duty is one for the court.Â  E.g., Houck v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 620 S.E.2d 326 (2005).Â  I can find no error in the trial court's conclusion that these two heightened duties do not exist.Â  I agree with the majority that we should affirm the dismissal of these two claims.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons given above, I concur in part and dissent in part.\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. and Mrs. Doe's daughter is not a party to this action.Â  A separate suit was filed on her behalf and was settled at trial.\r\n[2] Mr. and Mrs. Doe allege that they have incurred medical bills for the care of their daughter as a result of this incident.Â  It is unclear from the briefs whether the medical costs resulting from this incident were considered in the settlement of their daughter's claims against the School District.Â  \r\n \r\n[3]It may be that the difference between my view and that of the majority is one of definition, and I will readily acknowledge that \"spousal consortium\" includes conjugal elements obviously not included in \"filial consortium.\"Â  I note the broadening of the term beyond the tort field in parental rights cases, where we have repeatedly spoken of a child's right to his parent's consortium.Â  E.g. SCDSS v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 627 S.E.2d 718 (2006). \r\n \r\n[4] Webb v. Southern Ry. Co., supra.\r\n[5] Wright v.

Maybank, both of Pratt-Thomas Epting &amp; Walker PA, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this civil action, the court of appeals held that a claim for attractive nuisance requires the injured child to be attracted onto the defendant's property by the nuisance which causes him or her injury.Â  Although we agree with the disposition reached by the court of appeals, we disagree with the rule found both in its opinion and in our precedent.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' decision, but modify it as outlined below.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nInternational Paper Company (IPC) owns and operates a canal that runs twenty-seven miles through Georgetown County.Â  The canal diverts water from the Pee Dee River through a system of pump stations, pipes, and trenches, and ultimately delivers the water to IPC's plant in the city of Georgetown.Â  The canal's depth is between twelve and twenty feet, and at points near the pump stations, the canal has a considerable current.Â  Allegedly, the opaqueness of the diverted river water makes neither the canal's depth nor its current apparent from a visual inspection.\r\nThe tragic events underlying this legal action occurred in 1998.Â  The record reveals that on the day in question, ten-year-old Terry Henson and his older brother went to the home of a friend where they agreed to accompany a companion to a go-cart &quot;dirt jumping hill&quot; near the city of Georgetown.Â  Apparently, the boys ventured by the canal in their journey.\r\nAs the boys walked along the canal, they came upon what the parties refer to as a &quot;pipe bridge.&quot;Â  The record indicates that the &quot;pipe bridge&quot; is simply a large pipe spanning the canal for the purpose of allowing drainage to pass from the surrounding land on one side of the canal to the other.Â  Metal bracing on part of the pipe gives the pipe the appearance of a bridge.\r\nAfter the boys used the pipe to cross the canal, they discovered a discarded cast net lying on the ground.Â  Though neither he nor his older brother could swim, Terry decided to enter the water.Â  Terry held on to one end of the cast net while his friends held on to the other end, and after being in the water for a relatively short period of time, Terry attempted to grab the metal pipe supports and lift himself out of the water.Â  In this process, Terry slipped and fell back into the water.Â  As Terry fell, his friends lost hold of their end of the cast net.Â  Sadly, Terry drowned.\r\nPetitioner instituted this wrongful death action alleging causes of action for negligence, attractive nuisance, and unguarded dangerous condition.[1]Â  At the conclusion of Petitioner's case in chief, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of IPC on the cause of action for attractive nuisance.Â  In support of this decision, the court stated &quot;the case law indicates that the reason they needed to have gone [to the canal] was that they were attracted by [the canal] . . . the evidence in this case is clear they went there for another purpose and then went to [the canal].&quot;\r\nAt the trial's conclusion, a jury found both IPC and Terry negligent in causing Terry's death.Â  Specifically, the jury attributed twenty-five percent of the fault to IPC, and seventy-five percent of the fault to Terry.Â  The jury determined Petitioner's total damages were $400,000, however, the trial court instructed the clerk to stop reading the verdict once the clerk stated that the jury had allotted seventy-five percent of the negligence to Terry.\r\nPetitioner appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in directing a verdict on the cause of action for attractive nuisance.[2]Â  The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision; reasoning that because Terry was attracted onto IPC's property by a &quot;dirt jumping hill&quot; and not by the canal, Petitioner could not claim that the canal was an attractive nuisance.Â  Henson v. Int'l Paper Co., 358 S.C. 133, 139-40, 594 S.E.2d 499, 502 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Additionally, the court of appeals held that any error in directing a verdict as to attractive nuisance was harmless because Petitioner retained causes of action for negligence and unguarded dangerous condition.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision, and Petitioner raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in \r\n\t\t\treasoning that attractive nuisance requires the injured party to be \r\n\t\t\tattracted onto the defendant's property by the very temptation which \r\n\t\t\tcauses injury?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tIf the court of appeals erred in directing a verdict as to attractive nuisance, was the error harmless?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Elements of Attractive Nuisance\r\nPetitioner argues that attractive nuisance should not require that the thing alleged to be the nuisance be the instrumentality which attracts a child onto the defendant's property.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough the common law generally imposes no duty on a landowner to protect a trespasser from hidden dangers, see Nettles v. Your Ice Co., 191 S.C. 429, 436, 4 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1939), consideration of the proclivities and instincts of children has long provided an exception to this point in premises liability.Â  As this Court has stated:\r\n\r\n\t[O]ne who artificially creates upon his premises any dangerous thing which from its nature has a tendency to attract the childish instincts of children to play with it is bound, as a mere matter of social duty, to take such reasonable precautions as the circumstances admit of, to the end that they may be protected from injury while so playing with it, or coming in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nFranks v. S. Cotton Oil Co., 78 S.C. 10, 15, 58 S.E.2d 960, 961 (1907) (citing Seymour D. Thompson, 1 Commentaries on the Law of Negligence in all Relations Â§ 1024 (2d ed. 1901) [hereinafter Thompson on Negligence]).Â  In South Carolina, this consideration of children's susceptibility to fail to perceive the risks of encountering dangerous instrumentalities or conditions has evolved into two exceptions to the common law's general preclusion of a trespasser's ability to maintain a cause of action for premises liability.Â  These exceptions have commonly been termed &quot;attractive nuisance&quot; and &quot;unguarded dangerous condition.&quot;\r\nAttractive nuisance doctrine provides that where the owner or occupier of land brings or artificially creates something which, from its nature, is especially attractive to children, he is bound to take reasonable pains to see that the dangerous thing is so guarded that children will not be injured in coming into contact with it.Â  Franks, 78 S.C. at 15, 58 S.E.2d at 961.Â  South Carolina courts first recognized attractive nuisance in the &quot;turntable cases.&quot;Â  These cases held that infants could recover damages from railroad companies for injuries caused by the failure to lock or properly guard railroad turntables.Â  Bridger v. Asheville and Spartanburg R.R. Co., 25 S.C. 24 (1886).\r\nAt one time, the United States Supreme Court suggested that the dangerous condition or instrument must have attracted the child onto the defendant's property in order to hold a party liable under a theory of attractive nuisance.Â  United Zinc &amp; Chem. Co. v. Britt, 258 U.S. 268, 276 (1922).[3]Â  Although the majority of our attractive nuisance jurisprudence pays little attention to the reasons for an injured child's presence on the property, IPC correctly argues that this concept, sometimes referred to as the &quot;property line&quot; rule, eventually crept into this Court's jurisprudence.Â  See Kirven v. Askins, 253 S.C. 110, 117, 169 S.E.2d 139, 142 (1969); Daniels v. Timmons, 216 S.C. 539, 550-51, 59 S.E.2d 149, 155 (1950); and Hancock v. Aiken Mills, 180 S.C. 93, 104, 185 S.E. 188, 193 (1936).Â  See also Miller v. Perry, 308 F.Supp. 863 (D. S.C. 1970).Â  This case requires us to determine whether this creeping was justified, and whether our jurisprudence should provide a home for the property line rule.Â  We conclude that both answers are &quot;no.&quot;\r\nA close examination of the property line rule's origins is instructive.Â  Because trespassers were generally barred from recovering from a landowner, attractive nuisance doctrine needed to either amend trespasser liability doctrine for children or create a status for these children other than that of a trespasser.Â  Early case law in this area illustrates that courts solved this dilemma by providing that one who creates an artificial condition on his land that is dangerous to children yet, at the same time, attracts them onto his land to &quot;play in, swim in, or wade in&quot; it, has granted a child an &quot;implied license&quot; to enter his property.Â  Miller, 308 F.Supp at 865; see also Britt, 258 U.S. at 276 (stating &quot;[t]here can be no general duty on the part of a land-owner to keep his land safe for children, or even free from hidden dangers, if he has not directly or by implication invited or licensed them to come there.&quot;).Â  Viewed through this lens, the property line rule appears justified given that a landowner cannot have extended an implied invitation to enter his property to the child who trespasses for a purpose other than to pursue amusement with the thing that ultimately causes him injury.\r\nIn South Carolina, however, the usefulness of this distinction is severely weakened after examining attractive nuisance's companion doctrine of unguarded dangerous condition.Â  Quite unlike its counterpart, unguarded dangerous condition disregards the element of attraction; both to the property and to the danger.Â  See Everett v. White, 245 S.C. 331, 335, 140 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1965) (providing that although an artificial condition may not have special attraction for children, when the condition is left so exposed that children are likely to come into contact with it, and where their coming into contact with it is dangerous to them, the person exposing the dangerous thing should anticipate the injury that is likely to happen and is bound to take reasonable pains to prevent it); see also Franks, 78 S.C. at 15, 58 S.E.2d at 961.Â  Instead of justifying this exception on an implied license to enter another's land, we have recognized that liability in unguarded dangerous condition situations is based upon &quot;a mere matter of social duty.&quot;Â  Franks, 78 S.C. at 15, 58 S.E.2d at 961 (discussing both attractive nuisance and unguarded dangerous condition). \r\n \r\nThough tort law often involves drawing seemingly arbitrary distinctions, it is said that judicial line drawing obligates a court to justify its choice.Â  In this effort, we think recognizing the property line rule in attractive nuisance doctrine is intellectually inconsistent with allowing landowner liability under unguarded dangerous condition theory.Â  In our view, it would be improper to anchor one of these companion theories in the fiction of an implied license, and ground the other in a social duty.Â  As a matter of consistency, we find that these theories, long-recognized as being closely related, are not grounded in traditional tort concepts.Â  See Thompson on Negligence Â§ 1042: Owners of Property Leaving Dangerous Objects Unguarded, Liable to Trespassing Children.Â  Instead, these concepts rest on the consideration of the fact that the proclivities and instincts of young children sometimes lead them to seek amusement with artificially created conditions that can cause them serious injury.[4]\r\nAlthough an analysis of precedent may, to some degree, seem unnecessary given that we have found recognition of the property line rule to be inadvisable as a matter of doctrinal consistency, an examination of this Court's premises liability jurisprudence reveals that while the property line rule has appeared in this Court's decisions with some frequency, it has never been faithfully applied.Â  To exhibit this, we focus on the two cases relied upon directly by the court of appeals in the instant case.Â  \r\n \r\nIn Hancock v. Aiken Mills, 180 S.C. 93, 185 S.E. 188 (1936), this Court reversed a damages award to a thirteen-year-old boy who sustained serious burns when he stood near a fire workmen built and watched the workmen as they repaired a neighboring home.Â  Although the language of the property line rule appears in that case, the strongest justification for dismissing the suit was that the child admittedly did not encounter the fire due to a failure to appreciate its danger or a desire to play with it.Â  Id. at 100, 185 S.E. at 191-92.Â  We think the Hancock decision properly expresses considerable doubt as to whether a fire-with dangerousness apparent to even young children-could qualify as an attractive nuisance. Â Id. at 107, 185 S.E. at 194.Â  Additionally, because the fire in Hancock was on land the plaintiff's family rented, id. at 95, 185 S.E. at 189, the property line rule would require dismissal on that ground alone.\r\nThe second case relied upon by the court of appeals fares no better.Â  In Kirven v. Askins, 253 S.C. 110, 169 S.E.2d 139 (1969), this Court affirmed a decision setting aside a jury verdict for a twelve-year-old child who sustained injuries to his eye as a result of being struck by a clod of dirt thrown by another child.Â  Instead of disposing of the case based upon the reasons for the injured child's presence on the property, the Court relied primarily on a line of cases which held that similar construction materials were not inherently dangerous to children and that leaving these materials on a construction site did not create an unreasonably dangerous situation.Â  Id. at 117, 169 S.E.2d at 142.Â  Though the property line language undeniably appears in this opinion, the rule was of minimal relevance to the Court's holding.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, both the trial court and the court of appeals understandably relied on our precedent in reaching their conclusions, but our examination has revealed that the property line rule has only haphazardly appeared and rarely, if ever, been applied in South Carolina.Â  When this is coupled with the fact that we have held this rule cannot co-exist with other firmly-rooted aspects of our premises liability jurisprudence, any case that can be made in favor of adopting the property line rule is a slim one.Â  The better view, in our opinion, is to reject the property line rule's rigid framework as inconsistent with the aforementioned quotation from Franks, which has long-served as the guiding principle in our attractive nuisance jurisprudence.Â  \r\n \r\nFor these reasons, we hold the trial court erred in reasoning that attractive nuisance requires the injured child to be attracted onto the defendant's property by the very temptation which causes injury.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nIPC argues that any error in striking the attractive nuisance cause of action was harmless.Â  We agree.\r\nAn examination of the trial court's jury charges reveals that this must be so.Â  In the instant case, the trial court charged the jury that a child is not required to conform to an adult standard of care, and that a child's conduct is judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of similar age, intelligence and experience.Â  Furthermore, the court stated that a child may be so young as to be incapable of exercising the attention, perception, knowledge, experience, intelligence, and judgment which are necessary to enable the child to perceive a risk and to realize its unreasonable character.Â  In other words, the trial court charged the jury that it should consider Terry's age, childish instincts, and proclivities in determining liability.\r\nThese charges captured the distinctive characteristics of an attractive nuisance claim.Â  The trial court made no mention of the common law's general defense to a premises liability action brought by a trespasser. Â Instead, the trial court charged that IPC's conduct should be judged according to a negligence standard, and the jury received the instant case with instructions that the standard by which Terry's actions would be judged included consideration of Terry's age and his corresponding ability to understand and appreciate risks.Â  Although the court did not identify these principles as attractive nuisance doctrine, the record reveals that the jury was nonetheless charged to consider this theory of liability. Â \r\nFurthermore, the jury's verdict in favor of IPC ultimately precludes an award under an attractive nuisance theory.Â  In addition to attractive nuisance, the jury in this case was charged on the law of unguarded dangerous condition. Â By allotting to Terry the majority of the fault for causing his injury, there is no reasonable interpretation of the verdict other than providing &quot;however Terry came in contact with the canal, the canal was not an unreasonable danger to him.&quot;Â  Like unguarded dangerous condition, attractive nuisance is premised upon the existence of a condition that poses an unreasonable danger to children.Â  Without the necessary predicate of an unreasonably dangerous condition, recovery under an attractive nuisance theory was not possible.[5]\r\nThe instant case presents a ripe opportunity to provide some much needed clarity in this area of the law.Â  Though Petitioner's complaint, likely taking its cue from our case law, offered &quot;negligence, attractive nuisance, and unguarded dangerous condition&quot; as separate and distinct causes of action, we find this presentation to be not entirely accurate.Â  Negligence refers to a standard of care, and to be actionable, negligence requires a duty running from the alleged tortfeasor to the injured party.Â  In this case, Petitioner sought to hold IPC liable for neglecting its duty to protect Terry, a child trespasser, on IPC's premises. Â \r\nThe cause of action in these cases is a claim for premises liability.Â  Relying on the social duty to protect children from dangers of which they, through their childish instincts, are unlikely to become aware, courts created the doctrines of attractive nuisance and unguarded dangerous condition as exceptions to the general rule that there is typically no cause of action when a trespasser is injured by a dangerous condition on another's land.[6]Â  Although the importance lies in the legal standards created and not necessarily in the nomenclature, this clarification should aid lower courts in applying the principles we have set forth in this decision.\r\nIn that same vein, we believe that by recognizing a duty to protect children from dangers to which they will not be attracted, and by disregarding the element of the child's attraction onto a landowner's property, any significant distinction between attractive nuisance and unguarded dangerous condition has outlived its usefulness.Â  We think the better view is that there is but a single exception to the trespasser's rule in premises liability suits: dangerous conditions that injure children.Â  This view is consistent with the Restatement (Second) Â§ 339, which has been widely accepted in this area.Â  The section provides:\r\n\r\n\tA possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to children trespassing thereon caused by an artificial condition upon the land if\r\n\t(a) the place where the condition exists is one upon which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and\r\n\t(b) the condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children, and\r\n\t(c) the children because of their youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and\r\n\t(d) the utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and\r\n\t(e) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.\r\n\r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 339 (1965).Â  \r\n \r\nWe find the Restatement to be a succinct and effective presentation of the considerations which courts should weigh in deciding these cases.Â  Accordingly, as it is this Court's duty to declare the common law of South Carolina, see Russo v. Sutton, 310 S.C. 200, 204, 422 S.E.2d 750, 753 (1992), we adopt Restatement (Second) Â§ 339 and hold that future premises liability cases brought by or on behalf of child trespassers should be decided in accordance with the principles outlined in that section.[7]\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we modify the court of appeals' decision, and affirm.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Howard P. King, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] These were the designations Petitioner used to identify the claims presented in the complaint.Â  Also, Petitioner initially named IPC, Georgetown Steel Corporation, the city of Georgetown, and Georgetown County as defendants.Â  By the time of trial, however, IPC was the sole defendant.\r\n[2] Petitioner also argued the jury's verdict was inconsistent on its face.Â  This issue was not presented for our review.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Of course, Britt addressed this issue as a matter of Kansas common law. Â The non-binding nature of the opinion, however, is not pivotal to its informativeness.\r\n[4] We believe the movement away from an &quot;implied license&quot; rationale in these cases is likely responsible for the property line rule's declining popularity.

Rev. 835, 849-50 (2005) (discussing the rule's decline and the rising popularity of the Restatement (Second) of Torts: Artificial Conditions Highly Dangerous to Trespassing Children Â§ 339 (1965)).\r\n[5] Petitioner strenuously argues that, although attractive nuisance and unguarded dangerous condition are companion theories, attractive nuisance creates a higher standard of care for a landowner.Â  We believe this argument is resoundingly rejected by our precedent, see Daniels, 216 S.C. at 550-51, 59 S.E.2d at 155 (stating that attractive nuisance cases spring from the negligence of the defendant landowner in regard to his or her property which is subject to being entered upon by children); see also Bridger, 25 S.C. at 25-28 (stating that the turntable cases arise out of the negligence of railroad companies in leaving their turntables unlocked or unprotected, and further defining negligence as the absence of due care).Â  Furthermore, we decline to read &quot;reasonable pains&quot; to provide a &quot;negligence plus&quot; standard in one context and a simple negligence standard in another.Â  Compare Everett, 245 S.C. at 335, 140 S.E.2d at 584 (discussing the duty to take reasonable pains to protect children from an unguarded dangerous condition), with Franks, 78 S.C. at 15, 58 S.E.2d at 961 (discussing the landowner's duty to take reasonable pains to prevent injury to children in attractive nuisance cases). \r\n \r\n[6] We reiterate that these exceptions apply only in cases involving artificially created dangerous conditions.Â  See Byrd v. Melton, 259 S.C. 271, 276, 191 S.E.2d 515, 517 (1972). \r\n \r\n[7] As a final point of instruction, we specify that where a landowner defines the borders of his property or of an artificial condition on his property by fence or other barrier, and such fence or barrier is of a type that should reasonably be expected to exclude children or to place children on notice that their presence is not welcome, recovery for injuries to child trespassers should generally be precluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26375","title":"Strickland v.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-150 (Supp. 2006) (the &quot;continued cohabitation&quot; statute).\r\nThe family court agreed with Husband and dismissed Wife's complaint, holding that her claims for both past due and ongoing alimony were barred by laches.[1]Â  The court additionally found that Husband had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Wife had continuously cohabitated with another man within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-150.Â  Wife and Husband each appealed from the trial court's ruling.\r\nThe case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  The parties raise the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in \r\n\t\t\tdismissing Wife's claims to enforce her alimony award based on the \r\n\t\t\tdoctrine of laches?&nbsp; (Wife's issue on appeal)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in \r\n\t\t\tfailing to terminate alimony because Wife had continuously \r\n\t\t\tcohabitated with another man for a period of ninety or more \r\n\t\t\tconsecutive days?&nbsp; (Husband's issue on appeal)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â Â Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  This broad scope of review does not require the reviewing court to disregard the findings of the family court; appellate courts should be mindful that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, sits in a better position to evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to the testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Laches\r\nWife argues that the family court erred in dismissing her claims to enforce her alimony award based on the doctrine of laches.Â  We agree.\r\nLaches is an equitable doctrine defined as &quot;neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  In order to establish laches as a defense, a defendant must show that the complaining party unreasonably delayed its assertion of a right, resulting in prejudice to the defendant.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 368 S.C. 602, 606, 629 S.E.2d 388, 391 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nOn previous occasions, this Court has alluded to the inapplicability of the defense of laches in actions to enforce a court order.Â  In Jefferson Pilot Life Insurance Co. v. Gum, 302 S.C. 8, 393 S.E.2d 180 (1990), Husband was required pursuant to a 1974 divorce decree to name Wife #1 as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy.Â  Id. at 9, 393 S.E.2d at 181.Â  In 1976, Wife #1 learned Husband had changed the beneficiary to Wife #2 and thereafter, Wife #1 obtained several court orders to reinstitute herself as the beneficiary of the policy, the final order to this effect being issued in 1980.Â  Despite these proceedings, Wife #1 was aware that Husband never designated her as beneficiary.Â  After Husband's death in 1987, Wife #1 and Wife #2 both brought claims seeking the insurance policy proceeds.Â  The trial court granted Wife #2's motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of laches.Â  Id. at 9-10, 393 S.E.2d at 181.Â Â  \r\n \r\nOn appeal, this Court found that because there had been no modification to the court's order designating Wife #1 as the beneficiary, Husband was &quot;still under an obligation&quot; by order of the court to designate her as such.Â  Id. at 11, 393 S.E.2d at 182.Â  Therefore, the Court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on laches to Wife #2.Â  Id. at 12, 393 S.E.2d at 182.Â  \r\n \r\nIn our opinion, this Court's reasoning in Jefferson Pilot is equally applicable to a family court award of alimony.Â  Although the equitable nature of laches generally comports with the family court's equitable jurisdiction in determining support and maintenance between former spouses, the concept of &quot;inexcusable delay&quot; in the laches defense is inconsistent with the judicial authority inherent in a court order.Â  Because court orders awarding support and maintenance do not have an expiration date, allowing a party to avoid compliance based solely on the oblique notion of delay only serves to undermine the authority of the court.Â  See also Stephens v. Hamrick, 358 S.E.2d 547, 549 (N.C. Ct. App. 1987) (holding that the doctrine of laches does not bar the enforcement of a court order for child support because &quot;the obligation to furnish support is continuous [and therefore] a lapse of time will not be a bar to commencement of an enforcement action.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we hold that laches is not a defense to a claim for the enforcement of an alimony award and that therefore, the family court erred in applying laches as a defense to both Wife's claim for past due alimony and Wife's claim for ongoing alimony.[2]\r\nIn holding as we do today, we do not seek to limit the concept of fairness underlying actions in equity.Â  Instead, we believe that a court's focus in deciding an issue related to the enforcement of an alimony obligation should be on the equity of enforcing the court order rather than the general application of equitable defenses. In this context, we find that the theory of equitable estoppel appropriately balances principles of equity and judicial authority when the underlying facts of a case call into question the equity of enforcing a court order.Â  Â Â \r\nThe essential elements of equitable estoppel are divided between the estopped party and the party claiming estoppel.Â  Kelley, 368 S.C. at 608, 629 S.E.2d at 392.Â  The elements of equitable estoppel as related to the party being estopped are: (1) conduct which amounts to a false representation, or conduct which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge of the real facts.Â  The party asserting estoppel must show: (1) lack of knowledge, and the means of knowledge, of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and (3) a prejudicial change of position in reliance on the conduct of the party being estopped.Â  Boyd v. BellSouth Tel. Tel. Co., Inc., 369 S.C. 410, 422, 633 S.E.2d 136, 142 (2006). As the elements exhibit, equitable estoppel is based on affirmative conduct between the parties.Â  In our opinion, contesting the enforcement of a court order based on the affirmative conduct of the parties is less offensive to judicial authority than the emphasis on the lack of conduct by a party inherent in the defense of laches.Â  Accordingly, we hold that equitable estoppel is the appropriate defense to an action for the enforcement of a court order for support and maintenance.Â \r\n \r\nTurning to the instant case, we recognize that affirmative defenses to a cause of action in any pleading must generally be asserted in a party's responsive pleading.Â  Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 20-21, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Rule 12, SCRCP).Â  Therefore, because Husband only asserted laches as an affirmative defense, the question of whether Wife is equitably estopped from enforcing past due alimony is not squarely preserved in the instant case.Â  See id. (noting that an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for review).Â  Noting the equitable foundation of this case, we next consider whether a decision by this Court on the merits of equitable estoppel is appropriate under these circumstances.Â \r\n \r\nLaches is an equitable doctrine which arises upon the failure to assert a known right.Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 215, 603 S.E.2d 598, 602 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The equitable doctrine of laches is equivalent to the legal doctrine of waiver, which is the &quot;voluntary and intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,&quot; Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994).Â  Both laches and waiver require a party to have known of a right, and known that the party was abandoning that right.Â \r\n \r\nThe doctrine of equitable estoppel may be enforced in a court of law as well as in equity matters.Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992).Â  Often confused with waiver, equitable estoppel focuses on a party's detrimental reliance on another party's conduct while a waiver analysis focuses on a party's &quot;unequivocal intent to relinquish a known right.&quot;Â  7 S.C. Jur. Estoppel and Waiver Â§ 17 (1991).Â  Nevertheless, this Court has acknowledged that &quot;the distinction between waiver and estoppel is close, and sometimes the doctrines merge into each other with almost imperceptible gradations.&quot;&nbsp; Parker, 313 S.C. at 487, 443 S.E.2d at 391 (quoting Janasik, 307 S.C. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 388).\r\nGiven their derivation from the legal doctrine of waiver, we note that the doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel may be similarly indistinct at times.Â  For example, one who delays unreasonably could be said to be estopped from asserting a claim if another has relied on that delay to his detriment.Â  See 7 S.C. Jur. Estoppel and Waiver Â§ 28.Â  Thus, it is possible to assert only one of these equitable defenses - yet have successfully pled both.\r\nIn the instant case, we find this precise scenario to have occurred.Â  As it is argued in the pleadings and briefs, Husband's laches defense is virtually indistinguishable from an equitable estoppel defense - the underlying concept of waiver being the essence of Husband's argument.Â  Therefore, regardless of the &quot;laches&quot; title assigned to his argument, we find that equity demands that this Court consider whether Wife is equitably estopped from pursuing her claim for past due alimony.Â  See also Rule 15(b), SCRCP (&quot;When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.&quot;).Â \r\n \r\nTurning to the merits, we find that Wife's claim for past due alimony is barred under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.Â  Beginning as early as 1990, Wife's conduct conveyed the impression that she was willing to accept alimony in an amount different from that articulated in the 1988 divorce decree.Â  Wife accepted Husband's $300 monthly alimony payments for seven years and further testified that she &quot;agreed on [$300 per month] as long as I could make my other payments - because he was trying to get straightened out.Â  Furthermore, Wife pursued no alimony - other than a single request in July 1998[3] - when Husband's monthly payments altogether ceased, testifying that at that time, &quot;I told him as long as I could make it that I would not go after him.&quot; \r\n \r\nFurthermore, Wife intended Husband to rely on her actions and assertions.Â  Wife's communication with Husband and use of the court system early on indicate that she was clearly aware of Husband's financial situation as well as the procedure for modification or enforcement of the alimony award.Â  Wife herself initiated the claim which resulted in the 1992 consent order for Husband's alimony payments to be made directly to Wife and for the arrears to be &quot;worked out between the parties.&quot;Â  Later in 1992, Wife went so far as to initiate a claim to reduce the amount of alimony to $500 per month.[4]Â  In our opinion, the trial court correctly determined that between 1990 and 2004, Wife &quot;by her actions, and her inactions, lulled [Husband] into thinking they had resolved the issue between themselves and that he did not need to take any actions to protect himself by attempting to have the Court reduce or terminate his alimony.&quot;Â  Â \r\nMoreover, other than her 1990 contempt action for alimony in arrears, Husband had no indication that Wife was dissatisfied with the parties' own terms of alimony.Â  In light of Wife's 1992 court appearances, Husband justifiably relied on Wife's assertions that she did not need alimony on the terms ordered by the divorce decree.Â  Specifically, the consent order for the parties to settle the issue of arrears themselves, and Wife's subsequent initiation of a claim to significantly reduce alimony to an amount closer to that which Husband was actually paying at the time, gave Husband no reason to believe that he either needed to seek modification of alimony in light of his financial situation or ultimately face accountability for the entire amount dating back to the 1988 divorce decree. Â Â Â \r\nLastly, Husband was prejudiced in relying on Wife's assurances that the parties had settled all issues related to alimony.Â  The facts show, and the trial court correctly found, that Husband would not have incurred substantial farm debt beginning in 2004 if he had known he would ultimately be responsible for the full amount of his alimony obligation.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough Husband's almost immediate failure to adhere to the divorce decree, or at the very least seek a modification of alimony at that time, is unacceptable, Wife's assurances and reassurances that Husband need only pay what he could justifiably resulted in Husband's belief that his past due alimony obligations had been settled between them.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Wife is equitably estopped from bringing a claim for enforcement of past due alimony against Husband.[5]Â  Â Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Continuous cohabitation as a bar to alimony\r\nHusband argues that the family court erred in failing to find that Wife was no longer entitled to alimony because she had continuously cohabited with another man for the last seven years.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-150 provides that permanent alimony and support requirements of a supporting spouse will terminate &quot;upon the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse.&quot;Â  Unless another meaning has been agreed to in writing, Â§ 20-3-150 defines &quot;continued cohabitation&quot; as when:\r\n\r\n\tthe supported spouse resides with another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more consecutive days. . . . [or] there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with another person in a romantic relationship for periods of less than ninety days and the two periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIf a statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, then the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and a court has no right to impose another meaning.Â  Vaughan v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., __ S.C. ___, ___, 642 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2007).Â  The words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction which limit or expand the statute's operation.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough neither party disputes that Wife has been in a &quot;romantic relationship&quot; for more than seven years, Husband attempts to bypass the statute's other requirements for termination of alimony by refusing to interpret the phrase &quot;resides with another person&quot; on its face.Â  We find that the phrase &quot;resides with&quot; in the context of Â§ 20-3-150 sets forth a requirement that the supported spouse live under the same roof as the person with whom they are romantically involved for at least ninety consecutive days.Â  Any other interpretation essentially takes the &quot;cohabitation&quot; out of &quot;continued cohabitation.&quot;Â  Because Husband admits that Wife and her boyfriend do not live together in this fashion, and further, does not contend that their living arrangement is an attempt to circumvent the statute, Husband has not shown that Wife's relationship with another man amounts to &quot;continued cohabitation&quot; under Â§ 20-3-150.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's refusal to terminate Husband's ongoing alimony obligation under Â§ 20-3-150.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that laches is not a defense to claims for either past due or ongoing alimony.Â  Rather, we hold that equitable estoppel is the appropriate defense to the enforcement of a court order for support and maintenance.Â  We therefore affirm the decision of the family court dismissing Wife's claim for past due alimony on the modified grounds that Wife is equitably estopped from collecting alimony in arrears.Â  As to ongoing alimony, we vacate the decision of the family court finding laches barred Wife's claim for ongoing alimony and affirm the family court's refusal to terminate ongoing alimony pursuant to the continuous cohabitation statute.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Michael Baxley, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority's disposition of this appeal, but write separately because the fact the obligation sought to be enforced arises by virtue of a court order does not, in my opinion, preclude a plea of laches.Â  While I appreciate the majority's sensitivity to the dignity of court orders, I do not see that interposing either laches or equitable estoppel in any way undermines a court's authority.Â  These bars lie to prevent a party from enforcing a stale order, while the court's authority is vindicated through its contempt powers.Â  Further, I do not agree with the application of equitable estoppel to these facts.Â  The former husband was aware from the May 1992 consent order that he was obligated to pay his former wife $1200/month alimony and to make up arrearages as the parties agreed, and was aware that for many years his former wife had accepted less alimony than she was entitled to under this order.Â  Assuming his former wife meant for him to believe that she was satisfied with the underpayments when she in fact was not, and assuming he relied upon her &quot;false representation,&quot; this does not change his actual or constructive knowledge of the &quot;true facts&quot;:Â  he had, for years, failed to meet his court-ordered alimony obligation.\r\nI would affirm the family court order barring the request for alimony arrearages on the ground of laches, affirm the refusal to terminate alimony under the &quot;continual habitation&quot; statute, and reverse the order barring future alimony payments on the ground of laches.\r\n \r\n\r\n[1] Although Husband only asserted that laches barred Wife's claims for past due alimony, the order of the family court decreed that laches barred Wife's claims for both past due and ongoing alimony.Â \r\n \r\n[2] Recently, the court of appeals determined in Kelley v. Kelley, 368 S.C. 602, 629 S.E.2d 388, that the doctrine of laches only acts to bar a spouse's claim for past due alimony payments, but will not apply to bar a claim for future alimony payments. Â Id. at 606 n.2, 629 S.E.2d at 391 n.2.Â  Our opinion today vacates this portion of Kelley.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Wife requested $500 for home renovations.Â  \r\n \r\n[4] Wife apparently initiated the claim and had Husband sign an affidavit saying he agreed to the modification of alimony.Â  When Husband did not appear at the hearing, Wife withdrew the claim.Â  Husband's undisputed testimony was that Wife led him to believe that his only responsibility in the matter was to sign the affidavit, and further, that he never received notice of the hearing.Â  \r\n \r\n[5] Â Given that Husband only asserted that laches barred Wife's claims for past due alimony, we do not consider whether Wife is equitably estopped from enforcing the alimony obligation on a going-forward basis.Â  For this reason, we vacate the portion of the trial court's decision holding that Wife's claim for ongoing alimony is barred by laches.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William Glenn Rogers, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2007-08-17-01","description":"This is an order placing an attorney on interim suspension.","date":"2007-08-27","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of William Glenn Rogers, Jr.,\tRespondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondent's clients' interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n \r\n IT IS ORDERED that respondent's license to practice law in this state is suspended until further order of the Court.\r\n IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Dennis N.

The appeal pending before the Court of Appeals was certified to   this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, by order dated August 3, 2007.   Appellants have now filed a Motion to Determine Jurisdiction and Alternatively   for an Extension of Time to File Appellants' Initial Brief. Therein, appellants   ask this Court to make a determination as to the proper jurisdiction for this   appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. &Acirc;&sect; 42-17-60 (Supp. 2006) previously   provided that an appeal from a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission   shall be to the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the alleged   accident occurred or in which the employer resides or has his principal office.   On June 25, 2007, the statute was amended by 2007 Act No. 111 to require such   appeals be made to the Court of Appeals. However, Part IV, Section 2 of Act 111   states the following: &quot;Except as otherwise provided for in this act, this act   takes effect July 1, 2007, or, if ratified after July 1, 2007, and except   otherwise stated, upon approval by the Governor and applies to injuries that   occur on or after this date.&quot; (Emphasis added).\r\nThe cardinal rule in interpreting Act 111 is to   ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Davis v. School Dist.   of Greenville County, 374 S.C. 39, 647 S.E.2d 219 (2007). Where the language   is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of   statutory interpretation are not needed and the Court has no right to impose   another meaning. State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144   (2007).\r\nThe language of Act 111 is not ambiguous and clearly   states that it applies only to injuries that occur on or after July 1, 2007.   Therefore, the change regarding the appeal procedure, like all other provisions   of the Act, is only applicable to Workers' Compensation cases in which the   injury occurred on or after July 1, 2007.\r\nThe injury at issue in the case at hand occurred on   January 30, 2002, clearly prior to July 1, 2007. Accordingly, the amendments set   forth in Act 111 do not apply and, applying the former version of section   42-17-60, jurisdiction over this appeal lies in the Court of Common Pleas. We   therefore dismiss the notice of appeal filed in the Court of Appeals and   certified to this Court, and the appeal shall instead proceed as filed in the   Court of Common Pleas. Appellants' request to hold the timelines for this appeal   in abeyance or, in the alternative, to grant them an extension of time to file   their initial brief, is denied as moot.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.
