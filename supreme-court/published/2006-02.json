McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, and Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia, and John R. Justice, of Chester, for Petitioner.\r\n        Acting Deputy Chief Attorney Wanda H. Carter, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ reversal of the conviction of Gerald Means (Respondent) based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction by the circuit court.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nA county grand jury issued the following indictment against Respondent in March 2001:\r\n\r\n  INDICTMENT FOR CRIMINAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - AGGRAVATED\r\n    That Gerald Means did in Chester County on or about December 16, 2000, did [sic] commit an act of violence against one Natalie Flynn with whom he has two children.\r\n\r\nPrior to Respondentâ€™s trial in August 2001, the solicitor moved to amend the indictment to ensure it properly alleged criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) by adding, in handwriting, the following emphasized phrase:\r\n\r\n  That Gerald Means did in Chester County on or about December 16, 2000 did [sic] commit an act of violence against one Natalie Flynn with whom he has two children, such act of violence being of a high and aggravated nature. \r\n\r\nThe solicitor believed the indictment was defective as originally issued and moved to amend it â€œprior to calling this case in order to avoid any unfair surprise to [Respondent and his counsel].â€Â  The solicitor further asserted the defect was merely a â€œclerical errorâ€ because the proposed amendment would not alter the nature of the offense charged.Â  \r\nRespondent objected to the untimely amendment of the indictment and noted the proposed change was in the charging language.Â  Asked by the trial judge whether Respondent was prejudiced by the amendment, counsel stated â€œ[w]e were prepared for criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature, I have to admit that.â€\r\nThe trial judge granted the Stateâ€™s motion to amend the indictment.Â  Respondent subsequently was convicted of CDVHAN and sentenced to nine years in prison.\r\nA divided Court of Appeals vacated the conviction, concluding the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the case due to the improper amendment of an insufficient indictment.Â  State v. Means, Op. No. 2003-UP-633 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 23, 2003) (unpublished opinion).Â  The majority reasoned the amendment changed the nature of the offense charged, transforming it from a charge of criminal domestic violence in which Respondent faced a maximum sentence of thirty days into a charge of CDVHAN in which the maximum sentence was ten years.[1]Â  The majority noted the offense of CDVHAN requires the State to prove an element not contained in a CDV charge, namely, at least one element of the common law crime of ABHAN.[2]Â  The majority found that the term â€œaggravatedâ€ in the indictment caption was insufficient to uphold the validity of the amended indictment.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in vacating Respondentâ€™s conviction on the ground that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in light of State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)?\r\n\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nThe State contends the Court of Appeals erred in vacating Respondentâ€™s conviction in light of Gentry, which we decided after the Court of Appeals decided the present appeal.Â  We agree.[3]\r\nAs we recently explained, \r\n\r\n  In Gentry, we abandoned the view that, in criminal matters, the circuit court acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear a particular case by way of a valid indictment by either a county or state grand jury. Â Under the former approach, except for certain minor offenses, the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction in a criminal case unless there was an indictment which sufficiently stated an offense, the defendant had waived presentment of the indictment to the grand jury, or the charge was a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment. Under that former approach, a defective or insufficient indictment could result in a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which is a matter that may be raised at any time, including on direct appeal, in a [post-conviction relief] action, or sua sponte by the trial or appellate courts.\r\n  In Gentry, taking our cue from the United States Supreme Court and in keeping with our view of subject matter jurisdiction in civil cases, we explained that the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court and the sufficiency of an indictment are two distinct concepts.Â  â€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Gentry, [363 S.C. at 100, 610 S.E.2d at 498]; see also Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000) (stating same principle); Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (stating same principle); S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (â€œThe Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.â€).\r\n  In Gentry, then, we returned to our earlier view that an indictment is a â€œnotice document,â€ albeit one required by our state constitution and statutes.Â  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11 and art. V, Â§ 22 [footnote omitted]; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003) (â€œ[n]o person shall be held to answer in any court for an alleged crime or offense, unless upon indictment by a grand juryâ€ except in specified instances). Â The primary purposes of an indictment are to put the defendant on notice of what he is called upon to answer, i.e., to apprise him of the elements of the offense and to allow him to decide whether to plead guilty or stand trial, and to enable the circuit court to know what judgment to pronounce if the defendant is convicted.Â  Gentry, [363 S.C. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500]; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  This required notice is a component of the due process that is accorded every criminal defendant.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3. Â Given that the sufficiency of an indictment will no longer be considered an issue of subject matter jurisdiction which may be raised at any time, we applied the general rule regarding preservation of error and held that a defendant must raise an issue regarding the sufficiency of the indictment before the jury is sworn in order to preserve the error for direct appellate review.Â  Gentry, [363 S.C. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499] (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003)).\r\n\r\nEvans v. State, 363 S.C. 495, 507-09, 611 S.E.2d 510, 516-17 (2005); see also State v. Smalls, 364 S.C. 343, 346-48, 613 S.E.2d 754, 756-57 (2005) (applying Gentry and Evans to hold that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea where the defendant had not been indicted for the charge to which he pled guilty, but signed a sentencing sheet which constituted a written waiver of the right to have the charge presented to a grand jury and also signified the defendant had been notified of the charge to which he pled guilty).\r\nWe conclude, pursuant to Gentry, the Court of Appeals erred in finding the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in Respondentâ€™s case.Â  An indictment which allegedly is improperly amended no longer raises a question of subject matter jurisdiction; it instead raises a question of whether a defendant properly received notice he would be tried for a particular crime.Â  We take this opportunity to explain how, post-Gentry, the Stateâ€™s pretrial motion to amend an indictment should be analyzed.Â  The analysis remains largely the same as it was under pre-Gentry law, although it is now driven by concepts of notice and due process. \r\nA defendant has a constitutional and statutory right to demand that a properly constituted grand jury consider his case and decide whether to issue a sufficient indictment.Â  â€œThe primary purposes of an indictment are to put the defendant on notice of what he is called upon to answer, i.e., to apprise him of the elements of the offense and to allow him to decide whether to plead guilty or stand trial, and to enable the circuit court to know what judgment to pronounce if the defendant is convicted.â€Â  Evans, 363 S.C. at 508-13, 611 S.E.2d at 517-19 (citing Gentry, 363 S.C. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500, and also citing cases in which the Court has emphasized the importance of the grand jury process).Â  Furthermore, a sufficient indictment prevents later retrials for the same offense in contravention of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy and prevents a prosecutor from usurping the power of the grand jury by ensuring a defendant is tried for the crime for which he was indicted. Â State v. Tabory, 262 S.C. 136, 139, 202 S.E.2d 852, 853 (1974); State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 108, 572 S.E.2d 309, 312 (Ct. App. 2002), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; People v. Grega, 531 N.E.2d 279, 282 (N.Y. 1988); State v. Lewis, 36 S.W.3d 88, 97 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000).Â  The sufficiency of an indictment is examined objectively, from the viewpoint of a reasonable person, and not from the subjective viewpoint of a particular defendant.Â  This principle does not mean a defendantâ€™s understanding of an indictment is irrelevant; that understanding, or lack thereof, is a factor for the court to consider in its sufficiency determination.Â  However, a defendantâ€™s purported lack of understanding of an indictment which is sufficient, when viewed objectively, ordinarily will not serve to defeat the sufficiency of the indictment.\r\n In South Carolina, an indictment â€œshall be deemed and judged sufficient and good in law which, in addition to allegations as to time and place, as required by law, charges the crime substantially in the language of the common law or of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, that the offense be alleged to be contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  Thus, an indictment passes legal muster when it charges the crime substantially in the language of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood.Â  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 (1981); Guthrie, 352 S.C. at 107-08, 572 S.E.2d at 312.Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether an indictment meets the sufficiency standard, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the surrounding circumstances. . . . Further, whether the indictment could be more definite or certain is irrelevant.â€Â  Gentry, 363 S.C. at 103, 610 S.E.2d at 500) (citations omitted).Â  All the surrounding circumstances must be weighed to make an accurate determination of whether the defendant was prejudiced by a lack of notice and an insufficient indictment.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993); State v. Evans, 216 S.C. 328, 57 S.E.2d 756 (1950).Â  \r\nWhile the court should focus primarily on charging language in the body of the indictment, a caption or title which is consistent with the language in the body of the indictment may be considered in conjunction with the body in determining the sufficiency of the indictment as a whole.Â  Thompson v. State, 357 S.C. 192, 195, 593 S.E.2d 139, 140 (2004) (indictment was sufficient to charge the offense of criminal conspiracy where language in body of each indictment used verbs which implied defendant acted with another person, and title of each indictment cited the statute defining the offense), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C. 462, 465, 578 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2003) (indictments stating that defendant assaulted officers while they were attempting to process him after arrest were sufficient; although body of the indictments failed to specify that officers were employees of correctional facility, language in the indictments was substantially same as language of statute defining offense charged, captions indicated victims were correctional facility employees or cited the statute defining offense, and title of charge in body of indictments stated victims were correctional facility employees), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; Tate v. State, 345 S.C. 577, 581, 549 S.E.2d 601, 603 (2001) (â€œIt is the body of the indictment rather than the caption that is important.Â  If the body specifically states the essential elements of the crime and is otherwise free from defect, defect in the caption will not cause it to be invalid.â€); State v. Tabory, 262, S.C. 136, 141, 202 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1974) (â€œthe State may not support a conviction for an offense intended to be charged by relying upon a caption to the exclusion of the language contained in the body of the indictmentâ€).\r\nWhen a defendant timely objects to the sufficiency of the indictment, before the jury is sworn, a ruling that an indictment is not sufficient will result in the quashing of the indictment unless the defendant waives presentment to the grand jury and pleads guilty.Â  The solicitor ordinarily will be free to later submit a properly drafted indictment to the grand jury for its consideration.Â  Cutner v. State, 354 S.C. 151, 155, 580 S.E.2d 120, 122-23 (2003), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; Hopkins v. State, 317 S.C. 7, 10, 451 S.E.2d 389, 390 (1994), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; cf. Evans, 363 S.C. at 510-13, 611 S.E.2d atÂ  518-19 (indictment must be quashed when defendant timely objects to indictment issued by a grand jury which is established or constituted illegally, or when defendant timely proves disqualification of individual grand juror).\r\nA defendant may waive a potential challenge to an indictment, just as he may waive any of his constitutional rights, by failing to raise the issue or by admitting the sufficiency of a particular indictment.Â  Cf. Rivers v. Strickland, 264 S.C. 121, 124, 213 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1975) (defendant may waive right to assert various statutory and constitutional rights, nonjurisdictional defects, and defenses by pleading guilty); TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (1998) (an issue conceded in lower court may not be argued on appeal).\r\nAmendments to an indictment are permissible if:Â  (1) they do not change the nature of the offense; (2) the charge is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment; or (3) the defendant waives presentment to the grand jury and pleads guilty.Â  State v. Myers, 313 S.C. 391, 438 S.E.2d 236 (1993); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (2003) (trial court â€œmay amend the indictment . . . if such amendment does not change the nature of the offense chargedâ€).[4]Â  \r\nWhen the State moves before trial to amend an indictment previously issued or â€œtrue-billedâ€ by the grand jury, the court first should determine whether the existing indictment is sufficient to place the defendant on notice of a particular offense, and identify the nature of that offense.Â  Second, the court should determine whether the amended indictment would be sufficient to place the defendant on notice of a particular offense and, if so, identify the nature of that offense.\r\nThird, the court should determine whether the proposed amendment changes the nature of the offense set forth in the original indictment.Â  If it does, the motion to amend must be denied unless the amended indictment states a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the original indictment or the defendant chooses to waive presentment of the amended indictment to the grand jury and plead guilty.Â  To rule otherwise would violate the defendantâ€™s statutory and constitutional right to demand that a properly constituted grand jury consider his case and decide whether to issue a sufficient indictment.Â  See e.g. Cutner, 354 S.C. 151, 580 S.E.2d 120 (reversing conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana within proximity of a school because substituting a school for the church named in the original indictment was not a scrivenerâ€™s error, but changed the nature of the offense charged); State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 641, 545 S.E.2d 511, 514 (2001) (reversing conviction where trial court, with regard to first-degree burglary indictment, allowed aggravating circumstance to be changed from entering during the darkness to causing physical injury; amendment changed the nature of the offense charged because proof required for each aggravating circumstance was materially different), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; Weinhauer v. State, 334 S.C. 327, 513 S.E.2d 840 (1999) (granting post-conviction relief where prosecutor verbally amended indictment for second-degree burglary to state that the burglary occurred at nighttime; amendment changed the nature of the offense charged by changing the classification from nonviolent to violent), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; Clair v. State, 324 S.C. 144, 478 S.E.2d 54 (1996) (affirming grant of post-conviction relief where defendant was indicted for trafficking in cocaine weighing more than 100 grams and less than 200 grams, and defense counsel consented to an amendment of the indictment to an amount more than 200 grams, which changed the nature of the offense charged by increasing the penalty); Hopkins v. State, 317 S.C. 7, 10, 451 S.E.2d 389 (1994) (granting post-conviction relief and new trial where original indictment for felony DUI causing great bodily injury was amended to indictment for felony DUI causing death; amendment, which increased potential penalty from ten to twenty-five years, changed the nature of the offense charged), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494. \r\nOn the other hand, amendments usually are permitted for purposes of correcting an error of form, such as a scrivenerâ€™s or clerical error.Â  Cutner, 354 S.C. at 155, 580 S.E.2d at 122.Â  Thus, a motion to amend an indictment should be granted when the proposed amendment does not change the nature of the offense or affect the sufficiency of the indictment.Â  See e.g. State v. Batson, 261 S.C. 128, 132, 198 S.E.2d 517, 519 (1973) (upholding amendment of indictment to state name of law enforcement officer who allegedly bought illegal drugs from defendant where original indictment identified the officer only as an â€œundercover SLED agentâ€); State v. Quarles, 261 S.C. 413, 416-17, 200 S.E.2d 384, 385-86 (1973) (indictment may be amended to state the correct time or date of the alleged crime when time or date is not of the essence of the crime); State v. Jones, 211 S.C. 319, 45 S.E.2d 29 (1947) (amending indictment to correct the victimâ€™s name is a scrivenerâ€™s error and does not change the nature or grade of the offense charged; defendant was neither misled nor prejudiced in his defense on the merits); State v. Horton, 209 S.C. 151, 39 S.E.2d 222 (1946) (upholding amendment of indictment to strike out inapplicable charge of common-law rape, where remaining language charged statutory rape of minor; amendment did not change the nature of the offense charged and defendant was not prejudiced in his defense on the merits).\r\nIn applying the above principles in this case, we conclude the body and caption of the original indictment, when examined with a practical eye in view of all the surrounding circumstances, provided adequate notice to Respondent that he faced a charge of CDVHAN.Â  The law proscribed only two forms of criminal domestic violence - non-aggravated and CDV of a high and aggravated nature.Â  See footnote 1.Â  The caption of the indictment stated the offense was â€œaggravated,â€ indicating CDVHAN, and this caption was consistent with charging language in the body of the indictment.Â  See Thompson, 357 S.C. at 195, 593 S.E.2d at 140; Wilkes, 353 S.C. at 465, 578 S.E.2d at 719.Â  The indictment was sufficient to apprise Respondent of the elements of the offense, the circuit court knew what judgment to pronounce in the event of conviction, and Respondent was ensured the protections of double jeopardy.Â  Accordingly, the amendment of the indictment proposed by the solicitor and approved by the judge, as well as Respondentâ€™s statement he was prepared to defend a charge of CDVHAN, were both superfluous and of no import in this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and affirm Respondentâ€™s conviction for CDVHAN.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, J.J., and Acting Justice Diane Schafer Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-20 (2003) at the time of Respondentâ€™s trial provided: \r\n\r\n  It is unlawful to:Â  (1) cause physical harm or injury to a personâ€™s own household member; or (2) offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a personâ€™s own household member with apparent present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-30 (2003) at the time of Respondentâ€™s trial provided:Â  \r\n\r\n  Any person who violates Section 16-25-20 is guilty of the misdemeanor of criminal domestic violence and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-65 (2003) at the time of Respondentâ€™s trial provided:\r\n\r\n  (A)Â  The elements of the common law crime of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature are incorporated in and made a part of the offense ofÂ  criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature when a person violates the provisions of Section 16-25-20 and the elements of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature are present.\r\n  (B)Â  A person who commits the crime of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than three thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\r\n  (C)Â  The provisions of this section create a statutory offense of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature and must not be construed to codify the common law crime of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.\r\n\r\nAmendments of these statutes in 2003 and 2005 do not apply in Respondentâ€™s case.\r\n[2]Â  Circumstances of aggravation include the infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in sexes, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful authority.Â  E.g. State v. Foxworth, 269 S.C. 496, 238 S.E.2d 172 (1977). \r\n[3]Â  See State v. Jones, 312 S.C. 100, 439 S.E.2d 282 (1994) (new rule of criminal law should be applied retroactively to cases pending on direct review at the time the new decision is issued, unless the new rule results in a finding that the trial court acted without jurisdiction or the trial courtâ€™s action is void because the defendantâ€™s conduct is not subject to criminal sanction, in which case the new rule should be fully retroactive and applied to all previous cases).\r\n[4]Â  The second sentence of Section 17-19-100 states:Â  â€œAfter such amendment the trial shall proceed in all respects and with the same consequences as if the indictment had originally been returned as so amended, unless such amendment shall operate as a surprise to the defendant, in which case the defendant shall be entitled, upon demand, to a continuance of the cause.â€Â  In a pre-Gentry case, we observed that â€œ[t]he appropriate analysis is whether the amendment to the indictment changed the nature of the offense charged, not whether the amendment in any way surprised or prejudiced appellant.â€Â  State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 641, 545 S.E.2d 511, 514 (2001), overruled on other grounds, Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494.Â  The second sentence of the statute applies only to permissible amendments, i.e., those which do not change the nature of the offense charged.Â  Id. at 641 n.3, 545 S.E.2d at 514 n.3 (emphasis in original).Â  Therefore, this continuance provision will not be applied to deprive a defendant of the right to presentment when the court determines an existing indictment fails to give the required notice to the defendant or is otherwise insufficient pursuant to Gentry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26106","title":"State v.

Rhoden, of Winter &amp; Rhoden, of Gaffney, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Respondent was convicted of armed robbery, failure to stop for a police vehicle, and unlawful possession of a pistol.Â  He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of twenty-four years for armed robbery, three years for failing to stop, and one year for the pistol charge.Â  Respondentâ€™s alleged accomplice, Tavo Glenn (Glenn), was arrested at the same time as respondent and was tried and convicted prior to respondentâ€™s trial.Â  We granted this writ of certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed and remanded this case for an in camera hearing to determine whether the identification of respondentâ€™s alleged accomplice was so tainted as to require its suppression at respondentâ€™s trial. Â See State v. Miller, 359 S.C. 589, 598 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by remanding the case to the trial court?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe following evidence was introduced at respondentâ€™s trial.Â  About 4:00 p.m. on October 5, 2001, the Alltel Communications store on Floyd Baker Boulevard in Gaffney, South Carolina, was robbed.Â  The perpetrator entered the store with his back to the storeâ€™s two female employees.Â  As he turned to face the employees, he pulled a black mask over his face, brandished a black handgun, and ordered the employees to fill a bag with money.\r\nThe two employees began filling the bag with money from one of the storeâ€™s cash registers.Â  Keys could not be found to the second cash register and the store safe was found to be empty.Â  Realizing they would not be able to open the second register, the man took both employees into the back of the store and made them lie down on the floor.Â  The employees did as instructed until they heard the front door buzzer.Â  Assuming the robber had left the store, the employees went to the front of the store, locked the door, and called 911.\r\nThe robbery lasted approximately ten minutes and resulted in a little over four hundred dollars being stolen.Â  When police arrived, the employees described the robber as a black male wearing a blue shirt and dark pants.\r\nShortly after beginning his 4:00 shift, Trooper Johnnie Godfrey was traveling on Floyd Baker Boulevard near the Alltel store when a vehicle came from his right and cut him off.Â  Trooper Godfrey testified he turned on his blue lights and attempted to pull over the car for the purpose of issuing a warning for improper lane change and failure to yield the right-of-way.Â  The car pulled into a parking lot, but did not stop, instead exiting on another street and heading up the interstate.Â  A pursuit ensued involving officers from several law enforcement agencies.\r\nThe fleeing car sideswiped another car and turned off the interstate.Â  A bystander testified she observed the chase and, as the car approached her, she saw a gun tossed from the passenger side window.Â  An officer searched the area where the gun was allegedly thrown and retrieved a black handgun.\r\nThe chase ended after the car attempted to make a right turn and ran off the road into a field.Â  The two occupants fled from the car.Â  The driver of the vehicle was quickly apprehended and identified as respondent.\r\nRespondent was placed in the back of Sergeant Mark Goochâ€™s patrol car.Â  Respondent remained in the car for roughly twenty minutes, while detectives and the crime scene unit responded to the scene.Â  Sergeant Gooch testified that while en route to the detention center, respondent commented, â€œI heard someone say something about a robbery.Â  I donâ€™t know anything about a robbery.Â  I wasnâ€™t even near an Alltel store.â€Â  Respondent also questioned what the crime scene officers were doing at the vehicle, and when the sergeant told him they were recovering evidence and asked respondent if he was worried about them finding his fingerprints on the gun, he stated, â€œmy man had a gun.â€Â  After hesitating, respondent then said, â€œif you will get a detective to talk to me, Iâ€™ll tell them what they need to know.â€Â  Officer Gooch stated that, while respondent was seated in the patrol car, he did not mention a robbery or any charges against him to respondent.Â  He admitted, however, that his police radio was on while respondent was seated in the car, and he had discussed the robbery with other officers outside of the car.\r\nTrooper Godfrey testified he smelled an odor of alcohol on respondent and also suspected he had been using marijuana.Â  Once respondent was transported to the local detention center, a DataMaster test was administered.Â Â  Based on the DataMaster test, the trooper asked respondent to submit to a urine test and respondent refused.Â  Trooper Godfrey charged respondent with driving under the influence and respondent subsequently pled guilty to the charge.\r\nThe passenger from the vehicle was apprehended shortly after respondent and identified as Tavo Glenn.Â  He was wearing a blue shirt and dark pants when apprehended.Â  Glenn had several items in his possession when he was arrested, including a little over four hundred dollars, a pair of latex gloves, and eight to ten rounds of .380 caliber pistol ammunition.Â  A search of the automobile produced a .380 caliber silver handgun, found under the passenger seat.\r\nShortly after Glennâ€™s apprehension, Officer Chris Skinner of the Gaffney Police Department arrived and instructed one of his officers to take Glenn back to the Alltel store to be identified.Â  When Glenn arrived at the Alltel store, the officers took him out of the patrol car and placed him in front of the vehicle, twenty to twenty-five feet from the front door of the store.Â  Glenn was handcuffed and was the only civilian in the area, standing among police officers.Â  The two employees positively identified Glenn as the perpetrator of the robbery at that time and they reiterated that pre-trial identification at respondentâ€™s trial.[1]Â  Thereafter, both Glenn and respondent were charged with armed robbery.\r\nAt his trial, respondent took the stand and admitted he was the driver of the vehicle and that he intentionally failed to stop when he saw the police carâ€™s blue lights.Â  He claimed he did not see the lights while on Floyd Baker Boulevard, but noticed them after he cut through a parking lot, and thought he was being pulled for cutting through the lot to avoid a red light.Â  Respondent claimed he rode with Glenn to Gaffney so that Glenn could purchase some marijuana.Â  The two were riding around smoking[2] and drinking and made some stops along the way for Glenn to sell drugs.Â  They also stopped for respondent to go to the bathroom, at which point he took over driving since Glennâ€™s license had been suspended.Â  Respondent stated he failed to stop for the blue lights because he was on parole and he knew there was a gun in the car, as well as significant amounts of illegal drugs.Â  At some point during the chase, respondent saw Glenn throw something out the window.Â  He knew that Glenn was getting rid of the drugs, but he did not know if Glenn threw a gun out the window.Â  Respondent denied he robbed anyone.Â  He stated he did not know anything about the Alltel robbery until after he was placed in the police car.Â  While sitting in the car, he was listening to the police radio, and â€œheard them keep bringing up something about armed robbery.â€Â  He stated he must have heard them specifically mention Alltel.Â  He also testified that he did not say, â€œMy man had a gun,â€ but that he said, â€œIf my man had a gun, I donâ€™t know.â€\r\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved for a suppression hearing based on the unduly suggestive show-up identification of Glenn.Â  Recognizing Glenn was not on trial in this case and had already been convicted in the matter, defense counsel nonetheless argued respondent was entitled to such a hearing as this was a â€œhand of one, hand of all caseâ€ and the identification of Glenn was a critical part of the Stateâ€™s case against respondent.Â  The defense asserted the court needed to make a determination of the reliability of the evidence prior to the matter going before the jury.\r\nThe trial court pointed out that it had held such a hearing in Glennâ€™s trial and, although it acknowledged that courts generally disfavor one-person show-ups, the court had found the necessary requirements of the law met and admitted the identification in Glennâ€™s trial.[3]Â  Because Glenn had already been tried and convicted, the court held that his identification was not an issue in respondentâ€™s case.Â  Defense counsel countered that the State elected to try Glenn and respondent separately, and as a result, respondent was not present during the proceedings in Glennâ€™s trial dealing with the identification issue.Â  He therefore never had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.Â  Finding no case law to give guidance on the matter, the court determined respondent was not entitled to an in camera hearing regarding the identification of Glenn as the perpetrator.Â  The Court of Appeals disagreed and remanded for an in camera hearing regarding the reliability of Glennâ€™s identification.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred by remanding the case for an in camera hearing because respondent lacks standing to challenge the reliability of Glennâ€™s identification; and even if respondent has standing, any error in the admission of Glennâ€™s identification was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence against him.\r\nStanding\r\nWhether a defendant has standing to challenge the identification of an alleged co-participant in a crime is a novel issue in South Carolina.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded the trial court erred by failing to conduct a suppression hearing regarding the reliability of Glennâ€™s show-up identification.Â  Noting that respondent was never identified by the victims of the robbery and that the only thing linking him to the robbery of the Alltel store is the fact that he was apprehended in the company of Glenn, who in turn, was identified as the person who perpetrated the robbery, the Court of Appeals found that respondent had standing to challenge Glennâ€™s identification.Â  The court distinguished the present case from those where defendants have unsuccessfully sought to exclude incriminating evidence obtained in violation of anotherâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights.Â  See State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 352 S.E.2d 471 (1987) (defendant who seeks to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds must demonstrate he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in connection with the searched premises in order to have standing to challenge the search).Â  Unlike Fourth Amendment cases, the court explained that the concern under the current set of facts is not whether oneâ€™s personal constitutional rights were violated in obtaining the evidence, but whether the evidence obtained is unreliable. \r\nIn this case, we find respondent has a substantial personal stake in the admissibility of the identification evidence because the identification undercut his ability to present his defense that he and Tavo Glenn were with each other the entire day of the crime and that he did not know anything about the Alltel robbery.Â  See State v. Clausell, 580 A.2d 221 (N.J. 1990) (because defendant had a substantial personal stake in the admissibility of the identification evidence, he had standing to challenge identifications of his co-defendant). Â The identification of Glenn was an essential element in proving respondentâ€™s participation in the crime.Â  Admitting the evidence of Glennâ€™s identification in respondentâ€™s trial effectively destroyed his defense.Â  See People v. Bisogni, 483 P.2d 780 (Calif. 1971) (identification evidence based on an unfairly conducted show-up is equally unreliable when it is directed toward the identity of a co-participant in a crime as when it relates to the identity of the defendant on trial; whenever the identity of a confederate is essential to prove the defendantâ€™s participation in a crime and when such evidence effectively destroys the defense offered by the defendant, he has standing to challenge the fairness of the identification procedures of the alleged co-participant).Â  Therefore, respondent has standing to challenge the fairness of the show-up identification of Glenn.\r\nHarmless Error\r\nIn determining whether an error is harmless, the reviewing court must review the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the verdict.Â  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002).Â  Error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990).\r\nWithout the identification of Tavo Glenn, the case against respondent is circumstantial with no direct link between respondent and the Alltel robbery.Â  Respondent was not identified as being part of the robbery of the Alltel store; in fact, there was only one perpetrator inside the store.Â  There is, however, circumstantial evidence of respondentâ€™s guilt.Â  The circumstantial evidence is as follows:Â  (1) respondent was driving a car, with Glenn as his passenger, shortly after the robbery; (2) they were first noticed by police when respondent â€œcut offâ€ an officer not far from the store; (3) respondent failed to stop for blue lights; (4) a bystander saw a gun being tossed from the passenger side window during the chase - the gun was later determined to be similar to the gun used in the crime; (5) after apprehending Glenn, police found the following items in Glennâ€™s possession:Â  a pair of latex gloves, .380 caliber pistol ammunition, and a little over $400, which was the amount taken from the Alltel store; and (6) after being captured, respondent made the following unsolicited comments:Â  that he did not know anything about a robbery, that he â€œwasnâ€™t even nearâ€ an Alltel store, that his man had a gun, and that he would be willing to tell what he knew to a detective.Â  The circumstantial evidence against respondent is strong.\r\nHowever, respondentâ€™s defense included explanations of why he fled from police - that he was on parole and did not want to be caught with drugs and a gun in the car.Â  He also explained his comments to police by stating he heard about the robbery from the police radio and from the officers standing outside the car.Â  When Glenn threw the gun out of the car, respondent stated he thought Glenn was getting rid of the drugs.Â  Respondent further testified that he and Glenn were never apart the entire day except for stopping for respondent to go to the bathroom and to switch drivers.\r\nTherefore, the admission of the identification of Glenn at respondentâ€™s trial effectively destroyed his defense.Â  The trial courtâ€™s failure to allow respondent to challenge Glennâ€™s show-up identification was not harmless error.Â  If Glennâ€™s show-up identification was in fact not proper, the admission of that unreliable evidence could have reasonably affected the result of respondentâ€™s trial.Â  The Court of Appeals correctly held that the interests of justice required an in camera hearing be conducted on the pre-trial identification of Glenn.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that respondent was not, however, entitled to a new trial.Â  The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the purpose of conducting an in camera hearing to determine whether the identification of Glenn was so tainted as to require its suppression at trial.Â  The court stated that should such a finding be made, respondent would then be entitled to a new trial.Â  The Court of Appeals properly remanded for an in camera hearing.Â  See State v. Simmons, 308 S.C. 80, 417 S.E.2d 92 (1992) (per se rule requiring court to hold in camera hearing when the State offers a witness whose testimony identifies the defendant as the person who committed the crime and the defendant challenges the in-court identification as being tainted by a previous illegal identification).Â  We note that the fact Glennâ€™s identification has been upheld on appeal is irrelevant to the question of whether respondent is entitled to have an in camera hearing to determine whether Glennâ€™s show-up identification was properly conducted.Â  When respondent was denied the hearing, he was denied the opportunity to participate and elicit evidence that may not have been elicited in the pre-trial hearing at Glennâ€™s trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find respondent has standing to challenge the identification of his alleged co-participant in the crime.Â  We find the trial courtâ€™s error in not holding a hearing regarding Glennâ€™s identification was not harmless error.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to remand to the trial court for the purpose of conducting an in camera hearing to determine whether Glennâ€™s identification should be suppressed is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, J.J., and Acting Justice Paula H. Thomas, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]An in-court identification of Glenn was not conducted at respondentâ€™s trial. \r\n[2]Respondent stated they were smoking a blunt or â€œboonk,â€ which is a marijuana joint with either powder cocaine or rock cocaine added to the joint.\r\n[3]The Court of Appeals found the trial judge did not err by admitting Glennâ€™s identification at his own trial.Â  State v. Glenn, Op. No. 2003-UP-515 (S.C. Ct. App. filed August 27, 2003).Â  We denied Glennâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decision.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26107","title":"Williamsburg Rural Water and Sewer Company, Inc. v.

Jarrett, both of Jenkinson, Jarrett and Kellahan, of Kingstree, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  We granted certiorari to consider a Court of Appeals decision upholding the grant of summary judgment to respondents (County).[1]Â  Williamsburg Rural Water &amp; Sewer Co., Inc. v. Williamsburg County Water &amp; Sewer Auth., 357 S.C. 251, 593 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 2003).[2]Â  We reverse the Court of Appeals insofar as it affirmed summary judgment on Companyâ€™s statutory interpretation claim.[3]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe material facts are not in dispute, and a complete recounting may be found in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.Â  We have recited a briefer version below.\r\nIn January 1995, one of Companyâ€™s organizers[4] sent a letter to Countyâ€™s Supervisor notifying County of Companyâ€™s intent to provide water and sewer services in a portion of Countyâ€™s unincorporated area.Â  In March and April 1995, the organizer appeared before County Council to reiterate Companyâ€™s plan.\r\nThe circuit court held the January letter, as well as the March council appearance, satisfied the notice requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-35-90, and that Countyâ€™s failure to respond within the statutory period was the equivalent of consent.Â  Section 33-35-90, repealed in October 2000 and replaced by Â§ 33-36-270,[5] provided in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  [P]rior to providing any of the services authorized in this section, nonprofit corporations or groups intending to organize such corporations shall first notify the governing body, of the county or municipality in which the services are to be provided, of their intentions and the nature of such services.Â  The governing body shall, from the date of such notification, have a period of ninety days in which to approve the request to provide such services or inform the persons requesting permission to provide such services that the governing body intends to provide for such matters as a public function of the government.Â  Any such notification of intent by the governing body shall include a detailed description of the area to be served, the services to be provided and the time schedule under which such services will be available from the county or municipality.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).\r\nCounty has not challenged the finding that it received the statutory notice on January 16, 1995, or that it was deemed to have consented to Companyâ€™s proposal.\r\nWhile County did not affirmatively respond to Companyâ€™s notice, it took up a franchising ordinance (Franchising Ordinance) which would permit it to grant water and sewer franchises in County, including the area Company wished to service.Â  The Franchising Ordinance received its first reading on March 6, 1995, its second in June, and its third in August, and was adopted on August 7, 1995.Â  In October 1995, Company was notified that its application for funding from the federal government could not be processed until it received a franchise pursuant to the Franchising Ordinance.Â  More than one year later, in November 1996, a referendum allowing County itself to provide water and sewer services in Companyâ€™s area passed.\r\nIn May 1998, County and/or its Water and Sewer Authority applied for federal funding to construct its system.Â  In November 1998, it solicited bids to construct facilities in an area within Companyâ€™s area, and awarded a construction contract that month.Â  This suit followed.\r\nAmong Companyâ€™s claims was that it had acquired an exclusive right to provide water and sewer services in the area identified in its 1995 notice by operation of Â§ 33-35-90.Â  The circuit court granted County summary judgment on this claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  We reverse.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether County was entitled to summary judgment on the statutory interpretation issue?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ majority held that summary judgment was properly granted to County because while Company acquired the right to provide service in the area specified in its January 1995 letter by virtue of Â§ 33-35-90, nothing in that statute provided that the right was exclusive.Â  The Court of Appeals was persuaded of this conclusion, at least in part, because Company has no existing facilities.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ majority seemed to rest its decision on the fact that other providers were up and operating in the contested area:\r\n\r\n  The difficulty of this case lies in giving effect to the rights acquired by [Company] as a result of the Countyâ€™s failure to comply with section 33-35-90.Â  If this statute is to have any meaning, there must be some enforceable quality belonging to those rights; otherwise, a party obtaining approval under this statute receives, in effect, nothing at all.Â  Complicating the matter is the fact that during the pendency of this appeal, the County awarded numerous franchises affecting the disputed area, and those facilities are presently under development for the benefit of the people of Williamsburg County.Â  Thus, in this case, valid but competing interests are diametrically opposed.Â  An unfortunate result of our ruling today is that [Company] likely possesses a right which has little commercial value in light of the Countyâ€™s intrusion into the designated service area.Â  Nevertheless, in the absence of case law on point, and without specific language in section 33-35-90 compelling the grant of exclusive rights, we hold that [Company] does not possess an exclusive service right within the described service area; rather, as the circuit court found, it possesses a non-exclusive service right.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg Water, 357 S.C. at 263, 593 S.E.2d at 161.\r\nCompany complains, and we agree, that the Court of Appealsâ€™ majority improperly rested its decision in large part not on evidence in the record, but rather on the affidavit of John Whiteside, Director of the County Water &amp; Sewer Authority, which was attached to Countyâ€™s petition for rehearing filed after the first Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in this case.Â  In this affidavit, dated April 9, 2003, Mr. Whiteside described numerous projects planned and/or funded in the service area in dispute.Â  Nothing in the appellate court rules permits a party to unilaterally add after-created evidence to the record.Â  We review the summary judgment issue using only the evidence presented to the trial court and included in the Record on Appeal. In addition, we know of no authority for the proposition that a court should construe a statute not by its terms, but rather by weighing competing interests. \r\nThe statute does not state that the right to provide water and sewer services in the area identified by the not-for-profit company is exclusive.Â  In our view, the statuteâ€™s silence is the strongest argument for interpreting Â§ 33-35-90 to grant a non-exclusive right.Â  On the other hand, the statute gives the governmental body ninety days either to accept the not-for-profitâ€™s offer to provide the services, or to decide to offer comparable services itself.Â  The purpose of the statute is to expedite the provision of these vital services to unserved areas; it encourages a not-for-profit corporation to step into a governmental void, but effectively gives the local government veto power, permitting it to trump the not-for-profitâ€™s offer by making its own proposal within a short time period.Â  \r\nWe hold that once the local government fails to respond within the time period provided for by the statute, the not-for-profitâ€™s right to operate in the specified area is exclusive.Â  As the record in this case so amply demonstrates, anything less than an exclusive right to operate in the area will cause federal funding programs to deny assistance to the not-for-profit corporation. Â The purpose of the statute, to expedite the provision of water and sewer services to unserved areas, is frustrated by anything less than an exclusive right.Â  Cf. Johnston v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Reg., 365 S.C. 293, 617 S.E. 2d 363 (2005) (statutes should be interpreted to further, not frustrate, legislatureâ€™s intention).\r\nWhere the governmental agency consents[6] to the not-for-profit corporationâ€™s notice pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-35-90 or Â§ 33-36-270, that corporation acquires the exclusive right to operate water and sewer systems in the designated areas.Â  Such an operation is in the nature of a quasi-public utility, as evidenced by the unique condemnation provisions applicable only to these type corporations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-30(4) (Supp. 2004).Â  We therefore reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision which affirmed the circuit court order granting County summary judgment on Companyâ€™s statutory interpretation claim, and remand the case for further proceedings.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals affirming summary judgment on the statutory interpretation claim is \r\nREVERSED.\r\n MOORE, BURNETT, J.J. and Acting Justice Paula H. Thomas, concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part.Â  Although I agree with the majorityâ€™s reversal of the statutory interpretation issue, I would not dismiss certiorari as improvidently granted on the Torts Claim Act (TCA) issue.Â  In my view, there exists a material issue of fact regarding the possible gross negligence on the part of the County and the application of the TCA.Â  Further, the result articulated by the majority effectively forecloses Company from pursuing any remedy for the violation of the exclusive right to which the majority finds Company is entitled.Â  Therefore, I would reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order in its entirety and remand for further proceedings.\r\nThe TCA provides that the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental entities are immune from tort liability for specific losses including those resulting from:\r\n\r\n  licensing powers or functions including, but not limited to, the issuance, denial, suspension, renewal, or revocation of or failure or refusal to issue, deny, suspend, renew, or revoke any permit, license, certificate, approval, registration, order, or similar authority except when the power or function is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(a)(12)(2005) (emphasis added).Â  Although the gross negligence standard contained in this exception is not expressly contained in the other exceptions upon which the County relies,[7] we read the gross negligence standard into all of the relevant TCA exceptions.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 417 529 S.E.2d 543, 548 (2000) (quoting Steinke v. SC Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 398, 520 S.E.2d 142, 155 (1999)).Â  Therefore, the dispositive issue is whether the evidence presents an issue of material fact regarding gross negligence.\r\nâ€œGross negligence is the intentional, conscious failure to do something which one ought to do.â€Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 331 S.C. 192, 204, 500 S.E.2d 160, 167 (Ct. App. 1999), affâ€™d, 339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000).Â  Additionally, under Â§ 15-78-60(a)(12), gross negligence is a mixed question of law and fact which must be determined by a jury.Â  Id. at 205, 500 S.E.2d at 168.Â Â  Unless there is only one reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence, summary judgment is inappropriate.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, County was provided with notice of Companyâ€™s intention to provide service to certain rural areas of the county in accordance with Â§ 33-35-90.Â  This section also provides that County was to respond to Company within ninety days indicating whether County intended to provide the services as a public function, including â€œa detailed description of the area to be served, the services to be provided, and the time schedule under which such services will be available from the county. . . .â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nCounty contends that its initial reading of a franchise ordinance within the ninety day period combined with the fact that the second reading was postponed to consult with legal counsel shows that County did not act with gross negligence.Â  In opposition, Company points to several acts by County to show that County intentionally frustrated Companyâ€™s efforts to provide service to the area including the denial of Companyâ€™s application for a franchise ordinance.Â  In my view, deciding between these competing factual scenarios is the hallmark of the function of a jury, and it should be the juryâ€™s job to determine whether Countyâ€™s actions rise to the level of gross negligence.\r\nTherefore, in my view, the TCA issue should be submitted to a jury for a determination of whether the County acted with gross negligence.Â  The evidence in this case does not lead to only one reasonable inference, especially when all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence are construed in favor of the nonmoving party.Â  Furthermore, I find it perplexingly odd that, on one hand, the majority finds that Companyâ€™s rights have been violated by County, and on the other hand, the majority deprives Company of any possibility of relief.Â  If Company is unable to proceed in its tort action, there is no other remedy for the violation of its rights.\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons outlined above, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for trial.\r\n\r\n[1] For purposes of this opinion we will refer to respondents collectively as â€˜County.â€™\r\n[2] This en banc opinion was filed following the grant of a petition for rehearing.Â  Chief Judge Hearn authored the majority opinion.Â  Judge Anderson filed a separate concurrence, as did Judge Stilwell.Â  Judge Connor joined Judge Stilwellâ€™s concurrence.\r\n[3] We dismiss certiorari as improvidently granted on the Tort Claims Act issue.\r\n[4] Company did not file its articles of incorporation until May 1995.Â  The date of incorporation does not affect the analysis.\r\n[5] The repeal/replacement does not affect our analysis of the nature of the rights acquired by a not-for-profit corporation pursuant to Â§ 33-35-90.\r\n[6] This consent provision satisfies the requirement of S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 15 (1976).\r\n[7] Â County also relies on the exceptions found in Â§Â§ 15-78-60 (a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) as grounds for immunity to companyâ€™s tort action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26108","title":"Clearwater Trust v.

Weisenfelder, of Dow, Lohnes &amp; Albertson, of Washington, D.C. for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is an appeal from a circuit court order dismissing appellantsâ€™ amended complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty and securities fraud pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss must be based solely upon the allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United Healthcare Services, Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 606 S.E.2d 752 (2004).Â  The question is whether, viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states any valid claim for relief, even if the court doubts that the plaintiff will prevail.Â  Id.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe amended complaint alleges that the appellants are trusts which owned stock in a closely held corporation known as Spartan Communications, Inc. (Spartan).Â  Respondent Bunting was an officer of Spartan, and is alleged to have been a shareholder in the corporation and an â€œinsider.â€Â  Appellantsâ€™ representatives consulted Bunting when deciding whether to sell some of their Spartan stock, and he reassured them that â€œthere was no contemplation, consideration, discussion or activity within Spartan relating to a possible merger, sale, or other transaction concerning Spartan or its stock up to that point.â€Â  Prior to these conversations, Bunting had told the beneficiaries of the trusts that Spartan would prefer them to sell any Spartan stock to the corporation rather than â€œoutsidersâ€ in order to keep it within the close corporationâ€™s â€œfamily.â€Â  In addition to alleging that Bunting was an officer, shareholder, and insider of Spartan, the complaint alleges that Bunting attended shareholder meetings and occasionally drove a beneficiary of one of the trusts to these meetings.\r\nThe complaint alleges that Bunting knowingly made false and misleading affirmative representations that no changes were contemplated at Spartan, and that in reliance on his representations the appellants sold some of their shares (2,300) back to Spartan at $200/share.Â  \r\nApproximately six months later, in December 1999, Spartan announced its merger into respondent Media General.Â  When the merger was consummated in March 2000, all Spartan shareholders received approximately $800/share.Â  Had the appellants retained the 2,300 shares sold back to Spartan in May and June 1999, appellant Clearwater Trust would have received an additional $660,000 (approximately) and appellant Lenz Trust would have received $720,000 (approximately) more.\r\nThe complaint alleged four causes of action.Â  Three were directed to both Spartan and Bunting: breach of fiduciary duty, breach of fiduciary duty-unjust enrichment, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  One was directed to Spartan alone, and alleged a violation of the South Carolina Securities Act, specifically S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-1210(2) (Supp. 2004).Â  The circuit court held that Â§ 35-1-1210 does not create a private cause of action, and concluded that appellantsâ€™ three other claims alleged a single wrong, and that this claim arose under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-8-420 (1990).Â  The circuit court held this claim was precluded by the two-year statute of limitation found in Â§ 33-8-420(e), and granted respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss.\r\nISSUES\r\nOn appeal, appellants raise the following issues:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; Whether there is a private cause of action pursuant to Â§ 35-1-1210?\r\n  (2)&nbsp; Whether Â§ 33-8-420 codifies common law causes of action against a corporate officer who owes a fiduciary duty to a party separate and apart from his status as an officer?\r\n  (3)&nbsp; If Â§ 33-8-420(e) applies, what is the statute of limitations where the officer is alleged to have fraudulently concealed his breach of fiduciary duty?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Private Cause of Action\r\nAppellantsâ€™ third cause of action alleged Spartan committed fraud and deceit in purchasing appellantsâ€™ stock, thereby rendering it liable under the Securities Act, Â§ 35-1-1210(2).Â  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in dismissing this claim.Â  We hold the claim was properly dismissed.\r\n\r\n  Section 35-1-1210(2) makes it unlawful for any person:\r\n  \r\n    in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of any security, directly or indirectly, to:\r\n    â€¦\r\n    (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; or\r\n    â€¦.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAppellants acknowledge that this Court has held that there is no implied private cause of action for aiding and abetting fraud under Â§ 35-1-1210, but argue that decision does not answer the question whether there can be a direct private action under the statute.Â  See Atlanta Skin &amp; Cancer Clinic, P.C. v. Hallmark Gen. Partners, Inc., 320 S.C. 113, 463 S.E.2d 600 (1995).Â  They also concede that the Court of Appeals has stated in dicta that there is no such private right, see Garrett v. Snidegar, 293 S.C. 176, 359 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 1987), and acknowledge that in another appeal decided by this Court, the appellant conceded the issue.Â  Carver v. Blanford, 288 S.C. 309, 342 S.E.2d 406 (1986).Â  Appellants point out that these cases were all decided prior to 1997, when S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-510 (Supp. 2004) was amended, and argue this amendment evidences the General Assemblyâ€™s intent to create a private cause of action under Â§ 35-1-1210.Â  \r\nIn Atlanta Skin, the Court stated that the primary statute creating a private cause of action under the Securities Act is Â§ 35-1-1490, which imposes liability on sellers of securities.Â  The Court held that while Â§ 35-1-1210 makes â€œfraud or deceit in [securities] offers, sales, or purchases â€œunlawful,â€ [it does] not, by itself, create a private cause of action.â€Â  Id.Â  at 119, 463 S.E.2d at 603.Â  Contrary to appellantsâ€™ contention that Atlanta Skin only decided the aiding and abetting question, it held there was no private action under Â§ 35-1-1210.Â  \r\nAppellants rely on a post-Atlanta Skin amendment to Â§ 35-1-510.Â  This section authorizes the securities commissioner to â€œrequire registered broker-dealers, agents, and investment advisors[1] who have custody of or discretionary authority over client funds or securities, to post surety bondsâ€¦Every bond shall provide for suit thereon by any person who has a cause of action under Section 35-1-1210â€¦.â€Â  While this statutory amendment may be read to give rise to a private cause of action under Â§ 35-1-1210, such a private action exists merely to the extent the alleged violator has posted a surety bond under Â§ 35-1-510.Â  Here, there is no allegation that a â€œ510 bondâ€ has been required or posted, and thus Â§ 35-1-510 does not support a finding that these appellants have a private cause of action under Â§ 35-1-1210.Â  This cause of action was properly dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Carolina Care Plan, supra.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicability of Â§ 33-8-420\r\nAppellants contend that they pled that Bunting owed them a fiduciary duty separate and apart from that owed as an officer of Spartan, based upon an alleged special relationship.Â  Thus, the first question we address is whether they have pled facts sufficient to give rise to a separate duty.Â  See, e.g. Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., 355 S.C. 329, 585 S.E.2d 275 (2003) (existence of duty is question of law for the court).Â  We find no such duty was pled.\r\nA.&nbsp;Basis of Duty\r\n Appellants concede that their special relationship was predicated in part on Buntingâ€™s status as an officer, but allege that other facts gave rise to a special relationship and consequent duty.Â  First, they alleged that Bunting was a fellow shareholder and therefore owed them a fiduciary duty by virtue of that relationship.Â  Our decisions imposing a fiduciary duty on fellow shareholders are limited to situations that involve oppression of a minority shareholder by a controlling shareholder.Â  See e.g., Lesesne v. Lesesne, 307 S.C. 67, 413 S.E.2d 847 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  There is no contention that Bunting was a controlling shareholder, or that he used fraud or oppression to procure the appellantsâ€™ shares for himself.Â  There is no breach of shareholder fiduciary duty alleged here.\r\nSecond, appellants would impose a special relationship and a fiduciary duty upon Bunting as a result of their decision to repose trust in him, and on their repeated questioning of him.Â  We decline to impose a fiduciary duty as a consequence of such unilateral actions.Â  Compare Jacobsen v. Yaschik, 249 S.C. 577, 155 S.E.2d 601 (1967) (officer owes fiduciary duty of full disclosure when purchasing shares from shareholders); Manning v. Dial, 271 S.C. 79, 245 S.E.2d 120 (1975) (same).\r\nThere are no allegations that Bunting undertook to advise the appellants.Â  Instead, appellants sought information from Bunting, based on their belief that he had special knowledge, in order to make their own informed financial decisions.Â  If Bunting had misrepresented the facts to any shareholder who had inquired, then he would have breached the identical fiduciary duty to that individual that appellants contend was owed specially to them.Â  The only breach of fiduciary duty pled here was that owed by Bunting as a corporate officer.\r\nFinally, while appellants repeatedly argue they are not basing the claim that Bunting owed them a duty solely on the basis of his status as an officer of Spartan, this contention is belied by their pleadings.\r\nIn the first cause of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, the appellants allege:\r\n\r\n  39.Â  Spartan and Mr. Bunting were fiduciaries with regard to the shareholders of Spartan, [appellants] placed special trust and confidence in Spartan and Mr. Bunting; and Spartan and Mr. Bunting owed [appellants] a fiduciary duty.\r\n  â€¦\r\n  43.Â  In addition to its direct liability to [appellants] Spartan is vicariously liable for the conduct of Mr. Buntingâ€¦.\r\n  44.Â  Mr. Bunting and [Spartanâ€™s successor] are liable to [appellants]â€¦.\r\n\r\n The second cause of action, titled Negligent Misrepresentation, alleges the following:\r\n\r\n  46.Â  Spartan and Mr. Bunting owed [appellants] a duty of due careâ€¦\r\n  47.Â  Spartan and Mr. Bunting were negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, willful, and wanton in their communicationsâ€¦\r\n  48.Â  In addition to its direct liability to [appellants], Spartan is vicariously liable for the conduct of Mr. Bunting.\r\n\r\nThe fourth cause of action, entitled Breach of Fiduciary Duty-Unjust Enrichment alleges:\r\n\r\n  56.Â  Spartan and Mr. Bunting were fiduciaries with regard to the shareholders of Spartan; [appellants] placed a special confidence in Spartan and Mr. Bunting; and Spartan and Mr. Bunting owed [appellants] a fiduciary duty;\r\n  â€¦\r\n  59.Â  Spartan and Mr. Bunting breached their fiduciary duty to all Spartan shareholders when they approved these windfall [stock] options, which caused additional damages to the [appellants] in that the issue of these options diluted the total consideration from the sale of Spartan that should have been divided pro rata among all of the shareholders.\r\n  â€¦\r\n  61.Â  [Spartanâ€™s successor] is liable to the [appellants] for the pro rata share they would have received based on the fair market value of Spartanâ€™s stock before the windfall options diluted the companyâ€™s value.\r\n\r\nThe pleadings conclusively demonstrate that appellants pled a breach of the fiduciary duty owed by Bunting as a corporate officer.Â  The next question of law we address is whether an action for breach of that duty must be brought pursuant to the statute, or whether a common law duty continues to exist. \r\nB.&nbsp;Source of Duty\r\nThat the General Assembly intended the South Carolina Business Corporation Act (Act) to codify[2] the common law duties owed to shareholders by officers and directors is made clear by the South Carolina Reportersâ€™ Comments (Reportersâ€™ Comments).Â  Section 33-8-420, at issue here, sets forth the standards for corporate officers, while S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-8-300 (1990) covers the standards for corporate directors.Â  The Reportersâ€™ Comments to the officersâ€™ statute state, â€œThis section basically applies the standards of Section 33-8-300 to officers.Â  The [Reportersâ€™ Comments] to Section 33-8-300 apply.â€Â  We therefore look to those directorsâ€™ comments in aid of determining the legislatureâ€™s intent with regard to fiduciary duties.\r\nThe Reportersâ€™ Comments to Â§ 33-8-300 contain the following:\r\n\r\n  As the foregoing authorities suggest, the underlying principle of shareholders being express beneficiaries of fiduciary duties predates the technical amendment made in 1963.Â  South Carolina case law since Black v. Simpson, 94 S.C. 312, 77 S.E. 1023 (1913), has firmly embraced the notion that officers and directors owe duties to shareholders as well as the entity.Â  The principle has been applied in insider trading cases (see Jacobson v. Yaschik, 249 S.C. 577, 584, 155 S.E.2d 601, 605 (1967)) and squeeze-out cases (see Dibble v. Sumter Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 283 S.C. 278, 322 S.E.2d 674 (1984)).\r\n  In 1981, the Model Actâ€™s articulation of duties owed was adopted verbatim with the exception that the established principle that shareholders of South Carolina corporations are express statutory beneficiaries of duties owed was retained.Â  \r\n  â€¦.\r\n  Basically, the drafters of the current [1988] revision faced three alternatives: follow the [1984] Model Act entirely; continue the pattern of following the Model Act but with added express recognition of the legal principle that duties run to shareholders; or opt for a very pro-insider statute along the lines recently adopted by Delaware.\r\n  â€¦.\r\n  The decision of whether to adhere strictly to the Model Act, to maintain the status quo in this State, or to opt for the Delaware approach (or one even more liberal) raised philosophical pointsâ€¦.Â  One concern of proponents of the status quo is that dropping from the statute a duty that previously existed can hardly be taken as anything different than a repudiation of prior law.\r\n  â€¦.\r\n  After detailed discussion and analysis, the decision was made to retain mention in this provision of a direct duty owed to shareholders.\r\n  â€¦.\r\n\r\nThe common law fiduciary duty, first recognized in 1913, owed to shareholders by corporate officers and directors has been codified by Â§Â§ 33-8-300 and -420.Â  The trial court correctly held that appellantsâ€™ breach of fiduciary duty claims against Bunting must be brought within the statuteâ€™s terms.\r\nIII.&nbsp;Statute of Limitations\r\nWe have determined that appellantsâ€™ claims predicated on a breach of fiduciary duty must be brought pursuant to the statute.Â  Appellants alleged three theories:Â  Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Breach of Fiduciary Duty-Unjust Enrichment.Â  The trial court held that since there was only one wrong alleged, that is, Buntingâ€™s misrepresentation that no merger was planned, all three theories should be treated as a single breach of fiduciary duty claim.Â  As we read the complaint, however, appellants alleged two separate wrongs: the Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Negligent Misrepresentation claims involve Buntingâ€™s responses to appellantsâ€™ inquiries, while the Breach of Fiduciary Duty-Unjust Enrichment claim alleged Spartan and Bunting breached a fiduciary duty owed to all stockholders when â€œtheyâ€[3] approved windfall stock options prior to the sale to Media General, thereby diluting the sale proceeds that should have been divided pro rata among all shareholders.Â  We will discuss this Unjust Enrichment wrong first.\r\nA.&nbsp;Unjust Enrichment\r\nAppellants allege corporate malfeasance that resulted in identical harm to all shareholders: such a breach of fiduciary duty gives rise to a classic shareholdersâ€™ derivative suit.Â  See Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 557 S.E.2d 676 (Ct. App. 2001) (diminution in value of stock suffered by all shareholders must be brought as a derivative action); 12B Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations Â§ 5909 (2000).Â  A derivative action that does not meet the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP, is properly dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Â Carolina First Corp. v. Whittle, 343 S.C. 176, 539 S.E.2d 402 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of the Unjust Enrichment cause of action under Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Brown v. Stewart; Carolina First; Rule 220(c), SCACR (court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).\r\nB.&nbsp;Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nThe remaining two causes of action allege a breach of fiduciary duty.[4]Â  The trial court held these claims were barred by the statute of limitations in Â§ 33-8-420(e), as they were admittedly brought more than two years after appellants discovered the alleged breach.Â  Appellants contend the circuit court misconstrued the statute.Â  We affirm.\r\nSection 33-8-420(e) provides:\r\n\r\n  An action against an officer for failure to perform the duties imposed by this section must be commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued, or within two years after the time when the cause of action is discovered, or should reasonably have been discovered, whichever sooner occurs.Â  This limitations period does not apply to breaches of duty which have been concealed fraudulently.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held the last sentence of this section should be read to apply only to that part of the statute placing a three year accrual limit on an action.Â  In other words, a plaintiff must bring an action within two years of discovery or within three years of the accrual, except that when the breach has been fraudulently concealed, the three year outer limit does not apply, and the two-year discovery rule governs.Â  This reading is supported by the Reportersâ€™ Comments to Â§ 33-8-300(e), the statute of limitations for directorsâ€™ suits that contains identical language.\r\n The Reportersâ€™ Comments state:\r\n\r\n  The third difference between prior law and the Model Act section is that the South Carolina statute, since the enactment of the 1981 South Carolina Business Corporation Act, has had a special statute of limitations found in Section 33-13-150(d).Â  As enacted it cut off suits based on violations of the statute unless brought:\r\n  â€œwithin three (3) years after the cause of action has accrued, or within two years after the time when the cause of action is discovered, or should reasonably have been discovered, whichever sooner occurs.â€\r\n  Note that under the statute, the plaintiffâ€™s right to bring a cause of action which had been concealed, and could never have been reasonably discovered, lapsed after three years.Â  There was no provision for tolling based on fraudulent concealment.Â  Arguably, the statute would reward fraudulent concealment of a wrong.Â  The statute was flawed.Â  If the statute rewarded fraudulent concealment by corporate fiduciaries, it was bad policy; if it was intended not to apply in cases of fraudulent concealment, it was poorly drafted.\r\n  The leading proponents of adding the statute of limitations to the Model Act section were also the leading proponents for elimination of the duty to shareholders on the theory that it was better to have the Model Act unsullied by local law.\r\n  There was a general willingness to import a specific limitations period into the statute defining duties owed.Â  This was accomplished by adding to the Model Act provision a new subsection (e) which reads the same as Section 33-13-150(d) of prior law, but with this limitation added at the end: â€œThis limitations period does not apply to breaches of duty which have been concealed fraudulently.â€Â  The advantage to the short limitations period set forth in subsection (e) is not available to fiduciaries who fraudulently conceal their wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nA breach of fiduciary duty suit against a corporate officer or director, even where that breach has been concealed, must be brought no later than two years after discovery of that breach.Â  Here, the suit was admittedly commenced more than two years after discovery.Â  The circuit court properly dismissed the Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Negligent Misrepresentation claims under Rule 12(b)(6) as they were brought after the expiration of the statute of limitations. [5] Carolina Care Plan, Inc., supra. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court order dismissing the appellantsâ€™ complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBURNETT, J., and Acting Justice J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.Â  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Unlike the majority, I would hold the amendment to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-510 (Supp. 2004) gives rise to a private cause of action under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-1210 (Supp. 2004) and does not limit private causes of action to instances where a surety bond has been posted.Â  \r\nAdditionally, I would find that the common law causes of action alleged were not abrogated by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-8-420 (1990).Â  Simply because the General Assembly enacted a statute addressing the fiduciary duty owed to shareholders by corporate officers or directors does not mean that it intended to abrogate all common law causes of action involving corporate officers or directors and shareholders.Â  See State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 66, 447 S.E.2d 177, 182 (1993) (â€œCommon law offenses are not abrogated simply because there is a statutory offense proscribing similar conduct. Rather, it is presumed that no change in common law is intended unless the Legislature explicitly indicates such an intention by language in the statute.â€) (citations omitted).Â  See also Nuckolls v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 192 S.C. 156, 161, 5 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1939) (â€œ[I]t is not presumed that the Legislature intended to abrogate or modify a rule of the common-law by the enactment of a statute upon the same subject; that it is rather to be presumed that no change in the common-law was intended unless the language employed clearly indicates such an intention . . . .â€).Â  There is nothing in the Reporterâ€™s Comments cited by the majority or the statute itself that indicates the General Assembly intended to abrogate all common law causes of action involving corporate directors and officers and shareholders.Â  \r\nFurthermore, even if Â§ 33-8-420 applies, I would find the statute of limitations period set forth in subsection (e) does not bar appellantsâ€™ claims. Section 33-80-420(e) provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  An action against an officer for failure to perform the duties imposed by this section must be commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued, or within two years after the time when the cause of action is discovered, or should reasonably have been discovered, whichever sooner occurs. This limitations period does not apply to breaches of duty which have been concealed fraudulently.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  The majority states that the Reporterâ€™s Comments to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-8-300 (1990) support its conclusion that the last sentence in Â§ 33-8-420(e) applies only to the three-year statute of limitations period.Â  I disagree.Â  This subsection sets forth only one period, whichever occurs sooner of three years from the actual accrual or two years from discovery, and â€œthis limitations periodâ€ does not apply when fraudulent concealment is alleged.Â  The Reporterâ€™s Comments specifically state:Â  â€œThe advantage of the short limitations period set forth in subsection (e) is not available to fiduciaries who fraudulently conceal their wrongdoing.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  In my opinion, the last sentence in this subsection does not apply only to the three-year period and I would find this entire subsection inapplicable.Â  I would hold that appellants had three years from discovery, pursuant to the general statute of limitations set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005), in which to bring their claims.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse the order dismissing appellantsâ€™ complaint.\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] We need not decide whether Bunting is a registered broker-dealer, agent, or investment advisor within the meaning of this statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-20 (Supp. 2004) (definitions under Uniform Securities Act).\r\n[2] The dissent would find that the Act does not abrogate the common law duties.Â  We agree that those duties have not been abrogated, that is, â€œannulled, cancelled, repealed or destroyedâ€ as that term is defined in Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, but rather hold that the duties have been codified, as is the Legislatureâ€™s prerogative.Â  See, e.g. Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 562, 615 S.E.2d 98 (2005) (statute codifies common law rule that alimony terminates at death).\r\n[3] We strongly suspect that the board of directors, rather than an officer and the corporate entity, committed the alleged misdeed.Â  Since we are reviewing the grant of a Rule 12 (b) (6) motion to dismiss, we must accept the complaintâ€™s allegations as true.\r\n[4] As we recently clarified, a breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law.Â  See Jordan v. Holt, ___ S.C. ___, 608 S.E.2d 129 (2005).\r\n[5] The dissent begins its analysis of the statute of limitations issue by assuming that Â§ 33-8-420 applies, but concludes by holding that this section is â€œinapplicableâ€ and that the appellants had three years to bring their claim pursuant to the general statute, Â§ 15-3-530.Â  We adhere to our analysis of Â§ 33-8-420, which is borne out by the Reportersâ€™ Comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26109","title":"In the Matter of Richland County Magistrate Golie S.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        I.S. Leevy Johnson, of Columbia, for respondent.Â Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a sanction pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and impose a one year suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina Summary Court Judgesâ€™ Association sponsored a seminar for all South Carolina summary court judges from Thursday, March 3, 2005, through Saturday, March 5, 2005, in Myrtle Beach.Â  Respondent needed the continuing legal education (CLE) hours afforded by attendance at the seminar in order to meet his mandatory CLE requirements for the reporting period of July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005.Â  \r\n As instructed by respondent, an employee of respondent enrolled respondent in the seminar and picked up respondentâ€™s enrollment package at the seminar on Thursday, March 3rd.Â  Based on his enrollment in his seminar, the South Carolina Supreme Court Commission on CLE &amp; Specialization (the CLE Commission) sent respondent a Form K/Report (Compliance Report) which included twelve hours of CLE credit for attendance at all three days of the seminar.Â  \r\nRespondent signed the Compliance Report under oath before a notary public and then submitted the signed and notarized report to the CLE Commission.Â  In actuality, respondent did not attend the first two days of the seminar and only attended the seminar on the third day (which was scheduled from 10:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., including a 1Â½ hour non-credit adjournment for lunch).Â  \r\nOn or about October 26, 2005, Disciplinary Counsel filed a complaint with the Commission alleging respondent did not attend the seminar on Thursday, March 3rd or Friday, March 4th.Â  Respondent was required to file a written response to the complaint.Â  In his October 27, 2005 written response, respondent asserted he attended the seminar on Friday, March 4th from 9:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m., as well as Saturday, March 5th from 10:30 a.m. through 3:00 p.m.Â  \r\nDisciplinary Counsel initiated an investigation and requested Special Investigator James L. Evans, Jr., of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office interview respondent.Â  Investigator Evans interviewed respondent over the telephone on October 31 and November 1, 2005.Â  In both interviews, respondent admitted he did not attend the seminar on Thursday, March 3rd, and asserted he had attended the seminar on Friday, March 4th, and Saturday, March 5th.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen respondent signed the initial Compliance Report, made his initial written response to Disciplinary Counsel, and gave oral statements to Investigator Evans, respondent knew or should have known he had not attended the seminar on Friday, March 4th, and knew or should have known that his representations to the contrary were false.Â  Also, when respondent filed the initial Compliance Report, he knew or should have known that he had not attended the seminar on Thursday, March 3rd, contrary to the information he certified in the report.Â  \r\nOn November 3, 2005, respondent sent correspondence to Disciplinary Counsel in which he acknowledged he only attended the Saturday, March 5th portion of the seminar.Â  Subsequently, respondent amended the Compliance Report, changing his CLE hours earned for the seminar from twelve hours to four hours, thereby claiming CLE credit for only Saturday, March 5th.Â  Respondent filed the amended Compliance Report with the CLE Commission.Â  Respondent amended the Compliance Report by making a pen and ink change to the CLE hours and without having the amended Compliance Report re-notarized or the change initialed by the notary.Â  On November 29, 2005, respondent filed an amended response with Disciplinary Counsel.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); and Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary).Â  Respondent admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate Judgeâ€™s Oath of Office) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a suspension from judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent for one (1) year.Â  \r\nSUSPENDED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT and PLEICONES, J.J., concur.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Charles N. Pearman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Marlene T. Sipes, pro se, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction pursuant to Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent represented Complainant Aâ€™s ex-wife in divorce proceedings between Complainant A and his ex-wife.Â  As part of the divorce settlement between Complainant A and his ex-wife, Complainant A agreed to pay $22,000 to his ex-wife to extinguish a portion of the partiesâ€™ $40,000 marital debt with the understanding that his ex-wife would pay off the entire marital debt using Complainant Aâ€™s $22,000 and her own funds for the balance.Â  \r\nIn December 2003, respondent received the $22,000 from Complainant A and placed those funds in her trust account.Â  The balance in the trust account prior to the deposit of the $22,000 was $0.Â  Â Respondent then transferred $2,200 from her trust account to her personal account which, according to notations on respondentâ€™s bank statement, represented a â€œ10% debt settlement fee.â€Â  Neither Complainant A nor his ex-wife agreed to, were advised about, or were even aware of the â€œ10% debt settlement fee.â€ \r\nFrom December 2003 through April 2004, respondent transferred client funds totaling $14,600 from her trust account to her personal account.Â  The $14,600 was not used to pay the marital debts of Complainant A and his ex-wife or for any other benefit to Complainant A and his ex-wife.Â  The funds were used for respondentâ€™s own personal benefit.[1]Â  Respondent diverted a total of $19,311.67 in funds belonging to Complainant A and his ex-wife from her trust account to her own personal use without knowledge or acquiescence of Complainant A and his ex-wife. Â \r\nFrom January 2004 through April 2004, respondent made two deposits of personal funds totaling $7,900 into her trust account. Â From December 2003 through April 2004, respondent made payments to Complainant A and his ex-wifeâ€™s creditors totaling $8,475.26 using funds paid into the trust account by respondent.Â  \r\nImpermissible interest earned on the trust account funds was credited to respondent by the bank on a monthly basis.Â  The interest was retained by respondent and not remitted to the South Carolina Bar in accordance with Rule 412, SCACR.Â  \r\nAt the end of April 2004, the balance in respondentâ€™s trust account was $17.59 when the amount of client funds belonging to Complainant A and his ex-wife should have been $13,524.75.Â  Respondent acknowledges she did not have this amount in cash or on deposit in any bank account at the end of April 2004.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFrom May 2004 through the present, respondent has made additional payments of $5,096.32 to Complainant A and his ex-wifeâ€™s creditors.Â  The total amount paid by respondent to date on behalf of Complainant A and his ex-wife is $13,571.58.Â  Respondent does not have the balance of Complainant A and his ex-wifeâ€™s funds of $8,428.42 in her trust account or elsewhere and, in fact, her trust account has reached a $0 balance and has been closed by the bank.Â  As a result of respondentâ€™s actions and inactions, Complainant A and his ex-wifeâ€™s credit ratings have been severely impaired and the majority of their $40,000 marital debt remains outstanding.Â  \r\nIn May 2005, ODC issued a subpoena to respondent requiring the production of certain bank records including reconciliations, check stubs, deposit slips, and trust account ledgers.Â  Respondent produced some of the requested information but could not locate, and therefore, could not provide, much of the information, notwithstanding the maintenance of documentation required by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent has completely failed to reconcile her trust account has failed to comply with other requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent represented Complainant B in a divorce action.Â  Over the course of the representation, Complainant B repeatedly attempted to contact respondent via telephone, e-mail, and through third parties.Â  Respondent frequently failed to respond to Complainant Bâ€™s communications, thereby failing to properly and reasonably communicate with Complainant B regarding the status of her case.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1989, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for one year.Â  In the Matter of Sipes, 297 S.C. 531, 377 S.E.2d 574 (1989).Â  In 2003, respondent received a letter of caution with a finding of minor misconduct citing Rule 1.16 of Rule 407, SCACR.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5 (lawyerâ€™s fee shall be reasonable); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent further admits her misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  She agrees her misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nIn addition, within thirty (30) days of the date of this order, ODC and respondent shall file a restitution plan with the Court.Â  In the plan, respondent shall agree to pay restitution to all presently known and/or subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of her misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Moreover, in the restitution plan, respondent shall agree to reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection for any claims paid as a result of her misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, J.J., concur.

Kennedy, Jr., Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26111\r\nSubmitted December 22, 2005 - Filed February 6, 2006Â  \r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Susan M. Johnston, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Desa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment pursuant to Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In addition, respondent agrees to pay restitution to clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of his misconduct.Â  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent had previously represented Complainant A in a quiet title action involving real property.Â  Thereafter, Complainant A became involved in or was threatened with litigation involving easements related to the real property that was the subject of the previous quiet title action.Â  With respondentâ€™s acquiescence, Complainant A delivered his file related to the easement issue to respondentâ€™s office for review.Â  Approximately two (2) months went by without Complainant A hearing from respondent on this matter.Â Â Â Â  \r\nComplainant A tried without success to contact respondent about the matter and then launched an intensive campaign to contact respondent at his office.Â  Complainant A also wrote respondent several â€œheatedâ€ letters which respondent found offensive.Â  Thereafter, respondent left a voice message on Complainant Aâ€™s home answering machine which contained abusive and profane language about the matter.Â  Complainant A stated that this message was heard by his wife and children.Â  \r\nWhen Complainant A went to retrieve his file from respondent, respondent made a remark which Complainant A interpreted as respondent was going to â€œcreate a problem for [Complainant A]â€ or words of similar import and effect.Â  \r\nRespondent never agreed to undertake the easement matter other than to review the file on the issue.Â  After reviewing the file, considering his relationship with Complainant A, and considering his other workload, respondent decided he did not want to undertake to represent Complainant A in the easement matter and so advised him.Â  Respondent now recognizes he should not have used abusive or profane language in dealing with Complainant A, that he should have been more prompt in deciding whether or not to undertake representation in the easement matter, that his communications with Complainant A about whether or not he would undertake the matter were not as they should have been, and that the file should have been returned to Complainant A if respondent was not going to undertake representation of Complainant A in the new matter.Â  Â \r\nMatter II\r\nComplainant B transmitted money to respondent to fund two real estate transactions.Â  The first transaction was closed with a profit to Complainant B.Â  As a result, there should have been approximately $7,000 in one of respondentâ€™s trust accounts to be applied toward the closing of the second transaction.Â  In contemplation of closing the second transaction, Complainant B also transmitted additional money to respondent which should have left a balance in respondentâ€™s trust account in excess of $20,000 belonging to Complainant B.\r\nComplainant B was later advised by a non-attorney employee on respondentâ€™s staff that the second transaction had not been closed, that the file had been turned over to another attorney, and that there were insufficient funds in respondentâ€™s trust account to refund the money to Complainant B.Â  The title insurance company involved in this transaction made a partial refund to Complainant B, but denied liability for the balance inasmuch as respondent had not caused an insured closing letter to be issued in connection with the transaction.Â  As a result, Complainant B suffered a loss of approximately $18,000.Â  Respondent acknowledges that the cause of this loss was the fact that he misappropriated all or at least a substantial portion of the funds and/or applied them toward purposes other than intended without the consent or knowledge of Complainant B.Â Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent served as a qualified tax intermediary in a Section 1031 Tax Deferred Exchange in connection with a real estate transaction where Complainant C was the initial seller and sought to locate replacement property for a like-kind exchange.Â  As a result, approximately $40,000 was turned over to respondent.Â  This money was deposited into one of respondentâ€™s trust accounts and was supposed to be held by respondent to be expended in connection with that transaction upon direction of the beneficiary for which the funds were being held.Â  Thereafter, respondent misappropriated those funds in their entirety or used the entire amount of those funds for purposes other than intended without the knowledge or consent of Complainant C.Â  \r\nComplainant C made a claim to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection (Lawyersâ€™ Fund).Â  The Lawyersâ€™ Fund approved a payment to Complainant C in the amount of $20,000 (the maximum payment that could be made under the applicable rules to a single complainant) leaving Complainant C with a financial loss as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct. \r\nMatter IV\r\nComplainant D is an attorney who specialized in tax matters.Â  Complainant D and respondent were, for a period of time, law partners operating under as a limited liability company (LLC).Â  This LLC was for the limited purpose of handling Section 1031 tax deferred real estate exchanges.Â  Otherwise, respondent and Complainant D maintained separate law practices. Â Complainant D terminated his relationship with respondent after he determined respondent had engaged in professional misconduct on several occasions and in the several matters set forth below. \r\nA.\r\nRespondent decided to refinance his personal residence with a bank loan.Â  Respondent requested Complainant D conduct the title search, review the closing documents, and serve as the settlement agent, including executing the HUD-1 Settlement Statement as closing attorney/settlement agent in connection with the refinancing.Â  Complainant D was scheduled to be out of state on the day of the closing of the refinancing transaction.Â  For that reason, Complainant D and respondent agreed that the loan proceeds would be deposited into one of respondentâ€™s trust accounts and disbursed by respondent.Â Â  \r\nThe original HUD-1 Settlement Statement signed by Complainant D showed payoffs to several other lenders who had prior liens on the property and showed very little or no â€œcash to borrower.â€Â  Complainant D signed page two of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement as â€œsettlement agent.â€Â  Thereafter, respondent drafted or caused to be drafted a new page one of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.Â  This new HUD-1 provided a disbursement to respondent (i.e., â€œcash to borrowerâ€) of approximately $157,266 and omitted the payoffs to the other lenders that were supposed to be paid according to the original HUD-1 signed by Complainant D.Â  Complainant D had not authorized and did not know about the new page one until after the closing and disbursements in connection with the transaction.Â  \r\nRespondent received loan proceeds from the lender in the amount of $280,000 in connection with the refinancing transaction.Â  He did not pay off the holders of the prior liens and, instead, converted and used approximately $157,266 for purposes other than intended by or known to the lender.Â  As a result, these prior liens remained senior in priority to the lien of the refinancing lender.Â  Â Â Â \r\n In connection with the refinancing transaction, respondent asked Complainant D to execute the loan policy of title insurance on behalf of the title insurance company as his â€œlicensee.â€ Â Respondent assured Complainant D that he could, under respondentâ€™s agency agreement with the title insurance company, authorize Complainant D to sign the title insurance policy on behalf of the title company as â€œlicenseeâ€ of respondent.[1]Â  In reliance on respondentâ€™s assurance, Complainant D signed his own name to the loan title insurance policy on behalf of the title insurance company.Â  \r\nRespondent presented the title policy to the lender.Â  The lender questioned certain aspects of the loan policy presented and required that an amended loan policy be issued containing certain additional requirements of the lender.Â  Respondent then redrafted the loan policy, signed or allowed someone else to sign Complainant Dâ€™s name to the loan policy on behalf of the title insurance company, and then presented this new loan policy to the lender bearing Complainant Dâ€™s forged signature.Â  In reliance on the provisions of this new loan policy, the lender tendered the loan proceeds to respondent.Â  \r\nThe amended loan policy of title insurance reflects that the refinancing lender had a first mortgage lien on the subject property when, in fact, there were several prior and, therefore, superior liens on the subject property (respondentâ€™s residence) which was well known to respondent.Â  The lender consummated the refinanced loan transaction in reliance on the information in the amended loan policy of title insurance which falsely certified that the refinancing lender had a first lien on the subject property.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nB.\r\nIn another matter, respondent represented a client in connection with a Section 1031 exchange.Â  While Complainant D was out of the state, the LLC received a $943,265.08 check in connection with this 1031 exchange.Â  Respondent or someone acting on his behalf or under or subject to his direction and/or supervision endorsed this check â€œPay to [Respondentâ€™s] Law Officeâ€ (not the LLC partnership).Â  This check was then deposited into one of respondentâ€™s trust accounts.Â  Respondent then prepared or caused to be prepared a check on that trust account transferring $943,265.08 into another trust account maintained by respondent at another bank.Â  \r\nRespondent ultimately disbursed funds on the 1031 tax deferred exchange, but one check issued in the amount of $77,543.52 by respondent on one of his trust accounts in connection with the exchange was not honored upon presentment due to insufficient funds in the trust account.Â  Respondent admits the check was not honored because he had misappropriated these funds and/or converted the funds for purposes other than intended.Â  The client made a claim for these funds with the title insurance company which made a payment to the client in the amount of $79,787.79.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nOn August 26, 2002, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Kennedy, ___ S.C. ___, 623 S.E.2d 640 (2002). Â Respondent acknowledges that, at that time, he had shortages in his trust account of approximately $280,000. Â Respondent further acknowledges that, immediately prior to his interim suspension, he had approximately thirteen bank accounts and that he failed to follow the recordkeeping and money handling requirements of Rule 417, SCACR, in connection with the various trust accounts.Â  From time to time, respondent used money in his trust accounts which belonged to his clients to pay his personal expenses.Â  \r\nRespondent has represented to ODC that the cause of the acknowledged shortage in his trust accounts was the failure of a lender to wire loan proceeds into one of the trust accounts approximately twelve years ago.Â  Respondent stated he incorrectly believed the funds had been wired into the trust account and closed a transaction and disbursed the proceeds reflected in that transaction when he had not actually received the proceeds.Â  However, respondent can neither Â remember nor identify the name of the lender who failed to wire those loan proceeds to his trust account and he cannot identify the client in that transaction. \r\nODC has determined and contends that the total shortage in respondentâ€™s trust account in fact grew to the approximate sum of $420,000 at the time respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â Â For purposes of this agreement, respondent does not contest that contention.Â  However, respondent has represented to ODC that he suspects someone on his staff embezzled some money out of the trust account, thereby causing the known shortage of approximately $280,000 to increase to the actual amount thereof.Â  Respondent has not been able to provide records to support his suspicion.Â  \r\nAs a result of the shortage in his various trust accounts (whether the sum of $280,000 as acknowledged by respondent or the approximate sum of $420,000 as contended by ODC), respondentÂ  instituted a scheme of check kiting and/or moving money between his various bank accounts to cover the shortages.Â  On at least one occasion, a bank required respondent to cover shortages in his personal account.Â  Respondent paid the bank with numerous checks written on one or more of his law firmâ€™s trust accounts to cover the shortages.Â  \r\nThe Lawyersâ€™ Fund has paid $68,596 in claims made against respondent as a result of his misconduct.Â  The title insurance company mentioned herein reports that, as of August 19, 2004, it has paid damages in the amount of $836,421 as a result of claims made in connection with the foregoing activities of respondent.Â  For purposes of this agreement, respondent does not dispute the title insurance companyâ€™s claim.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nOn or about March 10, 2005, respondent entered a plea of guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1341 in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has cooperated with ODCâ€™s investigation into these matters, including submitting to voluntary interviews, joining into a consent order releasing records to auditors, and consenting to being placed on interim suspension.Â  Until this matter, respondent had never been found to have committed professional misconduct in South Carolina.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact to a third person); Rule 5.3 (partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that a non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\nRespondent further admits his misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5) ( it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice, bring courts or legal profession into disrepute, or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate oath of office), and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a court order).Â  In addition, respondent admits his misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  The disbarment shall be retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nIn addition, within thirty (30) days of the date of this order, ODC and respondent shall file a restitution plan with the Court.Â  In the plan, respondent shall agree to pay restitution to all presently known and/or subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Moreover, in the restitution plan, respondent shall agree to reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for any claims paid as a result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.

The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBeginning in 2004, respondent began transferring funds from his trust account to his operating account.Â  These funds were being held in respondentâ€™s trust account for a client who was awaiting final disposition of a workersâ€™ compensation and a personal injury claim.Â  Respondent transferred a total of $65,000 and used these funds for his own personal use.Â  \r\nRespondent self-reported his misappropriation to ODC.Â  Two weeks prior to the self-report, respondent had been authorized to release the funds to his client.Â  Respondent represents he has made arrangements to reimburse the client, with interest, in the very near future.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\nRespondent further admits his misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) ( it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice, bring courts or legal profession into disrepute, or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nIn addition, within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, ODC and respondent shall file a restitution plan with the Court.Â  In the plan, respondent shall agree to pay restitution to the client who incurred losses as a result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, J.J., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of H.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26113\r\nHeard December 1, 2005 - Filed February 13, 2006Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Duke K. McCall, Jr., of Leatherwood, Walker, Todd &amp; Mann, of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\n        Linda Byars McKenzie, of Brown, McKenzie &amp; Bowen, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  The issue in this case is whether the employeeâ€™s (Stoneâ€™s) widow (respondent) is entitled to continue receiving workersâ€™ compensation benefits after Stoneâ€™s death due to causes unrelated to his compensable injury.Â  The full commissionâ€™s appellate panel affirmed a single commissionerâ€™s order granting respondentâ€™s request for lump sum benefits, holding that respondentâ€™s claim was not barred by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-280 (1985), and that res judicata and/or collateral estoppel operated so as to bar appellants from contesting respondentâ€™s right to receive the money.Â  The circuit court affirmed, citing Rule 59(e), SCRCP, as an additional bar.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter Stone injured his left foot and leg and his back at work, he brought a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  Stone subsequently developed a brain tumor.Â  In October 1999, the single commissioner found Stone permanently and totally disabled and awarded him 500 weeks of compensation pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 2004).Â  In December 1999, Stone died from complications related to his brain tumor.Â  Following a January 2000 hearing, the full commissionâ€™s appellate panel issued an order confirming Stoneâ€™s entitlement to disability payments pursuant to Â§ 42-9-10.Â  The circuit court affirmed and appellants appealed to the Court of Appeals.\r\nOn appeal, appellants argued as they had before the commission and the circuit court that Stoneâ€™s disability should have been apportioned between the injury and the tumor, resulting in a lower compensation award pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-160 (1985).Â  In its first unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals acknowledged Stoneâ€™s death, and affirmed the award.Â  The Court of Appeals construed Â§ 42-9-160, upon which appellants based their apportionment argument, to require apportionment only between two compensable injuries, and went on to state:\r\n\r\n  For example, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-280 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2000) indicates that apportionment is not appropriate when death results from a noncompensable cause.\r\n\r\nAppellants filed a petition for rehearing, arguing among other things that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-280 did not apply to Stone since he had received compensation under the first paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 and therefore â€œhis award ceases with his death and is apportionable.â€Â Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals denied rehearing, but issued an amended unpublished opinion in January 2002.Â  In this opinion, the Court of Appeals again affirmed, but altered its reference to Â§ 42-9-280.Â  Appellantsâ€™ petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by this Court: it did not include any argument that Stoneâ€™s claim had abated by operation of Â§ 42-9-280, since that section was not at issue in this first appellate proceeding except by virtue of the Court of Appealsâ€™ use of it as a comparative.Â  In this first series of appeals, neither respondent nor Stoneâ€™s estate was ever substituted as a party following Stoneâ€™s death.Â  See Rule 226, SCACR (substitution of party upon death, etc.).\r\nFollowing the denial of certiorari, respondent filed a petition with the commission seeking a dependency hearing.Â  Appellants replied by letter that no dependency hearing was necessary as further benefit payments were barred by Â§ 42-9-280.Â  Following the dependency hearing, respondent was awarded lump sum benefits by the single commissioner, an award affirmed by an appellate panel of the full commission and the circuit court.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are appellants precluded from contesting respondentâ€™s entitlement to benefits?\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, does Â§ 42-9-280 preclude respondentâ€™s receipt of benefits?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Preclusion\r\nThe commission and circuit court held appellantsâ€™ defense, that Stoneâ€™s right to benefits ceased upon his death pursuant to Â§ 42-9-280 and that respondent therefore had no claim, was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and/or the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Â  Appellants contend this was error.Â  We agree.\r\nThe res judicata/collateral estoppel rulings are based upon appellantsâ€™ failure to seek dismissal of their first appeal when Stone died following the single commissionerâ€™s order awarding Stone benefits.Â  As explained infra, appellants did seek to stay the benefits proceedings before the commission while dependency was determined, but respondentâ€™s attorneyâ€™s objection to that procedure was sustained.\r\nRes judicata requires three elements be met: 1) a final, valid judgment on the merits; 2) identity of parties; and 3) the second action must involve matters properly included in the first suit.Â  E.g. Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 602 S.E.2d 32 (2004).Â  Here, the parties are different, and the issue is not the amount of compensation due but rather whether the right to compensation survives Stoneâ€™s death.Â  Res judicata does not bar appellantsâ€™ statute-based defense to respondentâ€™s dependency claim.\r\nFurther, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply.Â  â€œCollateral estoppel prevents a party from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.â€Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003).Â  Respondentâ€™s entitlement to benefits following Stoneâ€™s death was neither actually litigated in the first action, nor was the entitlement issue necessary to the resolution of the amount of benefits dispute.\r\nIn addition, respondent essentially contends that appellants waived their right to contest respondentâ€™s right to benefits at the January 2000 hearing.Â  The record refutes this contention.Â  At the outset of this hearing, the following took place:\r\n\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ attorney:Â  May it please the Chairman and members of the Appellant [sic] Panel.Â  Iâ€™m in a little bit of an unusual situation in this case in that Walter Stone is now deceased as of the end of December.Â  And I would therefore move for a continuance of this Hearing until such time as a dependency or the proper dependents can be determined.Â  Because no benefits can be paid, if they are in fact payable, until the dependency of Mr. Stone [sic] has been determined.\r\n  (emphasis supplied).\r\n  Commissioner Lyndon:Â  If I could hear from [Mr. Stoneâ€™s attorney] on that, sir?\r\n  Mr. Stoneâ€™s Attorney:Â  May it please the Panel.Â  Of course, that is not even an issue before this Panel today.Â  In the first place, this is an appeal from an Order.Â  The fact that the man subsequently died, you canâ€™t have a dependency hearing, what happens to have a dependency hearing [sic] if the Commission were to say well, itâ€™s not compensable.Â  And then if you affirm the case, then of course we have a dependency hearing.\r\n  Commissioner Lyndon:Â  I understand.Â  And I see it the way---unless my colleagues want---\r\n  Commissioner Mickle:Â  I donâ€™t think youâ€™re prejudiced by it.\r\n  Commissioner Lyndon:Â  I donâ€™t think youâ€™re prejudiced by it.Â  So Iâ€™ll note your Motion.\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ Attorney:Â  I will admit weâ€™re not prejudiced by it.Â  But I would offer that in the Circuit Courts if you have a party that is deceased then the proceedings are stopped and the parties are realigned until you get an Administrator or a personal representation [sic] appointed to come into Court.\r\n  Commissioner Atkins:Â  Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, [Appellantsâ€™ Attorney], that would just hold up the benefits at a later time.Â  I mean, we can go ahead and make this decision.Â  This can be appealed wherever it needs to be appealed so that when that situation is taken care of then they would be prejudiced if theyâ€™ve had to not be able to continue or so that they could be paid at the appropriate time once all that was taken care of.\r\n\r\nNothing in this passage can be construed as a waiver of appellantsâ€™ right to contest respondentâ€™s claim to benefits.Â  If anything, this colloquy could be read to estop respondent from claiming any procedural bar to the litigation now, after the first appeals have been concluded, of her right to â€œbenefitsâ€¦if they are in fact payableâ€¦.â€Â  \r\nSimilarly, any contention that appellants could or should have raised the Â§ 42-9-280 issue during the first appeals are refuted by this colloquy.Â  Only issues raised and ruled upon by the commission are cognizable on appeal.Â  E.g., TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Rev., 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 741 (1998) (on appeal from agency decision, circuit court can only review issues raised to and ruled upon by the commission).Â  At respondentâ€™s attorneyâ€™s insistence, the only issue before the panel in January 2000 was the amount of benefits to which Stone was entitled.Â  In light of the commissionâ€™s ruling, appellants did not, and could not, litigate the applicability of Â§ 42-9-280.\r\nThe circuit court referred to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, in its conclusion that appellants were procedurally barred from denying respondentâ€™s entitlement to Stoneâ€™s benefits.Â  Apparently, the ruling is premised on the misapprehension that once the commissionâ€™s appellate panel declined to discontinue the appeal pending a dependency hearing as appellants had requested, appellants were obligated to file a Rule 59(e) motion before the appellate panel to preserve the issue.Â  Rule 59(e) is not applicable in proceedings before the commission.Â  See Nettles v. Spartanburg School Dist. #7, 341 S.C. 580, 535 S.E.2d 146, fn. 4 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nRespondent also asserts as a sustaining ground that appellantsâ€™ invocation of Â§ 42-9-280 should be barred by laches.Â  Given that when appellants raised the effect of Stoneâ€™s death at the first available opportunity, that is, the January 2000 hearing before the appellate panel, respondent objected, and that appellants raised the issue at their next opportunity, that is, in response to respondentâ€™s request for a dependency hearing, equity will not and should not aid respondent.Â  See e.g., Hemingway v. Mention, 228 S.C. 211, 89 S.E.2d 369 (1955) (laches invoked where appellants were not vigilant).Â  Laches does not bar appellantsâ€™ defense.\r\nThe circuit court erred in upholding the commissionâ€™s ruling that there was a procedural bar to litigation on the merits of respondentâ€™s claim to post-death benefits.\r\nB.Â Section 42-9-280\r\nStone was awarded 500 weeks of benefits based on a finding of total disability pursuant to the first paragraph of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10.[1]Â  The statute provides:\r\n\r\n  Â§ 42-9-10.Â  Amount of compensation for total disability; what constitutes total disability. (Title)\r\n  When the incapacity for work resulting from an injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as provided in this chapter, to the injured employee during the total disability a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of his average weekly wages, but not less than seventy-five dollars a week so long as this amount does not exceed his average weekly salary; if this amount does exceed his average weekly salary, the injured employee may not be paid, each week, less than his average weekly salary.Â  The injured employee may not be paid more each week than the average weekly wage in this State for the preceding fiscal year.Â  In no case may the period covered by the compensation exceed five hundred weeks except as hereinafter provided. (1st paragraph)\r\n  The loss of both hands, arms, feet, legs, or vision in both eyes, or any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability to be compensated according to the provisions of this section. (2nd paragraph)\r\n  Notwithstanding the five hundred week limitation prescribed in this section or elsewhere in this title, any person determined to be totally and permanently disabled who as a result of a compensable injury is a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical brain damage is not subject to the five hundred week limitation and shall receive the benefits for life. (3rd paragraph)\r\n  Notwithstanding the provisions of Â§ 42-9-301, no total lump sum payment may be ordered by the commission in any case under this section where the injured person is entitled to lifetime benefits. (4th paragraph)\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the commission and circuit court erred in concluding that the right to Stoneâ€™s benefits did not terminate upon his death pursuant to Â§ 42-9-280. Â The statute provides:\r\n\r\n  Â§ 42-9-280.Â  Payment of unpaid balance of compensation when employee dies.\r\n  When an employee receives or is entitled to compensation under this Title for an injury covered by the second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 or 42-9-30[2] and dies from any other cause than the injury for which he was entitled to compensation, payment of the unpaid balance of compensation shall be made to his next of kin dependent upon him for support, in lieu of the compensation the employee would have been entitled to had he lived.Â  But if the death is due to a cause that is compensable under this Title and the dependents of such employee are awarded compensation therefor, all right to unpaid compensation provided by this section shall cease and determine.\r\n\r\nAppellants contend that since Stoneâ€™s benefits were based upon paragraph 1 of Â§ 42-9-10, the right to compensation abated upon his death from the brain tumor.Â  The commission based its decision to continue benefits to respondent despite Â§ 42-9-280 on this reasoning:\r\n\r\n  It is inconceivable that the legislature intended to protect the widow and/or dependents who are dependent upon the deceased employee for support only when the deceased employee suffered a schedule loss as set forth in Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-30.Â  This clearly would defeat the beneficent purpose for which the workersâ€™ compensation law was passed, that being to protect the injured employee and his dependents.Â  To hold otherwise would deprive the widow in this case of the equal protection of the law.\r\n\r\nThe commission then cited Â§ 42-9-290 as evidence of â€œthe legislative intent to take care of those dependent upon an employee whose injury is work related.â€Â  As appellants correctly point out, Â§ 42-9-290 is the applicable statute where the employee dies from the injury or accident which entitled him to workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  It simply has no application to Â§ 42-9-280, which applies when, as here, the employee dies from an independent cause.\r\nThe circuit court upheld the commissionâ€™s order.Â  It began by reciting numerous cases which stand for the principle that the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act must be liberally construed in favor of injured workers and their dependents.Â  It concluded that â€œif the legislature meant to abrogate the rights of an individual such as [respondent] such would have been set forth in plain language.â€Â  \r\nThe language of Â§ 42-9-280 is plain.Â  The legislature, as is its prerogative, determined that dependent survivors should receive all benefits due an injured worker who lost the use of a scheduled member (Â§ 42-9-30), or â€œlost both hands, arms, feet, legs, or vision in both eyes, or any two thereofâ€ (second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10), i.e., those who suffered a physical loss, while the dependents of a person totally disabled for another reason, i.e., one who suffered a wage loss compensated under the first paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10, should not.Â  The legislative distinction between â€œphysical lossâ€ and â€œwage lossâ€ appears in other workersâ€™ compensation statutes as well.Â  See e.g., Â§Â§ 42-9-150; 42-9-160; 42-9-170.\r\nProfessor Larson notes that since a compensation award, unlike a tort award, is a personal one based on the employeeâ€™s need for a substitute for lost wages and earning capacity, in the absence of a special statutory provision, heirs have no claim to unaccrued weekly payments.Â  Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law (2000) Â§Â§ 89.01; 89.03.Â  In construing a workersâ€™ compensation statute, â€œthe words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Adkins v. Comcar Industries, Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 475 S.E.2d 762 (1996) (internal citation omitted).Â  Section 42-9-280 specifically provides for the inheritability of two types of awards only.Â  We reverse the orders permitting respondent to receive unaccrued benefits.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nStone was awarded workersâ€™ compensation benefits pursuant to the first paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10.Â  Those benefits terminated upon his death from the tumor.Â  Â§ 42-9-280.Â  The circuit court order affirming the lump sum award to respondent is therefore\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, J.J., and Acting Justice D. L. Jefferson, concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  Appellants contested Walter Stoneâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation award for over two years after his unfortunate death, never once raising S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-280 (1985) as a bar to the recovery of benefits.Â  In my view, when a workersâ€™ compensation claimant dies while his claim is being appealed, an employer may not, after final judgment in the appeal, assert Â§ 42-9-280 in an effort to avoid paying any benefits.\r\nAccordingly, I would affirm the circuit court and find that Respondent is entitled to receive the full amount of Walter Stoneâ€™s compensation award.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent argues in her brief that Stone could have been awarded benefits under Â§ 42-9-30(15) and (19) for loss of use of his back and leg.Â  Appellants conceded at oral argument that such an award could have been made, had the commission chosen to utilize that statute.Â  The order, however, unequivocally finds total disability under Â§ 42-9-10, and awards compensation pursuant to that statute alone. \r\n[2] This is the â€œscheduled membersâ€ statute, which was not the basis for Stoneâ€™s 500 week award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26114","title":"Simpson v.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia, for Petitioner-Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respondent-Petitioner Keith Lasean Simpson (Simpson) was found guilty of murder and received a death sentence.Â  Simpson appealed and this Court affirmed.Â  State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996).Â  Simpson filed for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  The PCR court denied relief on all issues related to guilt but granted relief on sentencing.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nSimpson and his accomplice planned to rob a convenience store.Â  Armed with guns, the two men went to a store owned by Joe Harrison. Once there, Simpson went inside the store while his accomplice waited in the parking lot.Â  At the same time, a customer entered the store with his nine-year-old son, Nathan.Â  After making his purchase, the customer went outside to wait for Nathan.Â  Joe Harrison was behind the counter, working the register.\r\nSuddenly, gunshots were fired.Â  A store employee, who was in the back of the store, testified that he saw Harrison walking towards the front door while Simpson shot at Harrison from behind. Â Nathan testified that he walked towards the front of the store to see what had happened.Â  According to Nathan, Simpson pointed the gun at Nathanâ€™s forehead and attempted to fire the gun, but it only made a clicking noise.Â  After this encounter with Simpson, Nathan ran and hid behind a poker machine.Â  Nathan testified that while he was hiding, he saw Simpson go behind the counter and take money from the cash register. Â \r\nOnce the shooting began inside, Simpsonâ€™s accomplice shot Nathanâ€™s father, Tony Scott, outside, in the parking lot. Â Scott was injured, and Harrison, the owner, died.Â  Simpson and his accomplice fled the scene, pointing their guns and shooting at others in the area, but injuring no one else. \r\nSimpson was indicted for murder, armed robbery, assault and battery with intent to kill, possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime, and five counts of pointing a firearm.Â  \r\nAt trial, Simpson gave a different version of events.Â  He testified that once inside the store, he â€œchickened out.â€Â  He claimed that he lifted his shirt, exposing the gun, as a way of signaling to his accomplice that he no longer wanted to rob the store.Â  When Simpson lifted his shirt, Harrison saw the gun, grabbed Simpson by the shirt collar, and the two began to struggle.Â  During the alleged struggle, two shots went off, Harrison began to stagger, and then Simpson fired two additional shots at Harrison.Â  In addition, Simpson testified that he did not take anything from the store when he left.\r\nThe jury found Simpson guilty of murder and he was sentenced to death.Â  He was also sentenced to serve consecutive sentences of thirty years for armed robbery, twenty years for assault, and five years for each of the pointing-a-firearm charges.Â  Simpson appealed and this Court affirmed.Â  State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996).Â  Simpson filed for post-conviction relief (PCR), and following a hearing, Simpson was denied relief on guilt but granted relief on sentencing.Â  We granted Simpsonâ€™s and the Stateâ€™s petitions for certiorari. \r\nSimpson raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PCR court err in finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to consult an independent forensic pathologist, medical examiner, or homicide-reconstruction expert?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PCR court err by denying Simpson relief due to the State&rsquo;s failure to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence related to the armed-robbery charge? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PCR court err in finding the State did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Did the PCR court err in finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to call an expert witness to discredit a child witness&rsquo;s testimony?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.\r\n    Did the PCR court err in finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the State&rsquo;s use of peremptory challenges against women?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VI.\r\n    Did the PCR court err in failing to conduct a cumulative-error analysis?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe State raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PCR court err in finding Simpson was prejudiced by counsel&rsquo;s failure to fully develop Simpson&rsquo;s mitigation case?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PCR court err by considering numerous depositions and affidavits in lieu of live testimony? \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).&nbsp; On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.&nbsp; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).&nbsp; If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (citing Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)).\r\nTo establish a claim that counsel was ineffective, a PCR applicant must show that (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 694 (1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeâ€ of the trial.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.\r\nDiscussion\r\nIssues Raised by Simpson\r\nI.Â  Failure to Consult a Forensic Expert\r\nSimpson contends that the PCR court erred in finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to consult an independent forensic pathologist, a medical examiner, or a homicide-reconstruction expert.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, the State presented the expert testimony of Dr. Wren, the pathologist who performed Harrisonâ€™s autopsy.Â  Dr. Wren testified that Harrison was shot three times: once through the hand, once through the front abdomen, and once through the back.Â  Dr. Wren stated that all three were distant gunshot wounds, meaning that when fired, the gun was at least twelve inches from the victim.\r\nDefense counsel did not call an expert to rebut Dr. Wrenâ€™s testimony.Â  Instead, the defense presented Simpson as its sole witness.Â  Simpson testified that the shooting occurred during a struggle over the gun.Â  During closing argument, defense counsel reenacted Simpsonâ€™s testimony, showing the jury three possible theories regarding the trajectory of the bullets. \r\nAt the PCR hearing, defense counsel testified that he did not see a need for calling an expert witness to refute Dr. Wrenâ€™s testimony.Â  But to show that there was in fact a need for such testimony, PCR counsel called three expert witnesses to the stand.Â  Two of the experts testified that Harrison was shot in the hand while he was gripping the barrel of Simpsonâ€™s gun, which supported Simpsonâ€™s testimony that the shots were fired during a struggle. Â But one expert testified that Harrison could have been shot in the back while lying on the ground or he could have been shot in the back while standing upright and fleeing.Â  \r\nAfter considering this testimony, the PCR court found that defense counsel was not deficient in failing to consult an expert.Â  The court viewed the allegations against counsel as relating less with trial strategy and more to the degree that counsel should go in pursuing a defense theory.Â  In addition, the court found that even if counsel was deficient, there was no prejudice.Â  The judge found that the expert testimony presented at the PCR hearing added little either factually or theoretically, and did not negate the fact that all of the elements necessary for a murder conviction were present.Â  Therefore, the PCR court found that there was not a reasonable probability the added testimony would have changed the outcome of the guilt phase of the trial.Â  \r\nâ€œ[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.â€Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 691 (1984).Â  A decision â€œnot to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counselâ€™s judgments.â€Â  Id.Â  When counselâ€™s performance falls below this standard, a â€œdefendant must show that there is reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.â€Â  Id. at 694.Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.â€Â  Id.\r\nWe agree with the PCR court and find that counsel was not deficient in failing to consult a forensic expert.Â  It is clear from the record that counselâ€™s primary strategy was to prove that the shooting occurred during a struggle, and that this struggle somehow negated or lessened Simpsonâ€™s criminal liability for Harrisonâ€™s death.Â  However, evidence that Harrison grabbed Simpson by the shirt collar does nothing to explain how and why the gun was pulled from Simpsonâ€™s waist.Â  Additionally, Simpson himself testified to intentionally shooting a wounded Harrison twice after the alleged struggle concluded, once in Harrisonâ€™s back.Â  Even if Simpsonâ€™s testimony about the struggle was corroborated with expert testimony, there is not a reasonable probability that the jury would not have found Simpson guilty of murder. [1] \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the PCR court properly held that counsel was not ineffective in failing to consult an independent forensic pathologist, a medical examiner, or a homicide-reconstruction expert.[2]Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Brady Violation\r\nSimpson contends that the PCR court erred in denying relief due to the Stateâ€™s failure to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence related to the armed-robbery charge.Â  We agree.\r\nThe armed-robbery charge served as an aggravating circumstance that allowed the State to seek the death penalty.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (1976).Â  Accordingly, it was essential for the State to prove that Simpson actually robbed the store.Â  \r\nWhen police arrived at the scene of the crime, they noticed that the cash register drawer was open, and there were bills in every slot except the slot that would normally contain twenty-dollar bills.Â  Police also found a bag of money behind the counter, near the register.Â  Instead of preserving the bag and disclosing its existence to Simpsonâ€™s counsel, the police gave the bag to the victimâ€™s brother, Jack Harrison, who helped run the store.\r\nThe PCR court found: \r\n\r\n  The turning over of the bag by law enforcement clearly constitutes sloppy police work in an armed robbery investigation and could be considered a tainting of the scene.Â  Clearly the contents of the bag could have been exculpatory.Â  Clearly this evidence should have been preserved and, thus, been subject to discovery by [Simpson].\r\n\r\nDespite this finding, the court ruled that the issue about the bag of money was not preserved for review because Simpson did not specifically raise it in his PCR application.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, two witnesses were called to testify about the money issue.Â  The first witness was Simpsonâ€™s defense counsel, who testified that he learned about the bag of money only two hours before testifying.Â  The second witness was Jack Harrison, whom the State called for the specific purpose of addressing the money issue.Â  Jack testified that the money was used to cash customersâ€™ checks, and it was unusual for money to be taken from the register and put into the bag.Â  \r\nGiven this testimony and the PCR courtâ€™s ruling on the issue relating to the bag of money, we hold that Simpson should have been permitted to amend his PCR application to conform to the evidence presented. See Rule 15(b), SCRCP (pleadings may be amended, even after judgment, to conform to issues tried by express or implied consent but not raised in the original pleadings); Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 843 (1992) (amendments must conform to evidence presented at trial, not raise new claims).Â  Moreover, we hold that the State would not be prejudiced by such an amendment given that the State cross-examined Simpsonâ€™s defense counsel on the issue and was permitted to present its own witness, Jack Harrison, to contest the issueâ€™s relevance.Â  See Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 313, 566 S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002) (amendments should be liberally allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result). \r\nTurning to the merits, we hold that the Stateâ€™s failure to tell the defense that a bag of money was found behind the counter prejudiced Simpsonâ€™s case in the penalty phase.Â  â€œ[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.â€ Brady v. State of Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).Â  A Brady claim is complete if the accused can demonstrate (1) the evidence was favorable to the accused, (2) it was in the possession of or known to the prosecution, (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and (4) it was material to guilt or punishment.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 659, 594 S.E.2d 462, 470 (2004).Â  Favorable evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Id. at 660, 594 S.E.2d at 470.Â  \r\nArmed robbery was both a charge against Simpson in its own right and a statutory aggravating circumstance urged by the State as a ground for imposing the death penalty.Â  There is a reasonable probability that Simpson would not have been found guilty of armed robbery had the evidence about the bag of money been disclosed.[3]Â  Moreover, because the State needed to prove that a robbery occurred in order to seek the death penalty, there is a reasonable probability that Simpson would not have received a sentence of death had the State failed to prove Simpson robbed the store. \r\nTherefore, we hold that the PCR court erred in denying relief on this basis.Â  Accordingly, Simpson is entitled to a new trial on the armed robbery charge.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Prosecutorial Misconduct\r\nSimpson contends that the PCR court erred in finding that the State did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct in its alleged coaching of the child witness, Nathan.Â  We disagree.\r\nA conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the juryâ€™s judgment.Â  U.S. v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985).Â  The knowing use of perjured testimony is subject to the materiality standard of review:Â  â€œevidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.â€Â  Id. at 682.\r\nAt trial, Detective Rick Gregory testified that he interviewed nine-year-old Nathan Scott the day after the shooting.Â  During their conversation, which Gregory did not record, Nathan told Gregory that he saw a black man go behind the counter and take money out of the cash register.Â  But twelve days later, Gregory obtained a written statement from Nathan in which Nathan mentioned only that he saw a black man go behind the cash registerâ€”not that he saw a man take money from the register.\r\nAt some point before trial, the Stateâ€™s investigator, Johnny Dyer, went to Nathanâ€™s home to discuss the crime.Â  After talking at the house, Dyer took Nathan to the store so that Nathan could explain what he had witnessed and where he had hidden during the incident.Â  Afterwards, Dyer sent a letter to defense counsel stating â€œNathan Scott may testify that he saw the black man in the store, and the man had money in his hand that came from the cash register.â€\r\nSimpson first contends that the State engineered and introduced materially false and misleading testimony regarding whether Nathan saw Simpson take money from the register.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough there is speculation that Dyer attempted to improperly influence Nathan, there is simply no evidence supporting a finding that such misconduct actually occurred.Â  In fact, the State was uncertain as to how Nathan would testify.Â  In a letter to defense counsel, Dyer stated that Nathan may testify that he saw Simpson take money from the register.Â  And later, at the PCR hearing, defense counsel explained that he did not call Dyer to testify because counsel was uncertain as to whether Dyer had improperly coached Nathan. \r\nMoreover, there is no evidence to support a finding that Nathanâ€™s testimony was false.Â  Defense counsel was aware that Nathanâ€™s story had changed throughout the investigation and cross-examined him accordingly.Â  The jury heard this testimony and was able to evaluate Nathanâ€™s credibility based on these inconsistencies.Â  \r\nSimpson also contends that, by not telling defense counsel about the meeting with Nathan at home and at the store, the State withheld exculpatory and impeaching evidence in violation of Brady.Â  We disagree.Â  Simpson was unable to show that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the defense known about the meeting.Â  Therefore, we find that the State did not violate Brady.Â  See Sheppard, 357 S.C. at 660, 594 S.E.2d at 470 (withheld evidence must be material to guilt or punishment).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the PCR court properly found that the State did not engage in prosecutorial conduct. \r\nIV.Â  Expert Witness\r\nSimpson contends that the PCR court erred in finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to call an expert witness to discredit Nathanâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, defense counsel testified that he did not think that he needed to call an expert witness to discredit Nathanâ€™s testimony.Â  After learning that Nathanâ€™s recollection of events had changed, counsel decided that the issue could be addressed on cross-examination, and counsel was in fact able to get Nathan to admit on cross that someone from the solicitorâ€™s office â€œhelpedâ€ him remember that he saw â€œa black man taking money out of the cash register.â€Â  Given this admission, counsel concluded that cross-examination â€œwent very well,â€ and therefore there was no need to consult any sort of expert to discredit Nathanâ€™s testimony. \r\nIn response, Simpson presented expert testimony at the PCR hearing from a developmental psychologist who identified a number of factorsâ€”including Nathanâ€™s low I.Q., his young age, and the length of time between when the crime occurred and when Nathan was interviewed by investigatorsâ€”indicating that Nathan would likely remember false details about the shooting.\r\nThe PCR court found that counsel â€œably, adequately and thoroughly addressed the false memory/suggestion issue at the source, Nathan Scott.â€Â  In addition, the court found that the cross-examination of Nathan â€œclearly exposed his lack of accurate recall and not only his susceptibility to suggestion, but the actual enhancement of his recall by statements to him by others, namely individuals at the Solicitorâ€™s office.â€Â  We agree.\r\nOn both direct and cross, Nathanâ€™s lack of accurate recall was exposed to the jury.Â  At the PCR hearing, defense counsel explained that he knew Nathanâ€™s story had changed, and that he had planned to address this issue on cross-examination.Â  Therefore, we find that counsel was not deficient in failing to call an expert witness to discredit Nathanâ€™s testimony.Â  See Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 470, 560 S.E.2d 401, 402 (2002) (counsel may avoid a finding of deficiency if he articulates a valid reason for using a certain strategy).[4]\r\nV.Â  Voir Dire\r\nSimpson contends that the PCR court erred in finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the Stateâ€™s use of peremptory challenges against women.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making this contention, Simpson does not argue that the jury was incompetent or impartial.Â  Instead, Simpson argues that counsel was unaware of the then recent decision of J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 143 (1994), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the gender-based exercise of peremptory challenges violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, defense counsel testified that he did not recall considering the possibility of objecting to the Stateâ€™s use of peremptory strikes on the basis that they were gender-based.Â  The PCR court ruled that counselâ€™s failure to challenge the Stateâ€™s strikes on the basis of gender was consistent with objective standards of reasonableness and not prejudicial to the outcome of Simpsonâ€™s trial. Â We agree. \r\nSimpson did not present any evidence that potential jurors were struck simply on the basis of their gender.Â  In addition, Simpson failed to show that he was prejudiced by the jury selected.Â  See Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 517, 511 S.E.2d 62, 68 (1999) (â€œa criminal defendant has no right to a trial by any particular jury, but only a right to a trial by a competent and impartial juryâ€).Â  Therefore, we hold that the PCR court properly denied relief on this basis.Â  \r\nVI.Â  Cumulative-Error Analysis\r\nSimpson contends that the PCR court erred in failing to conduct a cumulative-error analysis.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen counselâ€™s deficiency is so pervasive as to render a particularized prejudice inquiry unnecessary, a defendant may be relieved of his burden to show prejudice.Â  Green v. State, 351 S.C. 184, 196, 569 S.E.2d 318, 324 (2002).Â  Whether several errors, which are independently found not to be prejudicial, may cumulatively warrant relief is an unsettled question in South Caroli na.Â  Id. at 197, 569 S.E.2d at 324-25.\r\nBecause the PCR court found that only one of Simpsonâ€™s allegations had merit, there was no need to conduct a cumulative-error analysis.Â  The record simply did not contain â€œseveral errorsâ€ for the judge to cumulatively assess.Â  We hold, therefore, that the PCR court did not err in failing to conduct such an analysis.\r\nIssues Raised by the State\r\nI.Â  Mitigation Case\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in finding that Simpson was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to offer sufficient social history evidence in the mitigation case.Â  We agree.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that counselâ€™s failure to conduct a reasonable investigation into mitigating circumstances constitutes ineffective assistance.Â  Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 511 (2003).Â  In Wiggins, the Court found that counselâ€™s review of a pre-sentence investigation report and records from the Department of Social Services records did not constitute a reasonable investigation into defendantâ€™s background.Â  Id.Â  A more in-depth investigation would have revealed the defendantâ€™s â€œsevere privation and abuse in the first six years of his life while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother,â€ the â€œphysical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during his subsequent years in foster care,â€ the time he spent homeless, and his diminished mental capacity.Â  Id. at 535.Â  Instead, only one significant mitigating factorâ€”Wigginsâ€™s lack of a criminal historyâ€”was before the jury.Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nSimilarly, this Court has found counsel ineffective for failing to adequately investigate and prepare expert testimony about a defendantâ€™s mental condition.Â  Von Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598, 602 S.E.2d 738 (2004).Â  In Von Dohlen, a psychiatrist testified at trial that the defendant suffered from â€œadjustment reaction disorder,â€ as well as pathological intoxication from the abuse of alcohol and Valium.Â  Id. at 604, 602 S.E.2d at 741.Â  He also testified that the defendant did not have a chronic mental illness and did not dispute the solicitorâ€™s assertion that defendantâ€™s disorder was â€œpretty small potatoes.â€Â  Id.Â  But later, at the PCR hearing, the psychiatrist testified that, had he been provided with additional medical records that existed and were available at trial, he would have diagnosed defendant as suffering from â€œmajor depressive episodes with severe symptoms of anxiety and possible psychotic feature,â€ in addition to alcohol and Valium abuse.Â  Id. at 604-05, 602 S.E.2d at 741.Â  The Court held that â€œ[t]he absence of crucial medical records and related information which existed at the time of [the defendantâ€™s] trial prevented [the psychiatrist] from conveying an accurate diagnosis and explanation of [the defendantâ€™s] mental condition . . . .â€ Id. at 608, 602 S.E.2d 743. \r\nAt trial in the present case, defense counsel called several witnesses, including three experts, to offer mitigating evidence in the sentencing phase.Â  Witnesses testified that Simpsonâ€™s mother used heroin while pregnant with him, Simpson grew up in a drug environment, he had trouble in school, and he experienced several personal tragedies.Â  One expert, a clinical social worker, testified that Simpsonâ€™s mother abused drugs while pregnant with Simpson and after, Simpson was often abandoned as a child, he suffered chronic headaches, and had been exposed to traumatic life events.Â  A second expert, a clinical psychologist, testified that Simpsonâ€™s IQ was at the lower end of the normal range, and that Simpson tested â€œhighly abnormalâ€ on the scales of paranoia, schizophrenia, and mania. Â Finally, a forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Dupree, testified that Simpson suffered from a mental illness known as dysthymic disorder, which is basically chronic depression that lasts over a period of more than two years.Â  Dr. Dupree also testified that Simpson experienced symptoms associated with attention deficit disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, but he could not be diagnosed as having these disorders. Â Â She also noted his history of drug and alcohol abuse.\r\nBut at the PCR hearing, Simpsonâ€™s counsel presented the testimony of two experts, who gave a more detailed explanation of the relationship between Simpsonâ€™s traumatic childhood and the likelihood that he would murder someone.Â  PCR counsel also submitted the affidavit of Dr. Dupree, in which she stated that the opinion she gave at the sentencing hearing was not reliable because she did not know that Simpsonâ€™s mother had used drugs during her pregnancy with Simpson; that Simpson had been sexually abused; that he had witnessed and experienced several acts of violence; and that he had suffered chronic headaches.Â  Based on this â€œnewâ€ information, Dr. Dupree stated she was prepared to testify that neglected and abandoned children are prone to depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders, and other psychiatric illnesses, and that people who are exposed to traumatic events are more likely to suffer from PTSD.Â  \r\nBased on this evidence, the PCR court found that counsel failed to fully investigate Simpsonâ€™s medical, mental, social, and familial history, and because of this, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider mitigating factors warranting a life sentence as opposed to the death penalty.Â  We disagree.\r\nSimpsonâ€™s defense counsel interviewed a number of witnesses about Simpsonâ€™s childhood and life.Â  Counsel also hired a private investigator to go to New York and gather background information on Simpson.Â  Moreover, counsel called several witnesses, including three experts, to offer mitigating evidence.Â  Counsel testified that information gathered about Simpsonâ€™s background was available to the experts.Â  Therefore, we find that the PCR judge erred in finding counsel deficient.Â  \r\nEven if the PCR judge correctly found counsel deficient, Simpson failed to show that he was prejudiced during the mitigation case.Â  The jury was aware of Simpsonâ€™s troubled childhood, traumatic life experiences, and mental condition. Â Any additional investigation would have merely resulted in a â€œfancierâ€ mitigation case, having no effect on the outcome of the trial.Â  See Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 504 S.E.2d 822 (1998) (holding that a â€œfancier mitigation caseâ€ does not render the prior case inadequate).Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore, the PCR court erred in finding that Simpson was prejudiced by deficiencies in the mitigation case.\r\nII.Â  Depositions and Affidavits\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred by considering numerous depositions and affidavits in lieu of live testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt a PCR evidentiary hearing, â€œ[t]he court may receive proof by affidavits, depositions, oral testimony, or other evidence . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (1985).Â  Whether to admit such evidence is within the courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Beckett v. State, 278 S.C. 223, 224, 294 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1982).Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the PCR court allowed Simpson to introduce over forty depositions and some twenty-two affidavits into evidence in lieu of live testimony.Â  We find that this decision was within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion, resulting in no prejudice to the State. Â Most of the relevant witnesses testified at the PCR hearing and were cross-examined by the State.Â  In addition, the court gave the State the opportunity to submit additional testimony and affidavits countering the evidence presented by Simpson.Â  Therefore, we hold that the PCR court did not err.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the PCR courtâ€™s decision declining to grant a new trial as to the conviction of murder.Â  As to the conviction of armed robbery, however, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision declining to grant relief, because we find that the State withheld potentially exculpatory evidence related to the armed robbery charge.Â  Therefore, Simpson is entitled to a new trial on the armed robbery charge.Â  If the State convicts Simpson of armed robbery on retrial, Simpson will also be entitled to a new trial on the penalty phase of the capital murder charge, given that armed robbery served as the sole aggravating circumstance allowing the State to seek the death penalty.[5]Â  \r\nWe also reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision finding that the mitigation case was not fully developed.Â  We find that defense counsel presented a thorough mitigation case on Simpsonâ€™s behalf. Â \r\nFinally, we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s decision to consider certain depositions and affidavits in lieu of live testimony.Â  \r\nTherefore, the PCR courtâ€™s decision is affirmed in part and reversed in part. \r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, J.J., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  The majority holds the Stateâ€™s Brady[6] violation entitles Simpson to a new trial on the armed robbery charge, with capital resentencing contingent on the outcome of that trial.Â  In my opinion, such a limited remedy would violate Simpsonâ€™s constitutional rights.\r\nIn finding a Brady violation, we have necessarily found the nondisclosed evidence was material.Â  In determining materiality for Brady purposes,\r\n\r\n  The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\r\n\r\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995).\r\nI would hold that when, as here, the Brady violation in the guilt phase of a capital trial relates to the aggravating circumstances relied upon by the State in the penalty phase, [7] fundamental fairness requires a new trial.\r\nI am also concerned that to deny Simpson a new sentencing proceeding under these circumstances would violate his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.Â  In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), the United States Supreme Court held that this right entitles the capital defendant to â€œa jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in [his] maximum punishment.â€Â  Id. at 589. Â Â The original jury which sentenced Simpson to death was deprived, by the Stateâ€™s unconstitutional act, of hearing all of the evidence relevant to the aggravating factors.Â  To deny Simpson the right to have his sentence determined by a jury which has heard all the facts, including those which exculpate him, would violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.Â  Ring v. Arizona, supra; cf.Â  State v. Riddle, 301 S.C. 68, 389 S.E.2d 665 (1990) (capital resentencing reversed where state permitted to prove statutory aggravators merely by introducing defendantâ€™s convictions for burglary and armed robbery from the first trial; these convictions were in no way binding on resentencing jury, which had to determine appropriate penalty from the evidence presented to it).\r\nI therefore concur in the majorityâ€™s determination that the State committed a Brady violation, but dissent from its holding that the error may be remedied by a retrial on the armed robbery charge alone with a contingent new sentencing proceeding.Â  In any case, as explained below, I would hold that counsel were ineffective in failing to present expert testimony to impeach Nathanâ€™s credibility, and to dispute the Stateâ€™s forensic evidence. [8] \r\nAt trial, Nathan acknowledged that â€˜someoneâ€™ had told him what to say, and agreed on cross-examination that the solicitorâ€™s office had â€œhelpedâ€ him remember.Â  At the PCR hearing, Simpson presented expert testimony that Nathanâ€™s low I.Q.[9] and learning disability[10] made him especially susceptible to suggestions about past events, a situation compounded by his young age (nine at the time of the events).Â  Simpsonâ€™s expert pointed to specific parts of Nathanâ€™s testimony that were consistent with false memories.Â  One of Simpsonâ€™s trial attorneys admitted that while they were aware of the changes in Nathanâ€™s testimony, they felt they could deal with it through cross-examination.Â  Simpsonâ€™s lead counsel echoed this sentiment.Â  Trial counsel did not consult with a memory expert.\r\nThe PCR judge found that the attorneys were fully aware before trial of Nathanâ€™s belated recollection of having seen Simpson with cash in hand, and was not ineffective in relying only on cross-examination to call Nathanâ€™s credibility into question.Â  The majority upholds this ruling.Â  I would reverse.\r\nA PCR applicant claiming trial counsel was ineffective must establish both that counselâ€™s performance was deficient, that is, that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case, that is, but for counselâ€™s deficient performance there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Williams v. State, 363 S.C. 341, 611 S.E.2d 232 (2005); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  On certiorari, this Court will uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s findings if they are supported by any probative evidence in the record.Â  Williams, supra.\r\nThe PCR judge found counsel was not ineffective in relying solely on cross-examination to impeach Nathanâ€™s credibility.Â  In support of this finding, the PCR judge referred to a jurorâ€™s affidavit which stated:\r\n\r\n  I was concerned about the testimony of the little boy who was in the store.Â  I suspected that he might have some memory problems because I was not sure that I could rely on the boyâ€™s testimony about Mr. Simpson taking money out of the register and although I signed the verdict form in the end, I was never certain the [sic] Mr. Simpson really committed armed robbery.\r\n\r\n The majority affirms the PCR judgeâ€™s denial of relief to Simpson on this ground, finding the decision to rely on cross-examination of Nathan was â€œa valid trial strategy.â€Â  I disagree.Â  Counsel were well aware of the weakness of the Stateâ€™s armed robbery case, and the letter sent shortly before trial alerted them that Nathan â€˜mayâ€™ have suddenly remembered a crucial fact.Â  Without exploring the issue of Nathanâ€™s background, trial counsel were not in a position to make a strategic decision.Â  Had counsel conducted even a cursory review of Nathanâ€™s school records, they would have been aware of his low I.Q. and learning disability.Â  Surely knowledge of these facts, combined with Nathanâ€™s critical new recollection, would have sufficient to put trial counsel on notice that Nathanâ€™s memory was suspect.Â  In my opinion, counsel were deficient in failing to pursue the credibility of Nathanâ€™s recalled memory and in relying on cross-examination of a child witness/victim upon whose testimony the armed robbery case largely turned.\r\nAs Simpson demonstrated at the PCR hearing, expert testimony would have allowed the jury to understand the special vulnerability of Nathan to suggestions regarding the crucial events.Â  In my opinion, Simpson produced evidence not only of deficient performance in counselsâ€™ reliance solely on cross-examination to impeach Nathanâ€™s testimony, but also of prejudice.Â  One juror admitted she â€œsuspected that [Nathan] might have some memory problems.â€Â  While the PCR judge viewed this statement as evidence of counselâ€™s adequate cross-examination performance, I find it is evidence of prejudice.Â  In my opinion, there is a reasonable probability that expert testimony would have confirmed this jurorâ€™s â€œsuspicionâ€ and resulted in Simpsonâ€™s acquittal of armed robbery.Â  A finding of â€˜not guiltyâ€™ on the armed robbery charge would have negated both aggravators relied upon by the State.Â  \r\nFurther, as explained below, if the jury were to find Nathanâ€™s story less credible, then the credibility of Simpsonâ€™s explanation of the events is enhanced.Â  A jury finding Simpsonâ€™s story credible might return a manslaughter verdict.[11]\r\nSimpson testified that he had decided to withdraw from the planned armed robbery, and that the first shots were fired as he and Harrison struggled over the gun.Â  Simpson explained that he shot at Harrison as Harrison moved rapidly away from the cash register, presumably to use the phone to summon help, only in an attempt to disable him.Â  In contrast, the State theorized that there was no struggle and no shots fired during such, and that Harrison was shot in the back while prostrate on the ground.Â  The State presented testimony from a pathologist that Harrisonâ€™s hand wound was â€˜distant,â€™ and that Harrison had been lying on the ground when he was shot twice in the back.[12]\r\nAt trial, counsel relied solely on Simpsonâ€™s testimony and counselâ€™s own â€œreenactmentâ€ during closing argument to support Simpsonâ€™s version of events.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, Simpson presented three forensic experts.Â  All disputed the Stateâ€™s expertâ€™s trial testimony, and opined that the evidence was consistent with the first shots having been fired during a struggle.Â  They testified that Harrisonâ€™s hand wound was not distant, and that the other wounds indicated Harrison was shot while standing, not while prostrate as the pathologist had testified at trial.\r\nThe PCR judge agreed that Simpsonâ€™s PCR experts supported Simpsonâ€™s story, but held their evidence was merely cumulative to trial counselâ€™s reenactment in closing argument.Â  I disagree. \r\nCounselâ€™s closing argument is not evidence.Â  E.g., State v. Charping, 333 S.C. 124, S.E.2d 851 (1998).Â  I would hold, therefore, that there is no evidence in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s holding that trial counsel were not deficient in failing to present forensic evidence to support Simpsonâ€™s version of events.\r\nThe PCR judge held that, in any case, Simpson could not establish prejudice in that there was no reasonable probability that the forensic evidence would have changed the result since the jury could still have returned a murder verdict even if a struggle preceded the upright shooting of Harrison.Â  I disagree.Â  Had the jury heard the expert evidence concerning false memories and found that no money was taken, and had it heard forensic evidence that supported Simpsonâ€™s story of a struggle followed by the shooting of Harrison while he was running away, the jury may have found Simpsonâ€™s story credible and returned a manslaughter verdict.Â  While it is true Simpson entered the store intending to rob it, he claimed to have changed his mind once there.Â  Further, Simpsonâ€™s testimony indicated that Harrison lunged for the gun after seeing it in Simpsonâ€™s waistband, which is one explanation â€œhow and why the gun was initially pulled from Simpsonâ€™s waistband.â€Â  Finally, Simpson acknowledges shooting Harrison twice after the struggle ended, but claimed it was in a panicked attempt to stop Harrison from getting help.Â  In my opinion, Simpson demonstrated both deficient performance and prejudice stemming from trial counselsâ€™ decision not to present expert testimony supporting Simpsonâ€™s version of events.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Stateâ€™s Brady violation denied Simpson a fair trial.Â  Kyles v. Whitley, supra.Â  Further, Simpson demonstrated both deficient performance on the part of his trial attorneys and resulting prejudice from their failure to pursue and present expert testimony.Â  I would reverse Simpsonâ€™s murder and armed robbery convictions and sentences, and remand for a new trial. [13]\r\n\r\n[1] It is these facts, which remained uncontested in the PCR hearing, that compel our finding that counsel was not deficient.Â  Although there is no doubt that some particulars of the crime are in dispute, there can be no doubt about Simpsonâ€™s malicious conduct which amounted to gunning down a wounded crime victim and attempting to execute the witnesses.Â  We further find that Simpson was erroneously given a voluntary manslaughter charge at trial.Â  Given Simpsonâ€™s admission to firing on Harrison multiple times after the alleged struggle, under no circumstance could we conclude that Simpson acted without malice or had sufficient legal provocation to use deadly force.\r\n[2] In a PCR proceeding, Simpson may not simply posit suppositions and speculations in an attempt to establish that counsel was ineffective.Â  Judicial scrutiny of counselâ€™s performance is highly deferential and the court must â€œindulge a strong presumption that counselâ€™s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . . .â€Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 445, 334 S.E.2d 813, 816 (1985) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668).Â  Though hindsight may provide a different view of counselâ€™s actions, Simpson is not entitled to a new trial for the sole purpose of presenting a â€œfancierâ€ case.Â  Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 339, 504 S.E.2d 822, 827 (1998).\r\n[3] There was also a memo to the file written by one of the solicitors identifying possible weaknesses in the case, including the fact that â€œno robbery (larceny) occurredâ€ and â€œ[t]here was nothing taken from the store . . . only an attempted robbery occurred.â€Â  But the PCR court did not consider whether the Stateâ€™s failure to disclose this memo constituted a Brady violation nor did PCR counsel raise the issue in the Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend.Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for review. See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).\r\n[4] The dissent finds that counsel was deficient in failing to consult and present an expert discrediting Nathanâ€™s testimony.Â  Again, this conclusion is somewhat confounding given that the PCR courtâ€™s decisions are reviewed under the â€œany evidenceâ€ standard and there appears to be ample evidence supporting the PCR courtâ€™s finding.Â  Second, assuming that counsel was deficient, the dissent presents two statements made by jurors citing their doubts as to the credibility of Nathanâ€™s testimony.Â  While the dissent finds this is evidence of prejudice, we see this as evidence of a lack of prejudice.Â  The jury in this case returned a unanimous conviction on the armed robbery charge; therefore, it is completely reasonable to assume that any jurors having doubts about Nathanâ€™s testimony relied on other evidence in finding Simpson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  We further note that Nathanâ€™s testimony was only relevant to the charge of armed robbery, and Nathan will inevitably have to testify again since we are reversing the armed robbery conviction under Brady.Â  Nathanâ€™s testimony was not at all relevant to, and had no impact on, Simpsonâ€™s murder conviction.\r\n[5] We fail to see how, as the dissent suggests, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), in any way suggests that this form of relief is improper.Â  Ring and its companion cases stand simply for the proposition that a sentence may not be enhanced by considering facts that have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Id. at 602, 609.Â  In no way can these cases be read to provide that the remedy we grant here is constitutionally deficient.Â  \r\nWe are equally unpersuaded that the case of Oregon v. Guzek, 336 Or. 424, 86 P.3d 1106 (Or. 2004) (scheduled for argument before the United States Supreme Court December 7, 2005), is at all relevant in this matter.Â  Guzek deals with the limitations and requirements for mitigation evidence as provided by the due process clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  If Simpson were found guilty of armed robbery on re-trial, it is likely that any â€œresidual doubtâ€ about Simpsonâ€™s guilt would simply be a collateral attack on the validity of his conviction.Â  Under current Supreme Court jurisprudence, the Eighth Amendment â€œin no way mandates reconsideration by capital juries, in the sentencing phase, of their â€˜residual doubtsâ€™ over a defendantâ€™s guilt . . . [s]uch lingering doubts are not over any aspect of petitionerâ€™s â€˜character,â€™ â€˜record,â€™ or â€˜circumstance of the offense.â€™â€Â  Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U.S. 164, 74, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 2327 (1988).Â  Until the Supreme Court directs otherwise, we will continue to apply what appears to be well-reasoned and well-settled precedent.\r\n[6] Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n[7] Murder during the commission of armed robbery, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(c)(a)(1)(d) (2003) and murder for the purpose of receiving money or any thing of value.Â  Â§ 16-3-20(c)(a)(4) (2003).\r\n[8] I would also find that trial counsel were deficient in failing to be aware of J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994), which was decided five months before the capital trial. See Hill v. State, 350 S.C. 465, 567 S.E.2d 847 (2002) (trial counsel rendered deficient performance in failing to be aware of three month old decision).Â  I agree, however, that Simpson failed to demonstrate the requisite prejudice stemming from this deficient performance and thus did not meet his burden of proving this allegation ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  See Williams v. State, 363 S.C. 341, 611 S.E.2d 232 (2005).\r\n[9] Nathanâ€™s full scale I.Q. was 71 while his performance I.Q. was 69, placing him in the lowest 3% of children in the United States.\r\n[10] His learning disability included an inability to recall the details of a story while grasping the main theme.Â  \r\n[11] The trial judge charged the jury on voluntary manslaughter based on Simpsonâ€™s testimony.\r\n[12] I note this theory is in part contradicted by the store employeeâ€™s testimony that he saw Simpson shoot Harrison as Harrison walked rapidly towards the store phone.\r\n[13] Even if the new jury were to convict Simpson of murder and armed robbery, it is conceivable that Simpson would be entitled to argue and/or have his sentencing jury charged on residual doubt.Â  The United States Supreme Court has on its docket for December 7, 2005, Oregon v. Guzek, No. 04-928.Â  The issue in Guzek is:\r\n\r\n  Does a capital defendant have a right under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to offer evidence and argument in support of a residual-doubt claim - that is, that the jury in a penalty-phase proceeding should consider doubt about the defendantâ€™s guilt in deciding whether to impose the death penalty?\r\n\r\nEven without a Guzek argument or charge, it is entirely possible that a weaker guilt case would result in a life sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26115","title":"Hughes v.

Zelenka, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We are asked to decide whether Mar-Reece Aldean Hughes (Petitioner), who has been sentenced to die for the murder of a police officer, is mentally competent to waive his statutory right to pursue post-conviction relief (PCR) and be executed forthwith.Â  We conclude Petitioner is not mentally competent at this time to waive his right to pursue PCR.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder, armed robbery, criminal conspiracy, possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and possession of a stolen vehicle at a trial in York County in September 1995.Â  The jury found as an aggravating circumstance that the victim was a local law enforcement officer performing his official duties.Â  Petitioner was sentenced to death.Â  This Court affirmed the convictions and sentence.Â  State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999), cert denied, Hughes v. South Carolina, 529 U.S. 1025 (2000). \r\nThe convictions arose from the fatal shooting of police officer Brent McCants on September 25, 1992.Â  Petitioner and Eric Forney, armed with a gun, accosted two college students in the parking lot of a restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina, and stole their car.Â  The two men then drove to Rock Hill where Officer McCants stopped them for driving without headlights. Â McCants was shot several times and his police-issue walkie-talkie was taken from his belt as he lay on the side of the road. Â Petitioner and Forney were apprehended shortly thereafter.Â  Hughes, 336 S.C. at 589, 521 S.E.2d at 502.\r\nThe State sought the death penalty against both Petitioner and Forney. Â They were tried separately. Â At his trial, Forney claimed Petitioner was the triggerman. Â Forney was convicted of murder, criminal conspiracy, and armed robbery and was acquitted of possession of a pistol during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Forney was sentenced to life imprisonment after the jury failed to return a unanimous verdict in the sentencing phase, and the convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal.Â  State v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996).Â  At Petitionerâ€™s trial, Petitioner admitted he participated in the armed robbery of the vehicle and that he was driving at the time McCants stopped them, but claimed Forney shot McCants from the passenger seat and stole the officerâ€™s walkie-talkie.\r\nOn May 11, 2000, we remanded Petitionerâ€™s case to the circuit court for a competency hearing after Petitioner wrote the Attorney General requesting to waive further proceedings and be executed.Â  Petitioner changed his mind before a competency hearing was held and filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) application on September 21, 2000.Â  Less than a week later, Petitioner filed a pro se motion requesting counsel be relieved and he be executed.\r\nAfter a court-ordered evaluation but before a competency hearing, Petitioner again changed his mind and decided to pursue PCR.Â  A competency hearing began on February 25, 2002, but was continued because Petitioner had been forcibly medicated in violation of a court order.Â  Petitioner indicated to counsel during a recess in the hearing that he wished to waive his right to PCR and be executed.Â  Petitionerâ€™s mental status was re-evaluated and a competency hearing was held in April 2002.\r\nJudge Paul E. Short, Jr. on September 18, 2002, ruled Petitioner was competent to waive his right to counsel and PCR and competent to be executed.Â  An appeal of that ruling was pending before us when, acting sua sponte on March 7, 2003, we ordered Petitionerâ€™s appeal be held in abeyance pending a decision in Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782 (2004).Â  We subsequently held in Council that a mentally incompetent PCR applicant is not entitled to a stay of proceedings pending a determination of his competency to proceed.Â  Instead, a mentally incompetent applicant and his counsel are required to pursue PCR on issues which do not require the applicantâ€™s assistance.Â  The applicant will have an opportunity to raise fact-based issues requiring his assistance at a later PCR proceeding if he regains competence.Â  Id. at 125-30, 597 S.E.2d at 785-87.\r\nOn June 25, 2004, we remanded the case to circuit court for another hearing on whether Petitioner is presently competent to waive his right to pursue PCR and whether that decision is knowing and voluntary pursuant to the standard established in Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993).\r\nA competency hearing was held on September 15, 2004, before Judge Paul M. Burch following two court-ordered evaluations.Â  Judge Burch on September 24, 2004, ruled Petitioner is presently competent under the Singleton standard to waive his right to PCR and his decision was knowing and voluntary. Â \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in ruling that Petitioner is mentally competent to waive his right to pursue PCR with counselâ€™s assistance and that his decision to do so was knowing and voluntary?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis Court is charged with the responsibility of issuing a notice authorizing the execution of a person who has been duly convicted in a court of law and sentenced to death.Â  The Court will issue an execution notice after that person either has exhausted all appeals and other avenues of post-conviction relief in state and federal courts, or after that person, who is determined by this Court to be mentally competent, knowingly and voluntarily waives such appeals.Â  See In re Stays of Execution in Capital Cases, 321 S.C. 544, 471 S.E.2d 140 (1996); Roberts v. Moore, 332 S.C. 488, 505 S.E.2d 593 (1998); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-370 (2003) and Â§ 16-3-25 (2003).Â  When considering a request by an appellant who has been sentenced to death to waive the right to appeal or pursue PCR, and to be executed forthwith, it has been our practice to remand the matter to circuit court for a hearing and ruling on whether the appellant is mentally competent to make such a waiver, and whether any waiver of appellate or PCR rights is knowing and voluntary.Â  We remand such a matter when we deem it necessary to further develop or explore the facts of a case.Â  Following that competency hearing, the parties are required by this Court to file briefs and an appendix containing the testimony and evidence considered by the circuit court.Â  The appellant is required, when directed by the Court, to appear at oral argument and personally respond to questions regarding the waiver of his appellate or PCR rights.Â  See State v. Passaro, 350 S.C. 499, 567 S.E.2d 862 (2002); State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (1994) (Torrence II); Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993).\r\nThis procedure is necessary and appropriate because it provides the parties an opportunity to fully explore the issues and develop a record for our review.Â  We are not bound by the circuit courtâ€™s findings or rulings, although we recognize the circuit court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cf. Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981).Â  This matter is similar to one arising in our original jurisdiction because it is this Court which must finally determine whether a particular appellant is mentally competent to make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his appellate or PCR rights.Â  Passaro, 350 S.C. at 506, 567 S.E.2d at 866 (â€œImportantly, this Court is the final body to decide whether to grant [an appellantâ€™s] waiver.â€); State v. Torrence, 322 S.C. 475, 477 n.2, 473 S.E.2d 703, 705 n.2 (1996) (Torrence III) (no appeal lies from the remand of case for fact finding on the issue of competency; such a case is similar to one arising in the Courtâ€™s general jurisdiction in which the Court may provide for fact finding as necessary). \r\nIn deciding the issue of an appellantâ€™s competency, we carefully and thoroughly review the appellantâ€™s history of mental competency; the existence and present status of mental illness or disease suffered by the appellant, if any, as shown in the record of previous proceedings and in the competency hearing; the testimony and opinions of mental health experts who have examined the appellant; the findings of the circuit court which conducted a competency hearing; the arguments of counsel; and the appellantâ€™s demeanor and personal responses to our questions at oral argument regarding the waiver of appellate and PCR rights.Â  See Passaro, 350 S.C. at 504-08, 567 S.E.2d at 865-67 (reviewing evidence presented at competency hearing, including testimony of mental health experts, as well as appellantâ€™s responses to Courtâ€™s extensive questioning of him at oral argument, in concluding he was mentally competent to waive right to direct appeal and be executed); Torrence III, 322 S.C. 475, 473 S.E.2d 703 (after reviewing the record of a competency hearing in circuit court which included testimony from mental health experts and the record of the Courtâ€™s prior questioning of appellant, Court concluded the record â€œoverwhelmingly supports a determination that [appellant] is indeed competentâ€ to knowingly and voluntarily waive his appellate rights and be executed); Torrence II, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (where appellant wished to waive right to direct appeal, Court remanded case for circuit court to conduct a competency hearing â€œallowing the introduction of testimony, exhibits, and evidence, to provide a full record for this Courtâ€™s evaluationâ€; Court questioned appellant personally about the waiver of his appellate rights and instructed circuit court to do the same); Singleton, 313 S.C. at 84, 437 S.E.2d at 58 (after reviewing record of competency hearing in circuit court which revealed, inter alia, the appellant was completely unaware he would die in an electric chair and was able to give only yes-no answers to questions, Court concluded â€œ[t]he record contains a wealth of evidence which supports the PCR judgeâ€™s finding of incompetenceâ€ and thus appellant could not be executed).Â  We necessarily decide each case on an individual basis, and it is within our discretion whether to allow an appellant to waive his appellate or PCR rights.Â  Passaro, 350 S.C. at 506, 567 S.E.2d at 866.\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  MENTAL COMPETENCY\r\nPetitioner[1] contends the circuit court erred in ruling that he was mentally competent to waive his right to pursue PCR with counselâ€™s assistance and that his waiver was knowing and voluntary.Â  Petitioner argues his history of mental health problems, past and present evaluations by mental health professionals, and evidence at the most recent competency hearing support exactly the opposite conclusion - that he is not mentally competent to make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to pursue PCR.Â  We agree.\r\nThe standard for determining whether an appellant or PCR applicant is mentally competent to waive the right to a direct appeal or PCR is set forth in Singleton, 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53:\r\n\r\n  The first prong is the cognitive prong which can be defined as:Â  whether a convicted defendant can understand the nature of the proceedings, what he or she was tried for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the punishment.Â  The second prong is the assistance prong which can be defined as:Â  whether the convicted defendant possesses sufficient capacity or ability to rationally communicate with counsel. \r\n\r\nId. at 83, 437 S.E.2d at 58; accord Torrence II, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883.Â  This standard of competency is the same standard required before a convicted defendant may be executed.Â  Torrence II, 317 S.C. at 47, 451 S.E.2d at 884. Â The failure of either prong is sufficient to warrant a stay of execution and a denial of the convicted defendantâ€™s motion to waive his right to appeal or pursue PCR.Â  Singleton, 313 S.C. at 83, 437 S.E.2d at 58.\r\nThe record sets forth Petitionerâ€™s mental health history from his arrest in 1992 until a competency hearing in 2002, as well as his pretrial murder of a cellmate by stabbing him to death during a psychotic episode in which he was deemed legally insane.Â  The record shows Petitioner exhibited signs of schizophrenia since at least the murder of Officer McCants in 1992, and perhaps a few years earlier.Â  He was first formally diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1994.Â  Petitioner has experienced serious mental health problems for years, with sporadic treatment by medication and limited success in resolving them.\r\nPetitioner was deemed legally competent to stand trial in 1994 by one examiner, then deemed incompetent by that same examiner and two others a short while later.Â  He was ruled legally competent by the court to stand trial in 1995 while being forcibly medicated, but stopped voluntarily taking his medications after he was sentenced to death.[2]Â  Examiners disagreed on whether Petitioner was competent in 2000, but court-appointed examiners found him to be incompetent to waive PCR in 2001.Â  A continued hearing resulted in further disagreement over Petitionerâ€™s competence among mental health practitioners, but a finding of competence by the circuit court in 2002.\r\nPetitioner stated he wished to waive PCR in 2000, then changed his mind and filed a PCR application.Â  He again tried to waive PCR later in 2000, but again changed his mind and decided to pursue PCR in 2001.Â  He expressed his wish for PCR at a hearing in 2002, then changed his mind and indicated a renewed desire to waive it.\r\nAt the most recent competency hearing in September 2004, held upon order of this Court, the circuit court considered the transcript of two commitment hearings before the probate court in 2003, the testimony and reports of several psychiatrists who examined Petitioner, and the testimony of Petitioner.\r\nAt the first probate court hearing in January 2003, the probate judge ordered the South Carolina Department of Corrections (DOC) to treat Petitioner at DOCâ€™s Gilliam Psychiatric Hospital instead of housing him at a maximum security prison.Â  The probate court adhered to a previous order by the circuit court to forcibly medicate Petitioner only when deemed necessary on an emergency basis by DOC doctors and approved by Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, a private psychiatrist who has treated Petitioner for several years.Â  Schwartz-Watts and Dr. Richard Ellison, a DOC psychiatrist, testified Petitioner suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.Â  Petitioner has â€œbizarre thoughts about life and the afterlife,â€ hallucinations, and delusions.Â  Petitioner repeatedly flushed his clothes down the toilet and stood naked in his cell, smeared feces on the walls and himself, and postured bizarrely in his cell like a bodybuilder.\r\nA Gilliam hospital social worker testified Petitioner was delusional.Â  Petitioner stated he had exploded bombs in several rooms, he could tell time by using his pulse, and he planned to be released from prison before Christmas and go to the bus station. \r\nThe record is replete with evidence of the love-hate relationship Petitioner has with his appellate attorney, Teresa Norris.Â  For example, Petitioner at this probate court hearing offered a rambling, hateful, profanity-laced diatribe against Norris, his doctors, and the courts.Â  Petitioner accused Norris of representing him only to advance her career and said he has tried to fire her.Â  Petitioner repeatedly denied he was incompetent and said Norrisâ€™s only goal is to have him declared incompetent to prevent his execution.\r\nAt the second probate court hearing in May 2003, the psychiatristsâ€™ testimony and result was much the same, with the probate court ordering Petitioner to be transferred again to Gilliam Psychiatric Hospital for treatment.Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified Petitioner was schizophrenic and severely mentally ill.Â  The doctor and a DOC social worker testified Petitioner had stopped eating or bathing, refused medications, torn up several jumpsuits, stayed in a fetal position under his cot, and was generally unable to care for himself.Â  While normally not violent, Petitioner can become extremely agitated and combative.Â  Before the judge entered the courtroom at this hearing, Petitioner picked up the table while in handcuffs and had to be restrained by several officers.Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified Petitioner was trapped in an ever-deteriorating cycle of mental illness, taking medication and improving slightly, then going off medication and getting progressively worse.Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified that\r\n\r\n  [h]e needs medication, but to get him well enough to even know what he would want when heâ€™s well, what kinds of medication he would need to be maintained on, weâ€™ve never gotten to that point.Â  I have never been to the point with [Petitioner] that I have been able to sit down and rationally understand what he wants because heâ€™s never been well long enough to be able to do that.Â  Heâ€™s so ambivalent, which is a symptom of schizophrenia.Â  One week he wants to die.Â  The next week he would want to go on with his legal proceedings. \r\n\r\nAt the competency hearing in September 2004, Drs. Jeffrey Musick, Pamela Crawford, and Margaret Melikian, psychiatrists employed by the South Carolina Department of Mental Health (DMH), all testified Petitioner was not competent under the Singleton standard.[3]Â  The three psychiatrists diagnosed Petitioner as suffering from undifferentiated schizophrenia, which is believed to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.Â  The characteristic symptoms of this major mental illness are delusions, hallucinations, disorganization of speech and thoughts, and disorganization of behavior.\r\nIn applying the Singleton analysis, the three psychiatrists testified Petitioner understands factually that he was tried for the murder of a police officer.Â  Petitioner seemed to understand the reason for the punishment, i.e., that he murdered someone, although he also asserted racial bias and the Stateâ€™s wish to dissect his superior physical body as reasons for his punishment. \r\nThe three psychiatrists testified Petitioner does not understand the nature of a PCR proceeding or the nature of the punishment.Â  In perhaps the most significant and serious deficiency, they concluded Petitioner does not possess sufficient capacity or ability to rationally communicate with his lawyer. \r\nThe three psychiatrists testified Petitioner does not believe he is mentally ill, but sane and rational.Â  However, their examinations revealed he is actively psychotic, suffering from visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions, and an inability to engage in organized speech or thought.Â  His conversations usually are incoherent, with occasional, seemingly rational comments dominated by unintelligible, wildly divergent, and irrelevant dialogue peppered with made-up words and references to non-existent places.Â  The psychiatrists offered the following examples of delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech, thoughts, and behavior by Petitioner:\r\n\r\n  Petitioner discussed something he called â€œhesitancy,â€ then in an incoherent monologue in which he moved to different topics in rapid succession, he discussed movies; Gandhi; â€œTel-Avery,â€ which he said was the worldâ€™s largest city; the equinox; the Tropic of Cancer; Venus Solaris; the synthetic god; the human god; the flesh god; and the cloth god. \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner described himself as a world-class athlete who once could run 300 miles a week.Â  One reason the State wants to put him to death is to dissect his body to discover the reason for his athletic prowess.\r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said he has an intelligence quotient, or IQ, of 172; he also stated this fact to the judge at the 2004 competency hearing.[4]\r\n  \r\n  Petitioner refused to discuss what happens in a PCR proceeding, saying only that he had waived it and had no further comment.Â  He did, however, assert that the number of hours in his day, of which there are thirty-six or thirty-eight, will affect the PCR proceeding.Â  Other peopleâ€™s days contain only twelve hours. Â Â \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said there is no afterlife, but then said he would be transformed into an â€œeternal force.â€ \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said some people prepare for death by taking flu shots, although he is not one of them.\r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said medications are administered by white people to black people, particularly young black males, in order to control or incapacitate them.\r\n  \r\n  Petitioner has episodes in which he tears up his clothes and blankets, smears feces on the walls of his cell in patterns, bangs on his door, jumps on his bed, refuses to eat, speak, or bathe, and believes the staff is poisoning his food.\r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said the FBI runs a concentration camp at the prison.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said he passes through time zones.Â  He often is Â fixated on numbers and the â€œhundreds of millionsâ€ of suns whose sunbeams awake unsuspecting women.Â  He believes â€œforcesâ€ enter and depart from his prison cell.Â  The forces awarded him â€œblack diamondsâ€ in his eyes, but took those away because he did not deserve them.Â  The forces instead gave him â€œblue ringsâ€ in his eyes, which he insisted on asking psychiatrists to examine by leaning forward and asking, â€œCan you see them?â€Â  The forces were responsible for removing a building from the prison grounds.Â  The forces have offered him 100 million years of life, but he turned them down in a respectful manner. \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said he wrote to former Secretary of State Madeline Albright at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because he must communicate through her in order to convince the Supreme Court he is competent. \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner stated that a major participant in a PCR proceeding is the â€œnotary republic,â€ which he defined as a â€œvalidated clerk that goes state to state and fills different positions.â€Â  A new â€œnotary republicâ€ must be chosen to serve in his case because the licenses of all â€œnotary republicsâ€ around the world will expire this year.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said death means death, but seconds later asserted he has been granted five million years of life.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said Judge Short told him that his mother was a whore during the first competency hearing in 2002.\r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said he is being punished because he owns the state of South Carolina and the State wants to confiscate his wealth.Â  He further asserted he made $56 million the previous week.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Petitioner said he is a god and described jousting with other gods. \r\n\r\nPetitionerâ€™s testimony at the hearing is informative only because it reinforces the psychiatristsâ€™ diagnoses and opinions.Â  Petitioner left the courtroom as the hearing began, upset that his usual guardian was not present and railing against â€œcrackersâ€ who are bent on medicating him against his will.Â  He later returned. \r\nNeither the Stateâ€™s attorney nor Judge Burch was able to elicit coherent or rational responses from Petitioner, including repeated questions about the nature of a PCR proceeding.Â  Petitioner brushed aside questions and, in profanity-laced statements, asserted he was a â€œsane, rational individualâ€ who â€œyou white folks always want to medicate me on drugs down here.â€Â  He told examiners â€œI am no donor and wish to be electrocuted,â€ â€œyou donâ€™t like the fact that Iâ€™m no donor.Â  I ainâ€™t going to be no donor.â€[5]Â  He stated he wanted to be executed by electrocution, complained that he had done his â€œlegal four hours in chains,â€ and repeatedly asked to be taken back to his cell.\r\nAt his appearance before this Court, Petitioner answered most of our questions calmly and politely.Â  Attorneys involved with his case for several years stated they were surprised by Petitionerâ€™s restrained demeanor. Â Petitioner chose not to remain in the courtroom to hear the attorneysâ€™ oral arguments, but was returned to Gilliam Psychiatric Hospital, where he has been incarcerated for 2Â½ years.Â  \r\nPetitioner testified he is not mentally ill, but merely withdrawn or voluntarily silent because he has been isolated in a cell by himself for years.Â  He expressed his wish to die by electrocution and testified that death means the brain and other bodily organs cease to function.Â  Respondent testified he occasionally takes â€œGeodorn,â€ which he described as a mild sedative which helps him sleep, but he has not taken it in about week.[6]\r\nPetitioner often responded with yes-no answers when asked about theÂ  nature of various rights he would be waiving and the consequences of his waiver.Â  When asked to elaborate on an answer in his own words, Petitionerâ€™s responses revealed a distinct lack of understanding of the PCR process, substantial confusion about his appellate rights, and disorganized thought patterns.Â  The following exchanges during the questioning of Petitioner by Chief Justice Toal are instructive:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  Do you understand what a post conviction relief Â proceeding is?\r\n  A:Â  Yes, I do.\r\n  Q:Â  Do you understand what happens in a post conviction\r\n  Â relief proceeding?\r\n  A:Â  Yes.Â  Yes, I do.\r\n  Q:Â  Has your attorney explained to you what happens in a post conviction relief proceeding?\r\n  A:Â  She has several times.\r\n  Q:Â  And do you understand what your attorney has told you\r\n  Â about that?\r\n  A:Â  I pretty much have taken it in.Â  I pretty much have\r\n  Â taken it in.\r\n  Q:Â  Tell me in your own words, Mr. Hughes, what happens\r\n  Â in a post conviction relief proceeding.\r\n  A:Â  That means that I can take up the terms and the amendments thatâ€™s being held before me to take and perceive the law, as in perceivance.\r\n  . . .\r\n  Q:Â  All right, sir.Â  Do you realize that by waiving your Â right to post conviction relief, you may be jeopardizing Â any habeas corpus relief that would be available to you in Â a federal court?\r\n  A:Â  Well, Iâ€™m not jeopardizing the habeas corpus law because the Mecklenburg County Jail, when they took and gave me ten years for grand theft auto larceny, they took and convened the court then.Â  They took and changed the jurisdiction, so thatâ€™s under habeas corpus law.Â  Theyâ€™ve already taken and did that, so Iâ€™m not under habeas corpus law.\r\n  The state of North Carolina willingly did take in and get with the legal system down here in that matter of conveyance.\r\n  . . .\r\n  Q:Â  Now, do you believe you received a fair trial, Mr. Hughes?\r\n  A:Â  Well, itâ€™s not to my belief in the law or the legal system.Â  As far as to merit, when I took and did my first summary, when I did my procumfactories (phonetic) all the way down to the final summary, in point factory - the case in factory, the court didnâ€™t have any evidence against me.Â  When the court didnâ€™t have any evidence against me, they showed me what their attitude was all about.\r\n  Q:Â  All right, sir.\r\n  A:Â  The court showed me, first of all, that on its legal terms, that they did not respect my ability to think.Â  When I took and did my summary, it wasnâ€™t that they took in a sorry day of intelligence, itâ€™s just the fact that they didnâ€™t have any case against me.\r\n  As I have stated over the years and stuff, being that Iâ€™m a person of my own degree, that means Iâ€™m a person of my own understanding, itâ€™s not that I have a problem with my conscience because my conscience does not deal with me - deal with me pertaining to this case.\r\n   I said when I had went into the courtroom, the court, first of all, made like it was an understanding as far as to what was presented on the record, and what was presented on the record, they could not have found me guilty.\r\n  Again as I stated, over the years since I have been incarcerated, I said that to myself, if they did come up, well, the cases in fact raise or misses in point they had to convict me to have a life sentence, I still would have to have did (sic) about 30 or 40 years.\r\n  If it had been a migrating (sic) circumstance, it still would have been the points that might have happened inside of this state, but as far as dealing with other peopleâ€™s backgrounds, other peopleâ€™s attitudes, like I said, I have always been a person who did solitary time.Â  I was being in segregated law.\r\n  As far as for incarcerated time, Iâ€™ll always be in segregation, other than the fact that when I had took (sic) and went to North Carolina, they have - you know, being incarcerated, segregated, as I said, they did not take and value what I put down on paper.Â  On those conditions there, I told judge Burch that I was guilty on those conditions there.\r\n   Q:Â  I understand.Â  I understand, Mr. Hughes.\r\n  A:Â  So it doesnâ€™t have anything to do with legal phasing as to innocent or guilt.Â  It didnâ€™t have anything to do with that.Â  Iâ€™m saying it had went through this court system here about four years ago one time before when I had took and brought the procedure about six years ago to be executed.\r\n  As I have stated, Iâ€™ve been waiting over six years now in my own room to be executed.Â  I have been waiting six years to be executed.Â  Do you understand?Â  I havenâ€™t been just sitting here thinking about being executed for no reason.Â  I've been waiting six years to be executed with finality.\r\n  Q:Â  All right, sir.\r\n  A:Â  In the courtroom decision back then, when they took and changed the legal law, the public back then, because she had an expired commission, I think it was every four years.Â  That was the first setback that I had took and went through.\r\n  Other than that, if I didnâ€™t give you a runaround story, it was just to this fact here.Â  When I had went through the courtroom through the preliminary hearings in North - I mean, not North Carolina but in York County close to North Carolina, they did not take and listen to what was presented in the case.Â  They just presented their case.\r\n  I offered those things right there.Â  I took and formed my own opinion about the state of South Carolina, but I have never came to the courtroom as showing a negative attitude.Â  I never did that, even though my attitude is negative toward the court system.\r\n\r\nPetitionerâ€™s mention of a â€œpublic back then,â€ a â€œsheâ€ who had an â€œexpired commission,â€ appears to be a reference to what he previously has described as a â€œnotary republic,â€ a person whom Petitioner has told psychiatrists is a major participant in a PCR proceeding.Â  In addition, Petitioner twice told us that he has written to former Secretary of State Madeline Albright, whom he previously has indicated wields some influence over our resolution of his case.\r\nWe have carefully and thoroughly reviewed Petitionerâ€™s history of mental competency, as well as his history of mental illness as shown in the record of previous proceedings and in the last competency hearing.Â  We have considered the testimony of the mental health experts who examined Petitioner.Â  We have reviewed the findings of the circuit court and weighed the arguments of counsel for the parties, and we have considered Petitionerâ€™s demeanor and personal responses to our questions at oral argument regarding the waiver of his rights.Â  We recognize, of course, that questions of mental competence, unlike issues of historical fact, call for a basically subjective judgment.Â  â€œAnd unlike the determination of whether the death penalty is appropriate in a particular case, the competency determination depends substantially on expert analysis in a discipline fraught with subtleties and nuances.â€Â  Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 426 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring) (quotes omitted).\r\nWe acknowledge the issue of Petitionerâ€™s mental competence is not immutable.Â  A determination of mental competence may change from one period of time to another, particularly when the administration of medication or treatment, or the lack thereof, may affect a personâ€™s mental faculties.Â  See e.g. Walton v. Angelone, 321 F.3d 442, 459 (4th Cir. 2003) (â€œEven if a defendant is mentally competent at the beginning of the trial, the trial court must continually be alert for changes which would suggest that he is no longer competent.â€); Hunter v. State, 660 So.2d 244, 248 (Fla. 1995) (once a defendant is determined competent to stand trial, a presumption of competence attaches to the defendant in later proceedings; however, another competency hearing is required if a bona fide question about the defendantâ€™s competency is raised); see also Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 180 (1975) (information concerning defendantâ€™s suicide attempt during trial, when considered with psychiatric information available prior to trial and wifeâ€™s testimony concerning his â€œstrange behaviorâ€ and his attempt to kill her shortly before trial, created sufficient doubt of defendantâ€™s competence to stand trial so as to require further inquiry on the issue).\r\nWe conclude that, pursuant to the Singleton standard, Petitioner is not mentally competent at this time to waive the right to pursue PCR.Â  Petitioner apparently understands what he was tried for and the reason for his punishment; whether he understands the nature of the punishment is less certain.Â  However, it is clear he does not understand the nature of the PCR proceeding which he wishes to waive the right to pursue.Â  Petitioner was not able to describe, in a reasonably coherent fashion using laymanâ€™s terms, the basic purposes or procedures available to him in PCR, either in the court below or in this Court.Â  Thus, the cognitive prong of the Singleton analysis has not been satisfied.\r\nWe further conclude the assistance prong is not satisfied on this record.Â  We are not persuaded Petitioner possesses sufficient capacity or ability to rationally communicate with counsel.Â  We agree with the mental health experts who examined Petitioner, and who cited his inability to communicate adequately with counsel as a primary reason for their conclusion he was not mentally competent.Â  Given our conclusions, it is not necessary to reach the issue of whether any waiver was knowing and voluntary. \r\nIn a second argument, Petitioner asserts that, even if he were deemed mentally competent, the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment and international law prohibit the execution of a chronically mentally ill person.Â  We find it unnecessary to address this argument in light of our disposition of this matter.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude Petitioner is not mentally competent, pursuant to the Singleton standard, to waive the right to pursue PCR and be executed forthwith.Â  We remand this case to circuit court for further proceedings pursuant to Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782 (2004).\r\nREMANDED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, and PLEICONES, J.J., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, Hughes is competent to waive his right to pursue PCR.Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s cherry-picking of the transcript and record.Â  Throughout this proceeding Hughes has demonstrated an ability to understand the impact of his decisions and, in my opinion, did so in his appearance before this Court.Â  \r\nFurther, in the interest of judicial economy, I would allow Hughes to waive his right to PCR.Â  In my view, allowing Hughes to waive his right to PCR would result in the case arriving at the exact same procedural posture as is now.Â  Ultimately, the majorityâ€™s decision will force the case to go full circle and eventually require a thorough evaluation to determine if Hughes is competent to be executed.Â  As a result, after the Order for Execution is issued, counsel for Hughes could apply for subsequent PCR relief pursuant to Singleton, which is the final judicial safeguard against executing someone not mentally competent.Â  Singleton, 313 S.C. 75, 87, 437 S.E.2d 53, 60 (1993) (stating that apply Â§ 17-27-20 is the final judicial safeguard for a stay of execution to evaluation a defendants competency and immediate review by this Court is permitted if the defendant is found competent by the PCR court); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(6) (stating that a defendant may apply relief upon any ground of alleged error).Â  The decision of the majority adds an additional step, one that Hughes has requested that he be allowed to waive. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We recognize Petitioner personally disagrees with the arguments set forth by his attorney.Â  Nevertheless, we will refer only to Petitioner (without distinguishing him from counsel) because he remains represented by counsel and the crucial issue is whether Petitioner has the mental capacity to waive his right to PCR and counsel, and make these decisions for himself.\r\n[2]Â  The State may not forcibly medicate an inmate solely to facilitate execution.Â  An inmate has a right, grounded in the state constitutional right to privacy and the Fourteenth Amendmentâ€™s Due Process clause of the federal constitution, to be free from unwanted medical intrusions.Â  The State may forcibly medicate an inmate only when he is dangerous to himself or others, and then only when it is in the inmateâ€™s best medical interest.Â  Singleton, 313 S.C. at 89, 437 S.E.2d at 61 (relying in part on Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992) and Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990)); see also Ford v.

Savitz, III, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia; and Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Pursuant to Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), we vacate appellantâ€™s sentence of death and remand to the trial court for re-sentencing.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was charged with murder, armed robbery, and possession of an explosive device.Â  The charges resulted from the murder and armed robbery of a convenience store employee on May 3, 2000.Â  Appellant admitted shooting the victim once in the head as the victim was closing the store and then stealing a bag the victim was carrying that contained more than $7000.Â  Appellant and his accomplice, who had been hired at the store a week before the incident, had originally planned to blow a hole in the back wall of the store with a pipe-bomb after it closed.Â  Following a trial, appellant was found guilty as charged.\r\nThe State sought the death penalty, relying on two aggravating statutory circumstances:Â  (1) the murder occurred during the commission of an armed robbery, and (2) the murder occurred during the commission of larceny while armed with a deadly weapon.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d) and (e) (2003).Â  At sentencing, the defense relied on three mitigating circumstances:Â  (1) the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal conviction involving the use of violence against another person; (2) the age or mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime; and (3) the defendant was below the age of eighteen at the time of the crime.Â  See Â§Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(1), (7), and (9) (2003).\r\nThe jury found both statutory aggravators and appellant was sentenced to death on the murder charge.Â  On the charge of armed robbery, appellant was sentenced to an imprisonment term of thirty years.Â  On the charge of possession of an explosive device, he was sentenced to an imprisonment term of fifteen years to be served consecutively to the armed robbery sentence.[1]Â  \r\nSubsequently, the United States Supreme Court decided Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005).Â  The Roper court held that the execution of individuals who were under eighteen years of age at the time of their capital crimes is prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.[2]Â  Accordingly, appellantâ€™s sentence of death is vacated. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nShould appellant be allowed to present evidence on a remand for re-sentencing that he is entitled to a sentence less than life imprisonment?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe parties disagree on the appropriate procedure on a remand for re-sentencing.Â  The State argues the matter should be remanded to the trial court for the sole purpose of sentencing appellant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Â  The State contends life without parole is the only alternate sentence because the jury found two aggravating circumstances.Â  The State bases its argument on the portion of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 2005) which states, â€œIf the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt . . ., and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment.â€Â  The State argues that where it has sought the death penalty and the jury has found aggravating circumstances, the only available sentence other than death is life imprisonment.\r\nAppellant, however, contends that, on remand, he should be allowed to argue that he should be sentenced to something less than life imprisonment without parole.Â  Appellant is correct.Â  Pursuant to Roper v. Simmons, supra, appellantâ€™s death sentence is prohibited.Â  The portion of Â§ 16-3-20(A) cited by the State does not apply to appellant.Â  Further, on remand, whether the jury found certain aggravating circumstances at his sentencing proceeding is irrelevant because the discussion of aggravators arises only when the State seeks the death penalty, which the State cannot do in this case.\r\nWe therefore look to Â§ 16-3-20(A) for guidance on how a person convicted of murder and who is not subject to the death penalty should be sentenced.Â  Section 16-3-20(A) provides that â€œ[a] person who is convicted of . . . murder must be punished by . . . imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years.â€Â  Therefore, on remand, the trial court may receive additional evidence on the question of whether appellant is entitled to receive a sentence less than life imprisonment and decide on a sentence that ranges from a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of thirty years to life imprisonment.\r\nVACATED AND REMANDED.\r\nBURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., Acting Justice Clyde N. Davis, Jr., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Appellantâ€™s sentences on the charges of armed robbery and possession of an explosive device are unaffected by this decision. \r\n[2] Both the State and appellant agree that appellant was seventeen years old at the time of the murder.Â  The record indicates appellantâ€™s birthday is May 19, 1982.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-02-21-01","description":"","date":"2006-02-21","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn re: Amendments to the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRule 410(e), SCACR, currently requires that any   member wishing to practice in the Unified Court System provide a current e-mail   address to the Bar, and promptly notify the Bar of any change of e-mail address.   The purpose of the requirement is to allow the Bar and the respective clerks of   court to quickly and efficiently communicate with members. Moreover, as the   practice of law becomes increasingly driven by technology, it is paramount that   all members have a current and valid e-mail address not only to facilitate   prompt communication, but so that the judiciary can begin implementing e-filing   procedures. \r\n \r\nHowever, it has recently come to the Court&rsquo;s   attention that an unacceptable number of members have failed to provide the Bar   with their current e-mail addresses.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert E. Bogan, Assistant Deputy Attorney General, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        David L. Thomas, of Greenville, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and impose a public reprimand.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 6, 1989, respondent was appointed to serve as a Greenville County Magistrate.Â  Dorothy Campbell Crossley served as respondentâ€™s office manager from 1996 to January 2005.Â  On January 27, 2005, Crossley went to respondentâ€™s home before reporting to work and confessed she had been stealing money from respondentâ€™s office for five years.Â  \r\nCrossley provided the following explanation concerning her thefts to ODC.Â  She reported that the banking deposit was customarily compiled between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. and that, at this time, respondent was either not in the office or did not review the deposit.Â  Accordingly, unless she was absent from work or busy, Crossley was left with exclusive control over the daily deposits and associated documentation.Â  Knowing her work would not be reviewed, Crossley would occasionally take cash from the criminal deposit and reduce the amount of cash shown on the deposit ticket by the same amount, even though this left the deposit out of balance with the officeâ€™s computer-generated daily deposit listing. \r\nODC examined financial records provided by respondentâ€™s office for the months of January, April, August, and December 2004.Â  The examination confirmed the pattern of embezzlement described by Crossley.Â  Using the practice described above, Crossley embezzled $8344.60 in those four months.Â  ODC is informed that an accounting conducted by the Greenville County Finance Department indicates respondentâ€™s office is missing approximately $96,500 and it appears this amount was taken by Crossley while working under respondentâ€™s supervision.Â  \r\nThis Courtâ€™s November 9, 1999 order provides:\r\n\r\n  While the Court recognizes that magistrates must utilize employees of their office to assist in the handling of the monies of their office, each magistrate is personally responsible for compliance with all procedures for the handling of the monies of their magisterial office and proper record keeping related thereto and shall regularly, but no less than monthly, review bank statements and other records to insure such compliance.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent represents that he relied almost entirely on Crossley to properly document and disburse the monies in his office and that, prior to January 27, 2005, he had complete faith in Crossley and did not see the need to â€œgo behind herâ€ and check her work.Â  Respondent acknowledges that his supervision of Crossley did not comply with the requirements of the Courtâ€™s November 9, 1999 order and represents he has now implemented each of the oversights required by the order.Â  Respondent disputes any contention that his adherence to the order would have prevented Crossleyâ€™s embezzlement and has submitted affidavits in support of his belief that Crossley would have been successful in her embezzlement scheme even if all requirements of the November 9, 1999 order had been followed.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of office diligently); Canon 3(C)(1) (judge shall maintain professional competence in judicial administration); and Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall require his staff to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge). Â In addition, respondent admits that he has violated the Courtâ€™s November 9, 1999 order.Â  Respondent admits his misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to persistently fail to perform judicial duties or persistently perform judicial duties in an incompetent or neglectful manner), and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to willfully violate a valid order issued by a court of this state) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe note respondent did not participate in the thefts reported by this opinion.Â  Moreover, he candidly reported the thefts and, thereby, his own misconduct, to ODC and fully cooperated with ODC in its investigation of this matter. Â Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26118","title":"Capco of Summerville, Inc. v.

(Capco) appeals an order of the circuit court holding its contribution action against respondent, J. H. Gayle Construction Company (Gayle), was barred by the statute of repose set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-640(6) (1986).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCapco owns Dixie Plaza Shopping Center in Colleton County.Â  The parking lot of the shopping center was constructed by Gayle and was substantially completed on November 1, 1986.Â  On May 19, 1996, Pauline Conner was involved in an automobile accident with James Hogan in the parking lot of Dixie Plaza.Â  Conner entered a settlement agreement with Hogan for $5000.00.Â  In August 1998, Conner and her husband filed lawsuits against Capco and Gayle, alleging negligent design and construction of the parking lot.Â  On June 13, 2003, Capco settled the Connersâ€™ claims for $500,000.00.Â  Although Gayle did not participate in the settlement, the settlement expressly released Gayle from any liability to the Conners.Â  \r\nOn September 22, 2003, Capco filed this contribution action against Gayle.Â  Gayle moved for summary judgment contending Capcoâ€™s claim was barred by the thirteen year statute of repose set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-640(6) (2005), as it was commenced seventeen years after completion of the parking lot.Â  Capco responded, contending the thirteen year statute of repose had been impliedly repealed by the Legislatureâ€™s adoption of the one-year limitation period set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-40(D) of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act.Â  The trial court held Â§ 15-3-640 (6) controlled such that Capcoâ€™s contribution action was barred.\r\nThe issue presented by Capco is whether S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-6-640(6) was implied repealed by the Legislatureâ€™s 1988 adoption of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-40(D), and whether the two statutes are irreconcilably conflicting.Â  Although we are deeply troubled by the result in this case, we are constrained to hold that the thirteen year period set forth in Â§ 15-6-640 (D) controls, such that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Gayle.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAt the time this action was commenced, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-640 (1986), provided:\r\n\r\n  No actions to recover damages based upon or arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property may be brought more than thirteen years after substantial completion of such an improvement. Â For purposes of this section, an action based upon or arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property includes: \r\n  (6) an action for contribution or indemnification for damages sustained on account of an action described in this subdivision. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (Contribution Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-40(D) (2005), which was enacted in 1988, provides that an action for contribution is barred unless a settling tortfeasor has â€œagreed while action is pending against him to discharge the common liability and has within one year after the agreement paid the liability and commenced his action for contribution.â€ Â Â Â \r\nIn this case, Capco settled the pending case with the Conners on June 13, 2003, discharging the liability of both itself and Gayle, and brought this contribution suit three months later, well within the one year time period provided by Â§ 15-38-40(D).Â Â  However, although the contribution action was commenced within the one-year period set forth in the Contribution Act, it was not brought within 13 years of the substantial completion of the parking lot, as required by Â§ 15-3-640(6).Â Â  The circuit court, relying upon the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Florence County School District No. 2 v. Interkal, Inc., 348 S.C. 446, 559 S.E.2d 866 (Ct. App. 2002), held Â§ 15-3-640(6) controlled such that Capcoâ€™s contribution action was barred.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Interkal, a school bleacher collapsed in February 1991, injuring a student.Â  The bleachers had been installed in 1969 and 1971.Â  The student sued the school district and Interkal, the manufacturer of the bleachers.Â  The school district settled with the student, then sought contribution from Interkal under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-10 et. seq. (the Contribution Act).Â  The Court of Appeals held that â€œ[t]he Statute of Repose bars actions for contribution under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act brought more than thirteen years after the completion of an improvement to real property.â€Â  348 S.C. at 453, 559 S.E.2d at 869.Â  We find Interkal is clearly dispositive of the issue; accordingly, the trial court properly held the statute of repose applied to bar Capcoâ€™s action.\r\nNotwithstanding the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Interkal, Capco asserts the two statutes are irreconcilably conflicting.Â  It contends the statute of repose was repealed by implication by adoption of the one-year period in the Contribution Act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRepeal by implication is disfavored, and is found only when two statutes are incapable of any reasonable reconcilement.Â  Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 440 S.E.2d 357 (1994).Â  Moreover, the repugnancy must be plain, and if the two provisions can be construed so that both can stand, a court shall so construe them.Â  City of Rock Hill v. South Carolina DHEC, 302 S.C. 161, 167, 394 S.E.2d 327, 331 (1990).Â  Where there is one statute addressing an issue in general terms and another statute dealing with the identical issue in a more specific and definite manner, the more specific statute will be considered an exception to, or a qualifier of, the general statute and given such effect.Â  Wilder v. South Carolina Hwy. Depâ€™t, 228 S.C. 448, 90 S.E.2d 635 (1955).Â  See also Wooten ex rel. Wooten v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999) (a specific statutory provision prevails over a more general one); Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995) (general rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute prevails over a more general one).\r\nA statute of limitations is a procedural device that operates as a defense to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of action. A statute of repose creates a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a legislatively determined period of time.Â  Langley v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 403-04, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993).Â Â  A statute of repose is typically an absolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists and is not tolled for any reason because to do so would upset the economic balance struck by the legislative body.Â  Id. at 404, 438 S.E.2d at 243.Â  A statute of repose is â€œ[a] statute barring any suit that is brought after a specified time since the defendant acted . . . even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a resulting injury.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1451 (8th Ed. 2004).Â  â€œStatutes of repose by their nature impose on some plaintiffs the hardship of having a claim extinguished before it is discovered, or perhaps before it even exists.â€Â  Camachco v. Todd and Leiser Homes, 706 N.W.2d 49, 54, n. 6 (Minn. 2005) citing W. Page Keeton, et. al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§ 30, p. 168 (5th ed.1984).Â  As noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, â€œ[a] statute of repose differs from a statute of limitations. . . . [T]he expiration of the time extinguishes not only the legal remedy but also all causes of action, including those which may later accrue as well as those already accrued.â€Â  School Bd. of the City of Norfolk v. U.S. Gypsum, 360 S.E.2d 325, 327-328 (VA. 1987).Â  \r\nThe statutes at issue do not irreconcilably conflict.Â  Section 15-3-640(6) is a statute of repose setting forth the outside time period in which an action arising out of the defective condition of an improvement to real property must be brought, which date begins to run from completion of the project.Â  Section 15-38-40(D), on the other hand, is a statute of limitations which governs contribution actions, and begins to run from the date of settling a common liability.Â  We find neither an irreconcilable conflict, nor an implied repeal of section 15-3-640(6).[1]\r\nMoreover, section 15-3-640 (6) specifically applies to â€œan action for contribution or indemnification for damages sustained on account of an actionâ€ arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.Â  Section 15-38-40(D), on the other hand, applies generally to all contribution actions.Â  Given that section 15-3-640(6) applies not simply to contribution actions, but to this specific class of contribution actions, we find it is the more specific statute and therefore controls.Â  Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995) (general rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute prevails over a more general one).Â  See also State v. Life Ins. Co. of Georgia, 254 S.C. 286, 175 S.E.2d 203 (1970) (court will apply a more specific statute of limitations instead of a general one).[2]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Capcoâ€™s action is time-barred by the thirteen year time-period set forth in Â§ 15-3-640 (6).Â  However, we are troubled by the harsh result in the case.Â  As Capco correctly points out, where a lawsuit is filed on the eve of the running of the statute of repose, but is not resolved until after the statute has run, the contribution action will be barred before the right has even accrued, placing an undue burden on a single tortfeasor.Â  This is clearly contrary to the purposes of the Contribution Act, which was to â€œameliorate the unfairness vested on all joint tortfeasors by the common lawâ€™s prohibition against contribution.â€Â  Southeastern, 331 S.C. at 470, 443 S.E.2d at 397. Â However, although we are troubled by this result, we are not at liberty to rewrite the statutes, and any amendment must come from the Legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000).Â  The trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Gayle is affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED. Â Â \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Clyde N. Davis, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We note that Section 15-3-640 was amended in 2005 and now contains an outside limitation of eight years in which to file suit.Â  Notably, the 2005 amendment did not delete or otherwise amend subsection (6), clearly indicating the legislature did not intend to repeal this subsection.Â  2005 Act No. 27, Â§ 2, eff. July 1, 2005.\r\n[2]Â  Capco asserts this case is analogous to Southeastern Freight Lines v. City of Hartsville, 313 S.C. 466, 443 S.E.2d 395 (1994), superseded by statute as stated in Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).Â Â  In Southeastern, we held the Contribution Act, to the extent it provided unlimited pro rata liability for joint tortfeasors, was inconsistent with, and had effectively repealed those portions of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-100(c) and 15-78 120 (a)(1), which required apportioned liability and a limitation on damages against state agencies.Â  Southeastern is inapposite.Â  There, the limits on liability in the Tort Claims Act were inconsistent with unlimited pro rata liability.Â  Here, the statutes simply set forth time periods to establish when a claim is barred.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26119","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

(Mark) Grier, Jr., of Lancaster, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Angelica Seegars (Appellant) appeals the family courtâ€™s termination of her parental rights to Brionica Jaâ€™zyra Seegars and Javarus Kaleel Seegars (Children).Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 22, 2002, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) took Children into emergency protective custody because Javarus had been hospitalized for severe injuries from a nonaccidental trauma.Â  On October 16, 2003, in a formal order of removal, the family court found injuries to Javarusâ€™s brain, toes, neck, and leg occurred while in the care of another but under the direction of approval of Appellant and found injuries to Javarusâ€™s arm and ribs occurred while in Appellantâ€™s direct care and control.Â  The family court further found Brionica was at a substantial risk of abuse because of the severity of Javarusâ€™s physical abuse by Appellant.Â  The family court also ordered Appellant to pay monthly child support for Children in the amount of $248.00 with court costs of five percent.[1]Â  \r\nOn April 9, 2004, DSS commenced this action for termination of parental rights (TPR) against Appellant, John Doe, and L.J. Parker.Â  DSS sought termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (1), (2), (4), (6), and (8) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005) and termination of parental rights of Parker and Doe pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3), (4), (7), and (8).Â  \r\nAt the TPR hearing, Dr. William Lehman, an orthopedic surgeon, testified he treated Javarus on September 25, 2002, for a fracture of the upper arm bone.Â  On October 8, 2002, Lehman treated Javarus for skull and rib fractures.Â  He testified the skull injury led to significant and permanent brain damage, and he concluded Javarusâ€™s injuries were not accidental.Â  He further testified Javarus was two years old at the time of hearing, but functioning, intellectually and physically, at a six month level.Â  \r\nCarol Tiedeman, Javarusâ€™s physical therapist, testified she began his therapy on January 7, 2003.Â  According to Tiedeman, Javarus had neurological damage and vision and hearing impairments and had been diagnosed with battered child syndrome and shaken baby syndrome.Â  She testified that Javarusâ€™s foster mother brought him to the appointments and did home therapy with Javarus.Â  She stated she had never met or talked to Appellant.Â  \r\nChrys Tuttle, a foster care case worker for DSS, was assigned to Childrenâ€™s case.Â  According to Tuttleâ€™s records, Appellant alleged she had five places of employment since Children had been in foster care, but Tuttle was unable to verify Appellantâ€™s employment history.Â  She opined Appellant had not demonstrated stable employment for a period of six months because she had not had any one job for a six month period.Â  Tuttle testified her records indicated eight residences for Appellant since Children had been in foster care, including a one bedroom apartment in Charlotte, North Carolina where Appellant had been living since February 28, 2004.Â  \r\nTuttle testified Appellant attended four of twenty scheduled medical appointments for Javarus, none of Javarusâ€™s twenty-three emergency medical appointments, and none of Javarusâ€™s one hundred, at least, physical, speech, and occupational appointments.Â  She also testified there were prospective adoptive placements available for Children and in her opinion termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights was in the best interests of Children. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccording to family court records, Appellantâ€™s child support began on October 17, 2003.Â  Appellant paid $20.00 on October 17, 2003, and $50.00 on October 31, 2003.Â  The deputy clerk of the family court testified Appellant was in arrears $3,054.80 as of the date of the TPR hearing.Â  \r\nAppellant testified to four places of employment and four to five residences since the formal removal order.Â  She testified she would begin working at Mercy Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina, the week following the hearing and she had been working at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte since June 2004.Â  She testified she worked at Burger King Corporation in Charlotte from February to June 2004, and she worked at Goodwill Industries from September 2003 to November 2003.[2]Â  \r\nAppellant testified she gave Children toys, money, and gifts during visits and for their birthdays and Christmas.Â  She also asserted she had insufficient funds to pay the court-ordered child support because her employment with Goodwill ended in November 2003.Â  She further testified she wrote â€œa letter to Columbia to let them know what my status was with child support and to be patient with me and I would try to clear it up as soon as I could.â€Â  Appellant testified the family court records were incorrect because she had made more than two payments.Â  \r\nBy agreement, a written evaluation from Dr. Lisa Jackel, a licensed clinical psychologist who conducted a psychological evaluation of Appellant, was admitted in lieu of her live testimony.Â  She diagnosed Appellant with schizotypal personality disorder and alleged physical and sexual abuse. Dr. Jackel concluded that Appellant â€œis not currently or likely ever capable of appropriately caring for her children, financially, emotionally, or intellectually.â€\r\nBy agreement, a letter from Dr. Russell Hancock, Appellantâ€™s current psychologist, was admitted in lieu of his live testimony.Â  He diagnosed Appellant with adjustment disorder and schizotypal personality disorder.Â  He explained the difference between a personality disorder and a psychotic disorder.\r\n The guardian ad litem recommended termination of parental rights and found termination was in Childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\nOn November 15, 2005, the family court judge entered a Final Order for Termination of Parental Rights, terminating Appellantâ€™s parental rights based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4), (6), and (8).Â  The family court also terminated the alleged fathersâ€™ parental rights on the grounds of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (3), (4), (7), and (8).[3]Â  The family court denied Appellantâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment and for reconsideration, or, in the alternative, for a new trial.Â  Appellant appeals and we certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals under Rule 204(b), SCACR. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in terminating Appellant&rsquo;s parental rights because she willfully failed to support the children for a period in excess of six months, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-1572(4), or because she had a diagnosable condition that is unlikely to change within a reasonable time and made it unlikely that she could provide minimally acceptable care for the children, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-1572(6)?&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Does the termination of Appellant&rsquo;s parental rights based on S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7- 1572(8) violate her due process rights? \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe family court will terminate parental rights and free a child up for adoption if it finds that one of the nine statutory grounds for termination has been met and that â€œtermination is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572.Â  The family court judge terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights pursuant to three statutory grounds.Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-1572(4), (6), &amp; (8).Â  DSS must prove these grounds by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998).Â  When reviewing the family court decision, this Court may make its own conclusion as to whether DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that parental rights should be terminated.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 589 S.E.2d 753 (2003).Â  The reviewing court, however, is not required â€œto ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Termination of Parental Rights\r\nA. Willful Failure to Support\r\nAppellant argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights on the ground she failed to support Children or make any material contribution to their care for a period in excess of six months.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) the family court may order termination of parental rights if:\r\n\r\n  The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period Â of six months, and during that time the parent has wil[l]fully  failed to support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care. . . .The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wil[l]fully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support. \r\n\r\nWhether a parentâ€™s failure to support a child is â€œwillfulâ€ within the meaning of the statute is a question of intent to be determined in each case from all the facts and circumstances.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  Conduct of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as â€œwillfulâ€ because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.Â  Id. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839. \r\nFirst, Appellant argues we should reverse the family courtâ€™s termination of her parental rights because the family court did not find her failure to support Children was willful.Â  Regardless of the family courtâ€™s findings, we may make our own conclusions as to whether DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that parental rights should be terminated.Â  Cochran, 356 S.C. at 417, 589 S.E.2d at 755. Â \r\nSecond, Appellant argues the family court erred because she made material contributions in accordance with her means.Â  Appellant asserts the two partial payments toward child support and her testimony that she gave Children toys, gifts, and money are evidence of material contribution.\r\nâ€œMaterial contributionâ€ is defined as â€œeither financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4).Â  Toys are not included in this definition and will not be considered by us in concluding whether Appellant made a material contribution to Children.Â  Â Â \r\nChildren were taken into emergency protective custody on October 22, 2002 and were formally removed from Appellantâ€™s care on October 16, 2003 by order of the family court.Â  In eleven months, Appellant made two partial child support payments totaling $70.00, and she owed $3,054.80 in child support on the date of the TPR hearing.Â  If Appellant had insufficient funds to make child support payments, she could have petitioned the family court to reduce child support.Â  Appellantâ€™s failure to pay court-ordered child support or give a reasonable excuse for her failure to pay manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of Children to receive support, and is therefore a willful failure to support.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 582 S.E.2d 419 (2003) (affirming family courtâ€™s finding of willful failure to support where mother made some payments after being ordered by the court, then inexplicably stopped for 16 months, and although mother had caught up with her support payments by the time of the TPR hearing, the family court was able to look beyond the months immediately preceding the TPR action at the motherâ€™s overall conduct.); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 547 S.E.2d 506 (Ct. App. 2001) (affirming family courtâ€™s finding motherâ€™s failure to support was willful when mother made only one child support payment of $15 during 14 months and owed $490 in child support on the day of the TPR hearing even though she paid $457 to the court that day).\r\n The guardian ad litem and DSS case worker both testified termination would be in the best interests of Children.Â  Also, Dr. Jackel testified Appellant was not currently or would likely ever be capable of caring for Children.Â  Based on the above facts, we conclude there is clear and convincing evidence that Children have lived outside Appellantâ€™s home for a period of at least six months and during that time Appellant has willfully failed to support the Children, and we conclude termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights is in the best interests of Children. \r\nB. Diagnosable Condition\r\nAppellant argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights because she has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time and which makes her unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of Children.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellant argues DSS failed to present clear and convincing evidence that her personality disorder makes her unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of Children.Â  She also argues the family court erroneously relied on Dr. Jackelâ€™s evaluation because the evaluation is too vague, uncertain, and empty of evidence to support its conclusions and thus has no probative value.Â  \r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6), the family court may order termination of parental rights if:\r\n\r\n  The parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, mental deficiency, mental illness, or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child.\r\n\r\nThe family court terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights, in part, because she has a diagnosable condition of schizotypal personality disorder.Â  Dr. Jackel described schizotypal personality disorder as â€œinclud[ing] odd thinking and beliefs, suspiciousness due to paranoid ideation, inappropriate affect, odd/eccentric behavior, lack of close friendships and social anxiety due to paranoid fears, and unusual perceptual experiences.â€Â  From Appellantâ€™s personality test results, Dr. Jackel surmised Appellant â€œmay be more imaginative and her defense mechanism may be reliance on fantasy, neglecting practical matters, which may contribute to her denial of her sonâ€™s medical condition and permanent disabilities.â€\r\nIn light of her findings, Dr. Jackel concluded:\r\n\r\n   [Appellant] is not currently or likely ever capable of appropriately caring for her children, financially, emotionally, or intellectually.Â  She can not care for her sonâ€™s medical problems if she does not admit he has any problems.Â  She did not verbalize any medical problems, need for therapies, or special medical care he requires. . . . [Appellantâ€™s] personality profile suggests that she is likely to be disorganized and she may feel ineffective in her ability to cope with life.Â  She may be more imaginative and not pay attention to practical matters.Â  She can not be trusted to follow through on what she says she will do.Â  She also has personality traits which may cause her to be prone to developing an addiction. . . . It appears that [Appellant] is unable to take care of herself never mind her children as she has not maintained steady employment or housing since her children have been in [foster] care. â€ \r\n\r\nAt the TPR hearing, Appellant described Javarusâ€™s medical problems and stated he required around the clock care and was fed through a feeding tube.Â  Yet, the guardian ad litemâ€™s report supports Dr. Jackelâ€™s conclusions.[4] \r\nWe conclude there is clear and convincing evidence that Appellant has a diagnosable conditionâ€”schizotypal personality disorderâ€”which is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and this condition makes Appellant unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of Children.Â  The evidence shows Appellant denied the severity of Javarusâ€™s condition, had difficulty dealing with practical matters, failed to maintain steady employment, failed to maintain a stable home, and failed to establish she had reliable transportation.Â  See Orangeburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Harley, 302 S.C. 64, 393 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. App. 1990) (affirming family courtâ€™s termination of motherâ€™s parental rights, in part, under Â§ 20-7-1572(6) where mother had a low mental status which was unlikely to improve in the future, difficulty in caring for herself, poor impulse control, low frustration level, and difficulty responding to simple statements and directions and where mother had failed to maintain a stable residence--twelve homes in a little over two years--and could not manage her own finances).Â  Further, termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights is in the best interests of Children.\r\nII. Due Process Rights\r\nAppellant argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) because this subsection violates her due process rights.Â  \r\nBecause we affirm the family courtâ€™s termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) and (6), we decline to address Appellantâ€™s constitutional issue.Â  See Fairway Ford, Inc. v. County of Greenville, 324 S.C. 84, 86, 476 S.E.2d 490, 491 (1996) (â€œ[I]t is this Courtâ€™s firm policy to decline to rule on constitutional issues unless such a ruling is required.â€); see also Headden, 354 S.C. at 613, 582 S.E.2d at 425 (declining to address the issue of whether a motherâ€™s due process rights were violated because the family court terminated her parental rights under Â§ 20-7-1572(8) when this Court found clear and convincing evidence existed to affirm TPR based on willful failure to visit and support); Cochran, 356 S.C. at 420, 589 S.E.2d at 756 (same).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the family courtâ€™s termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) and (6) and decline to address termination under Â§ 20-7-1572(8). \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\nÂ [1]Â  In addition to the child support, the family court ordered Appellant to undergo a psychological evaluation and follow any recommendations made as a result of the evaluation; to complete additional parenting classes specific to nutrition and care of small children; to participate in individual counseling; to demonstrate suitable and stable housing for herself and Children prior to their return to her care; to demonstrate stable employment for a period of six months prior to the return of Children.Â  The family court further ordered that Appellant could attend any and all of Javarusâ€™s medical and therapy appointments and educate herself on the details of Javarusâ€™s ongoing care.\r\nÂ [2]Â  Based on check stubs presented into evidence, Appellant received compensation from Presbyterian Hospital for the pay periods ending July 24, 2004, and September 18, 2004; from Burger King for March 24, 2004 to July 15, 2004, and from Goodwill Industries for August 19, 2003 to November 26, 2003.\r\nÂ [3]Â  Those terminations have not been appealed and are the law of the case.Â  Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (unappealed ruling is the law of the case). Parker also executed a voluntary relinquishment of parental rights as to Javarus, which was filed on April 30, 2004, and took a paternity test which indicated he was not Javarusâ€™s biological father. \r\nÂ 4] The guardian ad litem found, â€œIf [Javarus] is returned to [Appellant], she would not be able to care for him and be able to take him at a momentâ€™s notice to a hospital if needed since transportation has sometimes become an issue during scheduled visitation. . . .She is unable to explain the severity of his injuries nor the requirements needed to feed him, medicate him, [and] provide therapy for him or his day-to-day care in general.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
