(CSX), alleging that, due to CSXâ€™s negligence, \r\n  he was injured as a result of exposure to excessive heat in a locomotive cab.Â  \r\n  The jury awarded Whaley actual damages in the amount of $1,000,000.Â  CSX appealed, \r\n  and after certifying this case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, we \r\n  affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFactual/Procedural \r\n  Background\r\nOn May 24, 2000, Whaley reported \r\n  to work at CSXâ€™s Maxwell Yard in Greenwood, South Carolina, to operate a familiar \r\n  route from Greenwood to Laurens and then back. \r\n  [1] Â  On the way to Laurens, Whaley became disoriented and began experiencing \r\n  stomach cramps, nausea, and diarrhea.Â  He also noticed that he was not sweating, \r\n  even though it was very hot in the locomotive cab.Â  When he arrived in Laurens, \r\n  Whaley went inside the depot office to cool off in the air conditioning.Â  He \r\n  tried drinking water but stopped because it made his stomach cramp. \r\nBefore Whaley began the return \r\n  trip to Greenwood, he realized that because of his symptoms, he would not be \r\n  able to make the trip.Â  He returned to the depot and called 911. \r\nEMS arrived, and after \r\n  learning that Whaley had not been drinking fluids and was experiencing dizziness, \r\n  the paramedic administered fluids through an IV.Â  The paramedic then recommended \r\n  that Whaley be taken to the emergency room â€œto be checked out.â€Â  Upon arrival \r\n  at the emergency room, Whaleyâ€™s temperature was either 99.1 or 99.7 degrees. \r\n  [2] Â  The emergency room physician determined that Whaley suffered heat \r\n  exhaustion, dehydration, and acute abdominal pain.Â  Whaley was kept in the emergency \r\n  room for approximately two hours for observation and then was released.Â Â  \r\nAfter that day, May 24, 2000, \r\n  Whaley remained out of work for two weeks.Â  On June 7, with his family doctorâ€™s \r\n  permission, Whaley returned to work.Â  Whaley testified that he still felt bad \r\n  at the time, but he had to work or he would not get paid.\r\nHe worked June 7 and 8, and then \r\n  took the next three days off because he was still not feeling well.Â  The following \r\n  Monday, June 12, Whaley returned to work, but the very next day, June 13, would \r\n  be his last day working for CSX.Â  He testified that, even though he did not \r\n  feel well all day, he was able to complete his duties.\r\nOn June 14, 2000, Whaley went \r\n  to a previously scheduled appointment with his family doctor, Dr. Hatfield, \r\n  who told Whaley not to go back to work until doctors could determine why Whaley \r\n  felt so badly and why he was unable to sweat upon exertion.Â  Dr. Hatfield referred \r\n  Whaley to a number of specialists.Â  Dr. James, a cardiologist, testified that \r\n  he found no cardiac abnormalities and thought, instead, that Whaley had a viral \r\n  illness and, accordingly, referred him to an infectious disease specialist.Â  \r\n  Dr. Holman, an internal medicine specialist, testified that Whaleyâ€™s symptoms \r\n  were consistent with a viral illness, heat exhaustion, or dehydration. \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nAfter he was examined by the \r\n  specialists, Whaley testified that he concluded â€œ[t]here was nothing anybody \r\n  could do.â€Â  Because of his inability to perspire upon exertion, Whaley never \r\n  returned to work.Â  Since then, he has been limited in his physical activity, \r\n  but has still been able to enjoy hobbies such as fishing and hunting.Â  In January \r\n  2003, however, Whaley began experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath.Â  \r\n  As a result, doctors installed a pacemaker. \r\nWhaley filed a complaint against \r\n  CSX in Hampton County on February 14, 2001, asserting claims under the Federal \r\n  Employerâ€™s Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 et seq., and the Locomotive \r\n  Inspection Act (LIA), 49 U.S.C. Â§ 20701 et seq., and alleging, in sum, \r\n  that CSX was negligent for failing to provide him with a safe place to work.Â  \r\n  On November 1, 2002, CSX filed a motion to transfer venue to Greenwood County, \r\n  which was denied.Â  The case proceeded to trial in Hampton County, and the jury \r\n  returned a verdict for Whaley in the amount of $1,000,000.Â  CSXâ€™s post-trial \r\n  motions were denied.\r\nOn appeal, CSX raises the following \r\n  issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in denying CSXâ€™s motion to transfer venue?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in denying CSXâ€™s motion for\r\n    JNOV?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Were Whaleyâ€™s claims preempted by federal law?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in allowing medical experts to testify on Whaleyâ€™s behalf \r\n  about causation?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in admitting evidence concerning injuries to other CSX \r\n  employees, other employee complaints, and equipment on other CSX locomotives?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Venue\r\nA.Â  Residency\r\nCSX argues that venue was improper \r\n  in Hampton County because CSX does not â€œresideâ€ in Hampton County.Â  We agree.\r\nVenue is the place or geographical \r\n  location of trial.Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 238, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  598, 600 (1994); see also In re Asbestosis Cases, 276 S.C. 579, 581, \r\n  281 S.E.2d 112, 115 (1981) (noting that â€œvenueâ€ refers to the county where the \r\n  action should be brought).Â  The venue statute in South Carolina provides, in \r\n  part, that an action â€œshall be tried in the county in which the defendant resides \r\n  at the time of the commencement of the action.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (1976).Â  \r\n  A defendantâ€™s right to be tried in the county of its residence is a substantial \r\n  right.Â  Blizzard v. Miller, 306 S.C. 373, 375, 412 S.E.2d 406, 406 (1991).Â  \r\n\r\nThe question of where a defendant \r\n  resides is a question of law.Â  Breland v. Love Chevrolet Olds, Inc., \r\n  339 S.C. 89, 92, 529 S.E.2d 11, 13 (2000). When the facts concerning a defendantâ€™s \r\n  residence are uncontradicted, the trial court must, as a matter of law, change \r\n  venue to the county where the defendant resides.Â  Blizzard, 306 S.C. \r\n  at 375, 412 S.E.2d at 406-07.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nEarly decisions by this Court \r\n  established that, for purposes of venue, a foreign corporation resides in any \r\n  county where it has an office and agent for the transaction of business. Sanders \r\n  v. Allis Chalmers Mfg. Co., 235 S.C. 259, 111 S.E.2d 201 (1959); Hancock \r\n  v. S. Cotton Oil Co., 211 S.C. 432, 45 S.E.2d 850 (1947); Coker v. Sinclair \r\n  Refining Co., 203 S.C. 13, 25 S.E.2d 894 (1943); Shelton v. S. Kraft \r\n  Corp., 194 S.C. 81, 10 S.E.2d 341 (1940); Tucker v. Ingram, 187 S.C. \r\n  525, 198 S.E. 25 (1938); Campbell v. Mut. Benefit Health Corp. &amp; Accident \r\n  Assâ€™n, 161 S.C. 49, 159 S.E. 490 (1931); see also Hayes v. Seaboard Air \r\n  Line Ry., 98 S.C. 6, 81 S.E. 1102 (1914) (holding that a foreign railroad \r\n  corporation resides in the county where it â€œowns a line of railwayâ€ and â€œmaintains \r\n  offices and agents . . . for the transaction of its businessâ€).Â  Domestic corporations, \r\n  on the other hand, have been held to reside (1) in any county where the corporation \r\n  maintains an agent and transacts its corporate business or (2) in the \r\n  county where the corporation maintains its principal place of business.Â  See \r\n  McGrath v. Piedmont Mut. Ins. Co., 74 S.C. 69, 72, 54 S.E. 218, 218-19 (1906); \r\n  Tobin v. Chester &amp; L. Narrowgauge R.R. Co., 47 S.C. 387, 25 S.E. \r\n  283 (1896) (holding that a domestic railroad corporation resides in the county \r\n  â€œwhere its line is located, and where it maintains a public office for the transaction \r\n  of its business, and an agent upon whom process may be servedâ€).Â  \r\nIn 1941, however, this Court \r\n  expanded the definition of venue for domestic corporations.Â  In Miller \r\n  v. Boyle Constr. Co., this Court held that venue is proper in any county \r\n  where a domestic corporation â€œowns property and transacts business.â€Â  198 S.C. \r\n  166, 172, 17 S.E.2d 312, 314-15 (1941).Â  In support of its decision, the Court \r\n  relied upon language in a 1927 statute concerning service of process on and \r\n  jurisdiction over domestic corporations: \r\n\r\nin the case of domestic corporations[,] \r\n  service â€¦ shall be effective and confer jurisdiction over any domestic corporation \r\n  in any county where such domestic corporation shall own property and transact \r\n  business regardless of whether or not such domestic corporation maintains \r\n  an office or has agents in that county.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 172, 17 S.E.2d at \r\n  315 (emphases added). Although the statute pertained to service and jurisdictionâ€”not \r\n  venueâ€”the Court decided that the statute â€œgoverned and controlledâ€ the question \r\n  of where a domestic corporation resides for purposes of venue.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  As a result, counties where a domestic corporation owned property and transacted \r\n  business became an additional place where venue could be found proper.Â  \r\nSix years later, the Court had \r\n  the opportunity to extend the â€œowns property and transacts businessâ€ test to \r\n  foreign corporations, but the Court declined to do so.Â  See Hancock \r\n  v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., 211 S.C. 432, 437, 45 S.E.2d 850, 853 (1947) \r\n  (holding that foreign corporations reside in any county where they maintain \r\n  an agent and office for the transaction of business).Â  In Hancock, the \r\n  Court squarely considered whether the rule established in Millerâ€”that \r\n  domestic corporations reside in any county where they own property and \r\n  transact businessâ€”applied to foreign corporations, and the Court held \r\n  that it did not.Â  The Court declined to extend the rule to foreign corporations \r\n  because the 1927 service statute, which formed the basis of the Courtâ€™s decision \r\n  in Miller, dealt only with domestic corporations, not foreign corporations.Â  \r\n  If the legislature had intended for the statute to apply to foreign corporations, \r\n  the Court reasoned, then the statute would have been written accordingly.Â  The \r\n  Court was unwilling, therefore, to use the statute to define venue as proper \r\n  in any county where a foreign corporation owned property and transacted business.Â  \r\n  Consequently, the Court maintained the long-standing rule that a foreign corporation \r\n  resides in any county where the corporation maintains an agent and office for \r\n  the transaction of business.Â  Id. at 438, 45 S.E.2d at 854.\r\nEventually, in 1964, the statute \r\n  concerning service and jurisdiction was amended to include foreign corporations.Â  \r\n  The amended statute provided, in part, the following:Â  \r\n\r\nin the case of domestic or \r\n  foreign corporations, service as effected under the terms of this section \r\n  shall be effective and confer jurisdiction over any domestic or foreign corporation \r\n  in any county where such domestic or foreign corporation shall own property \r\n  and transact business, regardless of whether or not such domestic or foreign \r\n  corporation maintains an office or has agents in that county.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-421 (Supp. \r\n  1975) [4]  (emphases added).Â  \r\n  Now that the service statute included both domestic and foreign corporations, \r\n  the question then became whether the Court would use the statute to expand the \r\n  definition of venue for foreign corporations, to include any county where a \r\n  foreign corporation owned property and transacted business. \r\nSoon after the service statute \r\n  was amended, the Court answered this question, holding that venue was proper \r\n  in a county where a foreign corporation owned property and transacted \r\n  business. Lott v. Claussens, Inc., 251 S.C. 478, 480, 163 S.E.2d 615, \r\n  616-17 (1968).Â  The Court reached this decision by relying exclusively on the \r\n  1964 service statute, without a single citation to the venue statute or precedent. \r\n\r\nFinally, in 1980, this Court \r\n  definitively established that, for a corporate defendant, venue is proper in \r\n  any county where such corporate defendantâ€”foreign or domesticâ€”owns property \r\n  and transacts business, regardless of whether the corporation maintains an office \r\n  and agent in that county.Â  In re Asbestosis Cases, 274 S.C. 421, 433, \r\n  266 S.E.2d 773, 778 (1980).Â  In that case, the Court began its analysis with \r\n  the proposition that venue for corporations may be predicated on either \r\n  the venue statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (1976), or the service of \r\n  process statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-210 (1976).Â  Because the Court reasoned \r\n  that both statutes addressed the venue issue, the Court read the two statutes \r\n  together. \r\nThe venue statute, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-7-30, entitled â€œActions which must be tried in county where defendant \r\n  resides,â€ provided, in part, the following:\r\n\r\n[an] action shall be tried in \r\n  the county in which the defendant resides at the time of the commencement of \r\n  the action.Â  If there be more than one defendant then the action may be tried \r\n  in any county in which one or more of the defendants to such actions resides \r\n  at the time of the commencement of the action.Â  If none of the parties shall \r\n  reside in the State the action may be tried in any county which the plaintiff \r\n  shall designate in his complaint.Â  This section is subject however to the power \r\n  of the court to change the place of trial in certain cases as provided by law.\r\n\r\nThe service of process statute, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-210, entitled, â€œService on corporations generally,â€ provided, \r\n  in part, the following: \r\n\r\nservice as effected under the \r\n  terms of this section shall be effective and confer jurisdiction over \r\n  any domestic or foreign corporation in any county where such domestic or foreign \r\n  corporation shall own property and transact business, regardless of whether \r\n  or not such domestic or foreign corporation maintains an office or has agents \r\n  in that county.\r\n\r\n(Emphases added).\r\nBecause the venue statute did \r\n  not define the term â€œresides,â€ the Court, as it had done in prior decisions, \r\n  looked to the service statute for guidance.Â  The Court explained its analysis \r\n  in the following way:Â  \r\n\r\n[b]oth 15-7-30 and 15-9-210 obviously \r\n  deal with the same general subject matter. \r\n  [5] Â  With [this] principle in mind, it is logical to interpret â€œresidesâ€ \r\n  as used in section 15-7-30 to include, for the purpose of determining proper \r\n  venue, those counties in which any corporate defendant â€œshall own property and \r\n  transact businessâ€ as provided in section 15-9-210.\r\n\r\nIn re Asbestosis Cases, \r\n  274 S.C. at 426, 266 S.E.2d at 775.Â  Accordingly, without relying on precedent, \r\n  the Court held that because the defendant corporation did not own property or \r\n  transact business in Barnwell County, venue was not proper in that county, and \r\n  the case was remanded for transfer to Greenville County, where the defendant \r\n  had its only place of business. Â Id. at 433, 266 S.E.2d at 778.\r\nA year later, the Court \r\n  delineated the three locations where a corporationâ€™s residence may be established \r\n  for purposes of venue:\r\n\r\n(1) county where a domestic corporation \r\n  has its principal place of business, Lucas v. Atlantic Greyhound Federal \r\n  Credit Union . ..; or\r\n(2) county where a domestic or \r\n  foreign corporation maintains an office and agent for the transaction of business, \r\n  Lucas v. Atlantic Greyhound Federal Credit Union . . .; Shelton v. \r\n  Southern Kraft Corp., 195 S.C. 81, 10 S.E.2d 341 (1940); or\r\n(3) county where a domestic or \r\n  foreign corporation owns property or transacts business (Â§ 15-9-210), Code of \r\n  Laws of South Carolina (1976). \r\n\r\nIn re Asbestosis Cases, \r\n  276 S.C. 579, 582, 281 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1981).Â  Notably, the Court cited case \r\n  law in support of the â€œoffice and agentâ€ test and statutory law in support of \r\n  the â€œowns property and transacts businessâ€ test.Â  Id.\r\nSoon after the Court \r\n  published the In re Asbestosis Cases decisions, the legislature rewrote \r\n  section 15-9-210, the service statute.Â  The revised service statute no longer \r\n  included the phrase â€œown property and transact businessâ€ and no longer referred \r\n  to jurisdiction.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-210 (Supp. 1981).Â  Moreover, \r\n  the revised service statute dealt only with domestic corporations; provisions \r\n  regarding service on foreign corporations were moved to another section of the \r\n  Code.Â  See Â§ 15-9-240 (Supp. 1981).Â  As a result of these significant \r\n  revisions, there is no longer a statutory basis for laying venue in a county \r\n  where a corporation â€œowns property and transacts business.â€Â  \r\nAlthough the statutory basis \r\n  for the â€œowns property and transacts businessâ€ test no longer exists, South \r\n  Carolina appellate courts have continued to cite the test.Â  See Dove v. Gold \r\n  Kist, Inc., 314 S.C at 239, 442 S.E.2d at 600-01; McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley \r\n  &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 335, 479 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Only one \r\n  case, however, has actually applied the test to reach its holding.Â  See Thomas \r\n  &amp; Howard Co., Inc. v. Wetterau, Inc., 291 S.C. 237, 239, 353 S.E.2d \r\n  141, 142 (1987) (holding that a corporation resides in county where it owns \r\n  property and transacts business).\r\nIn the present case, the trial \r\n  court [6]  relied upon this Courtâ€™s decisions in Thomas \r\n  &amp; Howard and the two In re Asbestosis Cases to support his decision \r\n  to deny CSXâ€™s motion to change venue, finding that CSX was a resident of Hampton \r\n  County because it owned property and transacted business in Hampton County.Â  \r\n  In so ruling, the trial court also relied, in part, on dicta from this Courtâ€™s \r\n  most recent case concerning venue, Breland v. Love Chevrolet, 339 S.C. \r\n  at 94, 529 S.E.2d at 13.Â  In Breland, this Court held that a denial of \r\n  a motion to change venue was not immediately appealable.Â  Id. at 96, \r\n  529 S.E.2d at 14.Â  In dicta, however, the Court stated, â€œit is clear that [the \r\n  defendantâ€™s] substantial and continuous contacts with Hampton County \r\n  will sustain the trials courtâ€™s decision [to deny the motion to change venue].â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 94, 529 S.E.2d at 13 (emphasis added).Â  Relying on this language, \r\n  the trial court in the present case found that the Supreme Court â€œclearly indicated \r\n  that the foreign corporationâ€™s substantial and continuous contacts with \r\n  a particular county support[ed] venue.â€ (Emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe hold that the trial court \r\n  erred in finding that CSX resides in Hampton County.Â  First, we find that the \r\n  trial court improperly relied upon dicta in Breland.Â  As the trial judge \r\n  in the present case acknowledged, the merits of the defendantâ€™s motion to change \r\n  venue was not before this Court.Â  Moreover, we did not hold that â€œsubstantial \r\n  and continuous contactsâ€ in a particular county satisfies the â€œowns property \r\n  and transacts businessâ€ test.Â  Therefore, the dicta in Breland does not \r\n  support the trial courtâ€™s ruling. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSecond, we hold that the â€œowns \r\n  property and transacts businessâ€ test is no longer a viable test for determining \r\n  whether venue is proper.Â  To begin, the test was improperly created by the Court \r\n  reading two statutes, in tandem, that addressed separate and distinct concepts.Â  \r\n  See In re Asbestosis Cases, 274 S.C. at 426, 266 S.E.2d at 775.Â  Section \r\n  15-9-210 addressed service of process and jurisdiction, while section 15-7-30 \r\n  addressedâ€”and still does todayâ€”venue.Â  Venue is the place or geographical location \r\n  of trial.Â  Dove, 314 S.C. at 238, 442 S.E.2dÂ  at 600; see also In \r\n  re Asbestosis Cases, 276 S.C. at 581, 281 S.E.2d at 114.Â  Jurisdiction, \r\n  on the other hand, is the power of a court to decide a case.Â  Blackâ€™s Law \r\n  Dictionary 855 (7th ed. 1999); see also Dove, 314 S.C. at 237-38, \r\n  442 S.E.2d at 600 (defining subject matter jurisdiction as the courtâ€™s power \r\n  to hear and determine a particular class of cases).Â  Proper service of process \r\n  on a defendant, therefore, confers personal jurisdiction over the defendant.Â  \r\n  Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 66 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n  Consequently, a court may have personal jurisdiction over a properly served \r\n  defendant by effecting personal service in a particular geographical location \r\n  without venue being proper in the place of service.Â  Therefore, because these \r\n  statutes do not address the same concepts, the Court improperly used the language \r\n  from the service statute to define the term â€œresidesâ€ in the venue statute.\r\nEven if we were to find that \r\n  the Court properly used the â€œowns property and transacts businessâ€ language \r\n  from the service statute to define â€œresides,â€ we no longer support a test that, \r\n  derived from statute, no longer exists in that statute.Â  Again, when rewriting \r\n  section 15-9-210, the legislature removed the â€œowns property and transacts businessâ€ \r\n  language.Â  As a result, this Court can no longer point to a statute, as it did \r\n  in prior decisions, including the two In re Asbestosis Cases decisions \r\n  and the earlier decision in Lott v. Claussens, Inc., to find venue proper \r\n  in a county where a corporate defendant owns property and transacts business.Â  \r\n  Therefore, in our decision today, we are unwilling to uphold the â€œowns property \r\n  and transacts businessâ€ test.Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, as recently as 1994, \r\n  this Court has continued to recognize that venue is proper where a corporate \r\n  defendant maintains an office and agent for the transaction of business.Â  Dove, \r\n  314 S.C. at 238, 442 S.E.2d at 600; Stewart v. Nichols, 282 S.C. 402, \r\n  404, 318 S.E.2d 369, 370 (1984).Â  In Dove, we were unwilling to find \r\n  that venue was proper in Richland County on the sole basis that the defendant \r\n  corporation maintained a retail outlet in the county. Dove, 314 S.C. \r\n  at 239, 442 S.E.2d at 601.Â  Instead, the Court was concerned with whether the \r\n  defendant maintained an agent in Richland County, and, therefore, remanded \r\n  the case to the trial court to make such a determination.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that for \r\n  purposes of venue, a defendant corporation resides in any county where it (1) \r\n  maintains its principal place of business or (2) maintains an office and agent \r\n  for the transaction of business.Â  \r\nCSX is incorporated under Virginia \r\n  law, and its principal place of business is in Florida.Â  Although CSX owns property \r\n  and transacts business in Hampton County, it does not maintain an office and \r\n  agent for the transaction of business there.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred \r\n  in finding that venue was proper in Hampton County. \r\nB.Â  Convenience \r\n  and Justice\r\nCSX argues that even if it did \r\n  reside in Hampton County, its motion to change venue should have been granted \r\n  based on the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice.  \r\n  [7] Â  We agree.\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Discretionary \r\n  authority\r\nA trial judge may change the \r\n  place of trial â€œ[w]hen the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice \r\n  would be promoted by the change.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-100(3) (1976).Â  Unlike \r\n  the determination of residency, which is a question of law, it is within the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s discretion to determine whether to grant a motion to change venue \r\n  based on the convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice.Â  Varnadoe \r\n  v. Hicks, 264 S.C. 216, 219, 213 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1975).\r\nÂ \r\nIn the present case, the trial \r\n  judge found that he lacked the discretionary authority to transfer the case \r\n  based on subsection 2 of South Carolinaâ€™s long-arm statute. \r\n  [8] Â  Subsection 2 provides that when jurisdiction is based solely on the \r\n  long-arm statute, a trial judge is not permitted to transfer venue for the convenience \r\n  of witnesses and the ends of justice. \r\n  [9] Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803(2) (1976).Â  Because the trial judge found \r\n  that personal jurisdiction in this case was based solely on the long-arm statute, \r\n  he found that he was without authority to transfer the case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s jurisdiction \r\n  was not based solely on the long-arm statuteâ€™s bare threshold level of minimum \r\n  contacts.Â  Another statutory basis for jurisdiction existed under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 36-2-802 (1976), which provides that â€œ[a] court may exercise personal \r\n  jurisdiction over a person domiciled in, organized under the laws of, doing \r\n  business, or maintaining his or her principal place of business in, this \r\n  State as to any cause of action.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Evidence in the record \r\n  demonstrates that CSX conducts business in this state, owns property in this \r\n  state, and has an agent for service of process in this state. \r\n  [10] Â  \r\nBecause we find that CSX was \r\n  â€œdoing businessâ€ in this state, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling \r\n  that jurisdiction was based solely on the long-arm statute.Â  Consequently, the \r\n  trial judge erred in ruling that he did not have the discretionary authority \r\n  to transfer the case based on the convenience of the witnesses and the ends \r\n  of justice.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMerits \r\n   \r\nEven though the trial judge found \r\n  that he did not have the authority to transfer the case based on convenience \r\n  of the witnesses and the ends of justice, the judge addressed the merits of \r\n  the motion, found that CSX did not make a prima facie showing that the \r\n  witnesses would be inconvenienced by a trial in Hampton County, and, accordingly, \r\n  ruled that CSXâ€™s motion, if considered on the merits, would be denied.Â Â  \r\nEither party may make a motion \r\n  to change venue based on convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice.Â  \r\n  McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 334, 479 S.E.2d 67, \r\n  70 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The moving party has the burden of making a prima facie \r\n  showing that both the convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice would \r\n  be promoted.Â  Mixson v. Agricultural Helicopters, Inc., 260 S.C. 532, \r\n  197 S.E.2d 663 (1973).Â  The showing must be based on â€œcompetent evidence,â€ not \r\n  mere â€œbeliefs, opinions, and conclusions of the witnesses.â€Â  Id.Â  Once \r\n  such a showing has been made, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion \r\n  to overcome at least one of the two requirements.Â  Id.\r\nAt the motion hearing, CSX presented \r\n  evidence showing that almost every witness identified by each of the parties \r\n  lived either in Greenwood County or the contiguous counties of Laurens and Abbeville. [11] Â  With the exception of a medical expert retained \r\n  by Whaley to review his condition in preparation for trial, none of the witnesses \r\n  were residents of Hampton County. [12] Â  In addition, the alleged \r\n  injuries occurred either in Greenwood or Laurens Counties, not Hampton County.Â  \r\n  Finally, CSX submitted deposition excerpts from two of Whaleyâ€™s treating physicians \r\n  who testified that it would be inconvenient for them to travel from Greenwood \r\n  to Hampton County for trial. [13] \r\n  \r\nBased on this evidence, we find \r\n  that CSX made a prima facie showing that Hampton County was not a convenient \r\n  place for trial.Â  Moreover, we hold that the ends of justice were not promoted \r\n  by having this case tried in Hampton County.Â  See Varnadoe v. Hicks, \r\n  264 S.C. 216, 213 S.E.2d 736 (1975) (convenience of the witnesses is a factor \r\n  the court may consider in deciding whether a change of venue would promote the \r\n  ends of justice); Holden v. Beach, 228 S.C. 234, 89 S.E.2d 433 (1955) \r\n  (the ends of justice are promoted by having a jury from the same area as the \r\n  witnesses evaluate witness credibility).\r\nTherefore, we hold that the trial \r\n  judge erred in ruling that CSX failed to make a prima facie showing that \r\n  the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by a \r\n  change of venue.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  JNOV\r\nCSX argues that Whaley did not \r\n  present a sufficient amount of evidence from which a reasonable and fair-minded \r\n  juror could have found that CSX violated the Federal Employerâ€™s Liability Act \r\n  (FELA) or the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA).Â  Accordingly, CSX argues, the \r\n  trial court erred in denying CSXâ€™s motion for JNOV on these two claims.Â  We \r\n  agree that the trial court erred in denying the motion on the LIA claim, but \r\n  we disagree that the court erred in denying the motion on the FELA claim. \r\nA.Â  FELA claim\r\nWhen deciding whether to grant \r\n  a motion for JNOV in a FELA action, a state court must apply the federal standard.Â  \r\n  Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 91, 588 S.E.2d 87, 90 (2003).Â  \r\n  The federal standard for sufficiency of evidence, which applies to both trial \r\n  and appellate courts, is the following:Â  \r\n\r\nthe evidence and all reasonable \r\n  inferences from it are assessed in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party . . . and the credibility of all evidence favoring the non-moving party \r\n  is assumed. . . .Â  Assessed in this way, the evidence must then be â€œof such \r\n  quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial \r\n  judgment could reasonably return a verdict for the non-moving party. . . .â€Â  \r\n  A â€œmere scintilla of evidenceâ€ is not sufficient to withstand the challenge.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 91-92, 588 S.E.2d \r\n  at 90 (internal citations omitted).Â  Therefore, the non-moving party must present \r\n  â€œmore than a scintilla of evidence to establish his claim.â€Â  Id. at 92, \r\n  588 S.E.2d at 90. \r\nUnder FELA, railroad carriers \r\n  are liable to their employees for injury resulting, in whole or in part, from \r\n  the employerâ€™s negligence.Â  45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 (2000).Â  Moreover, a railroad has \r\n  a non-delegable duty to provide its employees with a safe place to work. [14] Â  Rogers, 356 S.C. at 92, 588 S.E.2d at 90 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  This duty, however, extends only to foreseeable dangers.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  To recover, a plaintiff must prove the common law elements of negligence: \r\n  duty, breach, causation, and damages. Id. at 91, 588 S.E.2d at 90.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence and its \r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to Whaley, we find that Whaley presented \r\n  more than a scintilla of evidence to support a verdict in his favor on the FELA \r\n  claim.Â  At trial, Whaley presented the testimony of Tony Smith, general chairman \r\n  for the Eastern Lines General Committee of Adjustment on CSX, who admitted that \r\n  locomotive cabs become very hot during the summer months.Â  In addition, Larry \r\n  Koster, chief mechanical officer for CSX, testified that CSX was aware that \r\n  extreme heat and airflow were issues in locomotives. Â Finally, Gregory Martin, \r\n  chief mechanical officer for engineering and quality assurance for CSX, testified \r\n  that CSX had studied the issue of excessive heat in locomotive cabs. \r\nBased on this testimony, we find \r\n  that Whaley presented more than a scintilla of evidence to establish that CSX \r\n  knew or, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known that the conditions \r\n  inside its locomotives could constitute an unsafe work environment.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we hold that Whaley presented enough evidence from which a fair-minded juror \r\n  could differ on whether CSX was negligent and whether that negligence contributed \r\n  to Whaleyâ€™s injury.Â  \r\nB.Â  LIA claim\r\nWe find, however, that the trial \r\n  court erred in denying the JNOV motion on the LIA claim.Â  Under the LIA, railroad \r\n  carriers must ensure that their locomotives and all parts and appurtenances \r\n  â€œare in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal \r\n  injury.â€Â  49 U.S.C. Â§ 20701 (2000).Â  In addition, LIA regulations require that \r\n  locomotives â€œbe provided with proper ventilation.â€Â  49 C.F.R. 229.119(d) (2003).Â  \r\n  But â€œa carrier cannot be held liable under the [LIA] for failure to install \r\n  equipment on a locomotive unless the omitted equipment (1) is required by applicable \r\n  federal regulations; or (2) constitutes an integral or essential part of a completed \r\n  locomotive.â€Â  Mosco v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 817 F.2d 1088, 1091 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1987).\r\nIn this case, Whaley argues that \r\n  the locomotives he operated lacked proper ventilation.Â  But he did not present \r\n  any evidence that the locomotives and their parts were not in proper condition.Â  \r\n  Moreover, he did not present any evidence that CSX failed to install equipment \r\n  that was required under federal regulations or that constituted an integral \r\n  or essential part of the locomotive.Â  Because Whaley did not present even a \r\n  scintilla of evidence to establish a claim under the LIA, we hold that a fair, \r\n  impartial, and reasonable juror could not have returned a verdict in Whaleyâ€™s \r\n  favor on the LIA claim.Â  \r\nConsequently, we hold that the \r\n  trial court erred in denying CSXâ€™s motion for JNOV on the LIA claim but properly \r\n  denied the motion on the FELA claim.Â Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;\r\nPreemption\r\nCSX argues that the FELA and \r\n  LIA claims are precluded and preempted under federal law. [15] Â  We agree that the LIA claim \r\n  is preempted but hold that the FELA claim is not.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court \r\n  has held that the LIAâ€™s predecessor, the Boiler Inspection Act, was intended \r\n  to â€œoccupy the fieldâ€ of locomotive regulation.Â  Napier v. Atl. Coast Line \r\n  R. Co., 272 U.S. 605, 613 (1924).Â  As a result, any state regulation of \r\n  locomotives, e.g., to promote health and comfort or safety, is precluded and \r\n  preempted by federal law.Â  Id. at 612-13; see also General Motors \r\n  Corp. v. Kilgore, 853 So.2d 171 (Ala. 2002) (holding that the LIA preempts \r\n  state common law claims brought in wrongful death action).Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, we hold \r\n  that Whaleyâ€™s claim under the LIA is preempted by federal law.Â  Federal law \r\n  does not require that CSX install fans or air conditioners in its locomotives.Â  \r\n  To uphold the juryâ€™s verdict would support a finding of liability despite CSXâ€™s \r\n  compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations and would force CSX \r\n  to alter its locomotives in a way that would conflict with the uniformity and \r\n  consistency that the LIA is designed to provide.Â  As a result, CSX would be \r\n  forced to install cooling devices on all locomotives to protect itself against \r\n  future lawsuits in South Carolina.Â  Therefore, we hold that Whaleyâ€™s claim under \r\n  the LIA is preempted.Â  \r\nBut Whaleyâ€™s negligence claimâ€”that \r\n  his employer did not provide a safe place to workâ€”is not preempted by federal \r\n  law.Â  A claim under FELA gives rise to an ordinary negligence action, which \r\n  is governed by state law.Â  Therefore, to the extent Whaley had a viable claim, \r\n  he could have brought it under the FELA only.Â  \r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nExpert \r\n  Testimony  \r\nCSX argues that the trial court \r\n  erred in allowing Whaley to present expert testimony that heat exposure caused \r\n  Whaleyâ€™s current inability to sweat.Â  Moreover, CSX argues that the evidence \r\n  did not meet the standard for admissibility, was unreliable, lacked proper foundation, \r\n  and was based on facts not in evidence.\r\nAfter reviewing the record, we \r\n  find that this issue is not preserved for review.Â  See Holy Loch Distributors, \r\n  Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000) (to preserve \r\n  an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court).Â  \r\nCSX argues that the trial court \r\n  erred in allowing Drs. Shealy, Waheed, and Collins to testify as to causation.Â  \r\n  But there is no evidence in the record that CSX objected, at all, to the testimony \r\n  of Drs. Shealy and Waheed during trial.Â  CSX did, however, object to Dr. Collinsâ€™s \r\n  testimony, on the basis that it did not meet the standard of reliability.Â  But \r\n  this objection was apparently raised and ruled upon in a side bar, and the contents \r\n  of the side bar are not part of the record. \r\n  [16] Â  Moreover, when counsel attempted to put the contents of the side \r\n  bar on the record, the trial judge interrupted to explain that the objection \r\n  had been overruled in the side bar, not because the judge thought the testimony \r\n  met the standard of reliability, but because counsel failed to lay a foundation \r\n  for the objection.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not rule upon the issue now \r\n  raised by CSX in this appeal.Â  For these reasons, we find that this issue is \r\n  not preserved for review. Â Â \r\n  V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOther Evidence \r\n   \r\nCSX argues that the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting evidence of other employee complaints about the temperature \r\n  in locomotives.Â  CSX also argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence \r\n  about fans, air conditioners, and white-painted roofs on other locomotives. \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nEvidence of similar accidents, \r\n  transactions, or happenings is admissible in South Carolina where there is some \r\n  special relation between them tending to prove or disprove some fact in dispute.Â  \r\n  Brewer v. Morris, 269 S.C. 607, 610, 239 S.E.2d 318, 319 (1977).Â  This \r\n  rule, which governs the admissibility of prior accidents, transactions, or happenings, \r\n  is based on â€œrelevancy, logic, and common sense.â€Â  Id.Â Â  Because evidence \r\n  of other accidents may be highly prejudicial, â€œ[a] plaintiff must present a \r\n  factual foundation for the court to determine that the other accidents were \r\n  â€˜substantially similarâ€™ to the accident at issue.â€Â  Buckman v. Bombardier \r\n  Corp., 893 F. Supp. 547, 552 (E.D.N.C. 1995).\r\nRelevant evidence is â€œevidence \r\n  having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence \r\n  to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would \r\n  be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may \r\n  be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \r\n  of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by \r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative \r\n  evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The admission of evidence is within the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  discretion and his decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).\r\nIn the present case, the trial \r\n  judge permitted Whaley to submit evidence that, between 1984 and 2000, CSX had \r\n  received ninety-seven employee complaints about heat.Â  In addition, the trial \r\n  judge permitted Whaley to introduce evidence that, between 1993 and 2000, eighteen \r\n  CSX employees had suffered heat stroke.Â  Finally, the judge allowed Whaley to \r\n  introduce letters written to CSX by union officials complaining about heat.Â  \r\n\r\nWe hold that this evidence should \r\n  not have been admitted.Â  Whaley did not establish that the reported complaints \r\n  and injuries stemmed from the same or similar circumstances as his injuries.Â  \r\n  Because Whaley did not establish that the other employees were injured under \r\n  similar circumstances, much less under substantially similar circumstances, \r\n  the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence.\r\nThe trial judge also allowed \r\n  Whaley to introduce evidence that some CSX locomotive cabs are equipped with \r\n  fans or air conditioners, and that the tops of some cabs are painted white.Â  \r\n  We find that this evidence was not relevant to Whaleyâ€™s claim that the locomotives \r\n  in which he was injured were unsafe to operate or were not properly ventilated.Â  \r\n  Moreover, based on our holding that the LIA claim is preempted, the evidence \r\n  should not have been admitted to show that CSX was liable for failing to install \r\n  particular cooling devices. \r\nTherefore, we hold that the trial \r\n  judge erred in allowing Whaley to introduce this evidence.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nIn sum, we reverse the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling denying CSXâ€™s motion to change venue.Â  CSX does not reside \r\n  in Hampton County for purposes of venue, and therefore the case should not have \r\n  been tried in Hampton County.Â  Moreover, the case should have been transferred \r\n  to Greenwood County on the basis of the convenience of witnesses and the ends \r\n  of justice.Â  \r\n In addition, we reverse \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling denying CSXâ€™s motion for JNOV on the LIA claim.Â  But \r\n  we affirm the trial court ruling denying CSXâ€™s motion for JNOV on the FELA claim.Â  \r\n  As a result, Whaley may proceed with the FELA claim upon re-trial.Â  \r\nFinally, we reverse \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling admitting certain evidence regarding other employee \r\n  complaints and regarding fans, air conditioners, and white-painted roofs on \r\n  other locomotives.Â  \r\nThis case is therefore remanded \r\n  to Greenwood County to be tried in accordance with this opinion. [17] \r\n MOORE, WALLER and \r\n  BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that the trial court erred \r\n  in denying CSXâ€™s motion for a change of venue pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 \r\n  (1976).Â  Having found this statute controls, I would not reach the other venue \r\n  issues.Â  I therefore join Part I A of the majority, but decline to join Part \r\n  I B.\r\nI also join the majorityâ€™s decision in Part II affirming the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s denial of CSXâ€™s JNOV motion as it related to the FELA claim and reversing \r\n  as to the LIA claim.Â  Therefore, I find it unnecessary to reach CSXâ€™s \r\n  curious preemption argument as to the LIA cause of action.Â  Moreover, \r\n  like the LIA claim, the FELA claim was brought pursuant to a federal \r\n  act, and does not require us to decide whether these statutes preempt a state \r\n  law claim.Â  I therefore decline to join Part III.Â  While I join the majorityâ€™s \r\n  disposition of the evidentiary issues in Parts IV and V, I do so with the understanding \r\n  that some of these evidentiary objections may be renewed at the next trial.\r\nFor the reasons given above, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision \r\n  to remand the FELA claim for a new trial. \r\n  [18] Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The route was thirty miles each way, and with time spent switching \r\n    cars and waiting, it took approximately twelve hours to complete a round trip.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The temperature on the emergency room record appears as 99.1, but \r\n    the emergency room doctor testified that Whaley had a temperature of 99.7.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Whaley also saw Dr. Rodillo, who administered a stress test.Â  The \r\n    results of this test are not part of the record.Â  In addition, Whaley mentioned \r\n    the name of a fourth specialist, Dr. Smith, whom he saw shortly after his \r\n    alleged injury, but the record does provide the details of this treatment.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  This statute was subsequently codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-210 \r\n    (1976).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Throughout the opinion, the Court intertwined the concepts of service, \r\n    jurisdiction, and venue.Â  For example, the Court viewed the 1964 amendment \r\n    to the service statuteâ€”which provided that service on a domestic or \r\n    foreign corporation was proper and conferred jurisdiction in any county where \r\n    the corporation owned property and transacted businessâ€”as an amendment that \r\n    expanded the law of venue.Â  Id. at 426, 266 S.E.2d 775. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Pre-trial rulings in this case on the venue issue were made by Circuit \r\n    Court Judge J. Cordell Maddox, Jr.Â  The case was tried to a jury before Circuit \r\n    Court Judge Perry M. Buckner, who made the evidentiary rulings and post-verdict \r\n    rulings.Â  We have referred to these judges collectively as â€œthe trial courtâ€ \r\n    or â€œthe trial judge.â€Â  Judge Maddox and Judge Buckner are skilled and experienced \r\n    trial judges who did not have the benefit of our rulings here when they conscientiously \r\n    applied precedent as it then existed. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Although we hold that venue was improper in Hampton County because \r\n    CSX did not â€œresideâ€ there, we address the alternative basis upon which venue \r\n    was improperâ€”the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justiceâ€”because \r\n    we seek to issue a comprehensive decision that clarifies the law of venue.Â  \r\n    Moreover, because the incidents and parties involved in the underlying lawsuit \r\n    had no rational connection to the county in which this case was tried, we \r\n    cannot ignore a trial court ruling that fails to base venue on principles \r\n    of convenience and justice, particularly when such rulings may undermine the \r\n    publicâ€™s confidence in our judicial system. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  The long-arm statute confers personal jurisdiction over a nonresident \r\n    defendant for specific conduct occurring in this state.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 36-2-803(1) \r\n    (1976).Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [9] We note that South \r\n    Carolina is the only state that prohibits nonresident defendantsâ€”defendants \r\n    who are brought into a South Carolina court solely on the basis of the long-arm \r\n    statuteâ€”from transferring venue for the convenience of witnesses and the ends \r\n    of justice.Â  See Timothy Clardy, Nonresident Defendants Donâ€™t Deserve \r\n    Convenience or Justice in South Carolina, 55 S.C. L. Rev. 443 (2004) (arguing \r\n    that section 2 of the long-arm statute violates the Equal Protection Clause \r\n    and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 of the United \r\n    States Constitution).Â  We do not, however, consider the constitutionality \r\n    of subsection 2 of the long-arm statute.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [10]  In fact, in its amended answer to the complaint, CSX admitted that \r\n    it â€œdoes business in South Carolina.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [11]    This evidence was presented in the form of answers to interrogatories.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [12]  In fact, at trial, Whaley \r\n    presented the testimony of eleven witnesses by video deposition, instead of \r\n    by live testimony, in Hampton County.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [13]  At oral argument before this Court, Whaleyâ€™s counsel was asked the \r\n    following question: â€œWhy was this suit brought in Hampton County?â€Â  Counsel \r\n    answered, â€œIt was brought there because weâ€™re the lawyers.â€Â  Later, counsel \r\n    modified his answer, stating that the suit was brought in Hampton County because \r\n    â€œweâ€™re the lawyer and they [CSX] are residents there.â€Â  In either case, the \r\n    location of a lawyerâ€™s office should not enter into the analysis of whether \r\n    a defendant resides in a particular county for purposes of venue.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [14]  We note that FELA does not impose a duty on railroads to provide \r\n    employees with air-conditioned locomotives. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. \r\n    Denson, 774 So.2d 549, 556 (Ala. 2000).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [15]  CSX raised this argument several times throughout the trial, and \r\n    the trial judge ruled that the argument failed as a matter of law.Â  Because \r\n    CSX will likely raise this preemption argument on remand, we address the merits \r\n    of this argument in the interest of judicial economy.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [16]  The record does contain the contents of a side bar in which CSX \r\n    objected to Dr. Collinsâ€™s testimony based on hearsay, not based on the grounds \r\n    raised in this appeal. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [17]  The concurrence makes the technical procedural point that the case \r\n    should be remanded to Hampton County, instead of Greenwood County, without \r\n    prejudice to CSXâ€™s right to renew its motion to change venue.Â  First, in remanding \r\n    this case, we direct the remittitur to be sent to the trial court in Hampton \r\n    County, where, by order of this Court, the case will be transferred to Greenwood \r\n    County.Â  Second, in light of todayâ€™s opinion, we do not think it is necessary \r\n    for CSX to renew its motion to change venue, as suggested in the concurring \r\n    opinion.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [18]  In my view, the case must be remanded to Hampton \r\n    County, without prejudice to CSXâ€™s right to renew its motion to change venue. \r\n    See State v. Hunter, 82 S.C. 152, 63 S.E. 685 (1909) (remittitur \r\n    returned to county where appeal from venue order originated).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25936","title":"Greenwood County Council v.

Watson, Jr., of Watson Law Firm, of Greenwood, for Petitioner.\r\nJon Eric Newlon, of The McCravy &amp; Newton Law Firm, P.A., of Greenwood, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â Â  This case was filed in the original jurisdiction \r\n  of the Court seeking a declaratory judgmentÂ  determining whether the Greenwood \r\n  County Council (County) had the authority to reduce the salary ofÂ  an Interim \r\n  Clerk of Court.Â  We find the County did not have the authority to reduce the \r\n  salary of an Interim Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999, Louise Davis (Davis), with twenty-eight (28) years \r\n  experience in the Clerkâ€™s Office, was appointed the Interim Clerk of Court for \r\n  County.Â  Davis notified the County Manager that she expected the same pay as \r\n  her predecessor and the County complied.Â Â  In November 2000, Davis was elected \r\n  as Clerk of Court.Â  On June 30, 2003, Davis retired.Â  She was earning $46,592.00 \r\n  at the time of her retirement.Â  On the same day, the County passed its budget \r\n  for the fiscal year 2003-2004 and reduced the salary for the Clerk of Court \r\n  position to $35,000.Â  \r\nOn August 6, 2003, Governor Mark Sanford appointed Emmett \r\n  Brooks (Brooks) as the Clerk of Court to serve the remainder of Davisâ€™ term \r\n  until January 1, 2005. [1]  Apparently, Governor Sanford, \r\n  unaware of the salary reduction in the Countyâ€™s budget, informed Brooks that \r\n  he would receive the same salary that Davis had received before she retired.Â  \r\n  After accepting the appointment, Brooks was informed the salary would be only \r\n  $35,000.Â  \r\nThe County brought this action seeking a determination of \r\n  whether it had the authority to reduce the Clerk of Courtâ€™s salary.Â  Brooks \r\n  answered and counterclaimed. Â Brooks and the County subsequently settled and \r\n  as part of the agreement, Brooks resigned. In July 2004, the Governor appointed \r\n  the current Interim Clerk of Court, Ingram Moon (Moon), and the Court ordered \r\n  Moon added as a party to this action. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the County have the authority to reduce the salary of \r\n  the Interim Clerks of Court? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe County contends it was not prohibited from reducing \r\n  the salary of the Interim Clerks of Court.Â  Two code sections are applicable \r\n  to this issue. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-21-300 (Supp. 2003) provides, in pertinent \r\n  part: â€œThe clerks of court and registers of deeds of the several counties shall \r\n  receive such salaries for performance of their duties as may be fixed by the \r\n  governing body of the county, which shall not be diminished during their \r\n  terms of office . . . â€œ (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAdditionally, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-30(7) (Supp. 2003) provides \r\n  the county with the authority:Â  \r\n\r\nto develop personnel system policies and procedures for \r\n  county employees by which all county employees are regulated except those \r\n  elected directly by the people, and to be responsible for the employment \r\n  and discharge of county personnel in those county departments in which the employment \r\n  authority is vested in the county government. This employment and discharge \r\n  authority does not extend to any personnel employed in departments or agencies \r\n  under the direction of an elected official or an official appointed by an \r\n  authority outside county government. . . .The salary of those officials \r\n  elected by the people may be increased but may not be reduced during the \r\n  terms for which they are electedÂ  . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nSection 4-9-30(7) prohibits the reduction of a salary â€œduring the term for \r\n  which the official is electedâ€ and Â§ 8-21-300 prohibits a salary reduction during \r\n  an elected officialâ€™s â€œterm of office.â€ \r\n  [3] Â Â  \r\nThere are no South Carolina cases addressing whether the salary of an interim \r\n  official appointed to fill an unexpired term can be reduced.Â  However, there \r\n  have been several Attorney General Opinions which have concluded that the salary \r\n  may not be reduced during the unexpired term of the office.Â  1985 Op. Atty. \r\n  Gen., No. 85-107. [4] Â Â  Furthermore, several cases \r\n  from other jurisdictions have also addressed similar prohibitions and held that \r\n  the phrase â€œterms of officeâ€ means the unexpired term of the previously elected \r\n  official.Â  Lee v. Peach Cty. Bd. Of Commâ€™rs, 497 S.E.2d 562 (Ga. 1998); \r\n  McKesson v. Lowery, 335 P.2d 662 (Ca. 1959).Â  \r\nOne of the purposes behind legislation which prohibits salary changes during \r\n  an elected officialâ€™s term is to establish certainty as to the salary and to \r\n  prevent elected officials from using undue influence to secure salary increases.Â  \r\n  McKesson, 335 P.2d at 663.Â  Further, increases should be enacted for \r\n  the benefit of the office and not for the immediate benefit of the particular \r\n  person holding that office.Â  State v. Oklahoma Corp. Commâ€™n, 971 P.2d \r\n  868, 871 n 4 (Okla. 1998)(internal citations omitted). The salary pertaining \r\n  to an office is an incident to the office itself and not to the individual who \r\n  holds the office. Gaffney v. Mallory, 186 S. C. 337, 341, 195 S. E. 840, \r\n  844 (1938).Â  Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that sections 4-9-30 and \r\n  8-21-300 prohibit County from reducing an elected officialâ€™s salary during the \r\n  terms for which they are elected.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that County did not have the authority to reduce the salary \r\n  for an Interim Clerk of Court.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Kenneth G. Goode, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Probate Judge Frank Addy served the brief interim \r\n    between Davisâ€™ retirement and the Governorâ€™s appointment.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Moon won in Novemberâ€™s general election and her \r\n    elected term of office begins in January 2005. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The County contends that the enactment of Â§ 4-9-30(7) \r\n    in 1987 repealed by implication Â§ 8-21-300 and that Clerks of Court now are \r\n    covered only by Â§ 4-9-30(7).Â  Repeal by implication is not favored and can \r\n    be found only where no reasonable construction can be given to two statutes, \r\n    other than that they are in irreconcilable conflict with each other.Â  Johnston \r\n    v. City of Myrtle Beach, 283 S.C. 288, 290, 321 S.E.2d 627, 628 (Ct. App. \r\n    1984).Â  We find these two statutes are not irreconcilable and thus Â§ 4-9-30 \r\n    was not repealed by implication when Â§ 8-21-300 was enacted.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] In fact, the Attorney General has issued several \r\n    opinions in this case concluding that County impermissibly reduced the salary \r\n    for the Interim Clerk of Court.Â  2003 WL 22682936; 2003 WL 22422699; and 2003 \r\n    WL 22682935 (S.C.A.G.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25937","title":"In the Matter of Judge Hudson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25937","description":"In this opinion, the Court publicly reprimanded a municipal court judge.","date":"2005-02-07","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      In the Matter of Former Myrtle Beach Associate Municipal Court\r\n      Judge Phillip W.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n  General Robert E. Bogan, both of Columbia, for The Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\r\nThomas C. Brittain, of Myrtle Beach, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a \r\n  public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b)(3), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR. \r\n  [1] Â  In addition, respondent agrees not to seek or accept any judicial \r\n  position in South Carolina without permission of the Court.Â  The facts as set \r\n  forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was a part-time associate municipal court judge \r\n  for the City of Myrtle Beach.Â  In addition, respondent was a part-time instructor \r\n  at Horry-Georgetown Technical College.Â  On March 12, 2004, a Myrtle Beach Police \r\n  Officer issued two traffic tickets to one of respondentâ€™s students.Â  Traffic \r\n  court for the charges was scheduled for March 23, 2004.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he engaged in ex parte communication with \r\n  the student about the tickets.Â  As a result of these communications, respondent \r\n  marked certain court records falsely to show the disposition of one ticket as \r\n  â€œdismiss per officerâ€ and the other as â€œdismissed proof.â€Â  As a further result \r\n  of respondentâ€™s ex parte communications with the student, the student paid respondent \r\n  $252.00 in two payments on April 1 and April 3, 2004.Â  The student thought the \r\n  payments were for traffic fines.Â  These payments were made in cash outside the \r\n  proper procedure for remitting payment of fines.Â  \r\nRespondent did not issue a receipt to the student, did not \r\n  remit the money to the municipal court, and, instead, commingled the money with \r\n  his own.Â  Respondent represents it was his intention to remit the money to the \r\n  municipal court but that he was unable to do so prior to being contacted by \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel on April 7, 2004.Â  \r\nOn at least five prior occasions, respondent accepted money \r\n  from citizens in his official capacity without properly accounting for it.Â  \r\n  On these occasions, he converted the money to other purposes.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges he received a painting from a litigantâ€™s \r\n  husband on the same day the litigant appeared in court before him; respondent \r\n  suspended the litigantâ€™s $796.00 fine.Â  Respondent represented he believed the \r\n  painting was a gift to the municipal court, not to himself.Â  The painting remained \r\n  in respondentâ€™s office.Â  ODC can neither confirm nor dispute respondentâ€™s representation.Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 31, 2003, two defendants appeared before respondent \r\n  for a bond hearing on charges of leaving the scene of an accident involving \r\n  death.Â  Respondent set a $25,000 surety bond for each defendant.Â  \r\n Respondent engaged in an ex parte conversation with counsel \r\n  for one defendant after the hearing.Â  As a result of the ex parte conversation, \r\n  respondent changed both defendantsâ€™ bonds to personal recognizance without holding \r\n  another hearing or notifying the victimâ€™s family members.Â  Respondent represents \r\n  he believed the family members had been notified by the Victimâ€™s Advocate.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondentâ€™s term of office expired during the pendency \r\n  of the disciplinary matters referenced herein.Â  He was not reappointed.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall \r\n  uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety \r\n  and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall \r\n  respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that \r\n  promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); \r\n  Canon 2B (judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships \r\n  to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall \r\n  perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3B(7) \r\n  (judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte \r\n  communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the \r\n  presence of the parties concerning a pending proceeding);

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert E. Bogan, Assistant \r\n  Deputy Attorney General, both of Columbia, for The Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\r\nCharlie J. Johnson, Jr., and John T. Mobley, both of \r\n  Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into two Agreements \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In Agreement \r\n  #1, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a letter \r\n  of caution, admonition, or public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule \r\n  502, SCACR.Â  We accept Agreement #1 and impose a public reprimand.Â  In Agreement \r\n  #2, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition, \r\n  public reprimand, or a definite suspension not to exceed thirty (30) days pursuant \r\n  to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept Agreement #2 and impose a definite \r\n  suspension of thirty (30) days.Â  The facts as set forth in the Agreements are \r\n  as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAGREEMENT #1\r\nI.\r\nRespondent is a Richland County Magistrate.Â  Plaintiff A \r\n  filed a civil complaint in respondentâ€™s magisterial office on January 12, 2001.Â  \r\n  She alleges she was advised by the receptionist at respondentâ€™s office that \r\n  trial would be in about three or four weeks and that she would be notified by \r\n  mail.Â  \r\nPlaintiff A alleges she contacted respondentâ€™s office \r\n  in mid-February and was told the defendant had been served on January 19, 2001, \r\n  that a hearing would be scheduled within two weeks, and that she would receive \r\n  a letter soon.Â  Plaintiff A alleges she called respondentâ€™s office in March \r\n  and left a message that was not returned.Â  Plaintiff A alleges she called respondentâ€™s \r\n  office again in April, was told respondent was busy â€œfilling in for other judges \r\n  downtown,â€ that he would be back to his regular schedule soon, and she would \r\n  hear something shortly.Â  \r\nOn August 29, 2001, Plaintiff A complained by letter to \r\n  the Chief Magistrate about respondentâ€™s failure to set the matter for trial \r\n  and respondentâ€™s lack of response to her inquiries.Â  In the letter, respondent \r\n  asked to transfer the matter to another magistrate or for a refund of her $55.00 \r\n  filing fee if transfer to another magistrate could not be arranged.Â  \r\nThe Chief Magistrate contacted respondent about Plaintiff \r\n  A.Â  Respondent discovered that Plaintiff Aâ€™s complaint was inadvertently marked \r\n  by court staff to indicate that the defendant requested a jury trial and the \r\n  complaint was thereafter placed in the jury trial cabinet to await its turn \r\n  for placement on the jury docket.Â  Respondent also represents that, at that \r\n  time, cases placed on the jury roster generally took eighteen months to reach \r\n  a trial, which was the cause of the delay in Plaintiff Aâ€™s case.Â  \r\nRespondent further explains that none of his office staff \r\n  remember receiving any inquiries from Plaintiff A and that he was not made aware \r\n  of Plaintiff Aâ€™s communications, if any were made as she alleges.Â  While respondent \r\n  cannot confirm the representations made by Plaintiff A, for purposes of Agreement \r\n  #1, they are not contested.Â  \r\nPlaintiff Aâ€™s matter was subsequently assigned to another \r\n  magistrate and has been resolved.Â  \r\nII.\r\nIn October 2000, Ronald L. Hall, Esquire, filed a complaint \r\n  in respondentâ€™s court on behalf of Plaintiff B against Defendant B concerning \r\n  a $2,250.00 check Defendant B wrote to a third party and which the third party \r\n  subsequently signed over to Plaintiff B.Â  According to the complaint, the check \r\n  was returned for insufficient funds. \r\nBy January 2001, Mr. Hall had not heard anything further \r\n  about the matter and contacted respondentâ€™s office by letter dated January 8, \r\n  2001, but received no response.Â  In February 2001, Mr. Hall was informed that \r\n  the file may have been misplaced in respondentâ€™s office; Mr. Hall mailed respondent \r\n  another copy of the Summons and Complaint.Â  Respondent represents to ODC that \r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department lost the paperwork after it was sent to be served.Â  \r\n\r\nBy letter dated March 19, 2001, respondent made further \r\n  inquiry about the status of the case.Â  Respondent executed another Summons dated \r\n  March 30, 2001.Â  \r\nDefendant B was served on April 6, 2001, and, according \r\n  to respondentâ€™s files, filed an Answer on April 30, 2001, alleging the check \r\n  was returned in error and that a replacement check was issued to Plaintiff B.Â  \r\n  Defendant Bâ€™s Answer was not served on Mr. Hall.Â  \r\nOn May 8, 2001, Mr. Hall wrote respondent stating he had \r\n  been informed by his client that the matter might be set for a hearing on the \r\n  merits around June 1, 2001.Â  A bench trial was held on June 15, 2001.Â  At the \r\n  hearing, Mr. Hall was not aware that Defendant B had answered and he objected \r\n  to Defendant B being allowed to contest the case on the merits.Â  After hearing \r\n  the evidence, which included that Defendant B issued a replacement check and \r\n  that Plaintiff B had negotiated both checks, respondent took the matter under \r\n  advisement.Â  \r\nIn June and July, Mr. Hall inquired about when respondent \r\n  would issue a ruling.Â  Mr. Hallâ€™s letter of July 16, 2001, states:Â  â€œI do note \r\n  that we never received a copy of the Answer of [Defendant B]; and therefore \r\n  presumed he was in default.Â  If this is incorrect, I would appreciate receiving \r\n  a copy of [Defendant Bâ€™s] Answer for my file.â€Â  Respondent did not answer this \r\n  correspondence.Â  Respondent states it is his recollection that Mr. Hall was \r\n  shown Defendant Bâ€™s Answer during the hearing on June 15, 2001.Â  \r\nMr. Hall wrote respondent on August 8, 2001, stating he \r\n  understood from contacts with respondentâ€™s office that respondentâ€™s busy schedule \r\n  had kept him from ruling on this matter.Â  Mr. Hall included a proposed transcript \r\n  of judgment.Â  Respondent did not answer this correspondence.Â  \r\nOn September 10, 2001, Mr. Hall complained to Chief Magistrate \r\n  Womble about respondentâ€™s handling of this case.Â  Judge Womble contacted respondent \r\n  by telephone.Â  The same day, respondent issued a ruling in favor of Defendant \r\n  B.Â  \r\nMr. Hall alleged in his complaint to ODC that the ruling \r\n  in favor of Defendant B appeared to be retaliation against him for complaining \r\n  to the Chief Magistrate.Â  Respondent represented to ODC that his ruling had \r\n  actually been prepared in July, but had not been published, and that Judge Wombleâ€™s \r\n  call reminded him of the ruling.Â  Respondent denied his ruling was issued in \r\n  retaliation for Mr. Hallâ€™s complaint.\r\nMr. Hall appealed respondentâ€™s ruling to the circuit court.Â  \r\n  As of March 1, 2002, respondent had not submitted a return.Â  On March 2, 2002, \r\n  Judge Manning issued an order stating respondent had thirty (30) days to submit \r\n  a return or provide the tape recording of the proceedings to Mr. Hall for transcription.Â  \r\n  If the return was not prepared within thirty (30) days, the case would be remanded \r\n  to the Chief Magistrate to determine whether a new trial would be necessary.Â  \r\n\r\nThe tape of the proceedings in Magistrateâ€™s Court was unavailable.Â  \r\n  Respondent states it was re-used in the normal course of court activity.Â  \r\nThe matter was ultimately remanded back to the Chief Magistrate.Â  \r\n  A new trial was held and judgment for Plaintiff B was entered.Â  \r\nRespondent explains he did not respond to Mr. Hallâ€™s correspondence \r\n  because it was placed directly in the file by his staff.Â  He has corrected his \r\n  office practices to ensure that all correspondence comes to his desk before \r\n  being placed in the file.Â  \r\nAGREEMENT #2\r\nI.\r\nOn the evening of Saturday, April 14, 2001, Defendant C \r\n  allegedly struck Victim in the head with a handgun while the Victim was visiting \r\n  Defendant Câ€™s residence.Â  The incident is alleged to have occurred in connection \r\n  with Defendant C accusing Victim of having an affair with Defendant Câ€™s wife \r\n  as Victim was trying to leave the premises. \r\nVictimâ€™s Mother is a friend of respondent and his wife and \r\n  attends the same church as respondent.Â  Victimâ€™s Mother approached respondent \r\n  at church the next day about issuing a warrant for Defendant C who is respondentâ€™s \r\n  third cousin.Â  Respondent instructed Victimâ€™s Mother to come to his office the \r\n  next day and apply for a warrant.Â  \r\nThe next morning, Victim and Victimâ€™s Mother appeared at \r\n  respondentâ€™s office to apply for a warrant against Defendant C.Â  Certain paperwork \r\n  necessary for issuance of the warrant was completed and respondent indicated \r\n  he would issue an arrest warrant against Defendant C for assault and battery \r\n  of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).&nbsp; \r\nRespondent estimates that approximately two hours later, \r\n  Defendant C appeared at respondentâ€™s office inquiring whether a warrant had \r\n  been issued for his arrest.Â  Upon being informed that a warrant was being prepared, \r\n  Defendant C inquired about obtaining a warrant against Victim for trespassing \r\n  and asked respondent whether Victim might drop the warrant if he paid the medical \r\n  bills.Â  Respondent declined to issue the â€œcross warrantâ€ and told Defendant \r\n  C he had no control over whether Victim would drop the ABHAN warrant.Â  \r\nRespondent reports that Victimâ€™s Mother called on \r\n  Tuesday to determine whether the warrant had been issued.Â  Respondent informed \r\n  her it was still being prepared and told her Defendant C had been to the office \r\n  to seek a warrant against her son for trespassing.Â  Respondent reports that \r\n  Victimâ€™s Mother said something to the effect of â€œhold up on the warrantâ€ and \r\n  she would call him back.Â  Respondent further states that Victimâ€™s Mother called \r\n  back the next day and said go forward with the warrant.Â  \r\nVictimâ€™s Motherâ€™s recollection of what appears to \r\n  be the same conversation is somewhat different.Â  She reports receiving a telephone \r\n  call at her home from respondent.Â  Based on this conversation, Victimâ€™s Mother \r\n  believed respondent had talked with Defendant C prior to this phone call.Â  Victimâ€™s \r\n  Motherâ€™s recollection is that respondent indicated Defendant C may have been \r\n  justified in assaulting Victim and it is her perception that respondent might \r\n  have been suggesting the warrant against Defendant C be dropped.Â  \r\nRespondent testified in his interview under oath that the warrant was signed \r\n  on Wednesday or Thursday (April 18 or 19) and â€œwent outâ€ on Friday (April 20).Â  \r\n  It is customary that warrants are picked up at least once a day and usually \r\n  twice a day from respondentâ€™s office by deputies assigned to the sheriffâ€™s warrant \r\n  division.Â  Victimâ€™s signature is purported to have been affixed to the typed \r\n  warrant on April 16, 2001.Â  \r\nSometime on Saturday or Sunday (April 21 or 22), Defendant C called respondent \r\n  at home and stated he wanted to turn himself in to authorities.Â  Defendant C \r\n  sought instructions from respondent on how toÂ  do so without interfering with \r\n  Defendant Câ€™s work schedule and respondent instructed Defendant C to turn himself \r\n  in at the jail at 2:00 p.m. on Monday so he could attend the 4:00 p.m. bond \r\n  hearing.Â  Respondent had further conversation with Defendant C about the facts \r\n  and merits of the matter.Â  \r\nOn Monday, respondent contacted the sheriffâ€™s warrant division, advised Defendant \r\n  C would turn himself in that afternoon, and said he would like to get the warrant \r\n  and take it to the jail where Defendant C would turn himself in.Â  The Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department returned the warrant to respondent and respondent delivered it to \r\n  bond court at the detention center around noon.Â  Respondent believes this is \r\n  the first time he ever retrieved a warrant from the warrant division so that \r\n  someone could turn himself or herself in to authorities.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt some point later that day, respondent telephoned Magistrate Hudnell who \r\n  was scheduled to hold 4:00 p.m. bond hearings.Â  Knowing Magistrate Hudnell had \r\n  set a high bond of $35,000 in another case a week earlier and wanting to be \r\n  sure appropriate bond would be set in Defendant Câ€™s matter, respondent contacted \r\n  Magistrate Hudnell to inform her that Defendant C would be a â€œwalk-inâ€ for the \r\n  4:00 p.m. bond hearing, that Defendant C was respondentâ€™s cousin, that respondent \r\n  knew the Victim from church and the neighborhood, and asked Magistrate Hudnell \r\n  to â€œgive [Defendant C] a low surety bond and ten percent.â€Â  Respondent also \r\n  relayed the version of the facts and circumstances underlying the warrant as \r\n  given to him by Defendant C to Magistrate Hudnell.Â  According to Magistrate \r\n  Hudnell, respondent said he had also told Defendant C he probably would get \r\n  a low bond.Â  Respondent represents to ODC that it is not unusual for a magistrate \r\n  who has information about a case to contact the bond court magistrate and give \r\n  a bond suggestion.Â  \r\nDefendant C was present for the 4:00 p.m. bond hearing, but the warrant had \r\n  not been served, he had not been booked into the jail, and Victim had not been \r\n  contacted.Â  Defendant C was booked into the detention center to await a bond \r\n  hearing the next morning (April 24).Â  On April 24, Magistrate Hudnell set Defendant \r\n  Câ€™s bond at $7,500.00.Â  Defendant C was able to make bond that same day.Â  Five \r\n  days later, Defendant C murdered his wife.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes and acknowledges it was outside the scope of his \r\n  authority to become involved in effectuating or arranging Defendant Câ€™s arrest \r\n  and that, in doing so, he was using his judicial office for the benefit of another \r\n  and his conduct was indicative of bias.Â  Respondent now recognizes and acknowledges \r\n  that it was inappropriate to have had ex parte conversations with Victimâ€™s Mother \r\n  once the warrant was issued, to try to influence the amount of bond set by Magistrate \r\n  Hudnell, and to discuss Defendant Câ€™s version of events with Magistrate Hudnell.Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nRespondent presided over civil proceedings where Plaintiff \r\n  D was granted a judgment for $4,080.11 plus court costs against Defendant D \r\n  for telephone calls Defendant D made on Plaintiff Dâ€™s cell phone.Â  Plaintiff \r\n  D later came before respondent complaining Defendant D had not satisfied the \r\n  judgment.Â  Respondent told Defendant D, a dancer, to get a â€œregular job,â€ and \r\n  told the parties he did not want to see them in court again.Â  \r\nPlaintiff D later came before respondent complaining Defendant \r\n  D had not satisfied the judgment.Â  A hearing was convened.Â  Defendant D informed \r\n  the court that she had not paid the judgment, that she had enrolled in training \r\n  classes, and that she would be paid while in training.Â  Respondent concluded \r\n  the hearing by stating, â€œAlright, well you didnâ€™t do what I asked you to do \r\n  and I have no other choice.Â  I have no choice but to cite you for contempt and \r\n  send you to jail for thirty days or you can pay a $500 fine.Â  Iâ€™m sorry, maâ€™am.Â  \r\n  And when you get out you are still going to owe this money.Â  Good day.â€ [1] Â  \r\nRespondent stated in his interview under oath that he held \r\n  Defendant D in contempt because she failed to get a job as he ordered, not because \r\n  she failed to pay the judgment.Â  Respondent further stated in the interview \r\n  that it was his intention to only leave Defendant D in jail for three or four \r\n  days, but forgot about her until the Chief Magistrate called him about the matter \r\n  five or six days later, after which he had Defendant D released.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes that he lacked authority to order \r\n  Defendant D to get a job, that he lacked authority to hold Defendant D in contempt \r\n  for failing to get a job or failing to pay a judgment, that the sentence for \r\n  contempt was without legal authority, and, as a result of the foregoing, he \r\n  was not faithful to the law.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nOn June 21, 2001, Defendant E was arrested by a state trooper \r\n  on charges of driving under the influence (DUI), simple possession of marijuana, \r\n  and violation of the seat belt law.Â  Defendant E is the son of the office manager \r\n  for Richland County Magistrate Golie Augustus. The tickets were scheduled to \r\n  be tried on July 19, 2001 before Richland County Magistrate Harold A. Cuff.\r\nCourt personnel report that on July 19, 2001, the trooper \r\n  appeared in magistrateâ€™s court and asked to mark the DUI ticket as nolle prossed. \r\n  [2] Â  Court personnel told the trooper they could not honor the request \r\n  and the trooper left the building, stating he had to go to his car.Â  Court personnel \r\n  report that, after being seen in the court parking lot with Magistrate Augustus \r\n  and another person looking at the engine of a car, the trooper returned to the \r\n  magistrateâ€™s office and stated Defendant E wanted a jury trial. \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nCourt personnel further report the trooper saying respondent \r\n  called him â€œabout a month agoâ€ concerning these charges.Â  The trooper opined \r\n  that the cases would probably be transferred to Magistrate Peay and dismissed.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges discussing the pending charges with \r\n  the trooper after traffic court one day.Â  At the time, the trooper stated he \r\n  planned to â€œtake careâ€ of all charges except the simple possession of marijuana \r\n  charge.Â  Respondent represents this contact was an inquiry about the charges \r\n  and certain procedures (specifically, how someone could be charged with DUI \r\n  if he blew a zero on the datamaster) and denies that any attempt was made to \r\n  persuade or influence the trooper not to prosecute the charges.Â  These discussions \r\n  occurred outside the presence of Defendant E.Â  \r\nRespondent also acknowledges having discussed the pending \r\n  charges, including the possibility of obtaining a conditional discharge, with \r\n  Defendant E outside the presence of the trooper.Â  Respondent acknowledges being \r\n  at Central Court on other matters on the day Defendant Eâ€™s charges were to be \r\n  heard by Magistrate Cuff and approaching Magistrate Cuff to inform him that \r\n  Defendant E would plead guilty to simple possession of marijuana and request \r\n  a conditional discharge.Â  \r\nMagistrate Cuff confirmed that respondent visited him on \r\n  July 19, 2001, shortly before these matters were to be heard.Â  Magistrate Cuff \r\n  reported that, during this visit, respondent stated the trooper called respondent \r\n  and told him he would drop the DUI and enter a conditional discharge of the \r\n  possession of marijuana case.Â  According to Magistrate Cuff, respondent did \r\n  not request or instruct him to handle the matter a certain way.Â  \r\nODC is informed that the matters were ultimately assigned \r\n  to a Lexington County Magistrate, that the DUI charge was nolle prossed by the \r\n  trooper, the simple possession charge was conditionally discharged, and Defendant \r\n  E was given a one day suspended sentence on the seat belt charge.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes and acknowledges that his ex parte \r\n  conversations with Defendant E and the trooper were inappropriate and constitute \r\n  judicial misconduct.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, \r\n  maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe \r\n  those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will \r\n  be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of \r\n  impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with \r\n  the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence \r\n  in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B ( judge shall \r\n  not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the \r\n  judgeâ€™s judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties \r\n  of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3(A) (judgeâ€™s judicial \r\n  duties take precedence over all of judgeâ€™s other activities); Canon 3B(2) (judge \r\n  shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon \r\n  3(B)(7) (judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications); \r\n  Canon 3B(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, \r\n  and fairly); Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall require staff to observe standard of \r\n  fidelity and diligence that apply to judge); and Canon 3(E)(judge shall disqualify \r\n  himself in a proceeding in which the judgeâ€™s impartiality might be reasonably \r\n  questioned).Â  By violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has also \r\n  violated Rule 7(a)(1)( it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate \r\n  Code of Judicial Conduct) and 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for \r\n  judge to consistently fail to timely issue orders, decrees, opinions or otherwise \r\n  perform official duties without just cause or excuse) of the Rules for Judicial \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct as set forth in Agreement \r\n  #1 warrants a public reprimand.Â  We find respondentâ€™s misconduct as set forth \r\n  in Agreement #2 warrants a thirty (30) day suspension from judicial duties.Â  \r\n  We therefore accept the two Agreements for Discipline by Consent and hereby \r\n  publicly reprimand respondent and suspend him from his judicial duties for thirty \r\n  (30) days.Â Â Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND;

Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-766 (Supp. 2004). The Department of Social Services (DSS) sought to have the family court adopt a permanent plan which, based on previous findings of abuse and/or neglect against appellant, appellant&rsquo;s failure to complete treatment goals, and his current incarceration for violation of probation relating to an earlier drug conviction, provides that (1) Appellant shall have no visitation or contact with the eight minor children until he has completed all previously ordered treatment goals and petitions the family court for a change in visitation and contact provisions; (2) Appellant shall pay Defendant Melissa Downer child support; (3) DSS is relieved of providing services to Appellant; (4) all cases consolidated for purposes of the hearing and order shall close on December 6, 2004 unless any party files an objection to case closure prior to that date; and (5) on December 6, 2004, all appointed counsel and the children&rsquo;s guardian ad litem shall be relieved of further duty or obligation in this case. By order dated October 18, 2004, the family court adopted the plan with one modification that Appellant begin paying child support fourteen days after he is released from jail.\r\n \r\n Counsel for Appellant filed a notice of appeal. He also filed a &ldquo;Motion to be Relieved as Counsel or in the alternative Petition for Guidance from the Court of Whether to Proceed Under Cauthen&rdquo;. [1] Therein, counsel states Appellant directed him to file an appeal from the family court order. Counsel moves to be relieved as counsel. In the alternative, he petitions for guidance as to whether a Cauthen affidavit would be appropriate since he is &ldquo;unable to find any guiding authority on this issue.&rdquo; \r\n \r\n The Court of Appeals has now submitted the case to this Court for possible certification under Rule 204(b), SCACR, to resolve the issue of whether the procedure set forth in Ex parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987), to be followed when an indigent person appeals from an order terminating his parental rights, can also be used when an indigent person appeals from an order imposing other measures based on child abuse and neglect, such as in the case at hand. \r\n \r\n We hereby certify this appeal to this Court for the sole purpose of ruling on counsel&rsquo;s motion and providing guidance as to whether the procedure set forth in Cauthen can be used in other appeals involving the removal of a child from the custody of an indigent parent based on child abuse and neglect. We deny counsel&rsquo;s motion to be relieved as counsel; however, we expand the procedure set forth in Cauthen to situations, such as the one at hand, where an indigent person appeals from an order imposing other measures short of termination of parental rights, such as removal, based on child abuse and neglect. Accordingly, counsel may follow the procedure set forth in Cauthen, as he has done up to this point, in perfecting this appeal. Having made this determination, we hereby transfer this appeal back to the Court of Appeals. \r\n \r\n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.

Marvin Mullis, Jr., of Mullis Law Firm, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Fields v. Regional Medical Center Orangeburg, 354 S.C. 445, 581 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nVergie Fields (Plaintiff) brought this wrongful death action against Physician and Regional Medical Center Orangeburg (RMC), alleging negligence and medical malpractice in failing to diagnose a heart condition suffered by her husband, Thomas Edison Fields (Decedent), and admit him to RMC.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the jury verdict for Physician and RMC and granted Plaintiff a new trial.[1]\r\nPlaintiff took Decedent, age 49, to RMCâ€™s emergency room when he began suffering chest pain which radiated into both arms on the afternoon of September 14, 1994.Â  Decedent was examined, his history and past records were reviewed, he was placed on a heart monitor, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) test of his heart revealed no abnormalities.Â  Decedent suffered from previously diagnosed conditions of chronic back pain, caused by a 1976 employment-related injury which left him totally disabled, and a hiatal hernia and gastrointestinal reflux.Â  Decedent was given medication to relieve pain, told to follow up with his physician and sent home. \r\nPlaintiff again took Decedent to RMCâ€™s emergency room at about 3 a.m. on September 18, 1994, after he awoke with severe chest pain radiating into both arms.Â  Physician, who was on duty in the emergency room, testified he examined Decedent and reviewed past records which showed Decedentâ€™s history as a smoker, complaints of chest pain in past years, and past hospital admissions for mental health issues.Â  Physician reviewed previous EKG and heart test results, including a heart catheterization in 1993 and the visit four days earlier, none of which revealed any heart condition. \r\nPhysician testified he placed Decedent on a heart monitor and performed an EKG which showed no abnormalities.Â  Decedent stated his chest pain was similar to past instances, but worse.Â  He was crying and upset.Â  Physician gave Decedent the same pain medications he had received previously for the hiatal hernia and reflux, conditions which also may cause chest pain.Â  Physician diagnosed Decedent with histrionics[2] and chronic pain, told him to follow up with his doctor, and discharged him at 3:50 a.m.Â  Physician denied his diagnosis was substantially affected by an emergency room nurse who told him Decedent, her uncle, was â€œcrazyâ€ and possibly seeking drugs, but instead was based primarily on Decedentâ€™s medical history, the current exam and normal EKG test.\r\nPlaintiff testified Decedentâ€™s chest pains worsened after leaving RMC and she drove her husband to a Columbia hospital.Â  There, Decedent suffered a documented heart attack about an hour after leaving RMC.Â  Decedent was transferred to another Columbia hospital the same day, where he underwent an emergency heart catheterization.Â  Decedent died after his right coronary artery was dissected during the operation, which is a known risk of the procedure.Â  An autopsy revealed Decedent suffered from severe coronary artery disease.\r\nPlaintiff alleged that, had Physician properly diagnosed Decedent with potential coronary artery disease and realized a heart attack might be imminent, Decedent would have been admitted to RMC, probably would have been given thrombolytic (â€œclot-bustingâ€) medications when he suffered his heart attack, and would not have undergone the emergency procedure which resulted in his death.Â  Plaintiff presented evidence, including the testimony of two expert witnesses, of Physicianâ€™s medical malpractice in failing to have Decedent examined by a heart specialist and admitted to RMC; in failing to adequately investigate and consider Decedentâ€™s medical and family history and past episodes of similar chest pain; in failing to perform additional tests and monitoring; and in concluding Decedent was simply hysterical or exaggerating his symptoms. \r\nPhysician contended his examination and treatment of Decedent met the requisite standard of care.Â  Physician and his expert in emergency medicine testified Physician adequately reviewed Decedentâ€™s medical history, which included several instances in which Decedent had complained of chest pain and undergone heart-related tests which did not reveal any heart disease or impairment.Â  Physician presented evidence Decedent had suffered from a variety of physical and psychiatric ailments and made numerous trips to RMCâ€™s emergency room.Â  Physician also presented the testimony of Decedentâ€™s regular physician, his psychiatrist, and the cardiologist who performed the 1993 heart catheterization which revealed no significant abnormalities.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in denying Physicianâ€™s motion to dismiss Plaintiffâ€™s appeal as untimely?\r\n  II.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the juryâ€™s verdict based on the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of testimony regarding the qualifications of Plaintiffâ€™s expert witness?\r\n  III.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the juryâ€™s verdict based on the trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow Plaintiff to use a medical treatise to cross-examine Physician?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nQualification of an expert and the admission or exclusion of his testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Similarly, the admission or exclusion of evidence in general is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  In both instances, the trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Pike v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000); Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997); Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 166, 558 S.E.2d 921, 923 (Ct. App. 2001). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1991); Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair.Â  Means, 348 S.C. at 166, 558 S.E.2d at 924. \r\nTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997); Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commn., 254 S.C. 378, 405, 175 S.E.2d 805, 819 (1970); Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 160, 156 S.E.2d 759, 764 (1967).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL\r\nPhysician contends the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffâ€™s appeal because Plaintiff failed to timely serve the notice of appeal on the opposing parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the end of the trial on March 30, 2000, Plaintiff requested ten days to file a new trial motion, as provided in Rule 59(b), SCRCP.Â  The trial judge denied the request, stating he would prefer to consider any motions immediately while the case and issues were still fresh in his mind.Â  Plaintiff then asserted, in a one-sentence statement, that the trial courtâ€™s previous evidentiary rulings constituted reversible error.Â  The trial judge denied the oral motion.Â  \r\nSeven days later, Plaintiff filed a written motion for a new trial, citing Rule 59, SCRCP.Â  Plaintiff asserted that, inter alia, the trial judge erred in excluding testimony about her expert witnessâ€™s qualifications on the ground of hearsay, and in refusing to allow Plaintiff to use a medical treatise to cross-examine Physician on the ground the treatise had not been listed by Plaintiff in discovery responses.Â  The trial judge denied Plaintiffâ€™s post-trial motion July 14, 2000, after a hearing.Â  Plaintiff filed and served a notice of appeal August 8, 2000.\r\nPhysician filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction after the Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  The Court of Appeals denied the motion.\r\nPhysician contends, as he did to the Court of Appeals, that the trial judge denied Plaintiffâ€™s request to file a written new trial motion.Â  Thus, Plaintiffâ€™s written new trial motion, which followed the oral new trial motion made at the end of the trial, was an improper successive motion akin to those condemned in Quality Trailer Products, Inc. v. CSL Equipment Co., 349 S.C. 216, 562 S.E.2d 615 (2002) and Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Physician further contends the written motion cannot be viewed as a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration because it raised issues not previously ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Physician argues the improper successive motion did not toll the time to appeal, making Plaintiffâ€™s notice of appeal untimely and depriving the appellate court of jurisdiction.Â  See Mears v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 337 S.E.2d 206 (1985); Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.\r\nWe conclude Plaintiffâ€™s written motion is properly viewed as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e), SCRCP to the extent it addressed the trial courtâ€™s evidentiary rulings which Plaintiff challenged in her briefly stated oral motion at the end of the trial.Â  See e.g. C.A.H. v. L.H., 315 S.C. 389, 392, 434 S.E.2d 268, 270 (1993) (party may not use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could have raised prior to judgment, but did not).Â  It is proper to treat Plaintiffâ€™s written motion as a Rule 59(e) motion even though it was erroneously captioned as a motion for new trial.Â  See Mickle v. Blackmon, 255 S.C. 136, 140, 177 S.E.2d 548, 549 (1970) (treating motion based on its substance and effect as opposed to how it was captioned by party); Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 94, 567 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2002) (illustrating that when court is able to discern the relief requested, â€œ[i]t is the substance of the requested relief that matters regardless of the form in which the request for relief was framedâ€); Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Mungo, 306 S.C. 22, 26, 410 S.E.2d 18, 20 (Ct. App. 1991) (explaining that civil procedure rules must be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action, and defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties should be disregarded; thus, it is the substance of the relief sought that matters regardless of the form in which the request for relief was framed).\r\nMoreover, we recently clarified the limits and rationale of Quality Trailer and Collins Music in Elam v. South Carolina Department of Transportation, 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004).Â  We explained that an appeal may be barred due to untimely service of the notice of appeal when a party - instead of serving a notice of appeal - simply recaptions a written motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or new trial, which has been ruled on, and resubmits it as a virtually identical, written Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Elam, 361 S.C. at 20, 602 S.E.2d at 778; Quality Trailer, 349 S.C. 216, 562 S.E.2d 615 (presenting case in which appeal was barred as untimely where appellant filed written JNOV/new trial motion, which was ruled on, and then filed a virtually identical, written Rule 59(e) motion); Collins Music, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524 (same).\r\nHowever, in Elam we held that\r\n\r\n  \r\n    a party usually is free to file an initial Rule 59(e) motion, regardless of whether the previous JNOV/new trial motions were made orally or in writing, without unnecessary concern the repetition of an issue or argument made in a previous motion will result in a subsequent appeal being dismissed as untimely.Â  In essence, we view the use of oral or written JNOV/new trial motions, followed by an initial Rule 59(e) motion, as part and parcel of a partyâ€™s â€œsingle bite at the appleâ€ in presenting his case to the trial court.Â  Again, we caution a party who files post-trial motions to note carefully the exceptions to this general rule as expressed in Coward Hund,[3] Quality Trailer and Collins Music.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nElam, 361 S.C. at 21, 602 S.E.2d at 778.Â  Accordingly, Plaintiff timely filed a Rule 59(e) motion, which was denied, and Plaintiff then timely served and filed her notice of appeal.Â  The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction in this case and correctly denied Physicianâ€™s motion to dismiss the appeal.\r\nII.Â  EXCLUSION OF TESTIMONY ABOUT EXPERTâ€™S QUALIFICATIONS\r\nPhysician argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the juryâ€™s verdict and remanding for a new trial because the trial court excluded part of the explanation of Plaintiffâ€™s expert for not being board-certified in emergency medicine.Â  We agree.\r\nPhysicianâ€™s expert witness in emergency medicine, Dr. Robert Bartlett, testified a physician may seek board certification in emergency medicine after eight years of training.Â  A physician must pass a written and oral examination, and is recertified every ten years.\r\nThe expert witnesses of both parties were routinely asked if they were board-certified in emergency medicine or another specialty.Â  Physicianâ€™s witness, Bartlett, testified he was board-certified in emergency medicine.Â  One of Plaintiffâ€™s expert witnesses, Dr. Alfred Frankel, also testified he was board-certified in emergency medicine.Â  Physician testified he was board-certified in family medicine, but had failed the emergency medicine exam for board certification by one point.\r\nPlaintiff presented Dr. George Podgorny as an expert in emergency medicine.Â  Podgorny testified by video deposition that he had practiced emergency medicine for more than twenty-five years.Â  In explaining why he was not board-certified in the specialty, Podgorny testified, â€œThe reason is that I was the first president of the board of emergency medicine and was instrumental in development of the examination, and then served for many years as the editor of both the written and the oral exam.â€ \r\nThe trial court sustained Physicianâ€™s objection to the remainder of Podgornyâ€™s explanation on the ground it was inadmissible hearsay.Â  The jury did not hear this statement:Â  â€œAnd the opinion of legal counsel was that there may be a conflict of interest if I will take the exam, which it was perceived that I knowed (sic) all the answers.â€Â  \r\nIn closing arguments, Plaintiffâ€™s counsel mentioned the board certification of the expert witnesses.Â  He noted Podgorny was not board certified â€œbecause heâ€™s the one that writes the test that they useâ€ and described Podgorny as â€œthe guru in this part of the country on emergency rooms.â€Â  Physicianâ€™s counsel, in closing, emphasized Bartlettâ€™s qualifications as a â€œtrue expertâ€ who â€œknows what heâ€™s talking about.Â  Dr. Podgorny; what evidence is there that Dr. Podgorny writes the test?Â  Ridiculous!Â  Dr. Podgorny never took the test to be board certified.â€\r\nThe Court of Appeals held Plaintiff demonstrated both error and resulting prejudice in the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of a portion of Podgornyâ€™s explanation.Â  The Court of Appeals stated\r\n\r\n  [u]sually, if opinion testimony is offered by a physician or surgeon, his competency to testify as an expert is sufficiently established by the fact that he has been duly licensed to practice medicine or surgery.Â  State v. Moorer, 241 S.C. 487, 129 S.E.2d 330 (1963), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 316 (1991); Hill v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 204 S.C. 83, 28 S.E.2d 545 (1943).Â  A physician or surgeon is not incompetent to testify as an expert merely because he is not a specialist in the particular branch of his profession involved in the case.Â  Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 426 S.E.2d 785 (1993).Â  The fact that the physician is not a specialist in the particular area affects only the weight of the witnessâ€™s testimony and affords no basis for completely rejecting it.Â  Hill, 204 S.C. at 109, 28 S.E.2d at 555; Brown v. LaFrance Indus., 286 S.C. 319, 333 S.E.2d 348 (Ct. App. 1985). . . . \r\n  Hearsay is â€œa statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Proof of a statement introduced to show a party heard and acted upon information is not objectionable hearsay.Â  Webb v. Elrod, 308 S.C. 445, 449, 418 S.E.2d 559, 562 (Ct. App. 1992); 31A C.J.S. Evidence Â§ 259 (1996) (â€œ[T]estimony is not hearsay where it relates to what the witness himself did in reliance on, or in response to, a statement, facts upon which action was taken, personal observations, explanation of conduct, the effect of statements on the listener, the fact that something was said, or identifying what was said.â€).\r\n  Podgornyâ€™s statement is a classic example of showing an action based upon information and is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.Â  The statement was not offered to prove that the counsel was correct in showing that there would be a conflict of interest if Podgorny took the test, but rather explained why Podgorny did not take the test and therefore, was not board-certified.\r\n\r\nFields, 354 S.C. at 452-54, 581 S.E.2d at 492-93.Â  The Court of Appeals further concluded Plaintiff was prejudiced by the error because the case presented the â€œparadigmatic example of clashing experts and debatable qualificationsâ€ in a close case in which the expertsâ€™ credentials were crucial.Â  Id. at 454-55, 581 S.E.2d at 494.\r\nWe conclude the Court of Appeals correctly found error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling, and the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the â€œlegal counselâ€ testimony.Â  The testimony was not hearsay because it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\r\nHowever, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding Plaintiff has shown prejudice.Â  When evidence is erroneously excluded by the trial court, the appellate court usually engages in the following analysis to determine whether prejudice has occurred.Â  First, the court considers, inter alia, whether the error may be deemed harmless because equivalent or cumulative evidence or testimony was offered;[4] the aggrieved party still managed to accomplish his primary objective, such as eliciting testimony about an issue or effectively cross-examining a witness;[5] the juryâ€™s verdict or a proper court ruling rendered the wrongly excluded evidence moot because it was relevant to an issue that did not have to be reached;[6] the aggrieved party failed to establish a claim or defense even when both the admitted and excluded evidence are considered;[7] or the wrongly excluded evidence involved a generally known fact.[8]\r\nSecond, the appellate court considers whether, viewing a case as a whole, the wrongly excluded evidence or testimony was so crucial and important in proving the aggrieved partyâ€™s claim or defense that its exclusion constitutes prejudicial error, i.e., the aggrieved party demonstrates there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the lack of the challenged evidence.[9]\r\nIt certainly is true that the credentials of both partiesâ€™ expert witnesses were crucial in the present case.Â  Both partiesâ€™ medical experts were routinely asked whether they were board-certified.Â  Both parties mentioned the expertsâ€™ board certification in closing arguments while praising their own expert and criticizing their opponentâ€™s.\r\nPlaintiff did not present evidence that was equivalent or cumulative to the wrongly excluded â€œlegal counselâ€ testimony.Â  Plaintiff did, however, accomplish her primary objective in demonstrating Podgorny was well-qualified to render an opinion on Physicianâ€™s actions.Â  Podgorny testified he had practiced emergency medicine for more than twenty-five years and had helped edit the board certification test for years.Â  In addition, Plaintiffâ€™s other expert, Frankel, was board-certified in emergency medicine.\r\nViewing the case as a whole, we are not persuaded the â€œlegal counselâ€ testimony was so crucial and important in proving Plaintiffâ€™s malpractice claim that its exclusion constitutes prejudicial error.Â  Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable probability the jury was influenced by the absence of a portion of Podgornyâ€™s explanation regarding his lack of board certification.Â  This case differs, for example, from the Elledge, Senn, or Sellers cases described in footnote 9, where the aggrieved party was prejudiced by the wrongful exclusion of crucial and important evidence.Â  \r\n In short, both parties presented experienced, well-qualified experts who offered opposing opinions about the propriety of Physicianâ€™s actions.Â  Whether Physicianâ€™s actions met the requisite standard of care was a question for the jury and the jury decided it in favor of Physician.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding of error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling, but reverse the finding of prejudice.\r\nIII.Â  USE OF MEDICAL TREATISE TO CROSS-EXAMINE PHYSICIAN\r\nPhysician contends the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the juryâ€™s verdict and remanding for a new trial because the trial court refused to allow Plaintiff to use a medical treatise during cross-examination of Physician.Â  Although this issue presents a closer question than Issue II, we agree.\r\nPlaintiff attempted to use an emergency medicine textbook written by Tintinalli, Krome, and Ruiz while cross-examining Physician.Â  Physician testified he was familiar with the treatise, considered an authoritative source by emergency room doctors.Â  Physicianâ€™s counsel objected to use of the treatise because Plaintiff had failed to list it in her responses to Physicianâ€™s discovery requests. \r\nPlaintiffâ€™s counsel stated he intended to use the treatise to â€œask [Physician] if what heâ€™s testified to is different from whatâ€™s in the text.â€Â  Counsel did not proffer any specific questions or information from the textbook.Â  The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard all references to the treatise.Â  In an affidavit which accompanied Plaintiffâ€™s written motion for a new trial, Plaintiffâ€™s paralegal testified Physicianâ€™s counsel, apparently realizing Plaintiffâ€™s counsel had seen the treatise on defense counselâ€™s table while cross-examining Physician, instructed an assistant to put it away.Â  The assistant placed the treatise on the floor and covered it up with several notebooks.\r\nThe Court of Appeals, relying on Rule 37(b), SCRCP, held the trial court abused its discretion by disallowing use of the treatise without weighing the nature of the interrogatories, the discovery posture of the case, the willfulness of the offending party, and the degree of prejudice to the objecting party.Â  The Court of Appeals held Plaintiff had been prejudiced by the error.Â  Fields, 354 S.C. at 455-59, 581 S.E.2d at 494-96.\r\nWe conclude the Court of Appeals correctly held the trial court abused its discretion in preventing Plaintiff from using the treatise to challenge Physicianâ€™s assertion that his examination and treatment of Decedent was appropriate.Â  There was no evidence Plaintiff willfully failed to disclose the treatise, and Physician was not prejudiced or surprised by the use of an admittedly authoritative treatise lying on defense counselâ€™s table.Â  Disallowing use of the treatise for a discovery violation under these facts did not further the primary purpose of the civil procedural rules at issue, i.e., preventing or limiting ambush tactics at trial.\r\nHowever, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding Plaintiff has demonstrated prejudice under the analysis set forth in Issue II.Â  Plaintiff has failed to explain persuasively at trial or on appeal how she would have used the treatise to challenge Physicianâ€™s testimony.Â  The treatise evidence likely would have been cumulative to the testimony of Plaintiffâ€™s two experts, who testified Physician failed to perform additional tests and monitoring of Decedentâ€™s condition.Â  Viewing the case as a whole, Plaintiff has not shown the treatise was so crucial and important that its wrongful exclusion constitutes prejudicial error.Â  Plaintiff has failed to establish a reasonable probability the jury was influenced by the lack of cross-examination of Physician with information from the medical treatise.\r\nAs explained in Issue II, both parties presented experienced, well-qualified experts who offered opposing opinions about the propriety of Physicianâ€™s actions.Â  Whether Physicianâ€™s actions met the requisite standard of care was a question for the jury and the jury decided it in favor of Physician.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ denial of Physicianâ€™s motion to dismiss the appeal.Â  On Issues II and III, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ findings of error in the trial courtâ€™s evidentiary rulings, but reverse the findings of prejudice.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Physician.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PARTÂ  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  RMC is not a party on appeal.\r\n[2]Â  Plaintiffâ€™s expert defined histrionics as â€œ[a]n unofficial term sometimes used by doctors referring to

Goudelock v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 219 S.C. 284, 294, 65 S.E.2d 114, 118 (1951) (any error in exclusion of letter showing the plaintiffâ€™s salary scale did not prejudice defendant because plaintiff during cross-examination testified to substantially what the letter contained); Young v. Hudsex Motor Co., 172 S.C. 541, 174 S.E. 489 (1934) (in action for fraud in sale of automobile, trial courtâ€™s refusal to allow witness to testify about resale price of automobile was not prejudicial error because plaintiff was afterwards permitted to fully examine president of defendant company about the issue).\r\n[6]Â  E.g. First State Sav. and Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 449, 385 S.E.2d 821, 826 (1989) (any error in exclusion of defendantâ€™s proferred testimony on damages was harmless because defendant failed to establish counterclaim that plaintiff bank committed either a fraud or breached an express oral warranty in sale of horses). \r\n[7]Â  E.g.

[1] \r\nOn November 5, 2003, Charlene Taylor, John \r\n  Sketers, and Delores Wilson (Appellants) filed letters contesting the election \r\n  results.Â  The Commission reviewed challenged ballots at a hearing on November \r\n  6, 2003, and denied the candidatesâ€™ protests following a separate hearing on \r\n  November 8, 2003.\r\nOn appeal the circuit court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  This appeal is pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200(b)(5) (Supp. 2003) and \r\n  Rule 203(d)(1)(E), SCACR.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.Â  Did the circuit court err in refusing to remand the case to the Commission \r\n  for explicit rulings and a more definitive written order on allegations raised \r\n  by Appellants at a hearing before the Commission?Â Â  \r\n2.Â  Did the circuit court err in affirming the Commissionâ€™s denial of the election \r\n  protests because the constitutional and statutory right to a secret ballot of \r\n  those who voted by challenged ballot was violated?\r\n3.Â  Are Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues preserved for appellate review?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn municipal election cases, we review the judgment of the \r\n  circuit court only to correct errors of law.Â  Our review does not extend to \r\n  findings of fact unless those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  \r\n  We will employ every reasonable presumption to sustain a contested election, \r\n  and will not set aside an election due to mere irregularities or illegalities \r\n  unless the result is changed or rendered doubtful.Â  In the absence of fraud, \r\n  a constitutional violation, or a statute providing that an irregularity or illegality \r\n  invalidates an election, we will not set aside an election for a mere irregularity. \r\n  Â E.g. Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Commn., 342 \r\n  S.C. 373, 379, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000); George v. Mun. Election Commn. \r\n  ofÂ  Charleston, 335 S.C. 182, 186, 516 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1999); Sims v. \r\n  Ham, 275 S.C. 369, 271 S.E.2d 316 (1980); May v. Wilson, 199 S.C. \r\n  354, 19 S.E.2d 467 (1942); State v. Jennings, 79 S.C. 246, 60 S.E. 99 \r\n  (1908).Â  â€œVoters who have done all in their power to cast their ballots honestly \r\n  and intelligently are not to be disfranchised because of an irregularity, mistake, \r\n  error, or even wrongful act, of the officers charged with the duty of conducting \r\n  the election, which does not prevent a fair election and in some way affect \r\n  the result.â€Â  Berry v. Spigner, 226 S.C. 183, 190, 84 S.E.2d 381, 384 \r\n  (1954) (internal quotes omitted).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  DENIAL OF REMAND TO COMMISSION\r\nThe Commission by letter advised Appellants had not proved \r\n  the late opening of the polls affected the outcome of the election; Appellant \r\n  Taylorâ€™s â€œallegations of fraud and bribery were not provenâ€; and Appellant Sketersâ€™ \r\n  â€œallegations of ballots being seen and ballots being removed from the voting \r\n  place were not proven.â€ [2] Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in denying their \r\n  request to remand the case to the Commission for more definitive findings and \r\n  rulings in a written order on issues they had raised before the Commission.Â  \r\n  Appellants acknowledge an election protest generally is limited to allegations \r\n  contained in the written notice of protest.Â  They urge the Court to require \r\n  some degree of concomitant specificity by the election commission which hears \r\n  the protest; otherwise, it is difficult or impossible for circuit or appellate \r\n  courts to properly review the decision.Â Â  Appellants do not suggest such orders \r\n  be required to contain formal findings of fact or conclusions of law similar \r\n  to those demanded of lower courts or government agencies in other settings.Â  \r\n  Appellants ask the Court to either remand the case to the Commission or set \r\n  aside the election for reasons set forth in their appeal.\r\n Respondents assert the circuit court did not err in refusing \r\n  to remand the case to the Commission for further review.Â  They argue there is \r\n  no need to require greater specificity or clarity in decisions issued by election \r\n  commissions, and urge the Court to reject Appellantsâ€™ call for a new standard \r\n  for such orders.\r\nThere was no right to contest an election under the common \r\n  law.Â  Broadhurst, 342 S.C. at 383, 537 S.E.2d at 548.Â  â€œThe right to \r\n  contest an election exists only under the [state] constitutional and statutory \r\n  provisions, and the procedure proscribed by statute must be strictly followed.â€Â  \r\n  Taylor v. Roche, 271 S.C. 505, 509, 248 S.E.2d 580, 582 (1978); see \r\n  also S.C. Const. art. II, Â§ 10 (â€œGeneral Assembly shall . . . establish \r\n  procedures for contested elections, and enact other provisions necessary to \r\n  the fulfillment of and integrity of the election processâ€).\r\nStatutes applicable to municipal elections provide:\r\n\r\nWithin forty-eight hours after the closing of the polls, \r\n  any candidate may contest the result of the election as reported by the managers \r\n  by filing a written notice of such contest together with a concise statement \r\n  of the grounds therefor with the Municipal Election Commission.Â  Within forty-eight \r\n  hours after the filing of such notice, the Municipal Election Commission shall, \r\n  after due notice to the parties concerned, conduct a hearing on the contest, \r\n  decide the issues raised, file its report together with all recorded testimony \r\n  and exhibits with the clerk of court of the county in which the municipality \r\n  is situated, notify the parties concerned of the decisions made, and when \r\n  the decision invalidates the election the council shall order a new election \r\n  as to the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-130 (2004) (emphasis added).\r\nThe decision of the municipal election commission may be \r\n  appealed to the court of common pleas within ten days after a party receives \r\n  notice of it.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-140 (2004).Â  The circuit court, sitting \r\n  in an appellate capacity, does not conduct a de novo hearing or take \r\n  testimony.Â  The circuit court must examine the decision for errors of law, but \r\n  it must accept the factual findings of the commission unless they are wholly \r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  Blair v. City of Manning, 345 S.C. 141, \r\n  546 S.E.2d 649 (2001); Butler v. Town of Edgefield, 328 S.C. 238, 248, \r\n  493 S.E.2d 838, 843 (1997).\r\nAppellants have not cited, nor have we have found, any South \r\n  Carolina statute or case establishing standards for written orders issued by \r\n  an election commission.Â  Appellants initially asserted the Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act (APA) may apply to such a proceeding.Â  The circuit court correctly recognized \r\n  the APA does not apply to the appeal of a decision by a municipal election commission.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310(2) and (3) (Supp. 2003) (defining â€œagencyâ€ \r\n  and â€œcontested caseâ€).\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling the Commission fulfilled \r\n  its statutory duty under existing law.Â  Section 5-15-130 requires an election \r\n  commission conduct a hearing, decide the issues raised, file a report with the \r\n  testimony and exhibits, and notify the parties of the decision.Â  The statute \r\n  does not require a written order containing findings of fact or conclusions \r\n  of law similar to those, e.g., required of tribunals in APA or family court \r\n  proceedings.Â  Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (1986) (establishing standards \r\n  for written orders in APA cases, which require findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law); Rule 26(a), SCRFC (order or judgment in domestic relations case shall \r\n  set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law).Â  We decline to \r\n  impose standards for written orders on election commissions beyond those imposed \r\n  by statute.Â  It is within the plenary power of the Legislature, not this Court, \r\n  to promulgate election standards or enact statutory election requirements which \r\n  address the necessity or substance of written orders issued by an election commission.\r\n2.Â  SECRECY OF CHALLENGED BALLOTS\r\nTwenty-three voters cast challenged ballots.Â  All were included \r\n  in the results except the vote of one person who no longer lived in Atlantic \r\n  Beach.Â  Patricia Bellamy, a poll watcher for unsuccessful mayoral candidate \r\n  Taylor, challenged most of the ballots due to allegedly questionable addresses.Â  \r\n\r\nPoll manager Vanessa Warren stated in a letter to the Commission \r\n  that challenged voters â€œwere told to write the candidatesâ€™ names they were voting \r\n  for on a blank sheet of paper with their signature.â€Â  Further, the â€œfail-safeâ€ \r\n  printed ballots listing candidatesâ€™ names were not used â€œbecause we were rushing \r\n  and did not get situated.â€Â  Warren acknowledged before the Commission the procedures \r\n  followed were improper.Â  Appellant Sketers stated in his notice of contest the \r\n  â€œballots were allowed to be seen.â€Â  \r\nViolet Taylor, a witness for Appellant Taylor whose vote \r\n  was challenged, testified she â€œwas not given a printed ballot to vote on.Â  I \r\n  was given a blank sheet of paper and I was told to step to the side and write \r\n  the names of the candidates I was choosing in pencil.â€Â  Six of the twenty-one \r\n  challenged ballots contained in the record were signed by the voter.\r\nThe Commission rejected the assertion that â€œballots were \r\n  allowed to be seen.â€Â  Appellants in their notice of appeal to circuit court \r\n  attacked the challenged ballot procedures.Â Â  The circuit court ruled Appellants \r\n  had failed to raise issues related to the challenged ballots to the Commission \r\n  and rejected Appellantsâ€™ motions to reconsider the matter or remand it to the \r\n  Commission.\r\n Appellants argue the circuit court erred in affirming the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s denial of the election protests because the constitutional and \r\n  statutory right to a secret ballot of those who voted by challenged ballot was \r\n  violated.Â  Appellants assert the issues were sufficiently raised to the Commission, \r\n  although they concede the Commission hearing did not result in an â€œexemplary \r\n  recordâ€ because they were not then represented by counsel.Â  We conclude the \r\n  issues are sufficiently preserved.\r\n Respondents argue that the issue of secrecy of the challenged \r\n  ballots is not preserved for appellate review.Â  They further assert the issue \r\n  is without merit because it was â€œnot the kind of systemic invasion of privacy \r\n  that affects the fundamental integrity of the electoral process.â€\r\nâ€œThere are two prerequisites to maintaining an election \r\n  contest in South Carolina:Â  (1) the contest notice must allege irregularities \r\n  or illegalities; and (2) the alleged irregularities or illegalities must have \r\n  changed or rendered doubtful the result of the election in the absence of fraud, \r\n  a constitutional violation, [or] a statute providing that such irregularity \r\n  or illegality shall invalidate the election.â€Â  Butler v. Town of Edgefield, \r\n  328 S.C. 238, 246, 493 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1997).\r\nA notice of contest filed pursuant to Section 5-15-130 should \r\n  briefly state facts or a combination of facts sufficient to apprise the election \r\n  commission and winning candidate of the reason for the challenge.Â  It is not \r\n  sufficient to allege fraud generally or mere conclusions of the protesting person.Â  \r\n  Butler, 328 S.C. at 245-46, 493 S.E.2d at 842.Â  The circuit court, sitting \r\n  in an appellate capacity, may not consider issues which were not raised to the \r\n  election commission.Â  The circuit court has no authority to conduct a full hearing \r\n  when one is denied by the election commission; nor does it have authority to \r\n  take testimony or conduct a de novo hearing.Â  Butler, 328 S.C. \r\n  at 248, 493 S.E.2d at 843; Blair, 345 S.C. at 144, 546 S.E.2d 651.\r\nWe recently emphasized the importance of ballot secrecy \r\n  in George, 335 S.C. 182, 516 S.E.2d 206.Â  There we held the total absence \r\n  of voting booths and foldable ballots in a municipal election violated votersâ€™ \r\n  constitutional and statutory right to cast a secret ballot.Â  We reviewed the \r\n  occasionally violent nature of past elections and reasons underlying the nationâ€™s \r\n  gradual move toward secret ballots.Â  This Court and many others long have emphasized \r\n  the importance of secret ballots.Â  See George, 335 S.C. at 187-190, \r\n  516 S.E.2d at 209-210 (listing cases and statutes); Corn v. Blackwell, \r\n  191 S.C. 183, 4 S.E.2d 254 (1939) (holding ballot secrecy was violated when \r\n  numbering system for ballots and voter sign-in lists could be used to identify \r\n  a particular voterâ€™s ballot); State ex rel. Birchmore v. State Bd. of Canvassers, \r\n  78 S.C. 461, 468-469, 59 S.E. 145, 147 (1907) (holding ballot secrecy was violated \r\n  when voters were required to place their ballots in â€œforâ€ and â€œagainstâ€ boxes \r\n  that plainly revealed their choice).\r\nIt is undisputed the proper procedure was not followed with \r\n  regard to the twenty-two challenged ballots.Â  Voters should have been given \r\n  printed ballots listing the candidatesâ€™ names after appropriate determinations \r\n  by the poll manager, been provided with a private place to cast their ballot, \r\n  and absolutely not been asked or required to sign their name on the ballot.Â  \r\n  The ballot should have been placed in a separate envelope with the name of the \r\n  voter and challenger written on the envelope.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-830 \r\n  (Supp. 2003) (establishing procedures for handling challenged ballots); Greene \r\n  v. S.C. Election Commn., 314 S.C. 449, 445 S.E.2d 451 (1994) (discussing \r\n  challenged ballots); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-10 (2004) (municipal elections shall \r\n  be conducted pursuant to provisions set forth in Title 7).\r\nHowever, the present case is distinguishable from previous \r\n  cases addressing ballot secrecy.Â  The secrecy of the six challenged ballots \r\n  signed by the voter undoubtedly was compromised.Â  The secrecy of the remaining \r\n  sixteen challenged ballots may have been compromised by the voter â€œstepping \r\n  asideâ€ to cast it in potential sight of other voters or poll workers.Â  We agree \r\n  with Respondents there was no systemic invasion of privacy, as was evident in \r\n  George, Corn, and Birchmore, which affected the fundamental \r\n  integrity of the election and gave rise to a constitutional violation sufficient \r\n  to set aside the election results.Â  We conclude this issue constitutes an irregularity \r\n  that did not affect the result of the election, and the record does not demonstrate \r\n  evidence of fraud, a constitutional violation, or a statute providing this irregularity \r\n  should invalidate the election.\r\n3.Â  PRESERVATION OF REMAINING ISSUES\r\nAppellants assert the circuit court erred in affirming the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s denial of their election protests because (1) the constitutional \r\n  and statutory right to a secret ballot of twenty-eight persons who voted by \r\n  absentee ballot allegedly was violated and (2) the Commission was required by \r\n  statute to order a new election due to alleged irregularities based on the number \r\n  of voters who signed the poll list.\r\nThese issues are not preserved for appellate review.Â  Appellants \r\n  failed to raise either issue in their notice of contest letters.Â  See \r\n  footnote 2, supra.Â  The issue of absentee ballot secrecy was not raised \r\n  to the Commission or to the circuit court.Â  Issues related to the signing of \r\n  the poll list were not raised to the Commission.Â  Appellants did allege in their \r\n  notice of appeal to circuit court that challenged ballot voters had failed to \r\n  sign the poll list and questioned whether those votersâ€™ identities were properly \r\n  recorded, but their arguments came too late.Â  See Butler, 328 \r\n  S.C. at 248, 493 S.E.2d at 843 (circuit court, sitting in an appellate capacity, \r\n  may not consider issues which were not raised to the election commission and \r\n  it has no authority to conduct a full hearing when one is denied by the election \r\n  commission; nor does it have authority to take testimony or conduct a de \r\n  novo hearing); Blair, 345 S.C. at 144, 546 S.E.2d at 651 (stating \r\n  same principles).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order upholding the results of the \r\n  election held November 4, 2003.Â  We decline to impose standards for written \r\n  orders issued by election commissions beyond those imposed by statute.Â  We conclude \r\n  the alleged violation of secrecy of the challenged ballots constitutes an irregularity \r\n  that did not affect the result of the election.Â  There is no evidence of fraud, \r\n  a constitutional violation, or a statute providing this irregularity should \r\n  invalidate the election.Â  Lastly, Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues are not preserved \r\n  for appellate review because they were not raised to the election commission. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we order that Respondents Irene Armstrong, Jake Evans, \r\n  and Sherry Suttles, as the winning candidates, be forthwith seated in their \r\n  respective positions.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  The certified results of the November 4, 2003, \r\n    election were:\r\n  Mayorâ€™s seat:Â  Irene Armstrong, 104; Charlene \r\n    Taylor, 18; Josephine Isom, 34, Gloria Lance, 13.\r\n  Town council seat (two to be elected):Â  Jake \r\n    Evans, 110; Sherry Suttles, 65; Retha Pierce, 52; Kenneth McIver, 24; William \r\n    Cain, 3; Erica Lewis, 2; Russell Skeeters, 17; John Sketers, 17; Delores Wilson, \r\n    16; Russell Reave, 1.\r\n  Respondents have not begun serving in their respective \r\n    positions pending the outcome of this appeal.Â  See S.C.

Varnado, of Kernodle, Taylor &amp; Root, of Charleston, for respondent/appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We dismiss this action as moot and find the trial court did not err by failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees to the James Island Public Service District (District).\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn June 2002, the Town of James Island (Town) was formed.Â  Thereafter, an action was commenced by the City of Charleston (City), a resident and elector of the City who lives on James Island (Kizer), and a taxpayer and elector of the Town (Cabiness) (jointly referred to as City unless otherwise noted).Â  The complaint sought injunctive relief and declaratory relief as to who, after the incorporation of the Town, was entitled to vote in the District elections and to serve as District commissioners.Â  The complaint alleged that as a function of the incorporation of the Town, which overlapped certain areas in the District, the territorial boundaries of the District were reduced such that Town residents should be prohibited from participating in District elections.\r\nA general election for District commissioners was scheduled for November 5, 2002.Â  The Cityâ€™s motion for a preliminary injunction to stay the November election was denied after a hearing.Â  This matter was heard on the merits and the circuit court issued an order declining to decide the issues raised by the City.Â  The circuit court also denied the Districtâ€™s motion for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Both the City and the District appealed.\r\nSubsequent to the filing of this appeal, this Court found the Town of James Island to be a nullity because it had been created by unconstitutional special legislation.Â  Kizer v. Clark, 360 S.C. 86, 600 S.E.2d 529 (2004).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Cityâ€™s action moot?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err by failing to award the District attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n        I\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe find the District correctly argues that this case regarding the Town residentsâ€™ entitlement to vote in the District elections and the entitlement to serve as a District commissioner is moot given that the Town is a nullity.Â  Our opinion in Kizer v. Clark, supra, rendered the case nonjusticiable because a judgment, if rendered, would not have any practical legal effect given the Town was deemed nonexistent.Â  See Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 926 (2002) (case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon existing controversy); Waters v. South Carolina Land Resources Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 467 S.E.2d 913 (1996) (justiciable controversy is real and substantial controversy appropriate for judicial determination, as opposed to dispute or difference of contingent, hypothetical or abstract character).Â  \r\nThe City argues, however, that the Court should decide the issues involved because they are capable of repetition yet evade review and because the issues involve matters of important public interest.Â  We find neither exception is met in this case.\r\nRegarding the exception that a court can take jurisdiction, despite mootness, if the issue raised is capable of repetition but evading review, we find that while the questions involved could arise again, the questions will not â€œusually become mootâ€ before they can be reviewed.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health v. State, 301 S.C. 75, 390 S.E.2d 185 (1990) (although specific case is moot, appeal allowed because raises question that is capable of repetition, but which usually becomes moot before it can be reviewed).Â  Further, the issues involved do not appear to present a â€œrecurring dilemmaâ€ which the Court needs to address to clarify the law.Â  See Evans v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Servs., 303 S.C. 108, 399 S.E.2d 156 (1990) (although development renders case moot, controversy presents a recurring dilemma which the Court will address to clarify the law).\r\nThe other exception the City argues is that questions of public interest originally encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance, however abstract or moot they may have become in the immediate contest.Â  Ashmore v. Greater Greenville Sewer Dist., 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88 (1947); Berry v. Zahler, 220 S.C. 86, 66 S.E.2d 459 (1951) (same).Â  However, pursuant to our opinion in Sloan v. Greenville County, Op. No. 25899 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 22, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 45 at 40),Â  we find this case does not fit within the public importance exception to mootness because there is no imperative or manifest urgency in obtaining a decision on whether Town residents can vote in the Districtâ€™s election when the Town does not exist.Â  Further, while ensuring voters are not improperly denied their right to vote in a particular election is important, the fact remains that the pertinent issue does not present a recurring dilemma such that this issue should be addressed to clarify the law.Â  Compare Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003) (important public interest exists in stewardship of public funds and strong need exists to provide guidance for future procurement decisions) and Sloan v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 342 S.C. 515, 537 S.E.2d 299 (Ct. App. 2000) (same) with Sasser v. South Carolina Democratic Party, 277 S.C. 67, 282 S.E.2d 602 (1981) (appeal from circuit court order sustaining demurrers to petition to nullify results of primary election for political partyâ€™s nomination to State House of Representatives was rendered moot, where general election had already occurred).\r\nAccordingly, this case is dismissed as moot.\r\nII\r\n\r\nFollowing the circuit courtâ€™s order finding there were no rights to declare in the declaratory judgment action, the District moved for attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (Supp. 2003).Â  Section 15-77-300 provides:\r\n\r\n  In any civil action brought by the State, any political subdivision of the State or any party who is contesting state action, unless the prevailing party is the State or any political subdivision of the State, the court may allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)\r\n        The court finds that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)\r\n        The court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award of attorney&rsquo;s fees unjust.&nbsp; . . .\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court found the District was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because the District was not a â€œprevailing partyâ€ and the City had a substantial justification in bringing the action.\r\nThere are three prerequisites that must be established prior to the recovery of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs by a party contesting state action.Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 394 S.E.2d 709 (1990).Â  First, the contesting party must be the â€œprevailing party;â€ second, the court must find that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and third, the court must find that there are no special circumstances that would make an award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.Â  Id.\r\nThe District is not a prevailing party because its degree of success is nonexistent given that the circuit court did not specifically find for either party and because this case is being dismissed as moot.Â  See Heath v. County of Aiken, supra (court determines prevailing party by evaluating degree of success obtained).Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not err by denying the Districtâ€™s motion for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See Heath v. County of Aiken, supra (award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be disturbed absent abuse of discretion).Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25942","title":"Spruill v.

Nichols, of Bluestein &amp; Nichols, LLC, and Preston F. McDaniel, \r\n  of McDaniel &amp; Johnson, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nW. Hugh McAngus, of McAngus Goudelock &amp; Courie, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is a workerâ€™s compensation \r\n  case.Â  Appellant (Employee) contends the single commissioner erred in refusing \r\n  to allow Employee to withdraw her Form 50 following the hearing.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 1999, Employee \r\n  obtained a report from Dr. Fechter.Â  Employee believed Dr. Fechterâ€™s report \r\n  found a link between Employeeâ€™s disability and her workplace exposure to dust \r\n  created by construction work.Â  On January 3, 2000, Employee made Dr. Fechterâ€™s \r\n  report available to respondents.Â  When respondents sought to depose the doctor, \r\n  they learned he was out of the country.Â  Respondents requested relief.Â  As a \r\n  result, the hearing, which had been scheduled for January 13, was moved to January \r\n  17 by the hearing commissioner, who also ordered that the record would remain \r\n  open to allow respondents to depose Dr. Fechter.Â  No party objected to these \r\n  rulings.\r\nDr. Fechter was deposed \r\n  on January 28, 2000. Â In this deposition he â€˜clarifiedâ€™ his earlier report, \r\n  opining that Employeeâ€™s disability was the result of an idiopathic disease and \r\n  not connected to her earlier exposure to dust and debris at her place of employment.Â  \r\n  In late April 2000, the single commissioner informed the parties of her decision \r\n  to deny Employeeâ€™s permanent disability claim.Â  Several days later, Employee \r\n  sought to withdraw her Form 50, relying upon 25A S.C. Regulation 67-609 (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  The single commissioner denied this request, and her ruling was affirmed \r\n  by the full commission and the circuit court.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes Regulation 67-609 permit \r\n  a claimant to withdraw her Form 50 at any time?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nEmployee contends that \r\n  Regulation 67-609 permits a claimant to withdraw her Form 50 â€œonce as a matter \r\n  of right with leave to renewâ€ at any point in the proceeding.Â  The commissioner \r\n  held that a claimant could not withdraw her Form 50 after the hearing had been \r\n  held and a decision rendered.Â  We agree that Regulation 67-609 applies only \r\n  where the request is made prior to the hearing.\r\nRegulation 67-609 provides:\r\n\r\n67-609.Â  Withdrawing a Request \r\n  for Hearing.\r\n  \r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A claimant may withdraw a Form 50 or Form 52 once \r\n  as a matter of right with leave to renew.\r\n    \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Form 50 or 52 may be withdrawn by writing \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s Judicial Department, if a hearing notice has not been issued, \r\n  or, the Commissionerâ€™s office identified on the hearing notice.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a Form 50 or Form 52 is withdrawn, \r\n  a notice removing the case from the docket will be filed in the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  record and a copy mailed to the parties in R. 67-210.\r\n    \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The notice is without prejudice to the claimantâ€™s \r\n  right to proceed with his or her claim.\r\n    \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the nature of the claim and the relief \r\n  requested does not change, write the Judicial Department requesting the Form \r\n  50 or Form 52 be reset for hearing.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the nature of the claim or relief requested \r\n  changes, file according to R. 67-207, a new Form 50 or Form 52 with the word \r\n  â€œAmendedâ€ printed or typed boldly on the top of the form.\r\n    \r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Withdrawing a Form 50 or Form 52 the second \r\n  time without good cause may operate as a voluntary dismissal of the claim when \r\n  the form is withdrawn by a claimant who has once withdrawn a Form 50 or Form \r\n  52 based on the same set of facts, and, in the opinion of the Commissioner, \r\n  the form is withdrawn merely for the purpose of delay.\r\n  D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Withdrawing a Form 15 request for hearing waives \r\n  the sixty day hearing requirement.Â  If the jurisdictional commissioner is unable \r\n  to reschedule the case, the file will be returned to the Judicial Department \r\n  to be reassigned.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first sentence of Regulation \r\n  67-609(A), read in isolation, supports Employeeâ€™s contention.Â  We do not, however, \r\n  determine the meaning of a regulation by reading its component parts in isolation, \r\n  but rather construe the regulation as a whole.Â  See Byerly v. Connor, \r\n  307 S.C. 441, 415 S.E.2d 796 (1992). \r\nThe purpose of the regulation \r\n  is reflected in its title, Withdrawing a Request for a Hearing, and the text \r\n  reflects this limited application.Â  Regulation 67-609(A)(1) requires the claimant \r\n  to notify the Judicial Department if the withdrawal is made before the hearing \r\n  notice has been issued: if made after the notice has been issued, then the withdrawal \r\n  should be directed to the commissioner assigned to hear the case.Â  Regulation \r\n  67-609(B) provides that if the refiled claim and relief are unchanged, the claimant \r\n  should simply request the matter â€œbe reset for hearing.â€Â  If, however, the nature \r\n  of the claim or relief changes, then the claimant must file an amended Form \r\n  50 and comply with Regulation 67-207, which outlines the procedures to be followed \r\n  by a claimant requesting a hearing.Â  Regulation 67-609(B)(2). \r\nRegulation 67-609 contemplates \r\n  that the withdrawal request will be made prior to the hearing before the single \r\n  commissioner and provides the procedures for requesting a new hearing date.Â  \r\n  Nothing in this regulation supports Employeeâ€™s assertion that she is entitled \r\n  to withdraw her Form 50 at any point in the process.\r\nFurther, we traditionally defer \r\n  to an executive agencyâ€™s construction of its own regulation.Â  Such a construction \r\n  is â€œaccorded most respectful consideration and will not be overturned absent \r\n  compelling reasons.â€Â  E.g., Dorman v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health \r\n  and Enviro. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 565 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Even \r\n  if Regulation 67-609 were ambiguous, we would defer to the commissionâ€™s interpretation \r\n  since it reflects a sound policy decision not to permit disgruntled claimants \r\n  a second â€œbite at the apple.â€\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRegulation 67-609 did \r\n  not entitle Employee to withdraw her Form 50 following the single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  hearing.Â  The circuit court order, upholding the denial of Employeeâ€™s request, \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  [1] \r\n MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  In my view, the circuit court erred in affirming the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision forbidding Employee from withdrawing her Form 50.Â  Therefore, \r\n  I would reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision and remand this case with instructions \r\n  permitting the Employee to withdraw the form.Â Â  \r\nThe majority holds that a Form 50 must be withdrawn \r\n  before a hearing commences, or a claimant loses the right to withdraw the form.Â  \r\n  I do not agree with this holding because (1) it is not supported by the terms \r\n  of the controlling regulation and (2) it imposes even stricter requirements \r\n  than those imposed by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.\r\nThe controlling regulation provides that â€œ[a] claimant \r\n  may withdraw a Form 50 . . . once as a matter of right with leave to \r\n  renew.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-609(A) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  Given its plain and ordinary meaning, this regulation, in my view, does not \r\n  require that the Form 50 be withdrawn at any particular time in the proceeding.Â \r\nSee Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 444, 415 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1992) \r\n  (â€œThe words of a regulation must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without \r\n  resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the regulationâ€™s \r\n  operation.â€).Â  Had the appropriate rulemaking agency intended to impose the \r\n  requirement established by the majority todayâ€”that a claimant must withdraw \r\n  the form before the hearing commencesâ€”the agency would have done so.Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition, the majorityâ€™s holding imposes stricter \r\n  limitations on the right to withdraw than those imposed by the Commission itself.Â  \r\n  In the case at hand, the Commission ruled that â€œ[o]nce a hearing is convened, \r\n  concluded, and a determination rendered, the claimant cannot withdraw the Form \r\n  50.â€Â  This ruling, in my view, provides that a claimant may not withdraw the \r\n  form after a determination has been rendered, not before the hearing \r\n  commences, as the majority holds.Â  \r\nIn the present case, a decision had yet to be rendered \r\n  when Employee sought to withdraw the form.Â  On May 8, 2000, Employee requested \r\n  that the Form 50 be withdrawn.Â  At that time, the Commission had merely written \r\n  a letter asking the attorneys to draft an order.Â  Attached to the letter were \r\n  â€œnotesâ€ outlining the Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  The final order incorporating \r\n  these findings was not signed until September 6, 2000.Â Â Â  \r\nGiven these facts, it is my opinion that the letter \r\n  and its accompanying notes do not constitute an order, and until an order has \r\n  been issued, and the case removed from the docket, Employee had the right to \r\n  withdraw the Form 50.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s rulings on the remaining \r\n    issues raised by Employee pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following \r\n    authority: Pratt v.

Did the Court of Appeals err by affirming the trial courtâ€™s failure to suppress \r\n  an in-court identification?\r\nII. Did the Court of Appeals err by holding the trial court improperly disallowed \r\n  Lewisâ€™s attempt to strike a juror who had previously been struck in violation \r\n  of Batson? [2] \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nLewis argues the Court of \r\n  Appeals erred by affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision not to suppress an in-court \r\n  identification or to require an in camera hearing prior to the in-court \r\n  identification.\r\nGill Armstrong and Jane \r\n  Doe [3]  were driving from Virginia to their home in \r\n  Florida with their seven-month-old daughter when they stopped at a motel off \r\n  I-95 in St. George about 11:00 p.m.Â  Armstrong then left to get food.Â  Upon \r\n  his return, he noticed three black males in the breezeway of the motel and assumed \r\n  they were guests of the motel.Â  He had a direct view of the men because of the \r\n  fluorescent lighting in the breezeway.Â  After taking the food into the hotel \r\n  room, Armstrong then went to the vending machines to get drinks.Â  As he began \r\n  to place money in the machine, the three men walked up to him and placed a gun \r\n  to the back of his head.\r\nThe men then forced him \r\n  into the motel room.Â  Before entering the room, the men turned him around and \r\n  Armstrong saw Washington holding the gun to his head.Â  When they entered the \r\n  room, the lights were on.Â  Doe was just getting out of the shower and was clad \r\n  only in a towel.Â  Lewis asked where the money and jewelry was.Â  While Lewis \r\n  was digging in a duffel bag, Washington instructed Lewis to turn off the lights.Â  \r\n  Before the lights were turned off, Armstrong was able to view his assailants \r\n  for a few minutes. \r\nAfter the men did not find \r\n  anything, Washington pointed the gun at Armstrongâ€™s daughter who was still asleep \r\n  and said, â€œIf you try anything, sheâ€™s gone.â€Â  The men became extremely angry \r\n  when they discovered the couple had only $14.Â  At this point, Armstrong was \r\n  taken into the bathroom and was placed on his knees, bending over into the bathtub, \r\n  with the gun pointed at him.Â  At first, Lewis held Armstrong in the bathroom \r\n  at gunpoint, but then the third man, Shermaine Elmore, \r\n  [4]  switched with Lewis.\r\nDoe testified that two of \r\n  the men, allegedly Lewis and Washington, then took turns forcing her to perform \r\n  oral sex on them.Â  Washington then took Doe into the bathroom, bent her over \r\n  the toilet, and raped her while forcing Armstrong to watch.Â  Then, the men asked \r\n  for Armstrongâ€™s car keys.Â  As they left, Washington told Armstrong â€œHappy Fatherâ€™s \r\n  Day.â€ [5] Â  The men then took the coupleâ€™s car and burned \r\n  it.\r\nDoe was not able to give \r\n  a description of the attackers. [6] Â  However, Armstrong told the \r\n  police that the men were black males and gave general descriptions of their \r\n  height, facial hair, and clothing. [7] Â  A few days later, Shermaine Elmore informed the police he \r\n  was the lookout during the crimes.Â  Elmore told the police that Washington and \r\n  Lewis were the two men who sexually assaulted Doe.Â  Armstrong confirmed at trial \r\n  that Elmore had no involvement in the sexual assault.\r\nAt trial, Armstrong identified \r\n  Washington and Lewis as the perpetrators.Â  In fact, Armstrong stated he was \r\n  â€œ100 percent positiveâ€ in his identification of Lewis.Â  Further, Armstrong testified \r\n  the individuals that committed the crimes were â€œstuck in [his] mind.â€Â  Counsel \r\n  objected to the in-court identification and requested an in camera hearing \r\n  to determine the reliability of his identification.Â  The trial judge denied \r\n  the request, and ruled that Armstrong could identify the defendants in court, \r\n  even though Armstrong had never previously identified them. [8] \r\nThe Court of Appeals held \r\n  that, since Armstrong had never previously identified the defendants, no hearing \r\n  was necessary. [9] Â  The court further held that \r\n  the reliability of Armstrongâ€™s identification was a question for the jury and \r\n  that Lewisâ€™ counsel extensively cross-examined Armstrong regarding the identification.Â  \r\n  In his dissent, Judge Anderson concurred in the result but found that the trial \r\n  judge should have held an in camera hearing to determine the reliability \r\n  of Armstrongâ€™s identification.\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision represents the majority view that the Neil v. Biggers \r\n  [10]  analysis should not be extended to protect criminal defendants against \r\n  identifications that occur for the first time in court without a pre-trial identification.Â  \r\n  In Neil v. Biggers, the United States Supreme Court found that a court \r\n  must review the totality of the circumstances to determine whether an identification \r\n  is reliable.Â  See also State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 322 S.E.2d \r\n  15 (1984).Â  The factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification \r\n  include:Â  (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the accused; (2) the witnessâ€™ \r\n  degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™ prior description; (4) \r\n  the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and \r\n  (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  Neil v. \r\n  Biggers, 409 U.S. at 199; State v. Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 361 S.E.2d \r\n  329 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1079 (1988).\r\nWe conclude, as the majority \r\n  of courts have, that Neil v. Biggers does not apply to in-court identifications \r\n  and that the remedy for any alleged suggestiveness of an in-court identification \r\n  is cross-examination and argument.Â  The United States Supreme Court has not \r\n  extended its exclusionary rule to in-court identification procedures that are \r\n  suggestive because of the trial setting.Â  See State v. Smith, \r\n  512 A.2d 189, 193 (Conn. 1986).\r\nThe Georgia supreme \r\n  court has stated, â€œ[b]ecause pretrial identification procedures occur beyond \r\n  the immediate supervision of the court, the likelihood of misidentification \r\n  in such cases increases, and courts have required that pretrial identification \r\n  procedures comport with certain minimum constitutional requirements in order \r\n  to ensure fairness.â€Â  Ralston v. State, 309 S.E.2d 135, 136 (Ga. 1983).Â  \r\n  See also United States v. Domina, 784 F.2d 1361 (9th \r\n  Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1038 (1987) (concern with in-court \r\n  identification, where there has been suggestive pretrial identification, is \r\n  that witness later identifies the person in court, not from his recollection \r\n  of observations at time of crime, but from suggestive pretrial identification).Â  \r\n  However, as the Ralston court explained, these extra safeguards are not \r\n  applicable to an in-court identification because the witnessâ€™ testimony is subject \r\n  to the same rules of evidence, witness credibility, and cross-examination as \r\n  all testimony in a criminal trial.Â  Ralston v. State, 309 S.E.2d at 136-137.Â  \r\n  See also United States v. Bush, 749 F.2d 1227 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1058 (1985) (deference shown jury \r\n  in weighing reliability of potentially suggestive out-of-court identification \r\n  would seem even more appropriate for in-court identifications where jury is \r\n  present and able to see first-hand the circumstances which may influence a witness); \r\n  People v. Brazeau, 759 N.Y.S.2d 268 (N.Y. 2003) (where there has not \r\n  been a pretrial identification and defendant is identified in court for first \r\n  time, defendant is not deprived of fair trial because defendant is able to explore \r\n  weaknesses and suggestiveness of identification in front of the jury); State \r\n  v.

Rodriguez, 480 N.E.2d 1147, 1151 (Ill. App. 1985) cert. \r\n  denied, 475 U.S. 1089 (1986) (where witness first identifies defendant at \r\n  trial, defense counsel may test perceptions, memory, and bias of witness, contemporaneously \r\n  exposing weaknesses and adding perspective to lessen hazards of undue weight \r\n  or mistake). \r\n Accordingly, we \r\n  conclude Neil v. Biggers does not apply to a first-time in-court identification \r\n  because the judge is present and can adequately address relevant problems; the \r\n  jury is physically present to witness the identification, rather than merely \r\n  hearing testimony about it; and cross-examination offers defendants an adequate \r\n  safeguard or remedy against suggestive examinations.Â  Therefore, the Court of \r\n  Appeals properly concluded the trial court did not err by denying Lewisâ€™ request \r\n  for an in camera hearing prior to the in-court identification by Armstrong. \r\n  [11] Â  In any event, Armstrongâ€™s in-court identification was strong, detailed, \r\n  and clear, and would have survived an in camera hearing.\r\nII\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred by holding the trial judge improperly \r\n  disallowed Lewisâ€™ attempt to strike a juror who had previously been struck for \r\n  discriminatory reasons in violation of Batson. \r\n  [12] \r\nDuring jury selection, Lewis exercised peremptory strikes on nine white jurors.Â  \r\n  His co-defendant, Washington, also separately struck nine white jurors, including \r\n  juror 304, a white female.Â  At the end of jury selection, the State requested \r\n  a Batson hearing.Â  Each defendant separately presented reasons for his \r\n  respective strikes.Â  Lewis stated he did not want housewives to be jurors and \r\n  that is why he struck two white females.Â  Washington explained he struck juror \r\n  304 because she was a housewife.Â  In argument, the State pointed out that neither \r\n  Washington nor Lewis had struck Juror 166, who was also a housewife.Â  The trial \r\n  court found several jurors, including juror 304, had been struck for reasons \r\n  not race-neutral or gender-neutral.Â  The parties then began selecting a second \r\n  jury.\r\nJuror 304 was presented again.Â  Washington accepted the juror, but \r\n  Lewis attempted to strike her.Â  At that point, the trial court asked the attorneys \r\n  to approach the bench and told Lewisâ€™ attorney he could not strike the juror \r\n  because the court had already held that the reason for the previous strike was \r\n  pretextual.Â  Lewis therefore accepted the juror.Â  After finishing the second \r\n  jury selection process, Lewis moved to quash the jury and re-select another \r\n  jury because he was not allowed to exercise a peremptory strike.Â  Lewisâ€™ counsel \r\n  argued he should be allowed to strike juror 304 because he had an independent \r\n  reason to strike her, i.e. due to her demeanor.Â  The trial court denied \r\n  the motion and stated counsel was â€œstuck with [the reason] given the first time.â€\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the grounds that \r\n  Lewis had not previously attempted to strike the juror, only Washington had, \r\n  and because Lewis gave a race-neutral reason for striking the juror that was \r\n  different from Washingtonâ€™s reason.\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision not to allow Lewis to strike a juror who had previously been stricken \r\n  in violation of Batson.Â  See State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, \r\n  512 S.E.2d 500 (1999) (trial courtâ€™s findings of purposeful discrimination rest \r\n  largely on courtâ€™s evaluation of demeanor and credibility, and reviewing court \r\n  should give the findings great deference on appeal).\r\nAs we stated in State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  357, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 856 (1995), to hold that a trial court may \r\n  not seat a juror who was previously improperly excluded by defense counsel due \r\n  to a Batson violation would reward a party for his own improper conduct. [13] Â  Lewis offered a reason for striking juror \r\n  304, i.e., due to her demeanor, [14]  that was different from the \r\n  reason his co-defendant struck juror 304, i.e. she was a housewife.Â  \r\n  However, the previous discriminatory explanation that the juror was stricken \r\n  because she was a housewife tainted the selection process.Â  This is true regardless \r\n  of the other explanations for the strike.Â  See Payton v. Kearse, \r\n  329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (discriminatory explanation vitiates entire \r\n  selection process regardless of genuineness of other explanations for the strike).Â  \r\n  â€œTo excuse such obvious prejudice because the challenged party can also articulate \r\n  nondiscriminatory reasons for the peremptory strike would erode what little \r\n  protection Batson provides against discrimination in jury selection.â€Â  \r\n  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. at 60, 495 S.E.2d at 210.Â  See also \r\n  Coleman v. Hogan, 486 S.E.2d 548 (Va. 1997) (allowing a constitutionally \r\n  proper reason to override a constitutionally infirm reason if the acceptable \r\n  reason is given later would erode the constitutional protections enunciated \r\n  in Batson and its progeny).\r\nTo allow a striking party to challenge the reseated juror a second \r\n  time would require the trial court to ignore its prior determination and the \r\n  prior explanations and conduct each successive evaluation of a newly proffered \r\n  rationale as if on a blank slate.Â  Coleman v. Hogan, supra.Â  Such \r\n  a process improperly restricts the ability of the trial court to make the required \r\n  evaluation.Â  Id.\r\nWe conclude that once a juror has been unconstitutionally stricken, \r\n  the jury selection process relative to that juror is tainted.Â  If the trial \r\n  court chooses to reseat the improperly stricken juror, the striking party may \r\n  not use a peremptory strike to remove that juror from the panel a second time.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision not \r\n  to suppress an in-court identification.Â  However, we find the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by finding the trial court had erred by not allowing Lewis to strike a \r\n  juror who had previously been struck in violation of Batson.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice A. Victor \r\n  Rawl, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Washington \r\n    received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for the two kidnapping \r\n    charges, the first-degree CSC charge, and the armed robbery charge.Â  He also \r\n    received five yearsâ€™ imprisonment for each of the following charges:Â  unlawful \r\n    possession of a pistol, possession of a weapon during a certain crime, and \r\n    grand larceny.Â  All of the sentences were to be served consecutively.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Batson \r\n    v.

[1] Â  The \r\n  South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, Office of Ocean \r\n  and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) granted the permit.Â  After a contested \r\n  hearing, the Administrative Law Judge Division (ALJD) upheld the grant.Â  On \r\n  appeal the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel of OCRM (the Panel) affirmed.Â  \r\n  The circuit court reversed and vacated the permit.Â  We certified the case for \r\n  review under Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision and \r\n  reinstate the permit.\r\nFACTS\r\nLandTech of Charleston, L.L.C. (LandTech) applied to OCRM for a permit to build \r\n  a bridge across the marshes of the Wando River to Park Island in the Town of \r\n  Mt. Pleasant.Â  OCRM staff deemed Park Island a small island and therefore considered \r\n  the permit application governed by the access-to-small-islands regulation, Regulation \r\n  30-12(N) (Small Islands Regulation). [2] Â Â Â  LandTech claimed that Park \r\n  Island was not a small island and that the application was governed by the transportation-projects \r\n  regulation, Regulation 30-12(F) (Transportation Regulation). [3] Â  OCRM disagreed and processed the permit application under \r\n  the Small Islands Regulation, the criteria of which are more stringent than \r\n  those of the Transportation Regulation.Â  OCRM granted the permit.Â  \r\nRespondents objected and requested a contested hearing before the ALJD.Â  At \r\n  the hearing, LandTech raised its argument that Park Island was not a small island \r\n  and that the Transportation Regulation, not the Small Islands Regulation, governed.Â  \r\n  Respondents countered that Park Island was a small island and that the criteria \r\n  for the grant of a permit for bridge access had not been met.Â  OCRM staff agreed \r\n  with Respondents that Park Island was a small island but argued that the Small \r\n  Islands Regulation was satisfied.Â  \r\nThe Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) observed that â€œsmall islandâ€ is not defined \r\n  in the regulations and decided â€œthere needs to be some standard to guide the \r\n  OCRM in its application of its regulation dealing with bridges to islands.â€Â  \r\n  The ALJ compared Park Island only to other islands within the Wando River basin; \r\n  islands in other coastal areas were not considered.Â  Because Park Island was \r\n  larger than eighty percent of the Wando River basinâ€™s islands, the ALJ found \r\n  that Park Island was not a small island.Â  He therefore adopted LandTechâ€™s position \r\n  that the application was governed by the Transportation Regulation, not the \r\n  Small Islands Regulation.Â  He held that the Transportation Regulation was satisfied \r\n  and upheld the permit. \r\nNevertheless, because OCRM staff had granted the permit under the Small Islands \r\n  Regulation, the ALJ addressed whether the permit complied with that regulation \r\n  assuming Park Island were small.Â  He found that each factor in the regulation \r\n  that OCRM must consider weighed in favor of granting the permit.Â  He stated \r\n  that even if the Small Islands Regulation were the governing regulation, its \r\n  criteria had been satisfied.Â  \r\nRespondents appealed to the Panel, which affirmed without analysis.Â  \r\nRespondents then appealed to the circuit court, which reversed.Â  With respect \r\n  to the issue whether the Transportation Regulation or Small Islands Regulation \r\n  governed, the court held that the ALJ erred by using a test not promulgated \r\n  by regulation.Â  The court deferred to OCRM staff and found that Park Island \r\n  was in fact a small island and that the permit application was therefore governed \r\n  by the Small Islands Regulation.Â  The court held that the permitâ€™s issuance \r\n  did not comply with that regulationâ€™s criteria.Â  \r\nIn addition, the circuit court held that there was not substantial evidence \r\n  to support the finding that the permitâ€™s issuance complied with the regulation \r\n  requiring OCRM to consider the direct and cumulative effects of a project, Regulation \r\n  30-11 (Effects Regulation). [4] Â  \r\n  The court vacated the grant of the permit.\r\nLandTech appeals, arguing that the Transportation Regulation is the \r\n  governing project-specific regulation and that its criteria are satisfied.Â  \r\n  OCRM also appeals, arguing that the Small Islands Regulation governs and that \r\n  its criteria are satisfied.Â  Both argue that the grant of the permit complies \r\n  with the Effects Regulation.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Whether the Transportation Regulation or the Small Islands Regulation \r\n  is the governing project-specific regulation.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Whether the grant of the permit complies with the governing project-specific \r\n  regulation.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Whether the grant of the permit complies with the Effects Regulation.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe ALJ presided as the finder of fact at the contested hearing.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2003).Â  The Panelâ€™s review of the ALJâ€™s decision was \r\n  governed by South Carolina Code section 1-23-610(D). [5] Â  The circuit courtâ€™s appellate review of the Panelâ€™s decision \r\n  was governed by section 1-23-380(A)(6), \r\n  [6]  which also governs this Courtâ€™s review of the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  Brown v. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560 S.E.2d \r\n  410, 413 (2002).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 48-39-30 \r\n  [7]  sets forth state policy with respect to development of critical area.Â  \r\n  Section 48-39-150 [8]  lists general \r\n  considerations for OCRM to consider when deciding whether to grant a permit.Â  \r\n  The Effects Regulation repeats these policies and considerations and further \r\n  requires OCRM to consider the cumulative effects of a project in critical area.Â  \r\n  Regulation 30-12 [9]  sets forth project-specific criteria for proposed \r\n  construction in critical area, including transportation projects and projects \r\n  for access to small islands.\r\nI.Â  The Governing Project-Specific RegulationÂ  \r\nThe circuit court held that the Small Islands Regulation, not the Transportation \r\n  Regulation, was the governing project-specific regulation.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAs a creature of statute,â€ OCRM has â€œonly those powers expressly conferred \r\n  or necessarily implied for it to effectively fulfill the duties with which it \r\n  is charged.â€Â  Captainâ€™s Quarters Motor Inn, Inc. v. S.C. Coastal Council, \r\n  306 S.C. 488, 490, 413 S.E.2d 13, 14 (1991).Â  OCRM has the duty to approve or \r\n  deny permit applications.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-50(G) (Supp. 2003).Â  To fulfill \r\n  this duty, OCRM must promulgate rules and regulations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-130(B) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).\r\nWhether an island is small is the threshold issue in determining whether the \r\n  Transportation Regulation or the Small Islands Regulation is the governing project-specific \r\n  regulation.Â  No statute or regulation defines â€œsmall island.â€Â  The circuit court \r\n  held that the ALJ and Panelâ€™s test for determining whether an island is small \r\n  - comparing Park Island only to other islands within the same watershed - was \r\n  invalid because it was not promulgated by regulation.Â  We agree. \r\nThe circuit court also held that Park Island was a small island, using no test \r\n  but rather deferring to OCRM staff.Â  OCRM and Respondents assert that â€œsmallâ€ \r\n  is a term of common understanding, so no particular test is necessary.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSmallâ€ is a term of subjective relativity, and the regulations provide no \r\n  benchmark for comparative size.Â  Smallness arguably could be determined per \r\n  watershed, with respect to all of South Carolinaâ€™s islands, or on an absolute \r\n  scale.Â  The problem is that there is nothing to interpret or apply. \r\n  [10] Â  Allowing OCRM to exercise unrestrained discretion is inconsistent \r\n  with the statute requiring the agency to evaluate permit applications pursuant \r\n  to regulation. [11] Â  See \r\n  Captainâ€™s Quarters Motor Inn, Inc., 306 S.C. at 490-91, 413 S.E.2d at \r\n  14 (invalidating a test used by OCRMâ€™s predecessor in evaluating permit applications \r\n  because it was not promulgated by regulation); see also \r\n  Edisto Aquaculture Corp. v. S.C. Wildlife and Marine Res. Depâ€™t, \r\n  311 S.C. 37, 40, 426 S.E.2d 753, 755 (1993) (distinguishing mandatory agency \r\n  enabling statutes from permissive ones).Â Â  \r\nThat there is no promulgated test means that the Small Islands Regulation fails \r\n  for vagueness. [12] Â  Any test \r\n  to determine whether an island is small is invalid as not promulgated by regulation.Â  \r\n  Â Â \r\nIn light of the Small Islands Regulationâ€™s invalidity, the circuit court should \r\n  have deferred to the Panelâ€™s decision that the permit was governed by the Transportation \r\n  Regulation.Â  Courts defer to the relevant administrative agencyâ€™s decisions \r\n  with respect to its own regulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.Â  \r\n  Brown, 348 S.C. at 515, 560 S.E.2d at 414; Byerly Hosp. v. Health \r\n  and Human Serv. Fin. Commâ€™n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1995).Â  \r\n  The Panel, not OCRM staff, is entitled to deference from the courts.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(A) (Supp. 2003); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-40(A) (Supp. \r\n  2003); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150(D) (Supp. 2003); see also Dorman \r\n  v. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 167, 565 S.E.2d 119, \r\n  123-24 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nThere was no compelling reason to overrule the Panelâ€™s decision that the Transportation \r\n  Regulation governed.Â  Despite its adoption of the invalid ALJ test to determine \r\n  whether an island is small, [13] \r\n   the Panelâ€™s conclusion that the Transportation Regulation controlled was \r\n  correct.Â  As OCRM Director of Permitting and Certification Richard Chinnis testified, \r\n  the Transportation Regulation is the default bridge regulation.Â  OCRM staff \r\n  would have applied it had the staff recognized that the Small Islands Regulation \r\n  was invalid.\r\nConsequently, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision and hold that the Transportation \r\n  Regulation was the governing project-specific regulation.Â  \r\nII.Â  Compliance With The Transportation \r\n  Regulation\r\nAfter holding that the Transportation Regulation was the governing project-specific \r\n  regulation, the ALJ held that the regulationâ€™s criteria were met.Â  As already \r\n  noted, the Panel affirmed without analysis.Â  \r\nThe criteria of the Small Islands Regulation are much more stringent than those \r\n  of the Transportation Regulation.Â  In fact, Respondents have not disputed the \r\n  meeting of the Transportation Regulationâ€™s criteria. Â Rather, as already discussed, \r\n  Respondents have argued only that the Small Islands Regulation controls and \r\n  that its more stringent criteria are not met.Â  Because of our resolution of \r\n  the first issue, however, we address only the unchallenged ruling that the permitâ€™s \r\n  issuance complied with the criteria of the Transportation Regulation.Â Â  \r\nA ruling not challenged on appeal is the law of the case, regardless of the \r\n  correctness of the ruling.Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E. \r\n  Underwriters Risk Retention Group, 353 S.C. 249, 251, 578 S.E.2d 8, 9 n.1 \r\n  (2003).Â  The law of this case is that the grant of the permit complied with \r\n  the Transportation Regulation.Â Â  \r\nMoreover, notwithstanding the law of the case, there is substantial evidence \r\n  to support the finding that the grant of the permit complied with the Transportation \r\n  Regulation.Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify an administrative decision \r\n  if the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion that the administrative agency reached.â€Â  Southeast Res.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 \r\n  S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)).Â  â€œ[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions \r\n  from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being \r\n  supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. \r\n  Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984).\r\nThere is conflicting evidence in the record regarding the permit issuanceâ€™s \r\n  compliance with the Transportation Regulation.Â  The evidence that the issuance \r\n  did comply constitutes substantial evidence.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Compliance With The Effects \r\n  Regulation\r\nRegulation 30-11(B) requires OCRM to consider the direct effects \r\n  of a project in critical area.Â  Regulation 30-11(C)(1) requires OCRM to be guided \r\n  by â€œ[t]he extent to which long-range, cumulative effects of the project may \r\n  result within the context of other possible development and the general character \r\n  of the area.â€ [14] \r\nThe circuit court held that there was not substantial evidence to support the \r\n  finding that the grant of the permit complied with the Effects Regulation.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe record contains conflicting evidence concerning the direct and \r\n  cumulative effects of building the bridge to Park Island.Â  The evidence that \r\n  the effects will be minimal constitutes substantial evidence supporting the \r\n  finding that the permit complies with the Effects Regulation.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  view of the weight of the evidence did not justify vacating the grant of the \r\n  permit.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSouth Carolina Regulation 30-12(F), the Transportation Regulation, \r\n  is the project-specific regulation governing this permitâ€™s issuance, and the \r\n  law of the case is that the issuance complies with the Transportation Regulation.Â  \r\n  Further, there is substantial evidence that the issuance also complies with \r\n  Regulation 30-11, the Effects Regulation.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision vacating \r\n  the grant of the permit is therefore\r\n REVERSED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, \r\n  C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I agree with the result reached by the \r\n  majority.Â  In my view, however, OCRM properly granted the permit under the Small \r\n  Islands Regulation.Â  As the ALJ explained, in a decision affirmed by the Panel, \r\n  OCRM determines which regulation governs the issuance of a permit on a â€œcase-by-case \r\n  basis.â€Â  Moreover, the ALJ found that â€œOCRM gave appropriate consideration to \r\n  the 11 specific requirements under [the Small Islands Regulation] in issuing \r\n  the bridge permit . . . and the permit satisfies all 11 requirements.â€Â  Accordingly, \r\n  I agree with the majority that the circuit court decision vacating the grant \r\n  of the permit should be reversed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C.

Ariail, of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  \r\n  A jury convicted Alexander Santee Johnson (Petitioner) of murder.Â  At trial, \r\n  the judge allowed evidence of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions to be admitted.Â  \r\n  The court of appeals affirmed, holding that, although the trial judge erred \r\n  in admitting evidence of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions, the error was harmless.Â  \r\n  State v. Johnson, Op. No. 2003-UP-188 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 12, 2003).Â  \r\n  This Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the court of appeals.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner was convicted \r\n  of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  On direct appeal, this Court \r\n  reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.Â  State v. \r\n  Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 508 S.E.2d 29 (1998).\r\nPetitioner was retried \r\n  for murder in 2000.Â  At trial, Petitioner sought to have his 1986 convictions \r\n  for second-degree burglary and grand larceny excluded from evidence on the basis \r\n  that the convictions were more than ten years old.Â  The trial judge ruled that \r\n  the prior convictions were admissible because they were within ten years of \r\n  the alleged offense and they were crimes of moral turpitude.\r\nOn direct examination, Petitioner acknowledged \r\n  the prior convictions and stated that he spent thirty days in a juvenile facility \r\n  when he was twelve or thirteen years old. \r\n  [1] Â  Petitioner was not questioned about his prior convictions on cross \r\n  examination.\r\nAfter closing argument, but before the \r\n  judge charged the jury, the judge clarified his ruling on the admissibility \r\n  of the prior convictions.Â  The judge reasoned that the probative value of the \r\n  prior convictions outweighed their prejudicial effect.\r\nThe jury convicted Petitioner of murder, \r\n  and he appealed.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, \r\n  holding that the admission of the prior convictions was harmless.Â  State \r\n  v. Johnson, Op. No. 2003-UP-188 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 12, 2003).Â  This \r\n  Court granted certiorari, and Petitioner now raises the following issues for \r\n  review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       \r\n  Did the trial court apply the proper legal standard in calculating the ten-year \r\n  time limit under Rule 609(b), SCRE?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      Did the trial court err by using the moral turpitude standard to determine the \r\n  admissibility of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      Did the trial court err in failing to conduct the proper balancing test as set \r\n  forth by State v. Colf?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      Did the admission of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions constitute prejudicial error?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 609(b), \r\n  SCRE\r\nPetitioner argues that the trial \r\n  judge erred in admitting Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions because the trial judge \r\n  did not apply the proper legal standard in calculating the ten-year time limit \r\n  under Rule 609(b), SCRE.Â  We agree.\r\nEvidence of a prior conviction is admissible \r\n  to impeach a witness unless a period of more than ten years has elapsed since \r\n  the date (1) of the conviction or (2) of the release of the witness from confinement \r\n  for that conviction, whichever date is later.Â  Rule 609(b), SCRE.Â  The evidence \r\n  is admissible, however, if the trial judge determines that the probative value \r\n  of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.Â  Id.\r\n In 1986, Petitioner was sentenced to thirty days \r\n  as a juvenile for grand larceny and burglary.Â  The record does not reflect which \r\n  date is later, the date of the conviction or the release from confinement.Â  \r\n  What is certain is that the time of release from confinement and the date of \r\n  the conviction are both pre-1990.Â  Because Petitionerâ€™s trial was in 2000, the \r\n  1986 conviction was improperly admitted.Â  Therefore, we hold that the trial \r\n  court erred in calculating the ten-year time period under Rule 609(b), SCRE.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMoral Turpitude Standard \r\n   \r\nPetitioner \r\n  argues that the trial judge erred by using the moral turpitude standard to determine \r\n  that Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions were admissible.Â  We agree, but the issue \r\n  is not preserved for review.\r\nUnder \r\n  prior common law, moral turpitude was described as â€œan act of baseness, vileness, \r\n  or depravity in the social duties which a man owes to his fellow man or to society \r\n  in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule or right and duty between \r\n  man and man.â€Â  State v. Harvey, 275 S.C. 225, 227, 268 S.E.2d 587, 588 \r\n  (1980).Â  But the common law rule was replaced when South Carolina adopted Rule \r\n  609(a), SCRE.Â  Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 432, 527 S.E.2d 98, 100 \r\n  (2000).\r\nToday, \r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provide that if the witness has been convicted \r\n  of a crime that is punishable by death or imprisonment of more than one year, \r\n  and the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect, \r\n  the conviction is admissible to attack the witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  Rule 609(a)(1), \r\n  SCRE.Â  In addition, if the crime involved dishonesty or a false statement the \r\n  conviction is admissible to attack the witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  Rule 609(a)(2),\r\nSCRE.\r\n In \r\n  the present case, Petitioner had prior convictions of burglary and grand larceny.Â  \r\n  To determine whether Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions were admissible, the judge \r\n  applied the common law moral turpitude test.Â  Because the prior convictions \r\n  were crimes of moral turpitude, the judge ruled that Petitionerâ€™s convictions \r\n  were admissible.Â  \r\nSince the adoption of Rule 609, the moral turpitude standard is no longer \r\n  the proper test for determining the admission of remote prior convictions.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the trial court erred in using the moral turpitude standard to determine \r\n  the admissibility of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions.\r\nAlthough \r\n  we hold that the trial judge erred in applying the moral turpitude standard, \r\n  we find that Petitioner did not preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  To \r\n  preserve an issue for review there must be a contemporaneous objection that \r\n  is ruled upon by the trial court.Â  State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, \r\n  476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996).Â  The objection should be addressed to the trial \r\n  court in a sufficiently specific manner that brings attention to the exact error.Â  \r\n  State v. Priouleau, 345 S.C. 404, 411, 548 S.E.2d 213, 216 (2001).Â  If \r\n  a party fails to properly object, the party is procedurally barred from raising \r\n  the issue on appeal.Â  State v. Pauling, 322 S.C. 95, 99, 470 S.E.2d 106, \r\n  109Â  (1996).\r\nIn \r\n  the present case, trial counsel did not specifically object to the application \r\n  of the moral turpitude standard.Â  Instead, trial counsel objected to the admissibility \r\n  of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions on the basis that the convictions were too \r\n  remote.Â  When objecting, counsel stated that â€œitâ€™s now 14 years later.â€Â  Because \r\n  the objection was clearly based on remoteness and not the use of the moral turpitude \r\n  standard, we hold that the issue regarding the use of the moral turpitude standard \r\n  is not preserved for appellate review.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nColf \r\n  Balancing Test  \r\nPetitioner argues that the trial court erred by \r\n  failing to conduct the proper balancing test in determining whether Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  prior convictions were admissible.Â  We agree.\r\nThis Court has held that a trial judge must conduct \r\n  a balancing test to determine whether remote convictions are admissible under \r\n  Rule 609(b).Â  State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 626, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2000).Â  \r\n  Rule 609(b) creates a presumption that remote convictions are inadmissible and \r\n  places the burden on the State to overcome this presumption.Â  Id. at \r\n  626-627, 525 S.E.2d at 248.Â Â  When considering whether to admit prior convictions, \r\n  a trial judge should consider the following factors:\r\n\r\n  (1) Â Â Â  The impeachment value of the prior crime;\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  The point in time of the conviction and \r\n  the witnessâ€™s subsequent history;\r\n(3)Â Â Â Â  The similarity of the past crime and the \r\n  charged crime;\r\n(4)Â Â Â Â  The importance of the defendantâ€™s testimony; \r\n  and\r\n(5) Â Â Â  The centrality of the credibility issue.\r\n\r\nId. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248.Â  After the \r\n  trial court conducts the balancing test, the judge must make a determination \r\n  and articulate, on the record, the specific reasons for his ruling.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the judge explained that the prior \r\n  convictions were admissible because the probative value outweighed the prejudicial \r\n  effect.Â  However, the trial judge did not articulate why the probative value \r\n  outweighed the prejudicial effect.Â  We hold that a trial judge must conduct \r\n  the Colf balancing test when considering the admission of remote prior \r\n  convictions with reference to the factors enumerated in that opinion.Â  Therefore, \r\n  in the present case, the trial court erred by not conducting the proper balancing \r\n  test. \r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmless \r\n  Error\r\nPetitioner argues that the admission of the prior convictions constituted prejudicial \r\n  error.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo constitute error, a ruling to admit or exclude evidence must affect a substantial \r\n  right.Â  Rule 103(a), SCRE.Â  An error is harmless if the defendantâ€™s guilt has \r\n  been conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other result could \r\n  have been reached.Â  Prioleau, 345 S.C. at 407-408, 548 S.E.2d at 214-215.Â  \r\n  The circumstances of each individual case are to be considered.Â  State v. \r\n  Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1986).Â  In addition, the \r\n  error is harmless if the error could not have reasonably affected the outcome \r\n  of the trial.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, defense counsel strategically introduced Petitionerâ€™s prior \r\n  convictions on direct examination to lessen the impact they might have on Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  credibility.Â  Furthermore, the prosecution placed no other emphasis on these \r\n  prior convictions.Â  Therefore, we find that the impact was minimal because other \r\n  evidence introduced by the prosecution likely damaged Petitionerâ€™s credibility.Â  \r\n\r\nFor example, there was testimony that upon arrest, Petitioner gave the \r\n  police a false name.Â  In addition, there was testimony that the fight that led \r\n  to the death of the victim was over a stolen car.Â  We find that this testimony \r\n  was more damaging to Petitionerâ€™s credibility than the introduction of the prior \r\n  convictions.Â  Therefore, the introduction of the prior convictions was not prejudicial \r\n  to Petitionerâ€™s case.\r\nBecause there was overwhelming evidence of Petitionerâ€™s guilt, we do not believe \r\n  the admission of the Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions could have reasonably affected \r\n  the outcome of the trial, and therefore the error was harmless. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, the decision of the court of appeals is AFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and\r\nActing Justice A. Victor Rawl, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  After the judge ruled against the motion to exclude the prior convictions, \r\n    Petitioner decided to present evidence of the convictions on direct examination \r\n    to lessen the impact that they might have on the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25946","title":"Pittman v.

Lowtherâ€™s (Respondentâ€™s) \r\n  property.Â  Pittman v. Lowther, 355 S.C. 536, 586 S.E.2d 149 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1972, \r\n  Weldon Wall purchased Good Hope Plantation from Good Hope Corporation.Â  At that \r\n  time, trails and plantation roads crossed the 3,000-acre tract.Â Â  One such road, \r\n  known as Wellington Road, continues to exist and is the subject of this dispute.Â  \r\n\r\nWall divided \r\n  Good Hope Plantation into two parcels:Â  Parcel A contained approximately 2,340 \r\n  acres and Parcel B contained approximately 661 acres.Â  Both parcels have frontage \r\n  on Highway 278.Â  In 1973, Wall sold Parcel A to Petitioner.Â  Mary Wilcox later \r\n  purchased Parcel B at a foreclosure sale.Â  In 1975, Petitioner bought 279 acres \r\n  of Parcel B.Â  The 279-acre parcel purchased by Petitioner did not abut any public \r\n  roads.Â  At the time Petitioner purchased the 279-acre tract of land there was \r\n  a hunting lodge on it, which Petitioner then made his home.Â  Petitioner used \r\n  168 feet of Wellington Road to travel to his home.Â  Around 1980, Petitioner \r\n  built a road, which served as an additional driveway, leading from his home \r\n  to Highway 278, crossing his 2,340-acre tract of land.Â  The Wellington Road \r\n  driveway is more convenient for Petitioner to use because it is closer to town.Â  \r\n  In 1976, Wilcox sold approximately 312 acres to Respondent. The 168-foot portion \r\n  of Wellington Road in dispute crosses over Respondentâ€™s land.Â Â  \r\nAround 1982, \r\n  Respondent began to place obstacles such as setting posts and cables across \r\n  Wellington Road to prevent Petitioner from using the road.Â  Petitioner continued \r\n  to drive on Wellington Road, either going around the obstacles or pushing them \r\n  down.Â  Respondent replaced the obstacles when Petitioner ignored or destroyed \r\n  them.Â  Respondent reported Petitionerâ€™s actions to law enforcement authorities \r\n  when Petitioner used his tractor to uproot a couple of small trees and scraped \r\n  the road with his tractor.\r\nIn 1992, Petitioner \r\n  stopped using the road for about four or five months while a mutual friend attempted \r\n  to mediate the dispute.Â  The attempt to mediate was unsuccessful and Petitioner \r\n  resumed use of Wellington Road.Â  \r\nThe trial court \r\n  concluded Petitioner established a private prescriptive easement to the portion \r\n  of Wellington Road in dispute.Â Â Â  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding \r\n  the trial court erred in finding Petitioner enjoyed uninterrupted adverse use \r\n  of the land for the twenty-year period necessary to establish an easement by \r\n  prescription.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded Respondentâ€™s repeated attempts \r\n  to prevent Petitioner from crossing Respondentâ€™s land constituted interruptions \r\n  in Petitionerâ€™s use and enjoyment of the disputed portion of Wellington Road. \r\n  [1]   \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in \r\n  concluding Petitioner does not have a prescriptive easement over Respondentâ€™s \r\n  property because Petitionerâ€™s use was interrupted during the requisite twenty-year \r\n  period?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe \r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law \r\n  action and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by a judge \r\n  without a jury.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 496 S.E.2d 633 (1998).Â Â  \r\n  To establish a prescriptive easement, there must be continued and uninterrupted \r\n  use or enjoyment of the right for a period of twenty years, identity of the \r\n  thing enjoyed must be proven, and use must be adverse or under claim of right.Â  \r\n  Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993).Â  \r\nPetitioner \r\n  argues Respondentâ€™s efforts to interrupt Petitionerâ€™s use were ineffective and, \r\n  therefore, did not prevent Petitionerâ€™s use from ripening into possession.Â  \r\n  Petitioner testified he has used Wellington Road continuously from approximately \r\n  1972 until 1992 or sometime thereafter.Â  \r\nWe have not \r\n  previously addressed the issue of what constitutes an interruption in the context \r\n  of establishing a prescriptive easement where the owner of the servient tenement \r\n  erects barriers that are repeatedly ignored by the owner of the dominant tenement.Â  \r\n  Numerous courts have held when the potential servient owner, by either threats \r\n  or physical barriers, succeeds in causing a discontinuance of the use, no \r\n  matter how brief, the running of the prescriptive period is stopped.Â  4 \r\n  Powell on Real Property Â§ 34.10[3][b] (2000); see also Talbotâ€™s, \r\n  Inc. v. Cessnun Enterprises, Inc. 566 P.2d 1320 (Ala. 1977) (property ownerâ€™s \r\n  action in conspicuously blocking off area contained in alleged easement prevented \r\n  user from acquiring easement by prescription); Kelley v. Westover, 938 \r\n  S.W.2d 235 (Ark. App. 1997) (prescriptive easement did not vest in neighbor \r\n  where owner built fences and placed various obstructions on property); Serrano \r\n  v. Grisom, 28 Cal. Rptr. 579 (Ca. 1963) (use interrupted by servient owners \r\n  plowing up wheeltrack road and farming land the road formerly crossed); Ludwick \r\n  v. Kassenbrock, 253 S.W.2d 628 (Ky. 1962) (running of prescriptive period \r\n  stopped by closing of passway); Pugh v. Conway, 299 N.E.2d 214 (Ind. \r\n  App. 1973) (use interrupted when servient landowner planted a garden on most \r\n  of disputed area); Dalton v. Real Estate &amp; Import Co., 92 A.2d 585 \r\n  (Md. 1952) (use interrupted by physical barrier); Rice v. Miller, 238 \r\n  N.W.2d 609 (Mn. 1976) (servient landownerâ€™s efforts interrupted prescriptive \r\n  period even though efforts on landownerâ€™s part were not ultimately successful \r\n  in that public circumvented or removed barriers); Ormiston v. Boast, \r\n  413 P.2d 969 (Wash. 1966) (placing fence across road interfered with continuous \r\n  use).Â  \r\nPetitioner \r\n  urges us to adopt the analysis applied by the North Carolina Supreme Court in \r\n  Concerned Citizens of Brunswick County Taxpayers Assâ€™n v. State, 404 \r\n  S.E.2d 677 (N.C. 1991).Â  In Concerned Citizens, the court concluded ineffective \r\n  interruptions will not prevent use from ripening into an easement.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  In that case, the landowner made escalating attempts to stop the public from \r\n  trespassing on its land, first by putting up â€œno trespassingâ€ signs.Â  It then \r\n  placed a telephone pole across the road which the public drove around.Â  Its \r\n  next step was a padlocked cable that eventually grew to 200 feet long in an \r\n  attempt to stop the public from bypassing it.Â  Finally, the landowner used locked \r\n  gates, a guardhouse, and guards, all of which proved unavailing.Â  The majority \r\n  of the court treated the persistent trespassing as proof of the adversity of \r\n  the publicâ€™s use.\r\n We decline \r\n  to adopt the analysis applied by the North Carolina Supreme Court and conclude \r\n  a more reasoned approach was articulated by the Oregon Court of Appeals in Garrett \r\n  v. Mueller, 927 P.2d 612 (Or. App. 1996).Â  The court embraced the opinion \r\n  of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who stated the following in determining \r\n  what a landowner must do to interrupt prescriptive use.\r\n\r\nA landowner \r\n  . . . is not required to battle successfully for his rights.Â  It \r\n  is enough if he asserts them to the other party by an overt act, which, if the easement \r\n  existed, would be a cause of action.Â  Such an assertion interrupts the would-be \r\n  dominant ownerâ€™s impression of acquiescence, and the growth in his mind of a fixed association of \r\n  ideas; or, if the principle of prescription be attributed solely to the acquiescence \r\n  of the servient owner, it shows that acquiescence was not a fact. \r\n\r\nGarrett, 927 P.2d at 617 \r\n  (quoting Brayden v. New York, H.H. &amp; H.R. Co., 51 N.E. 1081, 1081-82 \r\n  (1898)).\r\nWe conclude \r\n  actions are sufficient to interrupt the prescriptive period when the servient \r\n  landowner engages in overt acts, such as erecting physical barriers, which cause \r\n  a discontinuance of the dominant landownerâ€™s use of the land, no matter how \r\n  brief.Â  In addition to physical barriers, verbal threats which convey to the \r\n  dominant landowner the impression the servient landowner does not acquiesce \r\n  in the use of the land, are also sufficient to interrupt the prescriptive period.Â Â  \r\n  To adopt an interpretation of â€œeffective interruptionâ€ which requires a servient \r\n  landowner to take actions in addition to erecting barriers like fences and cables, \r\n  would encourage wrongful or potentially violent behavior that is contrary to \r\n  sound public policy considerations and the peaceful resolution of disputes.\r\nTurning to \r\n  the present case, we conclude Respondentâ€™s actions were sufficient to interrupt \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s use of the land for the prescriptive period.Â  Not only did Respondent \r\n  set posts and cables across it, but Respondent also plowed the road every year \r\n  and planted the road with rye a couple of years.Â  When Petitioner removed the \r\n  barriers, Respondent replaced them.Â  Respondent also called law enforcement \r\n  authorities when Petitioner used his tractor to destroy the barriers.Â  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  actions caused Petitioner to discontinue use of the land, albeit briefly, and \r\n  were certainly sufficient to leave Petitioner with the impression that Respondent \r\n  did not acquiesce in the use of his land.\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., \r\n  WALLER, J., and Acting Justices Reginald I. Lloyd and R. Markley Dennis, Jr., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â [1] The Court of Appeals also concluded \r\n    the record was devoid of evidence supporting Petitionerâ€™s contention he gained \r\n    the easement by dedication.Â  We granted certiorari to consider this issue \r\n    and now dismiss certiorari as improvidently granted.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25947","title":"Helms Realty v.

Matthew Dove, of Dove Law Firm, of Murrells Inlet, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam Jerad Rissler and J. Christopher Clark, both of Nelson Mullins Riley \r\n  &amp; Scarborough, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is a breach-of-contract case.Â  Appellant Helms \r\n  Realty, Inc. (Appellant) appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Respondent \r\n  Gibson-Wall Company (Respondent).Â  We certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), \r\n  SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant and Respondent orally executed a listing agreement (the Listing Agreement) \r\n  pursuant to which Appellant was to find a buyer of certain property owned by \r\n  Respondent.Â  Respondent claims that an express term of the Listing Agreement \r\n  was that closing of a sale was a condition precedent to Respondentâ€™s obligation \r\n  to pay a commission to Appellant.Â  Appellant claims that the agreement contained \r\n  no express term concerning what triggered the right to a commission.Â  \r\nEventually, Appellant found a potential buyer (the Buyer).Â  Respondent and \r\n  the Buyer fully negotiated and executed a written contract for the sale and \r\n  purchase of the property (the Sales Contract).Â  The Sales Contract contained \r\n  a condition precedent to the Buyerâ€™s obligation to close on the property.Â  The \r\n  Sales Contract also contained a term that the contract would expire if the condition \r\n  remained unsatisfied on a certain date.Â  \r\nAt trial, Respondent argued that through no fault of its own, the condition \r\n  was never satisfied and that the Sales Contract had expired.Â  According to Respondent, \r\n  Appellant earned no commission because the Sales Contract never closed.Â  \r\nAppellant countered that it earned its commission when Respondent and the Buyer \r\n  executed the Sales Contract, regardless whether they closed.Â  \r\nThe jury found for Respondent.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n     Whether the circuit court erred by denying Appellantâ€™s motion for \r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in charging the jury.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Whether the circuit court erred by granting Respondentâ€™s motion\r\n    for summary judgment on Appellantâ€™s third-party-beneficiary\r\n    claim.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appellantâ€™s Motion for JNOV\r\nAppellant argues that the circuit court erred by denying Appellantâ€™s motion \r\n  for JNOV.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA trial court should grant JNOV when the evidence is insufficient to support \r\n  the verdict.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d \r\n  281, 283 (2003).Â  â€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial \r\n  court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can \r\n  be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions \r\n  and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields more than one inference \r\n  or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Id. (quoting Strange v. S.C. Depâ€™t \r\n  of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994)).\r\nAppellant argues that it earned its commission as a matter of law when Respondent \r\n  and the Buyer executed the Sales Contract, even though the Buyerâ€™s performance \r\n  was conditional.Â  Appellantâ€™s interpretation of the law is incorrect.\r\nIn executing a listing agreement, a seller and a real-estate broker may agree \r\n  to any condition precedent to the sellerâ€™s obligation to pay a commission.Â  \r\n  Thomas-McCain, Inc. v. Siter, 268 S.C. 193, 196-97, 232 S.E.2d 728, 729 \r\n  (1977); Hamrick v. Cooper River Lumber Co., 223 S.C. 119, 124, 74 S.E.2d \r\n  575, 577 (1953).Â  If the listing agreement is silent as to what triggers the \r\n  brokerâ€™s right to a commission, then the common law fills the gap.Â  The default \r\n  term is that the broker is entitled to a commission when it procures a sales \r\n  contract that is both valid and enforceable by the seller, regardless whether \r\n  the contract actually closes.Â  Dantzler Real Estate, Inc. v. Boland, \r\n  276 S.C. 275, 277-78, 277 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1981); Cass Co. v. Nannarello, \r\n  274 S.C. 326, 328, 262 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1980); Thomas-McCain, Inc., 268 \r\n  S.C. at 196, 232 S.E.2d at 729; Hamrick, 223 S.C. at 123-24, 74 S.E.2d \r\n  at 577; Fairly v. Wappoo Mills, 44 S.C. 227, 237-38, 22 S.E. 108, 112 \r\n  (1895).Â  \r\nIf the listing agreement is silent as to the point in time at which the broker \r\n  becomes entitled to a commission, and the sales contract contains a condition \r\n  precedent to the buyerâ€™s performance, then the broker is not entitled to a commission \r\n  until the condition is satisfied.Â  Only then is the sales contract enforceable \r\n  by the seller.

App. 1984) (involving a listing agreement with an express \r\n  term having the same effect as that of the default term); see also Catherine \r\n  M.A. Mc Cauliff, Corbin on Contracts vol. 8, Â§ 30.9, 18-19 (Rev. ed., \r\n  LEXIS 1999) (explaining that a condition precedent to performance generally \r\n  affects a contractâ€™s enforceability, not its validity).Â  In that situation, \r\n  effectively, the condition precedent to the buyerâ€™s performance under the sales \r\n  contract is also a condition precedent to the sellerâ€™s performance under the \r\n  listing agreement.Â  \r\nIn this case, the jury had to determine whether it believed Respondent or Appellant \r\n  regarding the disputed term of the oral Listing Agreement.Â  If the jury believed \r\n  Respondent, then closing was the condition precedent to Respondentâ€™s obligation \r\n  to pay a commission.Â  If the jury believed Appellant, then satisfaction of the \r\n  condition in the Sales Contract was the condition precedent to Respondentâ€™s \r\n  obligation.Â  Thus, without regard to which version of the Listing Agreement \r\n  the jury believed, Appellant was not entitled to JNOV. \r\n  [2]   \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Jury Charge \r\nAppellant asserts that it is entitled to a new trial because the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s jury charge was improper.Â  The jury charge is not in the Record \r\n  on Appeal, and Appellant had the burden of providing a sufficient record.Â  See \r\n  Germain v. Nichol, 278 S.C. 508, 509, 299 S.E.2d 335, 335 (1983) (holding \r\n  that the appealing party has the burden of providing a sufficient record).Â  \r\n  We therefore decline to address the merits of Appellantâ€™s claim.Â  See \r\n  Rule 210(h), SCACR; see also State v. Knighton, 334 S.C. 125, \r\n  136, 512 S.E.2d 117, 123 (Ct. App. 1999) (refusing to review a jury charge not \r\n  in the record); Hobgood v. Pennington, 300 S.C. 309, 314, 387 S.E.2d \r\n  690, 693 (Ct. App. 1989) (same); Dennis v. S.C. Natâ€™l Bank, 299 S.C. \r\n  34, 41, 382 S.E.2d 237, 240 (Ct. App. 1988) (same); Scruggs v. Quality Elec. \r\n  Servs., Inc., 282 S.C. 542, 545, 320 S.E.2d 49, 51 (Ct. App. 1984) (same).Â  \r\n\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Appellantâ€™s Third-Party-Beneficiary \r\n  Claim\r\nBefore trial, Appellant argued that it was a third-party beneficiary of the \r\n  Sales Contract.Â  Respondent moved for summary judgment that Appellant could \r\n  not proceed as a third-party beneficiary.Â  Appellant argues that the circuit \r\n  court erred by granting Respondentâ€™s motion.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn reviewing an order of summary judgment, an appellate court applies \r\n  the same standard as that which the circuit court applied in determining whether \r\n  to enter the order.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, \r\n  321 (2001).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate â€œif the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence \r\n  and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party.â€Â  Osborne, 346 S.C. at 7, 550 S.E.2d at 321.\r\nAppellant was not a third-party beneficiary of the Sales Contract.Â  \r\n  A third-party beneficiary is a party that the contracting parties intend to \r\n  directly benefit.Â  Touchberry v. City of Florence, 295 S.C. 47, 48-49, \r\n  367 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1988).Â  There is no evidence that Respondent and the Buyer \r\n  intended to directly benefit Appellant.Â  Appellantâ€™s expected benefit was merely \r\n  incidental.Â  The circuit court properly granted Respondentâ€™s motion for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for JNOV was proper, and the Record \r\n  is insufficient for the Court to review the allegedly improper jury charge.Â  \r\n  Further, the circuit court did not err by granting Respondentâ€™s motion for summary \r\n  judgment on Appellantâ€™s third-party-beneficiary claim.Â  The verdict for Respondent \r\n  is \r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent relies on Wahl v. Hutto, 249 \r\n    S.C. 500, 155 S.E.2d 1 (1967), for this principle.Â  Wahl is not implicated, \r\n    because it involved a condition precedent to the formation of a contract, \r\n    not its performance.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  At trial, there was an issue whether Respondent \r\n    wrongfully prevented satisfaction of the condition precedent to its performance \r\n    under the Listing Agreement, whatever that condition was.Â  A party that wrongfully \r\n    prevents satisfaction of a condition precedent to its performance is not excused \r\n    from performing.Â  Hubbard v. Woodmen of the World, 125 S.C. 154, 156, \r\n    118 S.E. 418, 419 (1923); Chambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 451, 570 \r\n    S.E.2d 528, 532-33 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied, 2003-OR-01141 (S.C. \r\n    Sup. Ct. Dec. 17, 2003); Champion, 280 S.C. at 120, 311 S.E.2d at 406.Â  \r\n    There was conflicting evidence, and Appellant did not base its JNOV motion \r\n    on this issue.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Luther E.

[1] \r\nIt has now come to our attention that a significant, and \r\n  frankly, disappointing number of members of the South Carolina Bar have still \r\n  not met these requirements and, as of March 1, 2005, will be suspended and prohibited \r\n  from practicing law in this State until reinstated.Â  We are not only disappointed \r\n  that a significant number of attorneys in this State have failed to comply with \r\n  an order of this Court, but that they have not taken seriously this opportunity \r\n  to reaffirm their commitment and dedication to upholding the dignity, integrity \r\n  and honor of their profession.Â  In addition, those members who have not complied \r\n  with the oath requirements have not benefited from the sense of renewed dedication \r\n  to the profession that those who have attended the accompanying CLE seminar \r\n  have reported receiving from the experience.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThis Court, in adopting the amended oath, sought for this to \r\n  be a positive opportunity and experience for members of the Bar.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  in order to insure that everyone has had an adequate opportunity to take the \r\n  new oath and attend the accompanying CLE, we extend the deadline for meeting \r\n  these requirements, for a final time, to May 31, 2005.Â  Those members of the \r\n  South Carolina Bar who have not yet done so must certify in writing that they \r\n  have taken the new oath, to include the CLE seminar if applicable, on or before \r\n  May 31, 2005.Â  This certification shall be done on the attached form and sent \r\n  to the South Carolina Bar on or before June 1, 2005.\r\nOn June 1, 2005, any member who has not taken the new oath \r\n  and the accompanying CLE seminar, if applicable, shall be automatically suspended \r\n  from the practice of law in this state by the South Carolina Bar.Â  We emphasize \r\n  that those members suspended at that time will be prohibited from practicing \r\n  law in this State until reinstated.Â  The Bar shall notify these members of their \r\n  suspension, and the Bar may reinstate a member upon a showing that the member \r\n  has taken the new oath and the accompanying CLE seminar, if applicable, and \r\n  payment of a $25 fee made payable to the Commission on Continuing Legal Education \r\n  and Specialization.Â  If not reinstated by the South Carolina Bar before July \r\n  1, 2005, their names will be published in the Shearouse Advance Sheets.\r\nThe South Carolina Bar shall forward to this Court a list of \r\n  the names of those members who remain suspended on August 1, 2005.Â  These members \r\n  shall be suspended by order of this Court and shall thereafter forward their \r\n  certificate of admission to practice law in this State to the Clerk of this \r\n  Court.Â  Any petition for reinstatement shall be submitted as provided by Rule \r\n  419(f), SCACR, and, if not reinstated within three years of the date of being \r\n  suspended by this Court, the memberâ€™s membership in the South Carolina Bar will \r\n  be terminated as provided by Rule 419(g), SCACR.\r\nIT \r\n  IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      s/Jean H.

Lacy and Christian Stegmaier, both of Collins &amp; Lacy, of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  \r\n  This is a workers compensation matter.Â  At issue is which of two insurance \r\n  carriers, The Insurance Corporation of New York (INSCORP) or Capital City Insurance \r\n  Company (Capital), is responsible for coverage for injuries sustained by Celestino \r\n  Rodriguez in a work-related accident on June 27, 2000.Â  The single commissioner \r\n  held Capital was the responsible insurance carrier; the full commission affirmed.Â  \r\n  The circuit court reversed and held INSCORP is the responsible carrier.Â  We \r\n  affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nFACTS\r\nRodriguez was employed \r\n  performing construction-type labor for Hector Romero, a subcontractor.Â  On June \r\n  27, 2000, while installing a new roof on a large commercial building, Rodriguez \r\n  slipped and fell through a skylight opening, suffering numerous injuries.Â  It \r\n  is undisputed that Rodriguez is entitled to workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  \r\n  The only question is which carrier is responsible.\r\nRomero initially purchased \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance from INSCORP in January 1999.Â  The policy was \r\n  cancelled in June 1999 for non-payment.Â  In May 2000, Romero called INSCORPâ€™S \r\n  managing agent, Risk Control, to ask if his policy could be reinstated.Â  Risk \r\n  Control referred him to one of its carriers, Tad Roberts.Â  On May 19, 2000, \r\n  Romero faxed his application to Roberts, who forwarded it to Risk Control.Â  \r\n  Romero sent a partial premium of $704.00 in June 2000.Â  \r\nSometime thereafter, \r\n  Roberts became suspicious Romero was â€œleasingâ€ his employees. [1] Â  Risk Control investigated and determined it \r\n  was likely Romero was leasing employees.Â  On or about June 16, 2000, Risk Control \r\n  advised Roberts that Romeroâ€™s policy should be cancelled.Â  Roberts relayed this \r\n  information to Romero and told him to seek coverage through an â€œassigned riskâ€ \r\n  plan. [2] Â  However, Romeroâ€™s policy was not cancelled and, instead, INSCORP \r\n  issued policy # SC0001204200RCS on June 22, 2000, with an effective date of \r\n  May 19, 2000.Â  On June 23, 2000, Risk Control sent Romero an invoice for the \r\n  July premium payment.\r\nMeanwhile, having been \r\n  advised by Roberts to seek assigned risk coverage, Romero went on June 23, 2000 \r\n  to Capstone Insurance Services in Greenville and applied for workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  coverage.Â  In accordance with assigned risk rules and procedures, Romeroâ€™s application \r\n  was sent to Capital, a designated assigned risk carrier.Â  Romeroâ€™s application \r\n  for assigned risk coverage made a number of misstatements and misrepresentations, \r\n  including the averment that he was a new business and had no prior workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation coverage. [3] Â  Not knowing of Romeroâ€™s coverage with INSCORP, \r\n  Capital issued policy # 05-WC-0004280/000, effective June 24, 2000.Â  Three days \r\n  later, on June 27, 2000, Rodriguez slipped through the roof and was injured.\r\nCapital, still unaware \r\n  of the INSCORP policy, accepted the claim and began providing benefits.Â  It \r\n  learned of the INSCORP policy on or about August 15, 2000.Â  On August 16, 2000 \r\n  Capital tendered Rodriguezâ€™ claim to INSCORP; Capital simultaneously filed a \r\n  cancellation form with the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) \r\n  asking its policy be voided on the ground that Romero was ineligible for assigned \r\n  risk coverage because a) he had voluntary coverage, and b) he had made material \r\n  misrepresentations in his application for coverage.Â  On August 17, 2000, INSCORP \r\n  sent a â€œflat cancellationâ€ notice to Romero.Â  \r\nOn September 6, 2000, \r\n  Capital filed a motion to determine coverage.Â  A hearing was held before the \r\n  single commissioner, who ruled that because Romero had lied in his representations \r\n  to obtain the policy, Capitalâ€™s policy should be rescinded and declared void \r\n  ab initio.Â  Since INSCORP voluntarily issued its policy, the commissioner \r\n  found it should be deemed the responsible carrier.Â  However, notwithstanding \r\n  these findings, the single commissioner ruled that because Capitalâ€™s assigned \r\n  risk policy had the most recent effective date, it was the responsible carrier \r\n  pursuant to the applicable regulation, 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-409.Â  The \r\n  full commission affirmed, with one commissioner dissenting.Â  The circuit court \r\n  reversed and found INSCORP to be the responsible carrier; it ruled that because \r\n  Romero had coverage in the voluntary market, he was not eligible for assigned \r\n  risk coverage such that Capitalâ€™s coverage was void.Â  The circuit court also \r\n  ruled the policy was void ab initio due to material misrepresentations \r\n  made by Romero in his application.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court found no \r\n  dual coverage such that Reg. 67-409 was inapplicable.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court properly \r\n  rule that INSCORP was the responsible carrier?\r\n\r\nSCOPE \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nReview of a decision of the workers' compensation \r\n  commission is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, \r\n  Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Although this Court \r\n  may not substitute its judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight \r\n  of the evidence on questions of fact, it may reverse where the decision is affected \r\n  by an error of law.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  438 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp.2002).Â  Review is limited \r\n  to deciding whether the commission's decision is unsupported by substantial \r\n  evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Hendricks v. Pickens County, \r\n  335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d 698, 701 (Ct.App.1999).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCentral to resolution \r\n  of this dispute is the interplay between the South Carolina Assigned Risk Plan \r\n  Operating Rules and Procedures (Procedures) and the applicable regulation, 25A \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-409.Â  \r\nPursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 38-73-540 (1976), â€œ[a]ssigned risk agreements may be made among insurers \r\n  with respect to the equitable apportionment among them of insurance which may \r\n  be afforded applicants who are in good faith entitled to, but who are unable \r\n  to procure, insurance through ordinary methods.â€Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n  In April 2000, [4] Â  the National \r\n  Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) filed the South Carolina Workers Compensation \r\n  Assigned Risk Plan (Plan) with the Department of Insurance. Â Although the Plan \r\n  has not been enacted by the General Assembly, it has been adopted and is followed \r\n  by the DOI in implementing the assigned risk pool created by S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38-73-540.Â  Carriers selected to write assigned risk coverage must accept \r\n  all applications of â€œeligibleâ€ employees.Â  \r\nCapital is one of only \r\n  two carriers in South Carolina who issue assigned risk policies under the South \r\n  Carolina Assigned Risk Plan.Â  The Plan provides for the equitable apportionment \r\n  of employers who are in good faith entitled to workers compensation insurance \r\n  but who are unable to procure such assurance in a regular manner. [5] Â  Pursuant to the Plan, good faith is presumed in the absence \r\n  of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.Â  One of the requirements of \r\n  eligibility is that the employer has not made any material misrepresentations \r\n  in his application. [6] Â  Paragraph 9 of the Plan, governing Cancellation of an assigned \r\n  risk policy states, in pertinent part, â€œany employer having voluntary coverage \r\n  or an offer thereof in this state is ineligible for SCWCARP Plan coverage.Â  \r\n  The assigned risk coverage terminates at the effective date of the voluntary \r\n  insurance.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Additionally, the Plan has a provision entitled \r\n  â€œCancellation for Voluntary Coverage,â€ which states, in part, â€œany insurer that \r\n  wishes to insure an employer as voluntary business may do so at any time.Â  If \r\n  such insurer is not the contract carrier, the contract carrier shall cancel \r\n  its policy. . . and the coverage shall automatically terminate as of the \r\n  effective date of the voluntary insurerâ€™s policy.â€Â  Another paragraph of \r\n  the Plan Procedures, governing the effective date of a policy, states that the \r\n  effective date shall be the latest of any of three conditions, one of which \r\n  is â€œthe date of expiration of existing coverage.â€Â  \r\nUnder the Assigned Risk \r\n  Plan and Procedures outlined above, it is patent the assigned risk policy issued \r\n  by Capital either a) never became effective because INSCORPâ€™s policy was not \r\n  cancelled until Aug. 17, 2000, b) terminated upon the effective date of INSCORPâ€™s \r\n  policy (which, although issued on June 22, 2000, was made effective May 19, \r\n  2000), [7]  or c) was not effective because \r\n  Romero, having misrepresented his status, was ineligible for assigned risk coverage.Â Â  \r\n  INSCORP asserts, however, that under Reg. 67-409, there was dual coverage such \r\n  that the later policy issued by Capital is effective.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nReg. 67-409 provides, \r\n  in part:\r\n\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When duplicate or dual coverage exists \r\n  by reason of two different insurance carriers issuing two policies to the same \r\n  employer securing the same liability, the Commission shall presume the policy \r\n  with the later effective date is in force and the earlier policy terminated \r\n  on the effective date of the later policy.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).Â Â  Here, it \r\n  is patent that the policy issued by Capital never became effective because the \r\n  voluntary policy had not been cancelled.Â  Accordingly, contrary to INSCORPâ€™s \r\n  contention, there was no dual coverage, and Regulation 67-409 is simply inapplicable.Â  \r\n  A recent Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is instructive.\r\nIn Avant v. Willowglen \r\n  Academy, 356 S.C. 181, 588 S.E.2d 125 (Ct. App. 2003), the issue was which \r\n  of two carriers, the assigned risk carrier, or a voluntary carrier, was responsible \r\n  for workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  Travelers had issued an assigned risk policy \r\n  to Willowglen Academy.Â  It sent a quotation to renew the policy effective August \r\n  24, 1997.Â  Travelers was paid the premiums for this coverage in two installments \r\n  on July 3, 1997 and Aug. 13, 1997.Â  On Aug. 27 or 29, 1997, three days after \r\n  the effective date of the assigned risk policy issued by Travelers, United issued \r\n  an endorsement indicating its voluntary policy was effective July 1, 1997.Â  \r\n  356 S.C. at 184-185, 588 S.E.2d at 126-127.Â  \r\nAvant was injured in \r\n  September 1997, and Travelers (the assigned risk carrier) accepted the claim \r\n  and began providing benefits.Â  Sometime later, when Travelers learned of the \r\n  dual coverage, and that the coverage with United was voluntary, it sought \r\n  to cancel its policy effective on the date of the voluntary policy, July 1, \r\n  1997.Â  It subsequently filed a motion with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  requesting a determination as to the proper carrier.Â  The single commissioner \r\n  ruled United was the proper carrier; the full commission reversed and held both \r\n  parties equally liable; the circuit court reversed and held that, under Reg. \r\n  67-409, because there was dual coverage, and because the Travelers policy had \r\n  the later effective date, Travelers was responsible.Â  356 S.C. at 186, 588 S.E.2d \r\n  at 128.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  reversed.Â  Writing for the majority, Judge Connor held the assigned risk policy \r\n  issued by Travelers had, under the South Carolina Assigned Risk Plan, [8]  terminated on the effective date of the voluntary policy, July \r\n  1, 1997.Â  The Court of Appeals held that Reg. 67-409 should be read in conjunction \r\n  with the Assigned Risk Plan; it found that since the Plan addressed the specific \r\n  situation of cancellation of an assigned risk policy upon the effective date \r\n  of a voluntary policy, and the regulation was silent on this issue, the provisions \r\n  of the Assigned Risk Plan should be given effect.Â  356 S.C. at 189, 588 S.E.2d \r\n  at 129.Â  Accordingly, it found that through application of the Assigned Risk \r\n  Plan, United was the only carrier with coverage on the date of the employeeâ€™s \r\n  injury.Â  Id.Â Â  We agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ reasoning.\r\nUnder the limited factual \r\n  circumstances here, we agree with Avant that the Assigned Risk Plan â€œshould \r\n  be read in conjunction with the Act and its regulations and be accorded effect \r\n  under the facts of this case given the [Plan] addresses matters where the Act \r\n  is silent.â€Â  356 S.C. at 189, 588 S.E.2d at 129.Â  As noted by the Court of Appeals, \r\n  without the Assigned Risk Plan and its procedures, â€œthere would be nothing guiding \r\n  assigned risk practice and its procedure.â€ 356 S.C. at 188, 588 S.E.2d at 128.Â  \r\n\r\nIn this case, because \r\n  Romero had voluntary coverage in effect, his assigned risk policy never became \r\n  effective.Â  Accordingly, there was no dual coverage, and Reg. 67-409 is inapplicable.Â  \r\n  The circuit courtâ€™s ruling finding INSCORP the responsible carrier is affirmed. \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I \r\n  respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act are the sole authority \r\n  governing which carrier is responsible for providing coverage in the present \r\n  case. [9] Â  Therefore, I would reverse the holding of the circuit court \r\n  and affirm the full commissionâ€™s finding that Capital, not INSCORP, is the responsible \r\n  carrier.Â \r\nIn my view, the majority misconstrues the law \r\n  to the extent that it reads the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in conjunction with \r\n  the guidelines set forth by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).Â  \r\n  In my opinion the guidelines the NCCI has set forth are not controlling authority \r\n  because the NCCI is not a rulemaking body.Â  For example, in NCCIâ€™s own â€œBasic \r\n  Manual,â€ the NCCI is described as a rating organization or advisory organization \r\n  to make and file rates for workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  In addition, the \r\n  guidelines state that they are not intended to replace state statute.Â  Further, \r\n  the NCCI is not authorized to promulgate regulations.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann Â§ 1-23-10 (1), (4) (Supp. 2002).Â  As a result, I would rely solely on the \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and its corresponding regulations to determine coverage.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nBecause I would hold the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Act and the regulations promulgated thereto as the sole controlling \r\n  authority, Regulation 67-409(A) is applicable in determining which company should \r\n  provide coverage.Â  \r\nPursuant to Regulation 67-409(A), \r\n  â€œ[w]hen duplicate or dual coverage exists by reason of two different insurance \r\n  carriers issuing two policies to the same employer securing the same liability, \r\n  the Commission shall presume the policy with the later effective date is \r\n  in force and the earlier policy terminated on the effective date of the later \r\n  policy.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-409(A) (1976) (emphasis added).\r\nIn the present case, INSCORPâ€™s \r\n  policy has an effective date of May 19, 2000.Â  On the other hand, Capitalâ€™s \r\n  policy has an effective date of June 24, 2000.Â  Therefore, pursuant to Regulation \r\n  67-409(A), I would hold that Capital is the proper carrier because its policy \r\n  has the later effective date.\r\nAccordingly, I would affirm the \r\n  full commissionâ€™s finding that Capital is the responsible carrier.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Coverage for leased employees was excluded by \r\n    INSCORPâ€™s treaty with its reinsurers.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  Assigned risk insurance agreements are made for \r\n    the benefit of people who are entitled to insurance but who are unable to \r\n    procure insurance through ordinary methods.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540 (1976).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â Â  INSCORP asserts there is no evidence Romero \r\n    made any material misrepresentations about his â€œnew business venture of a \r\n    temporary personnel agency which specialized in insulation installation and \r\n    related labor.â€Â  It contends his representations were valid and correct in \r\n    light of the distinctions between the coverage for which he sought the assigned \r\n    risk plan (temporary personnel agency doing insulation) and the INSCORP policy \r\n    (buildings-operation; by contractors- includes window cleaning, painting, \r\n    maintenance).Â  We disagree; we find substantial evidence supports the unappealed \r\n    finding of the commission that Romero made material misrepresentations to \r\n    gain coverage.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  In 2000, the assigned risk market in South Carolina \r\n    was privatized by the Department of Insurance (DOI).Â  Unlike the former assigned \r\n    risk pool system, which spread the risk over all carriers, the new system \r\n    places the burden on only a few carriers who have requested to handle assigned \r\n    risk to bear the loss.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â  This is identical to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â  The Plan itself states that an employer is not in good faith entitled \r\n    to assigned risk insurance if â€œ[t]he employer . . . knowingly makes a material \r\n    misrepresentation on the application by omission or otherwise, including, \r\n    but not limited to, the following: estimated payroll, offers of workers compensation \r\n    insurance, nature of business, . . . previous insurance history.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [7] Â  INSCORP asserts Capital was required to cancel \r\n    its policy, pointing to several provisions in the Plan which allow an assigned \r\n    risk carrier to cancel a policy upon learning the applicant is not eligible.Â  \r\n    The provisions cited by INSCORP are not controlling as there are more specific \r\n    provisions governing automatic termination where the employer is insured \r\n    in the voluntary market.Â  INSCORP relies upon a Virginia case, Franklin \r\n    Mortgage Corp. v. Walker, 367 S.E.2d 191 (Va. App. 1988) to support its \r\n    contention.Â  However, Franklin dealt solely with the effect of the \r\n    attempted cancellation of a workersâ€™ compensation policy.Â  It did not deal \r\n    with an assigned risk policy, nor did it deal with a policy for which the \r\n    employer was not eligible.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] Â  The Plan is referred to in the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n    opinion as the WCIP (Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance Plan).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  The [Workersâ€™ Compensation] Commission shall promulgate \r\n    all regulations relating to the administration of the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n    laws of this State necessary to implement the provisions of this title and \r\n    consistent therewith.Â  S.C.
