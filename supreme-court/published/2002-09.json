Macaulay, \r\n  Post-Conviction Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25524\r\nHeard March 5, 2002 - Filed \r\n  September 3, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor \r\n  Duffy Cleary, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for \r\n  petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief \r\n  Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General \r\n  Allen Bullard, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  Petitioner pled guilty to \r\n  armed robbery and was sentenced to twenty-one years imprisonment to be served \r\n  concurrently with a prior sentence.  The Court granted a writ of certiorari \r\n  to review the decision of the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge denying petitioner \r\n  relief.  We affirm.  \r\nFACTS\r\nAt the plea proceeding, \r\n  the trial judge questioned petitioner as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Court: This is [petitioner], who is accused in this indictment \r\n  with two different counts, one for armed robbery and one for possession of a \r\n  shotgun.  Heâ€™s pleading guilty to armed robbery but not to possession of the \r\n  sawed-off shotgun.  Now, for the armed robbery, you could receive a sentence \r\n  of from ten years up to twenty-five years, and you have to do at least seven \r\n  under our parole statute.  Do you understand that, [petitioner]?\r\nA.  Yes, Your Honor.  \r\n\r\nAlthough petitioner was parole ineligible because \r\n  he had a prior conviction for a violent offense, trial counsel neither objected \r\n  to the judgeâ€™s statement nor moved the judge to clarify petitionerâ€™s parole \r\n  status. [1] \r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner testified, prior to \r\n  the plea, trial counsel told him he would face a maximum of twenty-five years \r\n  imprisonment for armed robbery and would be eligible for parole in seven years.  \r\n  He testified the plea judgeâ€™s statement concerning parole eligibility was consistent \r\n  with counselâ€™s advice.  Petitioner testified he and counsel discussed the 1986 \r\n  Omnibus Criminal Justice Improvements Act, but did not discuss the impact of \r\n  his prior conviction on his parole eligibility.  He testified he would not have \r\n  pled guilty but would have gone to trial had he known he was parole ineligible.  \r\n\r\nTrial counsel testified \r\n  it was her general practice not to discuss parole with clients.  She admitted \r\n  she and petitioner did discuss parole as it related to his prior conviction, \r\n  but testified she could not recollect whether she and petitioner discussed parole \r\n  as it related to the armed robbery charge.  Counsel explained, in negotiating \r\n  petitionerâ€™s plea, her primary concern was to minimize the amount of time petitioner \r\n  would have to serve.    \r\nCounsel testified she \r\n  knew the 1986 Omnibus Criminal Justice Improvements Act was in effect when petitioner \r\n  pled guilty.  She further stated she knew two convictions for a violent crime \r\n  precluded parole, however she did not recall whether she specifically contemplated \r\n  the Actâ€™s effect on petitioner.     \r\n\r\nThe PCR judge denied \r\n  relief.  In the Order of Dismissal, the PCR judge held petitionerâ€™s â€œtestimony \r\n  concerning his reliance on parole eligibility information is not credible.â€  \r\n  Because it was counselâ€™s general practice not to advise clients about parole, \r\n  the court concluded petitioner did not enter his plea in reliance on parole \r\n  advice by counsel.  The court further concluded the trial judgeâ€™s comment about \r\n  parole â€œconcerned armed robbery by itselfâ€ and found â€œthere is nothing in the \r\n  record to indicate a plea fashioned on reliance on parole eligibility.â€  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs there any probative evidence which supports the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  decision petitioner was not misinformed about his parole eligibility and, therefore, \r\n  counselâ€™s failure to move for clarification of the trial judgeâ€™s statement did \r\n  not render petitionerâ€™s plea unknowing and involuntary?  \r\n\r\n  DISCUSSION \r\n\r\nA PCR applicant who enters a plea on the advice of \r\n  counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of a plea by \r\n  showing that counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness \r\n  and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the \r\n  defendant would not have pled guilty but would have insisted upon going to trial.  \r\n  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985); \r\n  Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. 16, 546 S.E.2d 417 (2001).  The burden of proof \r\n  is on the applicant to prove his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.   \r\n  Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP.  \r\nâ€œMisadviceâ€ Prior to Plea\r\nA guilty plea is not rendered involuntary if the defendant \r\n  is not informed of the collateral consequences of his sentence.  Brown v. \r\n  State, 306 S.C. 381, 412 S.E.2d 399 (1991).  Typically, parole eligibility \r\n  is considered a collateral consequence of a sentence.  However, if trial counsel \r\n  actively misinforms the defendant about parole eligibility, the defendant  must \r\n  prove he relied on the misinformation to receive PCR.  Smith v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 280, 494 S.E.2d 626 (1997); Griffin v. Martin, 278 S.C. 620, \r\n  300 S.E.2d 482 (1983).\r\nProbative evidence in the record supports the PCR \r\n  judgeâ€™s finding petitioner was not induced to plead guilty based on parole advice \r\n  prior to the plea.  Trial counsel testified it was her general practice not \r\n  to advise clients as to parole eligibility even though she could not specifically \r\n  remember what she told petitioner.  This evidence supports the PCR judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  petitioner did not enter his plea based on any â€œmisadviceâ€ by trial counsel \r\n  as counsel did not give any advice.  Accordingly, we affirm on this sub-issue.  \r\n  Anderson v. State, 342 S.C. 54, 535 S.E.2d 649 (2000) (if there is any \r\n  probative evidence to support the findings of the PCR judge, those findings \r\n  must be upheld). [2] \r\n â€œMisadviceâ€ \r\n  During Plea\r\nOn two occasions, the Court has considered the effect \r\n  of the plea judgeâ€™s parole â€œadviceâ€ on the plea.  Originally, the Court held \r\n  a guilty plea is rendered unknowing and involuntary where the plea judge misinforms \r\n  a defendant he is parole eligible when, in fact, he is parole ineligible.  Brown, \r\n  supra.  \r\n Thereafter, the Court \r\n  modified Brown, holding that where the plea judge â€œexplain[ed] the minimum \r\n  criteria for parole eligibility as contained in the applicable statute, the \r\n  fact that the defendant is not actually eligible for parole does not render \r\n  his guilty plea involuntary or unknowing.â€  Hunter v. State, 316 S.C. \r\n  105, 109, 447 S.E.2d 203, 205-06 (1994), abrogated on other \r\n  grds. Simpson v. State, 329 S.C. 43, 495 S.E.2d 429 (1998).  The \r\n  Court concluded:  \r\n\r\nWe still believe that erroneous parole advice from the bench  \r\n  could, on certain facts, mislead a defendant to his detriment; however, it would \r\n  be wholly impractical to maintain a rule which requires the automatic reversal \r\n  of a guilty plea without something more.  \r\n\r\nHunter, 316 S.C. at 109, 447 \r\n  S.E.2d at 205 (emphasis added).       \r\nPetitioner contends he established the â€œsomething moreâ€ required by Hunter.  \r\n  He claims that in addition to the plea judgeâ€™s comment, trial counsel advised \r\n  him prior to the plea that he would be eligible for parole in seven years. \r\nAs noted above, the probative evidence of record supports \r\n  the PCR judgeâ€™s finding trial counsel did not advise petitioner about parole \r\n  eligibility.  Accordingly, petitioner failed to establish â€œsomething moreâ€ than \r\n  the judgeâ€™s comment regarding parole at the plea.  The probative evidence of \r\n  record supports the PCR judgeâ€™s finding petitioner did not rely on the plea \r\n  judgeâ€™s comment concerning parole in pleading guilty.  Because there is probative \r\n  evidence which supports the PCR judgeâ€™s finding, we must affirm on this sub-issue.  \r\n  Anderson v. State, supra.   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE \r\n  and WALLER, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent.  \r\n  Trial counsel acknowledged that while she generally did not discuss parole eligibility \r\n  with her clients, she had discussed it with petitioner.   Although she could \r\n  not recall the exact conversation, her testimony supports petitionerâ€™s contention \r\n  that parole was an issue in his decision to plead guilty.  In my opinion, this \r\n  undisputed fact is the â€œsomething moreâ€ that, coupled with the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  misadvice concerning parole eligibility at the plea, entitles petitioner to \r\n  post-conviction relief.  Hunter v. State, 316 S.C. 105, 447 S.E.2d 203 \r\n  (1994), subsequent history omitted.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] A person convicted of armed robbery is eligible for parole after \r\n    service of seven years.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (Supp. 2001).  However, \r\n    under the 1986 Omnibus Criminal Justice Improvements Act, a person who is \r\n    convicted of a second or subsequent violent crime as defined in South Carolina \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 2001) is ineligible for parole.  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 2001).  Section 16-1-60 defines armed robbery as a violent \r\n    crime.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Counsel admitted she and petitioner discussed parole.  She explained \r\n    petitioner had been paroled after serving a portion of a prior sentence and \r\n    she was in hopes his parole revocation sentence could be served concurrently \r\n    with his armed robbery sentence.  However, counsel testified she did not remember \r\n    advising petitioner he would be eligible for parole on the armed robbery charge \r\n    after service of seven years and it was her practice not to advise clients \r\n    as to parole eligibility.  While parole may have been â€œan issueâ€ in petitionerâ€™s \r\n    decision to plead guilty, as stated by the dissent, there is probative evidence \r\n    which supports the PCR judgeâ€™s decision counsel did not advise him he would \r\n    be eligible for parole after service of seven years.  Because the Court is \r\n    required to affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling if there is any probative evidence \r\n    which supports the lower courtâ€™s decision, the Court must affirm.

(â€œAuto Nowâ€) brought this action against Catawba Insurance Co. (â€œCatawbaâ€) \r\n  for failing to provide it notice of cancellation of an insurance policy listing \r\n  Auto Now as loss payee.  A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s ruling in favor of Auto Now.  See Auto Now Acceptance Corp. \r\n  v. Catawba Ins. Co., 342 S.C. 526, 537 S.E.2d 553 (Ct. App. 2000).  We reverse. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n&nbsp; Catawba issued an automobile insurance policy \r\n  to Jacqueline D. Robinson and Michelle Jones (â€œInsuredâ€).  Auto Now took assignment \r\n  of the installment sales contract between Insured and the car dealership.  Catawba \r\n  listed Auto Now as loss payee on Insuredâ€™s policy.  Insured financed the insurance \r\n  premium with Premium Budget, Inc. (â€œPBIâ€).  Insured executed a power of attorney \r\n  granting authority to PBI to cancel the insurance policy upon ten daysâ€™ notice \r\n  to Insured in the event of Insuredâ€™s default in repayment of the premium.    \r\n\r\nInsured defaulted and PBI mailed Insured notice \r\n  of its intent to cancel.  Following an additional notice to Insured, PBI mailed \r\n  notice of cancellation to Catawba.1  \r\n  Neither PBI, Insured, nor Catawba notified Auto Now of the cancellation.  Fire \r\n  destroyed Insuredâ€™s automobile two months after PBI cancelled the insurance.  \r\n  Auto Now learned of the policyâ€™s cancellation only after Insured defaulted on \r\n  the loan.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding Catawba was required to \r\n  notify Auto Now of the cancellation of  Insuredâ€™s policy where the cancellation \r\n  was effected by PBI?\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by failing to address the\r\n    two types of loss payee clauses under South Carolina law?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nFailure \r\n  to Notify a Loss Payee of Cancellation\r\nCatawba argues the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in finding it owed a duty to inform Auto Now of the cancellation.  Catawba contends \r\n  it is neither contractually nor statutorily required to notify a loss payee \r\n  of a cancellation initiated by a premium service company.  We agree.\r\n The contract of insurance issued to Insured \r\n  by Catawba contemplates cancellation either by Insured or by Insurer, Catawba.  \r\n  If Catawba cancelled the policy, the contract requires it notify Insured at \r\n  least 15 days before the effective date of cancellation.  See also \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-120(a) (Supp. 2000) (requiring insurer to provide 15 days notice before \r\n  canceling policy).  This provision of the contract does not require notice to \r\n  third parties.  However, the contractâ€™s loss payable clause requires Catawba, \r\n  when it cancels a policy, to provide the same 15-day notice of cancellation \r\n  to a loss payee.  If the insured cancels, no notice is required. \r\nThe trial court held the insurance cancellation \r\n  by PBI was not the equivalent of cancellation by Insured.  The court concluded \r\n  the contractâ€™s notice provision to loss payees was triggered by PBIâ€™s cancellation. \r\n  Therefore, Catawba was contractually required to notify Auto Now of the cancellation.   \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Catawba argued PBIâ€™s cancellation, \r\n  through its power of attorney granted by Insured, was the equivalent of cancellation \r\n  by Insured.  The Court of Appeals, affirming the trial court, found â€œthe argument \r\n  ignores the clear intent of the statute governing cancellation by premium service \r\n  companies such as PBI.â€  Auto Now Acceptance Corp., 342 S.C. at 530, \r\n  537 S.E.2d at 555.  The Court of Appeals noted South Carolina limits the ability \r\n  of PBI as a premium service company to cancel an insurance contract on behalf \r\n  of Insured.  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90 (Supp. 2000).  \r\n\r\nCatawba argues 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 69-13(V)(B)(3) \r\n  (1976) provides cancellation by PBI is equivalent to cancellation by Insured.  \r\n  The regulation requires an insurer provide notice of cancellation to an insured \r\n  before cancellation of a policy.  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 69-13(V)(A) \r\n  (1976).  Subsection (B)(3) provides an exception to this requirement when a \r\n  premium service company cancels the policy because â€œ[i]n such a situation the \r\n  insured will have already been notified of the premium service companyâ€™s intent \r\n  to request cancellation, such cancellation by the premium service company is \r\n  deemed the equivalent of cancellation by the insured himself.â€  25A S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Reg. 69-13(V)(B)(3) (1976).  \r\nCatawba contends this language requires we \r\n  find the Legislature affirmatively recognizes PBIâ€™s cancellation as cancellation \r\n  by Insured, relieving Catawba of notifying Auto Now of the cancellation.  Catawba \r\n  reads the clause too broadly.  \r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly interpreted the regulation \r\n  in light of the insurerâ€™s duty to notify an insured before cancelling a policy \r\n  as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90 and 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 69-13(V)(B)(3).  \r\n  â€œ[T]he regulation relieves the insurer from providing the insured with any further \r\n  notice prior to carrying out the cancellation,â€ because â€œthe insured will already \r\n  have received notice of the premium service companyâ€™s intent to cancel.â€  Auto \r\n  Now Acceptance Corp., 342 S.C. at 531, 537 S.E.2d at 556.  The regulation \r\n  does not statutorily recognize a premium service company as the equivalent of \r\n  an insured.  Instead, it relieves the insurer of the burden of notifying the \r\n  insured of cancellation because the premium company is required to do so.  Catawbaâ€™s \r\n  interpretation is not reasonable in the light of the regulationâ€™s purpose to \r\n  ensure the insuredâ€™s notification of cancellation.  See Strother v. \r\n  Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 \r\n  (1998) (the cardinal rule of statutory construction is for a court to ascertain \r\n  the intent of the legislature and to give it effect); Rosenbaum v. S-M-S \r\n  32, 311 S.C. 140, 143, 427 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1993) (a court should give a \r\n  statute a â€œpractical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the \r\n  purpose, design and policy of lawmakers.â€); Mitchell v. Holler, 311 S.C. \r\n  406, 410, 429 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1993) (â€œThe words of a statute must be given \r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction \r\n  to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s operation.â€).\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ interpretation of the contract \r\n  and statutes is equally erroneous.  The Court of Appeals observes PBI cancelled \r\n  the policy because Insured failed to pay premiums, which is one reason an insurer \r\n  may cancel a policy.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-730 (1989 &amp; Supp. \r\n  2001).  The Court of Appeals offers if â€œPBI had not been a party to this transaction, \r\n  Catawba would have canceled the policy itself for nonpayment...[i]n that case, \r\n  there is no question but that Auto Now would be entitled to notice under the \r\n  terms of the insurance contract at issue.â€  Auto Now Acceptance Corp., \r\n  342 at 531, 537 S.E.2d at 556.\r\nIn adopting the trial courtâ€™s rationale, the \r\n  Court of Appeals based its decision on a premise inconsistent with the facts \r\n  of the case.  The fact Catawba would have cancelled Insuredâ€™s policy for non-payment \r\n  of premiums is not pertinent to circumstances in which PBI paid Insuredâ€™s policy \r\n  premiums in-full to Catawba, and then required Insured to repay PBI under threat \r\n  of cancellation of Insuredâ€™s coverage.  Assuming hypothetical facts is inconsistent \r\n  with the provisions of the contract, which are silent as to Catawbaâ€™s duty to \r\n  inform loss payees when PBI cancels.  See  Blakeley v. Rabon, \r\n  266 S.C. 68, 72, 221 S.E.2d 767, 769 (1976) (â€œWords cannot be read into a contract \r\n  which impart intent wholly unexpressed when the contract was executedâ€).   \r\nThe Court of Appeals further and incorrectly affirmed \r\n  the trial court by finding a statutory notice requirement independent of Catawbaâ€™s \r\n  contractual obligations.  The court below based its decision on S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38-39-90(d) (1976) which provides:\r\n\r\nAll statutory, regulatory, and contractual restrictions providing that \r\n  the insurance contract may not be canceled unless notice is given to a governmental \r\n  agency, mortgagee, or other third party apply where cancellation is effected \r\n  under this section.  The insurer shall give the prescribed notice in behalf \r\n  of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third \r\n  party by the second business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation \r\n  from the premium service company and shall determine the effective date of cancellation \r\n  taking into consideration the number of daysâ€™ notice required to complete the \r\n  cancellation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90(d)(emphasis added).\r\nThe Court of Appeals interprets this statute \r\n  as requiring Catawba give notice to Auto Now on the second business day after \r\n  it receives notice of intent to cancel from PBI.  We disagree.\r\nOur statute is similar2 to one reviewed by the Tennessee Court of Appeals in \r\n  Western Express, Inc. v. Interested Underwriters at Lloydâ€™s of London, \r\n  92 S.W.2d 542 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).  In Western Express, a premium service \r\n  company paid a yearly premium to an insurer on behalf of an insured.  The insurance \r\n  contract listed the lien holder of the insuredâ€™s truck as a loss payee.  The \r\n  Court of Appeals concluded:  â€œthe quoted statute does not independently obligate \r\n  the premium finance company or the insurer to give notice to lienholders...[only] \r\n  that other statutes, regulations or contracts that do \r\n  impose such requirements should be complied with.â€  Id. at 544 (emphasis \r\n  in original).  We concur.\r\nThe statute merely requires an insurer, before it may cancel \r\n  a policy, to provide a notice of intent to cancel to third parties where it \r\n  is affirmatively required to do so by statute, regulation or contract.  Section \r\n  38-39-90(d) is not instructive of Catawbaâ€™s duty to notify Auto Now when Insured \r\n  or PBI cancels the policy, nor does it provide an independent statutory duty \r\n  for Catawba to notify Auto Now of PBIâ€™s cancellation.\r\nAuto Now advances two additional theories why Catawba \r\n  had a duty to notify it of PBIâ€™s cancellation.  The first is Rawl v. American \r\n  Cent. Ins. Co., 94 S.C. 299, 77 S.E. 1013 (1913), in which we recognized \r\n  a loss payeeâ€™s right to receive notice of involuntary cancellation.  As the \r\n  dissent below correctly noted, the loss payeeâ€™s entitlement to notice in Rawl \r\n  was created by the insurance policy itself, not by our interpretation of a statute \r\n  or regulation.  See Auto Now Acceptance Corp., 342 S.C. at 533-34, \r\n  537 S.E.2d at 557-58 (Huff, J., dissenting).  Therefore, while Rawl holds \r\n  a contract may require an insurer to notify a loss payee of a cancelled policy, \r\n  it does not mandate such notice as a matter of law.\r\nSecondly, Auto Now contends public policy \r\n  requires Catawba to forward PBIâ€™s notice of intent to cancel to it.  Auto Now \r\n  believes the burden placed on Catawba is warranted because â€œrequiring insurers \r\n  to notify loss payees of involuntary cancellations of insurance â€¦ facilitates \r\n  the public policy of removing uninsured motorists from the highways of this \r\n  State.â€  We disagree.\r\nAuto Now does not cite, nor have we found, any \r\n  cases similar to the case sub judice in which a court found an insurerâ€™s \r\n  duty to notify a loss payee of  a third partyâ€™s cancellation of an insuredâ€™s \r\n  contract based on those grounds.  We believe a desire to remove uninsured vehicles \r\n  from the stateâ€™s roads, though laudable, cannot stand in the face of the explicit \r\n  language of Â§ 38-39-90(d).  \r\nAlthough we are sympathetic to the plight of loss payees \r\n  in these circumstances, no contract or any statutory or regulatory provision \r\n  requires an insurer notify a loss payee when a premium service company cancels \r\n  an insurance policy.  This Court recognizes PBIâ€™s capacity to cancel an automobile \r\n  insurance policy when it acts through a power of attorney granted to it by Insured.  \r\n  See Steele v. Seibels, Bruce and Co., 295 S.C. 206, 367 S.E.2d \r\n  695 (1988).  Insured irrevocably appointed PBI as their â€œtrue and lawful attorney-in-fact \r\n  with full authority to cancel any or all policies listed . . . in the event \r\n  of any default in repayment as agreed.â€  When PBI cancelled Insuredâ€™s policy, \r\n  it did so as an agent of Insured.  PBIâ€™s cancellation, therefore, is the equivalent \r\n  of Insuredâ€™s cancellation, which relieves Catawba from notifying Auto Now. \r\nII\r\nTwo Types \r\n  of Loss Payee Clauses\r\nBoth Catawba and the dissent below assert the majorityâ€™s \r\n  decision overlooks the distinction between the two types of loss-payee clauses \r\n  under South Carolina law.  We disagree.\r\n This Court \r\n  in Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Hunt, 327 S.C. 89, 488 S.E.2d 339 \r\n  (1997), recognized the existence of two types of third-party insurance clauses.  \r\n  They are: (1) loss payable clause which merely identifies the person who may \r\n  collect the insurance proceeds; and (2) a standard mortgage clause which creates \r\n  an independent contract for mortgageeâ€™s interest.  Id. at 93, 488 S.E.2d \r\n  at 341; see Auto Now Acceptance Corp., 342 S.C. at 534, 537 S.E.2d \r\n  at 558.\r\nCourts rely on the distinction between the two \r\n  clauses when an insurer cancels a policy and the remaining question is \r\n  whether the insurer had a duty to notify a third party, in the absence of a \r\n  contractual obligation to do so.  See, e.g., Vargas v. Nautilus \r\n  Ins. Co., 248 Kan. 881, 811 P.2d 868 (Kan. 1991); Gallant v. Lake States \r\n  Mutual Ins. Co., 142 Mich. App. 183, 187, 369 N.W.2d 205, 205 (Mich. Ct. \r\n  App. 1985); Old Kent Bank of Holland v. Chaddock, Winter &amp; Alberts, \r\n  197 Mich. App. 372, 495 N.W.2d 808 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993).  The distinction is \r\n  irrelevant here because this case involves a premium service company, standing \r\n  in the shoes of the insured, cancelling an insurance policy.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above reasons we REVERSE the Court of Appeals. \r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 All parties stipulate PBI complied fully with the requirements \r\n    governing insurance cancellations by premium finance companies.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 The Tennessee statute provided:\r\n  \r\n  All statutory, regulatory and contractual restrictions providing that the insurance \r\n    contract may not be cancelled unless notice is given to a governmental agency, \r\n    mortgagee or other third party shall apply for cancellations effected under \r\n    the provisions of this section.  The insurer shall give the prescribed notice \r\n    on behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mortgagee or \r\n    other third party on or before the second business day after the day it receives \r\n    the notice of cancellation, taking into consideration the number of daysâ€™ \r\n    notice required to complete the cancellation.\r\n  Tenn.

Duane Shuler, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25526\r\nHeard June 25, 2002 - Filed September 3, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of the South Carolina Office of \r\n  Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Walter M. Bailey, of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: Appellant was convicted of first \r\n  degree burglary and murder, and received a death sentence upon the finding of \r\n  burglary and physical torture as aggravating circumstances.  This opinion combines \r\n  appellantâ€™s direct appeal and this Courtâ€™s mandatory sentencing review pursuant \r\n  to S. C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-25 (1985).  We affirm.\r\nFacts\r\nAppellant and the victim had a ten-year-old son who lived \r\n  with the victim.  On April 30, 1998, as he finished his shift at work, appellant \r\n  told his supervisor that â€œhe was troubled with events going on in his personal \r\n  life about his sonâ€ and that he planned to go to the victimâ€™s home that evening \r\n  to try to resolve the problems.  Appellant told his supervisor he might not \r\n  be at work the next day because he was unsure what would happen.  After returning \r\n  to his home, appellant had a telephone conversation with his son, then left \r\n  for the victimâ€™s trailer.  He had a loaded shotgun in his truck.\r\nAppellant and the victim were observed arguing on the \r\n  victimâ€™s porch.  Appellant stated that the victim told him he would not be able \r\n  to see his son anymore.  A neighbor observed the victim enter her trailer, and \r\n  saw appellant go to his truck and return to the trailer carrying the shotgun.\r\nAppellant kicked open the door.  Witnesses heard a shot; \r\n  one heard a scream.  Another witness testified that a minute to a minute and \r\n  a half passed before more shots were fired.  When appellant left the scene in \r\n  his truck, a neighbor entered the trailer and found the victim dead inside.  \r\n  Appellantâ€™s son and the victimâ€™s young daughter, both of whom were in the trailer \r\n  during the shooting, were unhurt.  \r\nPolice officers were notified of the shooting; appellant \r\n  was stopped not far from the scene.  He confessed to two different officers \r\n  at the roadside, and asked for the death penalty.  Appellant gave a taped confession \r\n  later that evening, and then wrote a statement.  He consistently asked for the \r\n  death penalty, and stated that a voice had told him to shoot the victims.  He \r\n  told others he had observed the shooting as if watching it on a monitor or screen.\r\nAppellant admitted shooting the victim first in the arm, \r\n  then in the chest, then the stomach, and again in the upper chest and face.  \r\n  The victim was shot from close range with a 12 gauge automatic shotgun loaded \r\n  with three inch 00 buck shot.  The pathologist identified at least five shotgun \r\n  wounds, and testified that the arm wound would have been extremely painful.\r\nIssues\r\n    Appellant raises six issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whether the trial court erred in finding appellant competent \r\n  to stand trial following the pretrial Blair [1]  hearing?;\r\n  \r\n    Whether the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to accept appellantâ€™s offer to plead guilty but mentally ill (GBMI)?;\r\n  \r\n    Whether the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to hold a second competency hearing at the conclusion of the evidentiary \r\n  presentation in the guilt phase of the trial?;\r\n  \r\n    Whether the trial court erred \r\n  in not submitting GBMI as a form of the verdict in the guilt phase?;\r\n  \r\n    Whether the court erred in admitting \r\n  twelve color photographs in the penalty phase of the trial?; and\r\n  \r\n    Whether appellantâ€™s death sentence is disproportionate \r\n  to the crime?\r\n\r\nWe address these issues below.\r\n1. Competency\r\nThe week before appellantâ€™s \r\n  trial commenced the judge conducted a Blair hearing to determine appellantâ€™s \r\n  competency to stand trial.  Both the Stateâ€™s experts and appellantâ€™s experts \r\n  agreed that appellant suffers from a mental disorder, \r\n  [2]  and that he was not a malingerer.  They disagreed, however, whether \r\n  appellantâ€™s condition rendered him incompetent to stand trial.\r\nThe test for determining competency to stand trial \r\n  is whether the defendant â€œhas sufficient present ability to consult with his \r\n  lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has \r\n  a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.â€  \r\n  Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960); State v. Reed, 332 \r\n  S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998).  Competency is required â€œto ensure that [the \r\n  defendant] has the capacity to understand the proceedings and to assist counsel.â€  \r\n  Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389 (1993).  The defendant bears the burden \r\n  of proving his lack of competence by a preponderance of the evidence, and the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s ruling will be upheld on appeal if supported by the evidence and \r\n  not against its preponderance.  State v. Reed, supra.\r\nThe trial judge determined appellant was competent \r\n  to stand trial based on the opinions of the Stateâ€™s experts, and on his own \r\n  observations of appellant.  We find no error.  See e.g. State v. Kelly, \r\n  331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 360 \r\n  S.E.2d 706 (1987).\r\n2.  Plea\r\nDuring the arraignment in the juryâ€™s presence, the trial \r\n  judge asked whether appellant was pleading â€œguiltyâ€ or â€œnot guilty.â€  Appellantâ€™s \r\n  attorneys were permitted to approach, and an off-the-record bench conference \r\n  was held.  One of appellantâ€™s attorneys then stated, â€œYour honor, [appellant] \r\n  intends to plead guilty, but mentally ill.â€\r\nThe jury venire was qualified, and the potential jurors \r\n  divided into panels.  Before individual voir dire began, there was a \r\n  colloquy between the trial judge and appellant.  During this session, appellant \r\n  told the judge he wanted to plead guilty to murder.  When the judge defined \r\n  the elements of murder, appellant denied he had acted with malice, and the judge \r\n  declined to accept the guilty plea.  \r\nAfter the jury had been selected, and before opening \r\n  statements, the judge informed the jury that appellantâ€™s attorney had â€˜misspokenâ€™ \r\n  during the arraignment when he said appellant was pleading GBMI, and that in \r\n  fact appellant was pleading â€˜not guilty.â€™\r\nOn appeal, appellant contends the trial judge committed \r\n  reversible error in refusing to accept the plea, and in telling the jury that \r\n  appellantâ€™s plea had changed from GBMI to not guilty.  While appellant now contends \r\n  he was attempting to enter a GBMI plea, the record reflects the trial judge \r\n  believed it was intended to be a guilty plea.  No attempt was made during this \r\n  proceeding to comply with the statutory requirement for a GBMI plea. \r\n  [3]   In addition, there was no objection to the judgeâ€™s refusal to \r\n  accept the plea nor to the judgeâ€™s informing the jury that appellant was pleading \r\n  â€˜not guiltyâ€™ rather than GBMI.  Since there were no objections made at trial, \r\n  there is nothing preserved for this Courtâ€™s appellate review.  E.g., \r\n  State v. Huggins, 336 S.C. 200, 519 S.E.2d 574 (1999) (it is well settled \r\n  that issues cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\n  3.  Second Competency Hearing\r\nAfter the defense rested in the guilt phase of trial, \r\n  court adjourned for lunch.  When court resumed after lunch, the trial judge \r\n  announced that appellant and the attorneys had met in his office because appellant \r\n  wished to discuss (again) his desire to plead guilty.  The judge then questioned \r\n  appellant in open court whether he wished to plead, and whether appellant understood \r\n  that, if he did enter a guilty plea, his right to be sentenced by the jury would \r\n  cease and the trial judge alone would decide the sentence.  Following this discussion, \r\n  the trial judge ordered a recess so that appellant could consult with his attorneys.\r\nWhen court resumed, appellantâ€™s attorneys asked the judge \r\n  to have appellant reexamined for competency.  They explained that appellant \r\n  was talking about the voices telling him what to do, and they questioned his \r\n  ability to assist them, and his competency to choose between continuing with \r\n  the jury trial or entering a plea.  The judge denied their request, and explained \r\n  his decision at great length and in precise detail.  The trial judge \r\n  had observed appellant throughout the guilt phase proceedings.  He found \r\n  that appellantâ€™s conduct was consistent throughout the proceedings, and that \r\n  appellant had not decompensated in the manner that his experts had predicted.  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that appellant remained competent.  \r\nWhether to order a competency examination rests in the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s discretion, and his decision will not be overturned on appeal absent \r\n  a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.  State v. Locklair, 341 \r\n  S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000);  see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§44-23-410 \r\n  (2002) (â€œWhenever a judge of the Circuit Court . . . has reason to believe that \r\n  a person . . . is not fit to stand trial . . . the judge shall [order an examination]. \r\n  . .â€).  Appellant has not shown a clear abuse of discretion.  We defer to the \r\n  trial judge, who was able to view appellantâ€™s demeanor.  See State \r\n  v. Kelly, supra; State v. Bell, supra.\r\n4. Jury Instructions\r\nAppellant next contends the trial judge erred when he failed \r\n  to submit GBMI as a possible form of verdict in the guilt phase.  Whether this \r\n  was an error is not properly before the Court in this direct appeal since appellant \r\n  neither requested the charge nor called its omission to the attention of the \r\n  trial judge.  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998) (contemporaneous \r\n  objection to omission of charge required to preserve issue even in capital case).\r\n5.  Photographs\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge committed reversible error \r\n  in the sentencing phase when he admitted twelve color photographs of the victimâ€™s \r\n  body, six taken at the crime scene and six at the autopsy. [4]   Assuming that appellant adequately preserved his \r\n  objection, [5]  we find no error. \r\nIn State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  357 (1995), the defendant objected to the admission of seventeen crime scene \r\n  photos and ten autopsy slides during the penalty phase of his trial, contending \r\n  they were highly prejudicial and designed only to arouse the juryâ€™s passion.  \r\n  As in the present case, one of the aggravating circumstances alleged in Franklin \r\n  was physical torture.  We held that crime scene photos were highly relevant \r\n  to the aggravator, and thus their relevance and probative value outweighed their \r\n  prejudice.  Further, the autopsy slides showing the cleaned-up body served â€œto \r\n  more clearly depict the full extent of the pre-mortem physical torture [the \r\n  victim] suffered and to substantiate the testimony of the pathologist.â€  Id.\r\nOur decision in Franklin controls this issue.  \r\n  Appellant stated the shots were inflicted in this order:  (1) right arm; (2) \r\n  chest; (3) pelvic area; and (4) upper chest and face.  According to appellant, \r\n  the first shot â€˜tore up her whole armâ€™ and knocked the victim to the floor.  \r\n  There was evidence that the arm wound was extremely painful, that the victim \r\n  screamed after that first shot, and that as long as a minute and a half elapsed \r\n  between the first and second shots.  The photos illustrate the testimony regarding \r\n  the location and the severity of the shotgun wounds, and are relevant to the \r\n  physical torture aggravator.  Their relevance and probative value outweigh their \r\n  prejudicial impact.\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the admission of \r\n  these photographs.  State v. Franklin, supra.\r\n6.  Proportionality\r\nAppellant argues his death sentence should be vacated \r\n  because his was a crime of passion, and because the aggravators are only â€˜technicallyâ€™ \r\n  applicable.  He also contends that the sentence is capricious in light of his \r\n  mental disorder.  We disagree.\r\nThere was evidence from which the jury could have concluded \r\n  that the victim suffered such that she was physically tortured.  Further, the \r\n  breaking down of the screen door of the trailer while armed with a shotgun was \r\n  more than a â€˜technicalâ€™ burglary.  There was evidence from which the jury could \r\n  have concluded that, despite his mental disorder, appellant planned to confront \r\n  the victim and to kill her. \r\nFurther, the death penalty here is proportionate to other \r\n  cases where the murder resulted from domestic problems.  E.g., State \r\n  v. Kelly, supra; State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 \r\n  (1998).  Finally, while it violates the Eighth Amendment to impose a death sentence \r\n  on a mentally retarded defendant, Atkins v. Virginia, __ U.S. __, 122 \r\n  S.Ct. 2242, __ L.Ed. 2d __ (2002), the imposition of such a sentence \r\n  upon a mentally ill person is not disproportionate.  State v. Wilson, \r\n  306 S.C. 498, 413 S.E.2d 19 (1992).\r\nWe have conducted the sentencing review mandated by \r\n  Â§16-3-25, and find this sentence proportionate to others arising from domestic \r\n  disputes.  State v. Kelly, supra; State v. Ard, supra.  \r\n  Appellantâ€™s conviction and sentence are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER \r\n  and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] State v.

Glover\r\nand Alpine Podiatry Clinic (collectively referred to as \"Dr. Glover\"), in this medical malpractice suit.  Mizell v. Glover, 339 S.C. 567, 529 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 2000).  \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n  On March 2, 1993, Mrs. Mizell visited Dr. Glover for the first time for pain resulting from corns on the fourth and fifth toes of her right foot.  The pain began after she\r\nstarted a new job requiring her to stand for long periods of time.  On March 11, 1993, just nine days after her first visit,  Dr. Glover performed surgery to correct what he\r\ndiagnosed as \"hammertoes.\"  The surgery involved removing the toe joints that were rubbing together and causing the corns, and then disconnecting the tendons to the\r\nfourth and fifth toes.   Apparently, Mrs. Mizell was surprised to learn exactly what Dr. Glover had done after the surgery.  According to her testimony, she believed Dr.\r\nGlover was going to file down the bones underneath the corns, not remove the bones, and believed she would be out of work for a few days, not six weeks' as she claims\r\nDr. Glover informed her the day after surgery.\r\n\r\nFollowing the hammertoe surgery, Mrs. Mizell testified she suffered from intense pain, including swelling, discoloration, and alternating differences in the temperature of her\r\nfoot.  These symptoms are reflected in some of Dr. Glover's notes although he seems to attribute them to her inability to tolerate medication for pain and inflammation. \r\nMrs. Mizell continued to suffer pain around the toes already operated on, and, in addition, her second and third toes became painful.  According to both Mrs. Mizell and\r\nDr. Glover's accounts, these toes became increasingly contracted in the weeks following her first surgery.  Dr. Glover believed the contraction of her second and third\r\ntoes could be the cause of Mrs. Mizell's lingering pain.  To alleviate that pain, on April 27, 1993, he performed a second surgery to release the contractures in the\r\ntendons, allowing the toes to return to their normal position. \r\n\r\nAfter this second procedure, a painful lump developed on the bottom of Mrs. Mizell's foot.  Her foot hurt so badly that she would not allow Dr. Glover to touch it.  After\r\nexamining an x-ray of her foot, Dr. Glover preliminarily diagnosed the bump as a Morton's Neuroma.  On June 3, 1993, Dr. Glover performed exploratory surgery in\r\nwhich he confirmed the bump was a Morton's Neuroma and  removed it.   Although the Mizells appear to question whether the bump was a Morton's Neuroma, the\r\npathologist who examined the tissue extracted from Mrs. Mizell's foot testified it was a Morton's Neuroma.\r\n\r\nThis third surgery provided little relief to Mrs. Mizell, and she continued to complain to Dr. Glover.  Dr. Glover sent her to physical therapy around the first of June, but\r\ntherapy provided no relief.  On June 29, 1993, Dr. Glover referred Mrs. Mizell to her family physician, Dr. Still, to rule out any systemic problems, such as lupus or\r\nRaynaud's Disease, that could be causing her continued pain.  In his letter to Dr. Still, Dr. Glover noted discoloration in Mrs. Mizell's foot and hypersensitivity to cold. \r\nOn July 13, 1993, Mrs. Mizell returned to Dr. Glover, reporting that Dr. Still had eliminated the possibility of any vascular problems after a full work-up.  Dr. Glover gave\r\nher a steroid injection in another attempt to resolve the pain, but it was unsuccessful.  Finally, on July 27, 1993, Mr. Mizell stated he wanted to take his wife to see an\r\northopaedist in Charlotte, Dr. Gill.  Dr. Glover sent a letter and all his records to Dr. Gill.\r\n\r\nOn July 29, 1993, Mrs. Mizell visited Dr. Gill.  He diagnosed \"possible early [Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy],\" (1) gave her a prescription for a custom-made orthopaedic\r\nshoe, and advised her to walk on her foot as much as possible.  Dr. Gill scheduled Mrs. Mizell to return in two months.  When she returned, Dr. Gill believed her\r\ncondition had deteriorated, and he referred her to the Southeastern Pain Clinic for further diagnosis and treatment.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Mizell received some treatment at the pain clinic for RSD (including sympathetic blocks), but testified she received no lasting relief from it.  She stated the last\r\ntreatment option the pain clinic gave her was to attach a stimulator box to a wire along her spine through which she might be able to control the pain.  She and Mr. Mizell\r\ntestified they declined the treatment because they were told it carried a risk of paralysis.  Dr. Romanoff, an anesthesiologist at the Southeastern Pain Clinic, testified in his\r\ndeposition (read at trial) that he believed Mrs. Mizell was totally disabled, but that she could have received some relief from the stimulator which she chose not to pursue.  \r\n\r\nIn February 1996, the Mizells brought this medical malpractice and loss of consortium action against Dr. Glover.  The Mizells alleged Dr. Glover committed malpractice,\r\nbreaching the podiatrists' duty of care, by failing to diagnose Mrs. Mizell with RSD during his treatment of Mrs. Mizell.  Mrs. Mizell claims she is totally disabled as a\r\nresult of Dr. Glover's failure to diagnose the RSD.  Dr. Glover denied the malpractice allegations and the case went to trial in December of 1997.  The jury returned a\r\nverdict for Dr. Glover and the Mizells appealed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari.  The following evidentiary issues are before this Court:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Are the Mizells entitled to a new trial because Dr. Glover's counsel   cross-examined the Mizells' expert witness, Dr. Marne, extensively   regarding a jury interrogatory\r\nfrom a separate civil suit against Dr.   Marne, and then misstated that jury's finding in his closing   statement?\r\n\r\nII. Are the Mizells entitled to a new trial because the trial court refused   to admit an article written by Dr. Glover's testifying expert, Dr.   Buckholz, as an exhibit, but\r\nallowed the Mizells' counsel to publish   portions of the article during cross-examination?\r\n\r\nIII. Are the Mizells entitled to a new trial because the trial court   permitted a podiatrist, testifying as an expert for Dr. Glover, to   comment on the treatment of a medical\r\ndoctor at the Southeastern   Pain Clinic?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nI. Jury Interrogatory\r\n\r\nThe Mizells argue that Dr. Glover's attorney improperly questioned their expert, Dr. Marne, about a jury interrogatory from a  separate civil suit against Dr. Marne.  The\r\nMizells contend the evidence of the jury's finding was extrinsic evidence prohibited under Rule 608(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence (\"SCRE\").  The Mizells\r\nalso argue that questions regarding the jury interrogatory were improper because the case was settled and the interrogatory did not represent a final judgment.  We agree\r\nthat the evidence of the jury's finding was improperly admitted.\r\n\r\nThe interrogatory in question arose out of a suit by Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"Minnesota Life\") against Dr. Marne for making allegedly false statements\r\nregarding a personal disability claim he filed.  At trial, a Florida jury was asked by interrogatory if Dr. Marne had made misrepresentations to his insurance company.  The\r\njury answered that he had.  The jury was then asked if Dr. Marne committed fraud, and they answered that the fraud claim could not survive because of a statute of\r\nlimitations problem.  After the interrogatories were returned, the court entered judgment against Dr. Marne that did not include fraud.  While a motion for a new trial was\r\npending, the parties settled the matter.  Accordingly, the Mizells argue there was no final judgment. \r\n\r\nAt the Mizells' trial against Dr. Glover, Dr. Marne, a podiatrist, testified as an expert for the Mizells.  The Mizells filed a motion in limine before trial to exclude any\r\nevidence relating to Minnesota Life's lawsuit against Dr. Marne.  The court denied the motion, and the Mizells renewed their motion immediately before Dr. Marne's\r\ntestimony. (2)  In arguing against the motion, Dr. Glover's counsel contended the interrogatory in question was admissible under Rule 608, SCRE (3) \"as a matter affecting\r\nthe credibility of the witness.\"   The court denied the motion again, stating it would allow questioning of Dr. Marne regarding the trial for impeachment purposes pursuant\r\nto Rule 608, SCRE. \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' opinion on this issue was split.  Judge Goolsby found the question regarding the jury interrogatory did not constitute extrinsic evidence.   Mizell v.\r\nGlover, 339 S.C. 567, 529 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 2000).  Judge Connor, joined by Judge Howard, found the issue was not preserved for review.  Id.   Although she\r\ndeclined to address the issue fully, Judge Connor stated she believed, even if the interrogatory was inadmissible extrinsic evidence, that the error was harmless in light of\r\nDr. Marne's other testimony regarding the suit.  Id.\r\n\r\nDr. Glover argues the Court of Appeals should be affirmed on this issue because it was not preserved for review.  We disagree.  In order to preserve an issue for\r\nappellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.  Holy Loch Distributors Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000);\r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998).\r\n\r\n      In this case, the Mizells raised this issue - exclusion of the evidence from the Minnesota Life suit - on two occasions.  During the arguments on the second motion, Dr.\r\nGlover's counsel argued specifically that the interrogatory from the civil suit was admissible under Rule 608, SCRE.  The trial court agreed with Dr. Glover and admitted\r\nthe evidence under Rule 608.  We believe this issue was preserved through the Mizells' two motions.  Rule 608 was the only ground given by the trial court for admitting\r\nthe motion.  As such, it is only fair that the Mizells be able to argue that the trial court erred when it admitted the interrogatory under that Rule.\r\n\r\nBecause we find the issue was preserved for review, we must address whether or not Dr. Glover's question in which he recited the jury interrogatory and answer verbatim\r\nconstituted improper extrinsic evidence (prohibited under Rule 608(b), SCRE).  The Mizells argue this question, even without admission of the physical record of the\r\ninterrogatory, constituted improper extrinsic evidence.  To the contrary, Dr. Glover contends there is a distinction between admitting the physical record of the jury\r\ninterrogatory and admitting the oral record of the interrogatory, and that the oral record does not qualify as extrinsic evidence. \r\n\r\nRule 608(b) permits inquiry into specific instances of a witness' conduct during cross-examination, if such conduct is probative of the witness' truthfulness or\r\nuntruthfulness.  The Rule specifically states that such instances of conduct may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.  All parties agree that documentary evidence, such as\r\nthe record containing the jury interrogatory and response, would be inadmissible as extrinsic evidence. \r\n\r\nWe believe extrinsic evidence can be oral or written, as it is the source of the evidence that determines whether it is extrinsic, not whether it is introduced in oral or written\r\nform at trial.  Rule 608 permits questioning about the underlying event from the actor in the event, not rumors or reports of what others perceived about the event.  For\r\nexample, the Mizells concede Dr. Glover could have asked Dr. Marne, \"Did you make misrepresentations to your insurance company regarding a claim?\"  However,\r\nasking whether a jury found he made misrepresentations to his insurance company crosses over into the extrinsic evidence category.  Essentially, Rule 608(b) allows\r\nspecific instances of conduct to be inquired into on cross, but does not allow those instances of conduct to be proved by extrinsic evidence. (4)  Reading a jury\r\ninterrogatory into the record is more than inquiry into past conduct; the purpose of doing so is to prove past conduct.  Although Dr. Marne could have been questioned\r\n(and was questioned) about the  conduct that was the subject of the suit, he should not have been questioned directly regarding what a previous jury allegedly concluded\r\nabout such conduct. \r\n\r\nAlthough the trial court improperly admitted the \r\n  evidence of the jury's interrogatory, Dr. Glover argues the error was harmless. \r\n  We disagree. Although Dr. Glover correctly points out that the Mizells' counsel \r\n  elicited information from Dr. Marne about the Minnesota Life suit on direct \r\n  (5) and that he properly impeached Dr. Marne on his professional history \r\n  and qualifications during cross-examination, he fails to consider the impact \r\n  of his misstatement of the jury's finding in his closing argument. In closing, \r\n  Dr. Glover's counsel told the jury Dr. Marne had been found \"guilty of fraud \r\n  by a jury\" and admonished the jury \"to consider all those things in deciding \r\n  on the credibility of Dr. Marne.\" This statement is incorrect and highly prejudicial. \r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Marne was the Mizells' only expert witness \r\n  to testify that Dr. Glover had breached the podiatrists' standard of care. \r\n  (6) As such, his testimony and credibility were critical to the Mizells' \r\n  case. Dr. Glover used the alleged jury finding not simply to prove past conduct, \r\n  but to show what a previous jury had found regarding Dr. Marne. The purpose \r\n  of introducing this evidence was to argue to this jury that they should be influenced \r\n  by the actions of a previous jury. Further, Dr. Glover's counsel gave the jury \r\n  false information when he told them Dr. Marne had been found \"guilty of fraud.\" \r\n  (7) In light of these circumstances, we do not believe the Mizells \r\n  received a fair trial.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we note the Minnesota Life jury interrogatory was inadmissible on an additional ground as hearsay.  We find persuasive the jurisprudence developed by the\r\nFourth Circuit and other federal courts which have recognized that judicial findings of fact from one trial constitute hearsay when offered for admission in the context of\r\nanother trial.  See Nipper v. Snipes, 7 F.3d 415 (4th Cir. 1993); U.S. Steel, LLC v. Teico, Inc., 261 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Jones,29 F.3d 1549 (11th Cir.\r\n1994); Blue Cross and Blue Shield v. Philip Morris, Inc., 141 F.Supp. 2d 320 (E.D.N.Y. 2001). (8)  In Nipper, the Fourth Circuit held that judicial findings constitute\r\nhearsay and do not fall within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, including the exception for pubic records, Rule 803(8), FRE.  Nipper.  The Fourth Circuit made\r\nclear that its holding was firmly rooted in the common law.  Id. (Citing 5 John H. Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence Â§ 1671a (James H. Chadbourn rev. 1974) (citations\r\nomitted)). \r\n\r\nThe federal courts addressing this issue point to the great weight and obvious prejudicial effect that credibility assessments of witnesses by judges have on subsequent\r\njuries.  See Philip Morris, 141 F.Supp. 2d 320 (denying admission of a judge's statement regarding credibility of expert witness for impeachment of that expert at a\r\nsubsequent trial).  Although Philip Morris involved the credibility assessment of a judge and not the assessment of a jury, the jury's factual finding introduced in this case\r\nis hearsay nonetheless, and we believe, is equally prejudicial.  See U.S. Steel v. Teico (finding appellants were prejudiced by the admission of a previous judge's factual\r\nopinion into a subsequent trial because appellees relied on the opinion throughout the trial and advised the jury during closing argument to use the opinion to make their\r\nown credibility determinations).  As discussed, Dr. Glover's counsel told the jury in this case (incorrectly) that Dr. Marne was found \"guilty of fraud\" and that the jury\r\nshould consider that in assessing the credibility of Dr. Marne.\r\n\r\nWe find the jury interrogatory constituted improper extrinsic evidence, the admission of which constituted reversible error.  In addition, the jury interrogatory constitutes\r\ninadmissible hearsay.  We reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nII. Medical Treatise\r\n\r\nThe Mizells argue that the trial court improperly denied admission of a chapter in a podiatric textbook, written by Dr. Glover's expert, as an exhibit at trial.  We disagree.   \r\n\r\nAt trial, Dr. Glover called Dr. Buckholz, a podiatrist, to testify as an expert.  Dr. Buckholz testified that Dr. Glover had not breached the standard of care in his treatment\r\nof Mrs. Mizell or in his failure to diagnose RSD.  The Mizells claimed Dr. Buckholz's testimony conflicted with an article he wrote cautioning podiatrists to look for the\r\nwarning signs of RSD.  On cross-examination, the Mizells sought to introduce the chapter from the podiatric textbook in which Dr. Buckholz's article appeared.  The trial\r\ncourt ruled the document inadmissible, but allowed the Mizells' counsel to cross-examine Dr. Buckholz extensively about his article, reading portions of the article into the\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nDr. Glover argues that Rule 803(18), SCRE controls.  Rule 803(18) provides that the following works are not excluded by the hearsay rule:\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert witness in direct examination, statements contained in\r\npublished treatises, periodicals or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of\r\nthe witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice.  If admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.  This rule\r\nis in addition to any statutory provisions on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nThe Mizells argue the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the trial court's exclusion of the article itself.  The Mizells contend that Rule 803(18), SCRE would apply if the\r\narticle had been written by someone other than the witness, Dr. Buckhloz, but as it was written by Dr. Buckholz, it should have been admitted to impeach him under\r\nLaCount v. General Asbestos &amp; Rubber Co., 184 S.C. 232, 192 S.E.2d 262 (1937).  \r\n\r\nIn LaCount, this Court found the trial court committed error by not admitting scientific writings prepared by the testifying experts.  However, the Court found the error to\r\nbe harmless because the court permitted full cross-examination of the witnesses regarding the contents of the articles they had written.  LaCount, however, does not\r\ncontrol in this case.  It was decided long before the adoption of the SCRE.  Rule 803(18) is directly on point, and it does not distinguish between treatises written by the\r\ntestifying witness and treatises authored by others.  Rule 803(18) applies to both treatises written by the witness and those written by others, barring admission of the\r\ntreatise itself in both cases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it was proper for the trial court to deny admission of the article as an exhibit, but to allow the Mizells to cross-examine Dr. Buckholz regarding the article,\r\npublishing portions of it through their questions. (9)&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue.\r\nIII. Scope of Podiatrist Expert \r\n  Testimony\r\n\r\nThe Mizells argue the trial court erred by permitting Dr. Martin, a podiatrist testifying as an expert for Dr. Glover, to testify regarding Mrs. Mizell's treatment with Dr.\r\nRomanoff, an anesthesiologist at the Southeastern Pain Clinic.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Mizells' introduced the deposition of Dr. Romanoff, in which he reviewed Dr. Glover's treatment records of Mrs. Mizell, to show that Dr. Glover erred in not\r\ndiagnosing Mrs. Mizell with RSD earlier.  In turn, Dr. Glover called Dr. Martin to cast doubt on Dr. Romanoff's deposition testimony by suggesting that the pain clinic\r\nwhere Dr. Romanoff practices also had trouble diagnosing Mrs. Mizell with RSD.  Dr. Martin related his understanding, from reviewing the records, of what took place at\r\nthe pain clinic.  \r\n\r\nDr. Martin testified, in part, \"there was a very confusing picture to the pain management doctors. . . .\"  The Mizells' counsel objected, stating Dr. Martin was only qualified\r\nas a podiatrist, not as anesthesiologist capable of treating pain.  The court overruled the objection on grounds that Dr. Martin's opinion was based upon a review of the\r\nrecords in the case, permissible under the rules pertaining to experts.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found no error in the trial court's ruling, finding Dr. Martin's testimony was merely a recital of the initial treatment at the clinic rather than opinion on\r\nthe quality and scope of the clinic's treatment.  On appeal, the Mizells argue again that Dr. Martin, although an expert in podiatry, was not qualified to testify as an expert\r\nin the area of pain management.  \r\n\r\nRule 702, SCRE, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert\r\nby knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court has given the trial court wide discretion in determining the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their testimony.  McGee v. Bruce, 321 S.C.\r\n340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996); Creed v. Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 426 S.E.2d 785 (1993).  A trial court's ruling to exclude or admit expert testimony will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.  Jenkins v. E.L. Long Motor Lines, 233 S.C. 87, 103 S.E.2d 523 (1958).  \r\n\r\nFor a court to find a witness competent to testify as an expert, the witness must be better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of the\r\ntestimony.  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 487 S.E.2d 596 (1997).  In Gooding, this Court found error in the trial court's exclusion of the\r\ntestimony of an Emergency Medical Technician (\"EMT\") regarding intubation procedures, finding the EMT had sufficient knowledge of the procedure to give an opinion\r\non a doctor's performance of the procedure.  This Court found the disparity in training and education between the EMT and the doctor he testified against was relevant to\r\nthe EMT's credibility as a witness, but found the difference in qualifications affected only the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony.  Id.\r\n\r\nUnder Gooding and Rule 702, SCRE, the trial court correctly allowed Dr. Martin to testify regarding Mrs. Mizell's treatment at the pain clinic, even though he was not\r\nqualified himself to administer the treatment he recounted.  The jury was aware of Dr. Martin's credentials as a podiatrist and of Dr. Romanoff's credentials as an\r\nanesthesiologist.  Therefore, they could have given Dr. Martin's testimony less weight than Dr. Romanoff's.  Accordingly, Dr. Martin's limited opinion regarding Mrs.\r\nMizell's treatment at the pain clinic was correctly admitted and upheld by the Court of Appeals.  Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE IN PART the opinion of the Court of Appeals and REMAND for a new trial.     \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (\"RSD\") is a rare condition affecting the sympathetic nervous system, usually in an extremity, resulting in ongoing cycles of extreme pain. \r\nIt is often triggered by an accident, surgery, or other injury.  Early diagnosis and treatment of the condition is critical to curing RSD.  If it is not treated early enough, the\r\ncondition and the pain caused by it can be become permanent. \r\n2. The Mizells' counsel argued for exclusion of any evidence of fraud because the final judgment did not make any finding of fraud, but did not mention Rule 608\r\nspecifically.\r\n3. Rule 608(b) provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility, other than conviction of a crime as provided in Rule 609,\r\nmay not be proved by extrinsic evidence.  They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness' character for truthfulness or untruthfulness or . . . .\r\n\r\n4. The Mizells argued at trial and continue to argue before this Court that because the jury finding was not part of a final judgment, it was not an instance of conduct and,\r\ntherefore, was not admissible.  Admitting jury findings from prior civil cases is problematic whether the findings are final or not because the findings are always extrinsic\r\nevidence, most likely admitted to prove a witness' conduct (exactly what Rule 608(b) is intended to prevent).  Rule 609, SCRE, permits admission of evidence of criminal\r\nconvictions for impeachment purposes, and is pointedly silent as to admission of civil judgments.  Further, Rule 803(22) carves an exception to the hearsay rule for\r\nadmission of criminal convictions, and does not mention civil judgments or verdicts.  Further, the rules  prohibit admission of more than the fact of conviction; they do\r\nnot permit the record of the trial to be admitted along with the conviction.  See United States v. Robinson, 8 F.3d 398 (7th Cir. 1993).  Admitting an interrogatory, a\r\nsmall piece of the verdict, would seem to be prohibited under the same rationale.\r\n5. In response to a question by the Mizells' counsel on direct, Dr. Marne stated he had been named in six malpractice suits, another lawsuit, and a divorce and explained\r\nthe circumstances of the suit against him by Minnesota Life, admitting he had to settle with the insurance company for a large sum of money.\r\n6. The Mizzels introduced the deposition of Dr. Romanoff, an anesthesiologist specializing in  pain management at the Southeaster Pain Clinic, but he did not testify\r\nregarding the podiatrists' standard of care.  He reviewed Dr. Glover's records and opined that Mrs. Mizell's chances of recovery would have been better if she had been\r\nreferred to him earlier.  Dr. Romanoff's deposition testimony is discussed in Part III of this opinion.\r\n7. As discussed, the jury did \r\n  not find Dr. Marne had committed fraud in the civil context and certainly not \r\n  that he was guilty of fraud which connotes a criminal conviction. \r\n8. Dr. Glover cites several federal cases in support of his argument that credibility assessments by judges are not extrinsic evidence and are admissible in subsequent trials. \r\nSee United States v. Amahia, 825 F.2d 177 (8th Cir. 1987); United States v. Terry, 702 F.3d 299 (2d Cir. 1983).  Dr. Glover did not discuss the precedent of the\r\nFourth Circuit discussed in the text above.  We find the Fourth Circuit employed the correct analysis, and that the jury's response to the interrogatory is a judicial finding\r\nconstituting inadmissible hearsay. \r\n9. Although Rule 803(18) controls, we note any error in not admitting the article as an exhibit would be harmless error under LaCount.  The Mizells' counsel cross-examined Dr. Buckholz regarding the contents of his article extensively, with no limitation by the court.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral B. Allen Bullard, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth R. McMahon, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  This Court granted Charles Gardner's (\"Petitioner\") petition for a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthe denial, after a hearing, of his application for Post-Conviction Relief (\"PCR\").  Petitioner argues the PCR court erred in\r\nfinding he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.  We agree.\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn February 1995, Petitioner was indicted on two counts: (1) for trafficking over 400 grams of cocaine; and (2) for\r\ntrafficking over eighty grams of crack cocaine.  Pursuant to a plea agreement, Petitioner plead guilty to trafficking twenty-eight grams or more, but less than 100 grams, of cocaine and to trafficking ten grams or more, but less than twenty-eight\r\ngrams, of crack cocaine.  Petitioner was not represented by counsel at the plea hearing.  Pursuant to the State's\r\nrecommendation, Petitioner received concurrent 10 year sentences.\r\n\r\nIn September 1995, Petitioner filed an application for PCR. After a hearing, the PCR judge denied Petitioner relief. \r\nPetitioner then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.  This Court granted certiorari, and the sole issue before this\r\nCourt is:\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the PCR Court err in holding Petitioner knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the record does not support the PCR court's finding that he understood the dangers of self-representation\r\nand knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.  We agree.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Petitioner testified he retained an attorney after he was arrested.  However, because he was unable to\r\nafford the legal fees, the private attorney stopped representing Petitioner. (1)  A public defender was never appointed. \r\n\r\nPetitioner testified he spoke with Assistant Solicitor Jon Ozmint (\"Ozmint\") about his plea. (2)  Petitioner stated Ozmint\r\ninformed him that his bond would be revoked if he refused to plead guilty.  According to Petitioner, Ozmint told him he\r\nwould recommend a seven year sentence, of which he would only have to serve three years, if Petitioner would plead guilty\r\nand turn in three other drug dealers.  Ozmint admits he discussed a plea with Petitioner, but denied he ever told Petitioner\r\nthat his bond would be revoked or that he would only have to serve three years. \r\n\r\nPetitioner's brother, Rick Gardner, also testified at the PCR hearing.  He stated Ozmint offered Petitioner a seven year deal\r\nand promised him he would only have to spend four years in prison.  He later testified Ozmint offered Petitioner a ten year\r\ndeal and promised he would only spend three years in prison. \r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Petitioner admitted Magistrate David Crenshaw (3) informed him at his arraignment that he had a\r\nright to a public defender.  Furthermore, he stated he was aware public defenders were available to represent people who\r\ncould not afford to hire private counsel.  In fact, Petitioner  testified he had been represented by a public defender in 1993\r\non a charge of possession of cocaine.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found Petitioner failed to prove that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel.  In its\r\norder, the PCR court stated Petitioner was of above average intelligence. (4)  The court further stated the record indicated\r\nPetitioner was advised at his arraignment that he had a right to a public defender.  In addition, the court found Petitioner\r\nwas completely familiar with the court system. \r\n\r\nAccording to the United States Supreme Court, in order to waive the right to counsel, the accused must be (1) advised of\r\nhis right to counsel and (2) adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation.  Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 392\r\nS.E.2d 462 (1990) (citing Faretta v.California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1972)) (emphasis added). \r\nThe trial judge must determine whether there is a knowing and intelligent waiver by the defendant.  State v. Dixon, 269\r\nS.C. 107, 236 S.E.2d 419 (1977) (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938)).  If the\r\ntrial judge fails to address the disadvantages of appearing pro se, as required by the second prong of Faretta, \"this Court\r\nwill look to the record to determine whether petitioner had sufficient background or was apprised of his rights by some\r\nother source.\"  Prince, 301 S.C. at 424, 392 S.E.2d at 463 (citing Wroten v. State, 301 S.C. 293, 391 S.E.2d 575 (1990)).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile a specific inquiry by the trial judge expressly addressing the disadvantages of a pro se defense is preferred, the\r\nultimate test is not the trial judge's advice but rather the defendant's understanding.  If the record demonstrates the\r\ndefendant's decision to represent himself was made with an understanding of the risks of self-representation, the\r\nrequirements of a voluntary waiver will be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nWroten, 301 S.C. at 294, 391 S.E.2d at 576 (citing Fitzpatrick v. Wainwright, 800 F.2d 1057, 1065 (11th Cir. 1986))\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn a PCR action, if the record fails to demonstrate the petitioner made an informed choice to proceed pro se, with \"eyes\r\nopen,\" then the petitioner did not make a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel, and the case should be remanded for a\r\nnew trial.   See Watts v. State, 347 S.C. 399, 556 S.E.2d 368 (2001); Wroten; Prince; Bridwell v. State, 306 S.C. 518, 413\r\nS.E.2d 30 (1992).  We find Petitioner was not adequately apprised of the dangers of self-representation.  The plea judge\r\nnever even acknowledged that Petitioner did not have counsel with him at the plea hearing.  The judge did not inquire\r\nabout why Petitioner had relieved his counsel, or if he wished to have counsel present.  There is absolutely no mention by\r\nthe judge of anything relating to the right to an attorney, the dangers of self-representation, or the like in the guilty plea\r\ntranscript.  Furthermore, Petitioner did not say anything about counsel.  He never stated that he did not want an attorney,\r\nthat he wished to waive this right, or that he wanted to represent himself.\r\n\r\nBecause of the absolute failure of the plea judge to ask Petitioner for a waiver and to apprise him of the dangers of\r\nappearing pro se, as is required by Faretta, this Court must look into the record to determine if Petitioner had sufficient\r\nbackground or was apprised of his rights by some other source.  Prince; Wroten (absent a specific inquiry by the trial court\r\ninto the hazards of proceeding pro se, this Court will examine the record to determine whether the accused was advised of\r\nhis rights from some other source or had sufficient background to intelligently waive his right to counsel).  When\r\ndetermining if an accused has a sufficient background to understand the dangers of self-representation, the courts consider\r\nmany factors including: (1) the accused's age, educational background, and physical and mental health; (2) whether the\r\naccused was previously involved in criminal trials; (3) whether the accused knew the nature of the charge(s) and of the\r\npossible penalties; (4) whether the accused was represented by counsel before trial and whether that attorney explained to\r\nhim the dangers of self-representation; (5) whether the accused was attempting to delay or manipulate the proceedings; (6)\r\nwhether the court appointed stand-by counsel; (7) whether the accused knew he would be required to comply with the rules\r\nof procedure at trial; (8) whether the accused knew of legal challenges he could raise in defense to the charge(s) against\r\nhim; (9) whether the exchange between the accused and the court consisted merely of pro forma answers to pro forma\r\nquestions; and (10) whether the accused's waiver resulted from either coercion or mistreatment.  State v. Cash, 309 S.C. 40,\r\n43, 419 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1992) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nWhile there is evidence in the record to indicate Petitioner was aware of his right to counsel, there is insufficient evidence\r\nto indicate he was aware of the dangers of self-representation.  After weighing the factors above, we find the PCR court\r\nerred in finding Petitioner knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.\r\n\r\nFirst, the plea judge did not give Petitioner any warning about the dangers of proceeding pro se.  He did not inform him of\r\nthe nature of the charges or of the possible penalties.  Petitioner did have a 12th grade education, and he had been\r\nrepresented by counsel on a previous charge to which he pled guilty.  He also had a private attorney when he was first\r\ncharged.  However, the record gives no indication this attorney explained to him the dangers of self-representation.  See\r\nWroten (fact that petitioner had spoken with an attorney and fact that he had plead guilty to another charge in 1979 did not\r\nsufficiently demonstrate that he was aware of the dangers of self-representation).\r\n\r\nSecond, although the guilty plea proceeding did not consist merely of pro forma questions and answers, the transcript on its\r\nface poses several other problems which would indicate the plea itself was not knowing and voluntary.  This Court and the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court have held that before a court can accept a guilty plea, a defendant must be advised of the\r\nfederal and state constitutional rights he or she is waiving.  Boykin v. Alabama, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 395 U.S. 242, 23 L. Ed. 2d\r\n274 (1969); Pittman v. State, 337 S.C. 597, 524 S.E.2d 623 (1999).  Specifically, a defendant must be aware of the\r\nprivilege against self incrimination, the right to a jury trial, the right to confront one's accusers, the nature and crucial\r\nelements of the offense, the maximum and any mandatory minimum penalty, and the nature of the constitutional rights\r\nbeing waived.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the plea judge did not even ask Petitioner for an admission of guilt.  The transcript also indicates the trial judge\r\ndid not advise Petitioner of the crucial elements of the charged offenses, or of the possible penalties if the recommended\r\nsentence was not accepted by the plea judge.  In addition, the trial judge did not ask questions to ensure Petitioner's\r\nunderstanding of the consequences of his plea. Furthermore, any defect in the court's questioning was not cured by the\r\naccused conversation with another source, since Petitioner had no attorney. See State v. Ray, 310 S.C. 431, 437, 427 S.E.2d\r\n171, 174 (1993) (a knowing and voluntary waiver of the constitutional rights which accompany a guilty plea \"may be\r\naccomplished by colloquy between the Court and the defendant, between the Court and defendant's counsel, or both.\")\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the PCR court's order of dismissal and REMAND for a new trial.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. The record is not clear at what point Petitioner's private attorney stopped his representation.\r\n2. Following the initial dismissal of Petitioner's PCR application, he filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.  This Court\r\nissued an order remanding the case back to the PCR judge for a reconstruction of the record from the PCR hearing.  The\r\nPCR judge then issued a second order finding an additional hearing to reconstruct was unnecessary because the first order\r\nwas so detailed. Petitioner has not voiced an objection to this order.  Accordingly, the testimony discussed comes from the\r\nOrder of Dismissal.\r\n3. Judge Crenshaw also testified at the PCR hearing.  He stated it was his usual practice to explain to those who appear\r\nbefore him that they have a right to a public defender.  He further testified that he makes sure the accused understands his\r\nright to an attorney before he allows him to sign a \"statement of rights\" form.  However, Judge Crenshaw did not testify\r\nthat he explained to Petitioner the dangers of self-representation.\r\n4. The record is unclear whether Petitioner actually graduated from high school.  In his application for PCR, he stated he did\r\nnot have a high school diploma.  At his guilty plea hearing, when asked how far he went in school, Petitioner responded,\r\n\"12th Grade.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25530","title":"In the Matter of Vannie Williams, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25530","description":"In this opinion, the Court placed Vannie Williams on indefinite suspension for commingling and misappropriating client funds and for failing to maintain required financial records.","date":"2002-09-23","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n25530\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE \r\n  OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Vannie Williams, \r\n          Jr.,Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion \r\n  No. 25530\r\n  Submitted July 30, 2002 - Filed September 23, 2002\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE \r\n  SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B. Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant\r\n          Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office \r\n          of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nClifford  Scott, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary \r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition \r\n  of a sanction within the range of sanctions set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.  We accept the agreement and find an indefinite suspension from \r\n  the practice of law is the appropriate sanction. \r\nFacts\r\nSince 1997, respondent has failed to maintain \r\n  client ledger cards or monthly reconciliation sheets reflecting the receipt, \r\n  disbursement and balance of funds in his trust account.  Respondent has also \r\n  failed to maintain any other register, log or document reflecting the accurate \r\n  balance or existence of accumulated attorney's fees in his trust account.  \r\nA review of respondent's trust account from January 1, 2001 until\r\nDecember 31, \r\n  2001, found the account had a negative balance on three occasions and eight \r\n  checks were returned for non-sufficient funds.  Deposits were made without information \r\n  necessary to identify the case file number, client name or source of the funds, \r\n  nor was respondent able to provide that information upon examination of his \r\n  own financial records.  Moreover, forty-six checks, payable to respondent and \r\n  marked &quot;attorney's fees,&quot; were written on the account, and one telephone \r\n  transfer of funds for attorney's fees was made out of the account without any \r\n  information regarding the case file number or client from which they were earned.  \r\n  Respondent was unable to provide that information upon examination of his financial \r\n  records.  He was also unable to identify client funds, or distinguish attorney's \r\n  fees, if any, from client funds, in the trust account upon examination of a \r\n  monthly bank statement.\r\nTo further confuse matters, respondent deposited \r\n  personal funds into his trust account in an effort to conceal assets from the \r\n  Internal Revenue Service, which had attached liens to his personal banking accounts.  \r\n  He also paid personal debts and expenses from the trust account, including restitution \r\n  ordered by this Court in In the Matter of Williams, 336 S.C. 578, 521 \r\n  S.E.2d 497 (1999).\r\nPrior to and during the one year review period, \r\n  respondent received funds on behalf of six clients and deposited the funds into \r\n  his trust account.  In four of those matters, respondent did not pay the clients, \r\n  or third party providers he had agreed to pay on behalf of a client, the amounts \r\n  owed them for anywhere from three to seventeen months after he received the \r\n  funds.  Between the time that he received the funds and the time he paid the \r\n  clients or third party providers, respondent's trust account often had a negative \r\n  balance, thereby indicating the client funds had been misappropriated or converted \r\n  for purposes other than those for which they were intended. [1]   The funds eventually used to pay the clients \r\n  and third party providers came from a source other than the funds that had been \r\n  held in trust for them.  In the remaining two matters, respondent has failed \r\n  to pay the clients all of the funds owed them.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has \r\n  violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule \r\n  407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a \r\n  client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness \r\n  in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably \r\n  informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests \r\n  for information); Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer shall hold property of clients or third \r\n  persons that is in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation \r\n  separate from the lawyer's own property); Rule 1.15(b) (upon receiving funds \r\n  in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify \r\n  the client or third person, shall promptly deliver to the client or third person \r\n  any funds or other property the client or third person is entitled to receive \r\n  and, upon request, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such funds); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).  \r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following provisions of the \r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it \r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to \r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or to engage in conduct \r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\nConclusion\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants \r\n  an indefinite suspension from the practice of law.  Respondent shall not be \r\n  entitled to seek reinstatement to the practice of law until he has paid in full \r\n  the amounts owed to the two clients referenced above or repaid the Lawyers' \r\n  Fund for Client Protection if it has paid the amounts respondent owed to those \r\n  clients.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall \r\n  file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with \r\n  Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n&nbsp; INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In one matter, respondent issued a check to the \r\n    client but it was returned due to insufficient funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25531","title":"Tate v.

McIntosh, Assistant \r\n  Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General \r\n  William Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  JUSTICE WALLER:  Petitioner was convicted of murder, assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill (ABIK), attempted armed robbery, housebreaking, and grand \r\n  larceny of a motor vehicle.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder, \r\n  twenty years for ABIK, twenty years for attempted armed robbery, five years \r\n  for housebreaking, and ten years for grand larceny of a motor vehicle, the sentences \r\n  to run consecutively.  No direct appeal was taken.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR) was denied.  This \r\n  Court granted petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to determine whether \r\n  petitionerâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s presumption of malice charges.  We find that counsel was ineffective \r\n  and reverse the order of the PCR judge as to the ABIK charge.\r\nFACTS\r\n Shortly \r\n  before 4:00 a.m. on August 13, 1982, petitioner broke into Hack Motor Company \r\n  and stole an automobile.  He then drove to the Travel Inn Motor Lodge where \r\n  sixty year old Jean DeBelli was working as the motel desk clerk.  The owners \r\n  of the motel, the Baileys, lived in an apartment behind the office.  Petitioner \r\n  entered the office of the motel, pulled out a gun, and stated to Mrs. DeBelli, \r\n  â€œGive me the money.â€  Mrs. DeBelli refused, and petitioner stated, â€œPlease, \r\n  please give me the money.â€  When Mrs. DeBelli raised a pair of scissors she \r\n  had in her hand, petitioner shot her in the chest.  Mrs. DeBelli died from the \r\n  gunshot wound.  \r\nPetitioner \r\n  attempted to exit the motel, but discovered that the front door was locked.  \r\n  He then noticed the door to the Baileysâ€™ apartment and went up the steps towards \r\n  that door in an attempt to exit the motel.  At that point, fifteen year old \r\n  Jimbo Bailey, who had heard yelling and a gunshot, opened the apartment door.  \r\n  Blitz, the Baileysâ€™ German shepherd, began barking and attacked petitioner, \r\n  biting him on his leg.  Petitioner fired a shot into the apartment which hit \r\n  Jimbo in the back of the leg.  Blitz was shot twice by petitioner.\r\nRobert Bailey was awakened by the gunshots.  He retrieved his pistol and went \r\n  into the living room of the apartment where he saw a gun being pointed into \r\n  the room.  When Bailey yelled, â€œGet the hell outta here,â€ petitioner moved down \r\n  the steps.  Bailey then reached around the corner and fired his weapon into \r\n  the office, hitting a vending machine.  Petitioner moved back towards the apartment, \r\n  and Bailey closed the apartment door.  Petitioner then shot out the glass door \r\n  of the motel office and exited the building.  Bailey shot at petitioner as he \r\n  drove away from the motel.\r\nWhen petitioner was arrested, he stated that he â€œdid not mean for anyone to \r\n  get hurt at the motel.â€   In his statement, petitioner told police, â€œthey were \r\n  just coming at me from everywheres [sic]. . . . I didnâ€™t know which way to go \r\n  or what to do.â€   Petitioner confessed to police and agreed to participate in \r\n  a videotaped reenactment of the crimes at the motel.  \r\nThe trial judge charged the jury on voluntary manslaughter, as a lesser included \r\n  offense of murder, and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN), \r\n  as a lesser included offense of ABIK.  In his charge to the jury, the trial \r\n  judge initially instructed the jury on express and implied malice as follows:\r\n\r\nNow, malice is said \r\n  to be express when there is manifested a violent, deliberate intention, unlawfully \r\n  to take away the life of a human being.  And malice is implied where one intentionally \r\n  and deliberately does an unlawful act, which he then knows to be wrong and in \r\n  violation of his duty to another, and where no excuse or legal provocation appeared.\r\n\r\nFollowing the charge, the solicitor informed the judge that he did not believe \r\n  a charge that malice may be implied from the use of a deadly weapon had been \r\n  given.  The trial judge erroneously indicated that he had given the charge.  \r\n  However, the jury was then called back into the courtroom, and the court reporter \r\n  noted that one of petitionerâ€™s attorneys â€œobjected as giving undue emphasis.â€   \r\n  In his supplemental charge to the jury, the trial judge stated that â€œ[m]alice \r\n  is implied and presumed from the use of a deadly weapon.â€   After the charge, \r\n  counsel did not object to the presumption of malice instruction.\r\nAfter one and a half hours of deliberation, the jury asked for a definition \r\n  of malice aforethought and ABIK.  The trial judge again charged the jury that \r\n  malice is presumed from the use of a deadly weapon.    Following this charge, \r\n  counsel stated, â€œYour Honor, I wasnâ€™t in the courtroom when the presumption \r\n  of malice was previously charged, . . . but I believe we did enter an objection \r\n  to that.  We want that to continue.â€  When the assistant solicitor indicated \r\n  that he did not recall an objection, the trial judge stated, â€œShe noted it for \r\n  the record.â€\r\nThe jury later asked for an explanation of murder and manslaughter.  In that \r\n  charge, the trial judge repeated the instruction that malice is presumed from \r\n  the use of a deadly weapon.   Later in the charge, the trial judge stated, â€œNow, \r\n  in speaking of implied malice, thatâ€™s for the jury.  The implication is to require \r\n  the jury - -  does not require the jury to infer malice, but only permits it \r\n  to consider it.â€  When the jury foreman asked for the trial judge to review \r\n  the portion of the charge about â€œwicked heart,â€ the judge repeated his malice \r\n  charge without including the language regarding the presumption of malice from \r\n  the use of a deadly weapon.\r\nOn \r\n  PCR, petitioner alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to \r\n  object to the presumption of malice charges as erroneous burden shifting instructions.  \r\n  The PCR judge found that counsel noted a continuing objection to the malice \r\n  charge. [1]   In addition, the \r\n  judge found that petitioner failed to show he was prejudiced by the charge.  \r\n  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas petitionerâ€™s trial counsel ineffective in failing to object to the presumption \r\n  of malice charges?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and \r\n  exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions \r\n  in the case.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, \r\n  80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 \r\n  (1989).  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the applicant must \r\n  show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable \r\n  probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have \r\n  been different.  Strickland v. Washington, supra; Rhodes v. \r\n  State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002).  A reasonable probability is \r\n  a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.  \r\n  Id.\r\nThe State concedes that the trial judgeâ€™s charges that malice is presumed from \r\n  the use of a deadly weapon were unconstitutional burden shifting instructions.  \r\n  See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d \r\n  49 (1979).  Because the presumption of malice charges were erroneous charges \r\n  to which counsel did not object on the ground that they constituted unconstitutional \r\n  burden shifting instructions, counselâ€™s performance was deficient.  Taylor \r\n  v. State, 312 S.C. 179, 439 S.E.2d 820 (1993) (counsel was deficient in \r\n  failing to object to a jury charge which shifted the burden of proof to the \r\n  defendant).\r\nAs to the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that petitioner was not prejudiced by the malice \r\n  charges, an unconstitutional burden shifting instruction is not reversible error \r\n  if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Rose v. Clark, \r\n  478 U.S. 570, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986); Plyler v. State, \r\n  309 S.C. 408, 424 S.E.2d 477 (1992).  This Court must determine whether there \r\n  is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in a way that \r\n  violates the Constitution.  Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. \r\n  1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990); State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  248 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1027, 121 S.Ct. 1974, 149 L.Ed.2d \r\n  766 (2001).  An erroneous malice instruction is harmless if, based on all of \r\n  the evidence presented to the jury, it did not contribute to the verdict.  Plyler \r\n  v. State, supra.  In making this determination, the Court must review \r\n  the evidence the jury considered in reaching its verdict and weigh the probative \r\n  force of the evidence against the probative force of the presumption standing \r\n  alone.  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992), cert. \r\n  denied, 507 U.S. 927, 113 S.Ct. 1302, 122 L.Ed.2d 691 (1993).\r\nMalice is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved \r\n  spirit intent on doing wrong.  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d \r\n  63 (1998); State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480 (1987).  It \r\n  is the doing of a wrongful act intentionally and without just cause or excuse.  \r\n  State v. Bell, 305 S.C. 11, 406 S.E.2d 165 (1991), cert. denied, \r\n  502 U.S. 1038, 112 S.Ct. 888, 116 L.Ed.2d 791 (1992).\r\nAs to the shooting of Mrs. DeBelli, the jury need not have relied on the presumption \r\n  of malice from the use of a deadly weapon in order to find that petitioner acted \r\n  with malice in shooting Mrs. DeBelli.  Petitioner shot Mrs. DeBelli when she \r\n  refused to give him the money from the motel and threatened him with a pair \r\n  of scissors.  Although the trial judge instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter, \r\n  the evidence did not support the charge.  Mrs. DeBelliâ€™s attempt to resist or \r\n  defend herself from a crime cannot satisfy the sufficient legal provocation \r\n  element of voluntary manslaughter.  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d 805, cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 404, 151 L.Ed.2d \r\n  306 (2001).  Therefore, the erroneous malice instructions were harmless with \r\n  regard to the juryâ€™s consideration of voluntary manslaughter.  \r\nIn addition, although petitioner indicated regret over killing Mrs. DeBelli, \r\n  the evidence showed that the shooting was a wrongful act intentionally committed \r\n  without just cause or excuse.  State v. Bell, supra.  Because \r\n  all of the evidence showed that petitioner acted with malice in shooting Mrs. \r\n  DeBelli, the erroneous presumption of malice charges did not contribute to the \r\n  murder verdict.\r\nHowever, there is a reasonable likelihood that the erroneous charges did affect \r\n  the juryâ€™s consideration of the charges of ABIK and ABHAN for the shooting of \r\n  Jimbo Bailey.  ABIK is an unlawful act of violent injury to the person of another \r\n  with malice aforethought, either express or implied.  State v. Sutton, \r\n  340 S.C. 393, 532 S.E.2d 283 (2000).  ABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury \r\n  to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.  State v. Fennell, \r\n  340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000).  Circumstances of aggravation include the \r\n  use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious \r\n  bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, \r\n  a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking \r\n  indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful \r\n  authority.  Id.  A defendant may be convicted of ABHAN regardless of \r\n  whether malice is present.  Id.\r\nAbsent the erroneous presumption of malice charges, the jury could have found \r\n  petitioner guilty of ABHAN rather than ABIK for shooting Jimbo Bailey.  The \r\n  evidence of malice in that shooting was not overwhelming.  In fact, according \r\n  to petitionerâ€™s statement, he shot into the apartment when Blitz attacked him \r\n  and was not shooting at Jimbo.\r\nThe State argues that petitioner was not prejudiced by the erroneous presumption \r\n  of malice charges because the trial judge adequately informed the jury of the \r\n  Stateâ€™s burden of proof.  The trial judge did instruct the jury that the State \r\n  had the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in his original charge.  \r\n  However, the presumption of malice from the use of a deadly weapon was charged \r\n  three times in the judgeâ€™s supplemental instructions.  The term â€œreasonable \r\n  doubtâ€ was mentioned only once in these supplemental instructions when the trial \r\n  judge instructed the jury to resolve any doubt in favor of the lesser included \r\n  offense.  Therefore, the correct instructions on the Stateâ€™s burden of proof \r\n  did not render the erroneous presumption of malice charges harmless.\r\nThe State further argues that the trial judge cured any error by charging the \r\n  jury that the inference of malice was a question for the jury.  The trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  instruction that there was an inference of malice which permits, but does not \r\n  require, the jury to infer malice was not given immediately following the malice \r\n  charges.  In addition, the charge was given only once, whereas the erroneous \r\n  presumption of malice charge was repeated three times.  This charge did not \r\n  cure the error in the presumption of malice charges.   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the presumption of malice instructions were erroneous burden shifting \r\n  instructions which were not harmless error as to the ABIK charge, petitioner \r\n  met his burden of proving that counsel was ineffective in failing to object \r\n  to the instructions.  Accordingly, the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that counsel was \r\n  not ineffective in failing to object to the instructions is reversed as to the \r\n  ABIK conviction.  Ingle v. State, supra (the PCR judgeâ€™s findings \r\n  will not be upheld if there is no probative evidence to support them).  We affirm \r\n  the order of the PCR judge as to the murder conviction.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n \r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  This finding is not supported by the record.  Ingle v. State, \r\n    348 S.C. 467, 560 S.E.2d 401 (2002) (the PCR judgeâ€™s findings will not be \r\n    upheld if there is no probative evidence to support them).  The only objection \r\n    to the charge was one of â€œundue emphasisâ€ made before the charge was given.  \r\n    Although counsel indicated after the presumption was charged for a second \r\n    time that an objection had been made, counsel never objected to the charge \r\n    on the ground that it unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
