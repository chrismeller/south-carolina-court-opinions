Allen Bullard, \r\n  Jr., and Assistant Attorney General William Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for \r\n  Petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Tara S. Taggart, of \r\n  S.C. Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Petitioner asks this \r\n  court to review the post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€) judgeâ€™s grant of Respondentâ€™s \r\n  PCR application on the grounds that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel failed to object \r\n  to the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to charge voluntary manslaughter.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn August 3, 1979, Harold Medlin (â€œHaroldâ€) \r\n  drove over to Dorothy Robertsâ€™ (â€œDorothyâ€) home to pick up a refrigerator.  \r\n  Haroldâ€™s ex-wife, Linda Jean Medlin (â€œLinda Jeanâ€), was also at Dorothyâ€™s house.  \r\n  Harold pulled his pick-up truck underneath a carport where the refrigerator \r\n  was located, and Linda Jean came over and was trying to help him place the refrigerator \r\n  in the truck bed when Linda Jeanâ€™s boyfriend Clifton Harris (â€œCliftonâ€) pulled \r\n  up in his station wagon.  \r\n Harold said, â€œYou got here just in time \r\n  to help me load the refrigerator,â€ and Clifton helped him load the refrigerator.  \r\n  Harold testified that despite Linda Jean and Cliftonâ€™s adulterous affair, which \r\n  led to his divorce from Linda Jean, he maintained a friendly relationship with \r\n  Clifton. [1]   Clifton had been drinking most of the day \r\n  and was taking prescription painkillers that a doctor prescribed after Clifton \r\n  hurt his back in a car accident.  Clifton then asked Linda Jean to go out to \r\n  dinner with him, but she responded that she could not because she had previously \r\n  arranged to take her sons out to dinner.  \r\nHarold and a neighbor across the street, \r\n  Lillie Long, [2]  testified that Clifton and Linda \r\n  Jean got into a scuffle as Clifton tried to force her into the back seat of \r\n  his car.  Harold said, â€œClifton, donâ€™t start hitting her like that.â€  Linda \r\n  Jean resisted being forced into the car and scampered away from him in the direction \r\n  of Harold.  Clifton then grabbed an automatic .22 rifle from the car and fired \r\n  three shots in the direction of Linda Jean and Harold.  Clifton testified that \r\n  Harold had picked up a steel refrigerator grate and was heading in his direction, \r\n  so he fired three warning shots to keep Harold from advancing.  Harold testified \r\n  that he did not pick up a grate nor advance towards Clifton.  \r\nTwo of the shots hit the ceiling of the carport \r\n  and the third hit Linda Jean in her back, and she fell to the ground.  Harold \r\n  testified that Clifton had raised the rifle to his shoulder before firing the \r\n  shots, and Clifton testified that he shot the gun from his waist. \r\n Harold then ran out of the carport towards \r\n  the back yard, and Clifton began shooting at him.  Clifton shot him four times \r\n  before he fell.  Harold â€œplayed dead,â€ and Clifton approached him, placed the \r\n  barrel of the rifle on his throat, and shot him.  Clifton ran towards his car \r\n  but turned around once more and shot Harold in the left hip.  Linda Jean was \r\n  found dead by the police and paramedics, and miraculously, Harold survived.  \r\n\r\nClifton pled guilty to assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill (ABIK) Harold and was convicted of the murder of Linda Jean, \r\n  which was affirmed on direct appeal.  State v. Harris, 275 S.C. 463, \r\n  272 S.E.2d 636 (1980).  The trial court granted Cliftonâ€™s PCR on the murder \r\n  conviction, and this Court denied certiorari.  On retrial, Clifton was convicted \r\n  of murder and received a sentence of life imprisonment, and the conviction and \r\n  sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.  Op. No. 98-MO-002 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  January 5, 1998).  Clifton then applied for and was granted PCR again.  The \r\n  State now petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the Circuit Courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of Cliftonâ€™s PCR application.  \r\nThe Court granted certiorari on the following \r\n  issue:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in finding that Cliftonâ€™s trial \r\n  counsel was ineffective in not objecting to the trial judgeâ€™s failure to charge \r\n  voluntary manslaughter? \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe State argues that \r\n  the PCR judge erred in finding that Cliftonâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective \r\n  in failing to object to the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to charge voluntary manslaughter. \r\n  [3]   We agree.\r\nThis Court will sustain the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  fact-finding concerning ineffective legal counsel if there is any probative \r\n  evidence in the record that supports those findings.  Patrick v. State, \r\n  349 S.C. 203, 207, 562 S.E.2d 609, 611 (2002).  In order to prove ineffective \r\n  counsel, the applicant must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient according \r\n  to reasonable professional norms and that the deficient performance prejudiced \r\n  his defense.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, \r\n  80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Legge v. State, 349 S.C. 222, 224, 562 S.E.2d \r\n  618, 619-620 (2002).\r\nâ€œVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful \r\n  killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.â€ \r\n   State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 360, 535 S.E.2d 420, 424 (2000).  Sufficient \r\n  provocation necessary to justify a voluntary manslaughter charge must come \r\n  from the victim and not be transferred from a third-party to the victim.  \r\n  Id. at 362-363, 535 S.E.2d at 425; State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, \r\n  478 S.E.2d 260 (1996).  \r\nClifton testified that when he arrived \r\n  at Dorothyâ€™s house, [4]  he asked \r\n  Linda Jean to go out to dinner with him, and she replied, â€œNo, Iâ€™m not going \r\n  â€¦  Youâ€™re drunk.â€  Clifton testified that a scuffle did not result from Linda \r\n  Jeanâ€™s unwillingness to go out to dinner.  He said that when she freed herself \r\n  from him after refusing to go in his car, she ran in the direction of Harold, \r\n  who was holding a refrigerator grate as if to threaten Clifton.  Clifton testified \r\n  that he then fired three â€œwild shotsâ€ in the direction of Harold to keep Harold \r\n  from advancing with the refrigerator grate, and Linda Jean ran in between the \r\n  two men and was hit by one of the bullets. [5]   \r\nSince Clifton put forth no evidence that \r\n  Linda Jean provoked him, he cannot prove his entitlement to a charge on voluntary \r\n  manslaughter.  Clifton testified that he was provoked by Harold, who was not \r\n  the murder victim. [6]   Therefore, Clifton cannot allege that the trial counselâ€™s \r\n  failure to object to the lack of a voluntary manslaughter charge would have \r\n  prejudiced his defense since he was not provoked by the victim.  Locklair.   \r\n\r\n In our opinion, this PCR review for failure \r\n  to give a voluntary manslaughter charge has been mislabeled.  We believe \r\n  the PCR court intended to grant PCR based on a failure to charge involuntary \r\n  manslaughter, [7]  not voluntary manslaughter.   \r\n\r\n At trial, Cliftonâ€™s \r\n  trial counsel, the solicitor and the trial judge had a lengthy discussion about \r\n  what the judge would charge to the jury.  The parties discussed the possibility \r\n  of charging the jury with murder, self-defense and involuntary manslaughter.  \r\n  The court recessed and returned the following morning and the discussion continued.  \r\n  Cliftonâ€™s attorney said:  â€œJudge, we were talking yesterday about the charge \r\n  and we had a lot of discussions.  I wanted to put on the record that I requested \r\n  an accidental in relating to a self-defense, and involuntary in addition to \r\n  murder and you are only going to charge murder?  Correct?â€  The judge responded, \r\n  â€œIâ€™m charging murder and thatâ€™s all.â€  Cliftonâ€™s attorney failed to object to \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s failure to charge involuntary manslaughter.   \r\nAt the PCR hearing, we believe that the \r\n  court accidentally associated the term â€œvoluntary manslaughterâ€ with the law \r\n  of involuntary manslaughter.  In support of the her argument that involuntary \r\n  manslaughter should not have been charged, State Attorney Barbara Tiffen cited \r\n  cases involving dangerous weapons where involuntary manslaughter was not charged.  \r\n  When the PCR judge made his finding, he said:\r\n\r\nNow, this court is concerned about the failure of trial \r\n  counsel to protect the record and object to the courtâ€™s not charging voluntary \r\n  manslaughter and not charging self-defense.  When Mr. Harris took the stand, \r\n  he put his credibility into evidence.  The jury could have concluded that his \r\n  actions in firing the weapon, although counsel for the State has cited some \r\n  cases that seem to be contrary, under the facts of this case, his actions could \r\n  have been considered so reckless and so much in disregard for the life and safety \r\n  of other persons to have constituted an act of voluntary manslaughter when the \r\n  death of another person was caused.  \r\n\r\nHere, the PCR judge is discussing \r\n  the standard for involuntary manslaughter, but mistakenly called it voluntary \r\n  manslaughter.  Cliftonâ€™s attorney wrote the order, which also only referred \r\n  to voluntary manslaughter.  \r\n          This case is being reviewed \r\n  on the issue of voluntary manslaughter based on the PCR court confusing voluntary \r\n  and involuntary manslaughter.  The quote above illustrates that the PCR judge \r\n  was referring to the law of involuntary manslaughter but calling it â€œvoluntary \r\n  manslaughter.â€  \r\nRegardless, even if the involuntary manslaughter \r\n  issue was presented for review, we do not believe that Cliftonâ€™s counselâ€™s failure \r\n  to object when involuntary manslaughter was not charged was prejudicial to Cliftonâ€™s \r\n  defense.  This Court has stated, â€œ[t]here is no error in the refusal to charge \r\n  the law of involuntary manslaughter when the defendant admitted intentionally \r\n  firing the gun, but claimed only he meant to shoot over the victimâ€™s head.â€  \r\n  State v. Cooney, 320 S.C. 107, 112, 463 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1995); Bozeman \r\n  v. State, 307 S.C. 172, 414 S.E.2d 144 (1992).  Since Clifton admitted that \r\n  he intentionally fired warning shots in the direction of Harold, he was not \r\n  entitled to the involuntary manslaughter charge, and thus could not have been \r\n  prejudiced by the Courtâ€™s failure to charge it.  \r\nConclusion\r\nSince we hold that Cliftonâ€™s defense was not prejudiced by his counselâ€™s \r\n  failure to object to the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to charge voluntary or involuntary \r\n  manslaughter, we REVERSE the PCR courtâ€™s granting of his PCR application.  \r\n\r\n WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result \r\nonly.  MOORE, J., not participating. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  While Cliftonâ€™s willingness to help load the refrigerator supports \r\n    Haroldâ€™s testimony that Clifton and Harold were friendly to each other, both \r\n    Harold and Clifton testified that they had an altercation one-year earlier \r\n    that involved guns.  Harold filed charges against Clifton, but Linda Jean \r\n    convinced him to dismiss them.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Lillie Long died after the first trial and before the second trial, \r\n    so the State put forth her testimony from the original trial.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The PCR judge orally granted Cliftonâ€™s PCR application for counselâ€™s \r\n    failure to request a charge on voluntary manslaughter and self-defense.  The \r\n    written order, prepared by Cliftonâ€™s counsel, failed to specifically address \r\n    the self-defense charge.  Under section 6, which addresses voluntary manslaughter, \r\n    the order states, â€œFurther, the intended object of the warning shots was the \r\n    estranged husband of the victim, there was testimony that he was approaching \r\n    [Clifton] with a deadly weapon at the time of the shooting, and there was \r\n    evidence of prior difficulties between the parties.â€  In our opinion, this \r\n    reference to self-defense does not constitute a specific ruling that self-defense \r\n    should have been charged.  Cliftonâ€™s counsel should have filed a Rule 59(e) \r\n    motion to amend the judgment to include a finding on the lack of a self-defense \r\n    charge.  Since no motion was filed, we believe that the self-defense issue \r\n    was not preserved.  Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 256, 423 S.E.2d \r\n    127, 128 (1992) (This Court held that counsel has an obligation to meticulously \r\n    review the PCR order and file a Rule 59(e) motion if it does not address the \r\n    merits of the issues).      \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Dorothy was Cliftonâ€™s sister. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Harold and Lillie Longâ€™s testimonial account of the â€œscuffleâ€ between \r\n    Clifton and Linda Jean differs with Cliftonâ€™s account.  Harold testified that \r\n    Clifton had an arm-lock on Linda Jean.  Lillie Long testified that Clifton \r\n    and Linda Jean were â€œstruggling.â€  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Although Harold became a victim after Clifton shot Linda Jean, he \r\n    was not the murder victim. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  â€œInvoluntary manslaughter is (1) the unintentional killing of another \r\n    without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending \r\n    to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another \r\n    without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard \r\n    for the safety of others.â€ State v.

Richardson Jr. and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the Office of \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nA Camden \r\n  Lewis, of Lewis, Babcock &amp; Hawkins, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney \r\n  disciplinary matter, the Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct recommended \r\n  that Respondent receive a public reprimand for violating Rule 5.1 of the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR, finding that he had failed \r\n  to ensure that his Deputy Solicitor adhered to these Rules (hereinafter the \r\n  Quattlebaum Matter).  Further, the Panel recommended that Respondent receive \r\n  a letter of caution for permitting a member of his â€œjury selection teamâ€ to \r\n  attempt to contact a member of the jury venire (hereinafter the Juror Matter).\r\nI.  THE QUATTLEBAUM MATTER\r\nOn Memorial Day, May 29, 1995, \r\n  Robert Joseph â€œBJâ€ Quattlebaum (â€œQuattlebaumâ€), a murder suspect, was brought \r\n  to the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department for questioning.  John Earl â€œJackâ€ \r\n  Duncan (â€œDuncanâ€), Quattlebaumâ€™s attorney, arrived at the station shortly thereafter. \r\n  The Sheriffâ€™s Office summoned Deputy Solicitor Frances Humphries (â€œHumphriesâ€) \r\n  to the station that evening for the interview.  \r\nTheir initial interviews with \r\n  Quattlebaum convinced the officers that a polygraph test would flush out some \r\n  inconsistencies in his statements, so they asked Quattlebaum to take a polygraph \r\n  test, and he consented. David Grice (â€œGriceâ€), the polygraph operator for the \r\n  Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department, conducted a two-hour interview of Quattlebaum \r\n  in the polygraph room, a small room equipped with a video surveillance camera.  \r\n  Grice left the room giving Quattlebaum time to â€œstewâ€ over his responses and \r\n  returned to his office, where he monitored and recorded what occurred in the \r\n  polygraph room through a television monitor and a VCR machine.  \r\nDeputy Scott Frier (â€œFrierâ€) was \r\n  in Griceâ€™s office when Grice returned.  Both men looked at the monitor and saw \r\n  that Jack Duncan had entered the polygraph room and began having a conversation \r\n  with his client.  The VCR had ejected the videotape that was inside it, so Grice \r\n  pushed the tape back into the machine and pushed the record button.  Duncan \r\n  and Quattlebaum were unaware that Grice was recording their conversation.  \r\nGrice and Frier then summoned \r\n  Deputy Solicitor Humphries, lead investigator Edward Hite (â€œHiteâ€), and Lieutenant \r\n  â€œBuckyâ€ Phillips to the office to witness the events that were unfolding in \r\n  the polygraph room.  The officers arrived first and saw and heard the privileged \r\n  conversation between Quattlebaum and Duncan.  When Humphries arrived shortly \r\n  thereafter, he saw the monitor, heard the conversation, and the officers told \r\n  him â€œtwo wordsâ€ [1]  to describe \r\n  what the suspect had uttered to his lawyer.  Humphries told the officers to \r\n  turn the monitor off and left the room.  As he departed, Humphries was asked \r\n  if he thought the conversation could be used as evidence against Quattlebaum \r\n  and responded, â€œnot unless the Supreme Court has ruled differently over the \r\n  last twenty-four hours.â€  Grice originally intended to return to the polygraph \r\n  room to continue the polygraph examination, but the plan changed when the officers \r\n  arrested Quattlebaum shortly after Duncan left the polygraph room. \r\nRespondent Donald V. Myers is \r\n  the Solicitor for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit.  He has served with distinction \r\n  for 26 years and has never previously been disciplined for any lawyer misconduct.  \r\n  Around a week later, Humphries reported to his superior, Solicitor Myers, what \r\n  transpired the night of May 29.  Respondent Myers learned that the group overheard \r\n  a confidential conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum and that the suspect \r\n  uttered  â€œtwo wordsâ€ relating to the substance of the conversation, which dramatically \r\n  enhanced the import of the dialogue.  Humphries informed the Respondent that \r\n  he told the officers to turn off the monitor, and Respondent stated that Humphries \r\n  had responded appropriately to the scenario.  As of this meeting, no evidence \r\n  shows that Respondent Myers knew that the conversation was recorded, and there \r\n  is conflicting evidence as to whether Humphries knew that Grice was recording \r\n  the conversation. [2]   Respondent did not instruct Humphries, his Deputy Solicitor, \r\n  that he should inform the defense that he and the officers eavesdropped on a \r\n  privileged conversation of significant substance.  Grice placed the tape in \r\n  the safe in his office.\r\nOn June 2, 1995, Detective Hite \r\n  submitted his eleven-page Investigative Report about the murder for which Quattlebaum \r\n  was charged.  The highly detailed report failed to include an account of the \r\n  eavesdropped confidential conversation, nor did the report disclose that the \r\n  conversation was recorded on videotape.  Respondent Myers testified that the \r\n  report should have included those facts, which is how the defense would have \r\n  discovered that the conversation was overheard.  Humphries reviewed the report \r\n  after Hite finished it and made no comment about the lack of disclosure.  The \r\n  Solicitorâ€™s office made no effort to disclose to the defense the fact that Humphries \r\n  and the officers had heard and taped the confidential eavesdropped conversation.  \r\n  The defense did not discover the fact that the conversation was eavesdropped \r\n  or the existence of the tape for another twenty-seven months, until just three \r\n  months before the scheduled commencement of the Quattlebaum trial.\r\nAs of around March 1996, Humphries \r\n  had discussed the potential existence of a tape recording of the Duncan/Quattlebaum \r\n  conversation with Detective Hite, who would frequently ask Humphries what he \r\n  should do with the tape.   Eventually, Humphries reported a â€œrumorâ€ of the tapeâ€™s \r\n  existence to Respondent Myers.  The two discussed whether the tape was discoverable, \r\n  and Respondent Myers stated that if there was a tape, Humphries should give \r\n  it to the defense. [3]   Despite \r\n  the frequent conversations with Detective Hite and Respondentâ€™s mandate to hand \r\n  it over to the defense, Humphries made no specific request for the tape to the \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department.  \r\nOn June 30, 1997, Quattlebaumâ€™s \r\n  new attorney, Katherine Evatt (â€œEvattâ€), sent Humphries a discovery request \r\n  that included a specific demand for â€œcopies of all videotape or audiotape of \r\n  any interviews with the Defendant.â€  Evatt made the request for audio or video \r\n  recordings merely as a â€œcatchallâ€ request.  She had no reason to believe that \r\n  the videotape existed.  Humphries discussed the discoverability of the tape \r\n  again with Respondent, and was again instructed to hand over the tape to the \r\n  defense.  Humphries then informed Detective Hite to make a copy of the tape.  \r\n  Hite immediately asked Grice to make a copy, and the copy was delivered to Humphries. \r\n  [4]   Humphries delivered the tape to defense counsel Kathy Evatt on August \r\n  8, 1997.\r\nThe Quattlebaum matter eventually \r\n  went to trial in the Eleventh Circuit.  Quattlebaumâ€™s attorneys moved for the \r\n  recusal of Humphries and the Eleventh Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office as prosecutors \r\n  because of the surreptitious intrusion upon the confidential conversation between \r\n  Quattlebaum and Duncan.  The trial judge denied the defenseâ€™s motion, and Quattlebaum \r\n  was ultimately convicted and given a death sentence.  On appeal, the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court overturned Quattlebaumâ€™s convictions and sentence because we found \r\n  that the Eleventh Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office had committed deliberate prosecutorial \r\n  misconduct, which deprived Quattlebaum of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. \r\n  [5]   \r\nPanel Finding\r\nThe Commission on Lawyer Conduct \r\n  dismissed the charge that Respondent violated Rule 5.1(c) of the Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR, finding that he never secreted \r\n  from the defense the existence of the videotape or the fact that Humphries and \r\n  the officers overheard the Quattlebaum-Duncan conversation.  However, the Panel \r\n  held that Respondent violated RPC 5.1(b), Rule 407, SCACR, because as a supervising \r\n  attorney, he should have ensured that Humphries disclosed the tapeâ€™s existence \r\n  or the occurrence of the eavesdropped confidential conversation.  Accordingly, \r\n  the Panel recommended a penalty of public reprimand.  Respondent has taken exception \r\n  to the Panelâ€™s finding that he violated RPC 5.1(b).  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nIn an attorney disciplinary proceeding, \r\n  this Court gives great deference to the recommendation of the Panel of the Commission \r\n  on Lawyer Conduct.  In re Diggs 344 S.C 397, 544 S.E.2d 628 (2001).  \r\n  However, the Court may exercise de novo review of the Panelâ€™s findings of fact \r\n  and conclusions of law.  Id.  Furthermore, the State must prove that \r\n  the attorney violated a rule of Professional Responsibility by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence. Id.   \r\nWe find the Panel correctly held \r\n  that the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated \r\n  RPC 5.1(b), which provides: â€œA lawyer having direct supervisory authority over \r\n  another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer \r\n  conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct.â€  In order to establish that \r\n  Respondent violated RPC 5.1(b), the state must prove that (1) Respondent held \r\n  â€œdirect supervisory authorityâ€ over Humphries; (2) Humphries failed to adhere \r\n  to the Rules of Professional Conduct; and (3) Respondent failed to â€œmake reasonable \r\n  effortsâ€ to ensure that Humphries adhered to the Rules of Professional Conduct.  \r\n  In re Anonymous Member of the South Carolina Bar, 346 S.C. 177, 184-185, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 10 (2001).   \r\nRespondent, as Solicitor, held \r\n  supervisory authority over his Deputy Solicitor, Humphries.  Further, the Panel \r\n  of the Commission of Lawyer Conduct found that Humphries violated the Rules \r\n  of Professional Responsibility. [6]   In assessing whether Respondent made reasonable \r\n  efforts to ensure Humphries was complying with the Rules, this Court must consider \r\n  the Comments to RPC 5.1:\r\n\r\nThe measures required to fulfill \r\n  the responsibility prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) can depend on the firmâ€™s \r\n  structure and the nature of its practice.  In a small firm, informal supervision \r\n  and occasional admonition ordinarily might be sufficient.  In a large firm, \r\n  or in practice situations in which intensely difficult ethical problems frequently \r\n  arise, more elaborate procedures may be necessary. [7] \r\n\r\nWe hold that the Panel correctly \r\n  concluded that the Eleventh Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office is a law office where \r\n  complex ethical questions arise, which necessitate a more elaborate system to \r\n  ensure that the attorneys in the Solicitorâ€™s Office comply with the Rules.  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s supervisory system failed because the defense knew nothing of either \r\n  the eavesdropped conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum or that it had \r\n  been videotaped for over two years. \r\nThe \r\n  Eavesdropped Conversation\r\nRespondent learned of the surreptitious \r\n  intrusion upon the Duncan/Quattlebaum conversation approximately one week after \r\n  it occurred.  At that time, respondent told the Deputy Solicitor that he had \r\n  appropriately directed the officers to turn off the monitor, but Respondent \r\n  did not instruct the Deputy Solicitor to inform the defense of the eavesdropped \r\n  conversation and the â€œtwo wordsâ€ that Quattlebaum uttered.  Respondent failed \r\n  again to order his Deputy Solicitor to communicate the fact of the overheard \r\n  conversation to the defense when Humphries brought up the â€œrumorâ€ of the videotape \r\n  some ten months later in March 1996. [8]   In fact, the only reason why the defense discovered that the \r\n  Duncan/Quattlebaum dialogue was overheard was because on June 30, 1997, defense \r\n  counsel Evatt made a discovery motion, which included a request for any video \r\n  or audiotape of the defendant.  Only then, when Humphries responded to the request \r\n  on August 1, 1997, by stating that the defense would receive â€œ[a] copy of a \r\n  videotape containing statements made by the Defendantâ€ did the defense have \r\n  any notion that Humphries and the Lexington County officers had intruded on \r\n  the Duncan/Quattlebaum attorney-client conversation.\r\nRespondent testified \r\n  that he assumed that Detective Hiteâ€™s Investigative Report would have revealed \r\n  the existence and nature of the eavesdropped conversation.  As discussed, the \r\n  Report contained no account of the incident, and Humphries knew the detail was \r\n  left out because he reviewed the document before he gave it to the defense.  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s supervisory system failed because he assumed that Detective Hite, \r\n  an officer from another government agency (the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Office) \r\n  would inform the defense through an Investigative Report about the eavesdropped \r\n  conversation.  Respondentâ€™s supervisory system also failed because he did not \r\n  ensure that Humphries himself communicated to the defense about the overheard \r\n  dialogue.  Accordingly, Respondent failed in his supervisory capacity to ensure \r\n  the defense promptly learned of the eavesdropped conversation and thus violated \r\n  RPC 5.1(b).  \r\nThe \r\n  Videotape Recording\r\nWhile we find Respondentâ€™s failure \r\n  to ensure that the defense learned of the eavesdropped conversation supports \r\n  a finding that Respondent has violated RPC 5.1(b), we do not believe that his \r\n  handling of the videotape violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.  \r\n  First, no evidence points to Respondent having any knowledge of the tapeâ€™s existence \r\n  until Humphries gave it to the defense on August 8, 1997.  While a lack of knowledge \r\n  is not a complete defense to a violation of Respondentâ€™s duty to supervise, [9]  Respondent sufficiently stated \r\n  his officeâ€™s policy when Humphries brought up the videotape â€œrumorâ€ in March \r\n  1996: â€œIf there is a tape, give it to the defense.â€ (R.p. 510).  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  clear articulation of what to do with the tape constitutes sufficient â€œreasonable \r\n  effortsâ€ by Respondent to ensure that Humphries complied with the Rules.  \r\nIn our opinion, however, \r\n  the Panel incorrectly held that Respondent did not violate RPC 5.1(c).  Rule \r\n  5.1(c) states:  \r\n\r\n(c) A lawyer shall be responsible \r\n  for another lawyerâ€™s violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if:\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific \r\n  conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which \r\n  the other lawyer practices, or has direct supervisory authority over the other \r\n  lawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided \r\n  or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action. [10]       \r\n\r\nRespondent knew that \r\n  Humphries and the officers eavesdropped on the privileged conversation within \r\n  one week after it occurred, while the defense did not know of the intrusion \r\n  into the Quattlebaum-Duncan dialogue until twenty-seven months later.  Respondent \r\n  should have made sure that Humphries informed the defense immediately, or he \r\n  could have called defense counsel himself.  Immediate notification would have \r\n  given Quattlebaum twenty-seven more months to protect his rights \r\n  [11]  and would have avoided the necessity of this Courtâ€™s finding of deliberate \r\n  prosecutorial misconduct and breach of Quatttlebaumâ€™s Sixth Amendment right \r\n  to counsel. [12]   Because Respondent failed to immediately inform the defense \r\n  himself or through Humphries, his Deputy Solicitor, we find that he violated \r\n  RPC 5.1(c).  \r\nFor the violation of \r\n  both RPC 5.1(b) and RPC 5.1(c) in failing to properly supervise Humphries to \r\n  ensure that the fact of the eavesdropping was reported to Quattlebaumâ€™s defense \r\n  counsel, we sanction Respondent with a Private Reprimand.  See In \r\n  re Anonymous, 346 S.C. 177, 552 S.E.2d 10 (2001). \r\nWe hold a solicitor \r\n  in this state to the highest ethical standards, for his actions determine a \r\n  criminalâ€™s fate.  We understand that the pressures of the position, as well \r\n  as imperfect communication procedures with the county sheriffâ€™s office, may \r\n  impede the solicitor in exercising his supervisory authority, but no excuse \r\n  can justify actions which prejudice the defendant in a capital case.  \r\nA solicitor must implement \r\n  and manage a system that enables him to appropriately supervise his deputies \r\n  so that when he discovers that they may be violating a Rule of Professional \r\n  Conduct, he can immediately ameliorate any prejudicial effect that the violation \r\n  may have on the defense.   \r\nRPC \r\n  5.1 (a) and Government Agency\r\nRespondent argues that \r\n  RPC 5.1(a) only applies to a private law firm.  We disagree.  RPC 5.1(a) states: \r\n  â€œA partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm \r\n  has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm \r\n  conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.â€  RPC 5.1(a).  \r\nWe agree with the Comments to \r\n  RPC 5.1, which clearly state that RPC 5.1(a) applies to government agencies, \r\n  as well as law firms. [13]   \r\nII.  THE JUROR MATTER\r\nThe Eleventh Circuit Solicitorâ€™s \r\n  Office tried the death penalty case of Robert â€œBoâ€ Southerland (â€œSoutherlandâ€) \r\n  in March of 1992.  On the night before striking the jury, Respondent assembled \r\n  his â€œjury selection team,â€ as was customary before a murder trial.  The group \r\n  of officers and Respondent met in Respondentâ€™s conference room to review the \r\n  names on the jury venire to determine which jurors the prosecution would strike \r\n  in the next dayâ€™s voir dire.  The group immediately singled out Richard Otto \r\n  Cannon as the first potential juror that Respondent should strike.  Respondent \r\n  was familiar with many Cannons who were criminals in his district and did not \r\n  want him as a juror for a capital case.\r\nThe group also noticed two different \r\n  addresses on Cannonâ€™s Juror Questionnaire with only one phone number.  In order \r\n  to discern if Cannon lived at the address on the Questionnaire, an officer at \r\n  the other end of the table from Respondent picked up the phone, dialed the number, \r\n  announced that he represented law enforcement, and asked whether Richard Otto \r\n  Cannon lived at the specified address.    The person who answered the phone \r\n  stated that Cannon did not live at that address.  \r\nPanel Finding\r\nThe Panel concluded that Respondent \r\n  violated RPC 8.4 of the Rules of ProfessionalConduct (RPC), Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR, when he impliedly permitted a member of his â€œjury selection teamâ€ to \r\n  telephone a potential juror and recommended a letter of caution.  Respondent \r\n  has taken exception to the Panelâ€™s finding of an RPC 8.4 violation.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nRule 3.5(b) of the Rules of \r\n  ProfessionalConduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR, forbids a lawyer from communicating \r\n  ex parte with a member of the jury venire.  RPC 8.4 forbids a lawyer from violating \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct through the acts of another.  RPC 3.5(b) was \r\n  violated when a member of Respondentâ€™s â€œjury selection teamâ€ dialed the number \r\n  of Richard Otto Cannon, a member of the jury venire, while the group was meeting \r\n  in Respondentâ€™s conference room on the eve of jury selection for the Southerland \r\n  murder trial. Although the team member did not call Cannon at Respondentâ€™s direction, \r\n  Respondent failed to stop him from making the call.  Just as this Court â€œlooks \r\n  with disfavor upon officers of the court approaching jurors after a verdict \r\n  has been written,â€ [14] it also \r\n  should not condone pre-trial contact with a member of a jury venire.  Since \r\n  Respondent allowed a member  of the â€œjury\r\nselection teamâ€ to contact Mr. Cannon, he violated RPC 8.4(a). \r\nThis court has issued a public \r\n  reprimand to an attorney who approached jurors after his trial was over but \r\n  while the jurors remained on the venire. \r\n  [15]  But since Respondent did not actively attempt to communicate with \r\n  prospective juror Cannon, and since the state presented no other evidence of \r\n  juror contact by Respondent or any member of his â€œteam,â€ we find a letter of \r\n  caution is appropriate.\r\nIII.  COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS\r\nRule 7(b)(8), of the Rules \r\n  for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR, states that \r\n  an attorney who violates the Rules of Professional Responsibility may be responsible \r\n  for the costs and fees of the disciplinary proceedings.  Further, Rule 27(e)(3) \r\n  of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR, \r\n  states that, â€œ[t]he Supreme Court may assess costs against the respondent if \r\n  it finds the respondent has committed misconduct.â€  The state argues that the \r\n  Panel erred in not addressing the cost issue and asks the Court to assess costs \r\n  upon the parties in its discretion.  We find that Respondent is responsible \r\n  for the costs of these proceedings.     \r\n          \r\n  IV.  CONCLUSION\r\nRespondent failed to adequately \r\n  supervise his Deputy Solicitor Fran Humphries in the wake of the bizarre events \r\n  that took place on May 29, 1995.  Since Respondent did nothing in his supervisory \r\n  capacity to ensure that his office disclosed that a privileged attorney-client \r\n  conversation was overheard, he violated RPC 5.1(b) and RPC 5.1(c) of the Rules \r\n  of Professional Responsibility.\r\nThis Court must now determine \r\n  what sanction is appropriate.  We are aware that any disciplinary sanction we \r\n  impose in this matter will be made public because of the procedural posture \r\n  of this case.  Under our current Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), \r\n  thirty days after the answer has been filed or the time to answer has expired \r\n  in a misconduct case, the record and all subsequent proceedings are made public \r\n  no matter what the ultimate disposition may be.  Rule 12(b), RLDE.  It would, \r\n  therefore, be a simple expedient to agree with the panel and impose a public \r\n  reprimand.  We do not believe that would be fair to Solicitor Myers, because \r\n  it would treat him differently from the way we treated the civil lawyer in In \r\n  re Anonymous.  \r\nIn this case, we have not found \r\n  that Solicitor Myers engaged in any direct misconduct.  He is being disciplined \r\n  because he did not exercise the appropriate supervisory control over his Deputy \r\n  Solicitor, Fran Humphries.  Similarly, in In re Anonymous, we disciplined \r\n  a civil lawyer, partner in a law firm, for his failure to ensure that his subordinate \r\n  lawyers turned over discovery material to opposing counsel in a serious products \r\n  liability case.  There, we imposed a private reprimand.  We found the conduct \r\n  to be a serious breach of the lawyerâ€™s duty to supervise as we do here.  We \r\n  imposed private discipline because it was the first time we as a court had given \r\n  direction in this area.\r\nSouth Carolina has had since 1990 \r\n  a stronger â€œduty to superviseâ€ rule than many states.  This is the first case \r\n  in which we have made it clear that this â€œduty to superviseâ€ also applies to \r\n  public attorneys and to Solicitorâ€™s offices.  The Respondent has had no other \r\n  disciplinary matters in his 31 years of practice.  All these factors influence \r\n  the level of discipline we impose for this violation.\r\nThe vast majority of the misconduct \r\n  relating to the failure to supervise was committed before the Rules of Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement became effective on January 1, 1997.  Under the former \r\n  Rule on Disciplinary Procedure, the appropriate sanction would have been a private \r\n  reprimand, and we find that is the appropriate sanction in this case.  While, \r\n  as discussed above, the private nature of the reprimand cannot be maintained \r\n  under our current procedure, a private reprimand still has significance since \r\n  it is not reported to the American Bar Associationâ€™s National Discipline Data \r\n  Bank and indicates our belief that the misconduct warrants less than a public \r\n  reprimand.  Accordingly, we impose a private reprimand under Paragraph 7A(5) \r\n  of the former Rule on Disciplinary Enforcement. \r\n  [16]   \r\nAdditionally, we also hold that \r\n  Respondent violated RPC 8.4 when he permitted a member of his â€œjury selection \r\n  teamâ€ to attempt to contact a member of the jury venire.  We issue a letter \r\n  of caution for this violation.          \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward \r\n  B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In deference to the fact that Quattlebaum is awaiting \r\n    retrial, â€œtwo wordsâ€ is the way that the record describes the overheard statement \r\n    Quattlebaum made to his attorney.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Grice testified that after Humphries told the officers to turn off \r\n    the tape, Grice asked Humphries what he should do with the tape.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Hite testified that when he would mention the tape to Humphries, \r\n    he never said there was a â€œrumorâ€ of the tape.  He would only ask Humphries \r\n    for instructions as to what to do with the tape.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Hite testified that it might have taken only one day to deliver the \r\n    tape to Humphries after Humphries requested it.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 \r\n    S.E.2d 105 (2000).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] The Panel found that Humphries violated the rules when he: (1) Failed \r\n    to immediately notify Jack Duncan that the police and Humphries had overheard \r\n    his privileged conversation with Quattlebaum; (2) Failed to ensure that the \r\n    Hite Investigative Report disclosed the interception of the Duncan/Quattlebaum \r\n    conversation; (3) Failed to immediately investigate whether a videotape of \r\n    the Duncan/Quattlebaum conversation existed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  Comments to RPC 5.1(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  He did, however, instruct Humphries to turn over \r\n    the tape if it existed.\r\n    \r\n   [9]  In re Anonymous, 346 S.C. 177, 552 S.E.2d \r\n    10.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]  Rule 407, SCACR, Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n    Rule 5.1(c).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [11]  After Humphriesâ€™ first meeting with Respondent, Respondent knew \r\n    of the â€œtwo wordsâ€ that Quattlebaum uttered during his conversation with Duncan.  \r\n    Respondentâ€™s knowledge of this severe intrusion into the attorney-client conversation, \r\n    coupled with his failure to make sure the defense knew about it, is the only \r\n    reason why he should be sanctioned.  Further, a strong presumption exists \r\n    that the officers arrested Quattlebaum shortly after they heard the conversation \r\n    due to what Quattlebaum said to Duncan.  Consequently, the defense had to \r\n    wait over two years to even pursue its constitutional defenses, such as the \r\n    â€œfruit of the poisonous treeâ€ doctrine.  \r\n\r\n \r\n  -0[12] Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d \r\n    105.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [13] â€œParagraphs (a) and (b) refer to lawyers who have supervisory authority \r\n    over the professional work of a firm or legal department of a government \r\n    agency.

Purpose.&nbsp; Because South   Carolina has a long history of maintaining open court proceedings and records,   this Rule is intended to establish guidelines for governing the filing under   seal of settlements and other documents.&nbsp; Article I, &sect; 9, of the South Carolina   Constitution provides that all courts of this state shall be public and this   Rule is intended to ensure that that Constitutional provision is fulfilled.&nbsp;   However, the Court recognizes that as technology advances, court records will be   more readily available and this Rule seeks to balance the right of public access   to court records with the need for parties to protect truly private or   proprietary information from public view and to insure that rules of court are   fairly applied.&nbsp; This Rule does not apply to private settlement agreements and   shall not be interpreted as approving confidentiality provisions in private   settlement agreements where the parties agree to have the matter voluntarily   dismissed under Rule 41(a)(1), SCRCP, without court involvement.&nbsp; The   enforceability of those provisions is governed by general legal principles, not   by this Rule.\r\n(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filing Documents under seal.&nbsp; Should Rule 26(b)(5), SCRCP, be inapplicable, and absent another governing   rule, statute, or order, any party seeking to file documents under seal shall   file and serve a &ldquo;Motion to Seal.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion shall identify, with   specificity, the documents or portions of documents for which sealing is   considered necessary, shall contain a non-confidential description of the   documents, and shall be accompanied by a separately sealed attachment labeled   &ldquo;Confidential Information to be submitted to Court in Connection with the Motion   to Seal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attachment shall contain the documents for the court to review in camera.&nbsp; The motion shall state the reasons why sealing is necessary,   explain why less drastic alternatives to sealing will not afford adequate   protection, and address the following factors:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the need to ensure a fair   trial;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the need for witness   cooperation;\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reliance of the parties   upon expectations of confidentiality; \r\n\t \r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the public or professional   significance of the lawsuit; \r\n\t \r\n  (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the perceived harm to the   parties from disclosure;\r\n  (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why alternatives other than   sealing the documents are not available to protect legitimate private interests   as identified by this Rule; and\r\n  (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why the public interest,   including, but not limited to, the public health and safety, is best served by   sealing the documents.\r\n\r\nThe burden is on the party seeking to seal   documents to satisfy the court that the balance of public and private interests   favors sealing the documents.&nbsp; In family court matters, the judge shall also   consider whether documents: 1) contain material which may expose private   financial matters which could adversely affect the parties; and/or 2) relate to   sensitive custody issues, and shall specifically balance the special interests   of the child or children involved in the family court matter. \r\n \r\nUnless otherwise ordered by the court, the   clerk of court shall treat the motion to seal in a manner similar to all other   motions filed with the court.&nbsp; The motion shall be entered in the Clerk&rsquo;s File   Book and on the Motion Calendar and a hearing on the motion shall be   held.&nbsp; \r\n \r\n(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sealing Settlements.&nbsp; A   proposed settlement agreement submitted for the court&rsquo;s approval shall not be   conditioned upon its being filed under seal.&nbsp; Under no circumstances shall a   court approve sealing a settlement agreement which involves a public body or   institution.&nbsp; \r\n \r\nSimultaneously with the filing of a motion   seeking court approval of a settlement, or after a settlement has been approved,   any party to the litigation may file a motion seeking to have all or part of the   settlement filed under seal.&nbsp; \r\n \r\nIf the agreement is approved, and a motion   to seal has been filed, the procedure set forth in (b) above shall be   followed with the exception that the factors for sealing a settlement set forth   below shall be addressed.\r\nIn determining whether to approve the   filing of the settlement documents, in whole or in part, under seal, the court   shall consider:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; the public or professional   significance of the lawsuit;\r\n  (2)&nbsp; the perceived harm to the   parties from disclosure:\r\n  (3)&nbsp; why alternatives other than   sealing the documents are not available to protect legitimate private interests   as identified by this Rule; and,\r\n  (4)&nbsp; why the public interest,   including, but not limited to, the public health and safety, is best served by   sealing the documents.\r\n\r\nIn family court matters, the judge shall   also consider whether the settlement: 1) contains material which may expose   private financial matters which could adversely affect the parties; and/or 2)   relates to sensitive custody issues, and shall specifically balance the special   interests of the child or children involved in the family court matter. \r\n \r\n(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders Sealing   Documents.&nbsp; All orders sealing documents or all or parts of settlements   shall set forth with specificity the reasons that require they be   sealed.\r\nNote\r\n\r\n  Rule 41.1 was enacted to set forth with   clarity the fact that the courts of this State are presumed to be open and to   set forth with particularity when documents and settlement agreements, submitted   to a court for approval, may be sealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE 43\r\n  CONDUCT OF TRIAL\r\n(a) Form and Admissibility.&nbsp; In all   trials the testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open court, unless   otherwise provided by these rules.&nbsp; All evidence shall be admitted which is   admissible under the statutes or rules of evidence heretofore applied in the   courts of this State.&nbsp; In any case, the statute or rule which favors the   reception of the evidence governs and the evidence shall be presented according   to the most convenient method prescribed in any of the statutes or rules to   which reference is herein made.&nbsp; The competency of a witness to testify shall be   determined in like manner.\r\n(b) Scope of Examination and   Cross-Examination.&nbsp; Deleted \r\n \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; Examination, Leading Questions.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n  (2)&nbsp; Hostile and Adverse   Witnesses.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n\r\n(c) Record of Excluded Evidence.&nbsp; Deleted \r\n \r\n(c)(1) Reservation of Rights   Unnecessary.&nbsp; If an objection has once been made at any stage to the   admission of evidence, it shall not be necessary thereafter to reserve rights   concerning the objectionable evidence.\r\n(d) Affirmation in Lieu of Oath.&nbsp;   Whenever under these rules an oath is required to be taken, a solemn affirmation   may be accepted in lieu thereof.\r\n(e) Evidence on Motions.&nbsp; When a   motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter   on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but may direct that the   matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions.\r\n(f) Interpreters.&nbsp; When a witness   does not speak the English language sufficiently to testify, the court may   appoint an interpreter of its own selection and may fix his reasonable   compensation.&nbsp; The compensation shall be paid out of funds provided by law or by   one or more of the parties as the court may direct, and may be taxed ultimately   as costs, in the discretion of the court.\r\n(g) Statement of Pleadings to   Jury.&nbsp; Counsel for any party may read his pleadings to the jury or make a   statement to the jury of the facts alleged in the pleadings and the theory of   his case; but counsel shall not argue his case during his opening statement.&nbsp;   The pleadings shall not be submitted to the jury for its   deliberations.\r\n(h) Examination of Witness.&nbsp; One   counsel only for each party shall examine or cross-examine a witness.&nbsp; During   examination in open court, the examining counsel shall stand.&nbsp; For the purpose   of this subdivision of this rule, two or more parties who have pleaded jointly   shall be considered one party.\r\n(i) Argument.&nbsp; Counsel shall not   attempt to further argue any matter after he has been heard and the ruling of   the court has been pronounced.&nbsp; No argument shall be made on objections to   admissibility of evidence or conduct of trial unless specifically requested by   the court.&nbsp; No more than two hours shall be taken by each side in final argument   or sum up, without permission of the court.&nbsp; Counsel shall not address or refer   to by name any member of the jury he is addressing, or otherwise personally   appeal to any member thereof.\r\n(j) Right to Open and Close.&nbsp; The   moving party upon a motion shall have the right to open and close argument, and   the plaintiff shall have the right to open and close upon the trial; except that   a party admitting the adverse party's claim in his pleading, and taking upon   himself the burden of proof, shall have the like privilege.&nbsp; The party having   the right to open shall be required to open in full, and in reply may respond in   full but may not introduce any new matter.\r\n(k) Agreements of Counsel.&nbsp; No   agreement between counsel affecting the proceedings in an action shall be   binding unless reduced to the form of a consent order or written stipulation   signed by counsel and entered in the record, or unless made in open court and   noted upon the record.&nbsp; Settlement agreements shall be handled in accordance   with Rule 41.1, SCRCP.\r\n \r\n(l) Subsequent Applications for Order   After Refusal.&nbsp; If any motion be made to any judge and be denied, in whole   or in part, or be granted conditionally, no subsequent motion upon the same   state of facts shall be made to any other judge in that action. \r\n \r\n(m) Expert Testimony.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; Testimony by Experts.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n  (2)&nbsp; Bases of Opinion Testimony by   Experts.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n  (3)&nbsp; Opinion on Ultimate Issue.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n  (4)&nbsp; Disclosure of Facts or Data   Underlying Expert Opinion.&nbsp; Deleted\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n  This Rule 43 substantially preserves   present State practice as to evidence and conduct of trial.&nbsp; The present Federal   Rule differs because of the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975;   however, the practitioner will notice little change in present practice.&nbsp; Rules   43(a) through 43(d) restate present State practice under statutes, rules and   case law.&nbsp; Rule 43(d) preserves Code &sect; 19-1-40.&nbsp; Rule 43(c)(1) preserves new   Circuit Rule 101.&nbsp; Rule 43(f) is new matter but is implied by the court's powers   under Title 14, Chapter 15 of the Code.&nbsp; Rule 43(g) preserves Circuit Rule 85,   except it prohibits submitting the pleadings to the jury for its deliberations,   a needed change to avoid the jury treating pleadings as evidence or having   information therefrom contrary to the judge's charge and   instructions.\r\n\r\nNote to 1986   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  The amendment to Rule 43(b)(2) clarifies   the right of a litigant to call an adverse party, or a witness who may bind an   adverse party, and use leading questions and impeach him if justified by the   facts.&nbsp; The amendments to paragraphs (f) and (h) correct inadvertent omissions   in those paragraphs.\r\n\r\nNote to 1987   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  Rule 43(f) is amended to delete the   reference to the hearing impaired whose interpreters are to be provided by   statute.\r\n\r\nNote to 1990   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  Rule 43(m) Expert Testimony is taken from   Rules 702 to 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.&nbsp; The language in subdivision   (3) is that of Federal Rule of Evidence 704 prior to its amendment in 1984.&nbsp; The   Advisory Committee Notes to the Federal Rules of Evidence provide commentary and   useful guidance on the use of expert testimony under this   Rule.\r\n\r\nNote to 1995   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  This amendment deleted subsections (b),   (c) [but not (c)(1)], and (m).&nbsp; These matters are now governed by the South   Carolina Rules of Evidence.\r\n\r\nNote to 2003   Amendment:\r\n\r\n  This amendment changed the title of the   Rule to be more reflective of its content and added the final sentence to Rule   43(k), Agreements of Counsel to provide that agreements regarding sealing   settlements will be handled according to Rule 41.1,   SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE 232\r\n  AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS\r\n(a) Agreements.&nbsp; No agreement   between the parties or their attorneys, in respect to a proceeding before an   appellate court shall be considered unless it has been reduced to writing and   signed by the parties or their attorneys.&nbsp; After consideration, an appellate   court shall either accept or reject the proposed agreement.&nbsp; Should the parties   seek approval of a settlement agreement, the procedure set forth in Rule 41.1,   SCRCP, shall be followed.\r\n(b) Vacation of Prior Opinions, Orders   or Judgments.&nbsp; As part of their agreement, parties may request vacation of   previously rendered opinions, orders, and judgments.&nbsp; However, an appellate   court retains the authority to deny any request for vacation.&nbsp; If an agreement   which includes a request for vacation is rejected, the parties are free, if they   so choose, to resubmit their agreement absent the request for   vacation.\r\nNote to 2003 Amendment\r\n\r\n  This amendment added the final sentence to   section (a) to provide&nbsp; that agreements regarding sealing settlements will be   handled according to Rule 41.1, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 3(b), SCRCP","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-05-05-02","description":"The Supreme Court has amended Rule 3(b), SCRCP.

Under its license \r\n  from the Federal Power Commission (â€œFPCâ€), Santee Cooper was required to maintain \r\n  ownership of all land located within its project boundaries.  As demand for \r\n  recreational property increased, Santee Cooper began developing residential \r\n  subdivisions on project land around the lake, making lots available for long-term \r\n  lease to individuals.\r\nIn 1962, Santee Cooperâ€™s \r\n  Board of Directors adopted a resolution that it would not sell any land in the \r\n  leasing program.  Some time later, Santee Cooper published a Land Policies and \r\n  Procedures booklet in which it declared its policy on land sales.  The booklet \r\n  stated, â€œSantee Cooper does not, as a general rule, sell any property.  The \r\n  sale of property is only considered in cases where the property is declared \r\n  surplus and such sale has no adverse affect on Santee Cooper, the community, \r\n  or the public.â€\r\nIn 1979, the Federal \r\n  Energy Regulatory Commission (â€œFERCâ€), the successor to the FPC, redefined Santee \r\n  Cooperâ€™s project boundaries, removing most of the leased lots from the project \r\n  boundaries as surplus. [2]   Santee Cooper continued to lease lots after \r\n  1979, and by 1994, Santee Cooper was administering 2,931 fixed-term residential \r\n  leases.  The rents on these leases ranged from $75 to $300 annually and ran \r\n  for terms of 40 to 50 years.  Although the leases ran for lengthy fixed terms, \r\n  either party could terminate the lease, with or without cause, by giving 90 \r\n  days notice.\r\nMany lessees made improvements \r\n  on their leased lots, and the leases specifically addressed improvements to \r\n  the property.  The leases generally stated, â€œ[u]pon any termination of this \r\n  lease other than by the Lessor under the [90 day notice provision], any buildings \r\n  and improvements remaining upon the property shall become the property of the \r\n  Lessor.â€  The lease agreements continued to operate on this basis into the 1990â€™s.  \r\n\r\nIn March 1993, Santee Cooper \r\n  sent a letter to the lessees notifying them that it was considering selling \r\n  the leased lots to the lessees.  In July of 1994, Santee Cooper sent a survey \r\n  to the lessees to gauge their interest in buying their lots.  In both letters, \r\n  Santee Cooper stated that any decision to place leased property for sale would \r\n  not have any affect on current lease contracts, and that leases would not be \r\n  revoked if Santee Cooper decided to offer the lots for sale to the lessees.  \r\n  According to Santee Cooper officials, the overwhelming majority of lessees (78%) \r\n  indicated that they would be interested in buying the lots they were leasing.  \r\n\r\nIn January of 1995, Santee Cooperâ€™s \r\n  Board authorized the initiation of a sales program, giving leaseholders an opportunity \r\n  to buy their lots. [3]   The Resolution \r\n  established that Santee Cooper would hire qualified appraisal firms to establish \r\n  â€œfair market valueâ€ for the lots, and would give a leasehold value credit of \r\n  15% if the lot were purchased within two years from the initial offering and \r\n  a value credit of 10% if purchased within three to five years of the initial \r\n  offering.  Additionally, the Resolution offered those lessees who chose not \r\n  to purchase their lots an option to renew for 10 years after the expiration \r\n  of their leases if their lease did not so provide.  \r\nSantee Cooper notified its lessees \r\n  of its intention to initiate this sales program and of the terms of sale encompassed \r\n  in the Resolution.  The letter estimated that surveys and appraisals of all \r\n  the lots would be completed and the lots available for sale within 12 to 18 \r\n  months.  In closing, the letter assured the lessees that they were under â€œabsolutely \r\n  no obligation to purchase the lot and that [they] may continue with their lease \r\n  agreement[s] through their expiration and any extensions as outlined [in the \r\n  letter].â€\r\nSantee Cooper appraised \r\n  the lots to determine their fee simple value in an unimproved condition.  \r\n  Each lot was appraised at least two times and the offered price was the average \r\n  of the two appraisals, less the discounts for early purchase outlined in the \r\n  letter to the lessees.  After all lots were surveyed and appraised, Santee Cooper \r\n  held public meetings to outline the appraisals and the discounts available.  \r\n  Santee Cooper also explained that upon purchase, Santee Cooper and the leaseholder \r\n  would sign a mutual cancellation of the lease, after which the purchaser would \r\n  receive fee simple title to the property. \r\nIn response to Santee \r\n  Cooperâ€™s program, many lessees organized to complain about the appraisal methods \r\n  employed by Santee Cooperâ€™s appraisers.  They formed the Santee Cooper Owners \r\n  and Leaseholders Association (â€œSCOLAâ€) and held meetings to discuss their dissatisfaction \r\n  regarding the appraisal methods.  Whether they were satisfied or dissatisfied \r\n  with the offered price, many lessees purchased their lots, including most of \r\n  the named plaintiffs in this suit.  \r\nAppellants filed their complaint \r\n  in January of 1998. [4]   Appellants \r\n  moved for class certification in July 1998, and their motion was denied in February \r\n  1999.  Appellants filed a motion to alter or amend the order denying class certification.  \r\n  Several months later, three more leaseholders (â€œIntervenor Appellantsâ€) filed \r\n  a motion to intervene.  The judge granted the motion to intervene and then denied \r\n  the motion to alter the order denying class certification.  In April 1999, Santee \r\n  Cooper filed a motion for summary judgment on all causes of action.  Appellants \r\n  filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In May 2001, the circuit court \r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of Santee Cooper.  \r\nAppellants raise the following \r\n  issues on appeal: [5] \r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in finding that no genuine issues of material fact exist \r\n  to support the essential elements of Appellantsâ€™ causes of action for breach \r\n  of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in failing to terminate Intervenor Appellantsâ€™ permissive \r\n  intervention? \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Appellantsâ€™ motion for class certification?\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in finding that Appellantsâ€™ claim for negligent misrepresentation \r\n  is barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nI. Genuine Issue of Material Fact\r\nAppellants argue that \r\n  the trial court erred in finding no genuine issues of material fact exist to \r\n  support their causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  and unjust enrichment. We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is \r\n  appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving \r\n  party must prevail as a matter of law.  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  To determine if \r\n  any genuine issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Summer \r\n  v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).  Upon review of the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard \r\n  applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  George v. Fabri, \r\n  345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBreach of Contract  \r\nAppellants argue that \r\n  the Santee Cooper Boardâ€™s 1995 Resolution along with the letter sent by Santee \r\n  Cooper to its leaseholders notifying them of the decision to sell the leased \r\n  lots, constituted a unilateral modification of their contract (lease agreement) \r\n  with Santee Cooper.  We disagree.\r\nAt the summary judgment \r\n  hearing, Appellants asserted that the Boardâ€™s Resolution and letter to the leaseholders \r\n  unilaterally modified their contracts, but the trial court appears to \r\n  have applied the analysis for bilateral modification, not unilateral modification.  \r\n  On appeal, Appellants insist that the Resolution and letter constitute a unilateral \r\n  modification, comparable to an employerâ€™s unilateral modification of its employeeâ€™s \r\n  contract of employment.  Appellants claim that Santee Cooper unilaterally modified \r\n  the provisions of the lease agreements by (1) giving ten year extensions to \r\n  those lessees who did not have that option written into their leases, (2) removing \r\n  Santee Cooperâ€™s 90 day cancellation authority, and (3) giving each leaseholder \r\n  the option to purchase the property at fair market value.  Appellants then contend \r\n  that Santee Cooper breached the modified lease agreements by failing to offer \r\n  to sell the lots at fair market value.  In order to represent fair market value, \r\n  Appellants insist that the appraisals should have included the value of the \r\n  leasehold interests.\r\nAppellants cited this \r\n  Courtâ€™s decision in Fleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d \r\n  589 (1994), in support of their unilateral modification argument.    In Fleming, \r\n  this Court considered whether an employer could unilaterally modify a \r\n  unilateral contract created by the employee handbook.  Id.  Ultimately, \r\n  the Court held that employers could unilaterally modify such contracts by amending \r\n  the employee handbook as long as the employee had actual notice of the change.  \r\n  Id.  The Court noted, however, that â€œthe promisor does not enjoy the \r\n  unfettered right to modify or terminate a unilateral contract prior to completion.â€  \r\n  Id. at 461, 450 S.E.2d at 594.  Essentially, the Court made a policy \r\n  exception from this general rule in the employer/employee context to allow employers \r\n  â€œa mechanism . . . to alter the employee handbook to meet the changing needs \r\n  of [both parties].â€  Id. at 462, 450 S.E.2d at 595.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ reliance on Flemingâ€™s \r\n  analysis is flawed.  The original lease agreements between the Appellants \r\n  and Santee Cooper are bilateral contracts, not unilateral contracts.  A unilateral \r\n  contract occurs when there is only one promisor and the other party accepts, \r\n  not by mutual promise, but by actual performance.  See International Shoe \r\n  Co. v. Herndon, 135 S.C. 138, 133 S.E. 202 (1926).  A bilateral contract, \r\n  on the other hand, exists when both parties exchange mutual promises.  Id.  \r\n  Here, the lease agreements are clearly bilateral: Santee Cooper promised \r\n  to lease specified property to the Appellants and, in return, the Appellants \r\n  promised to pay a certain amount of rent per year.\r\nWe cannot find anything in Fleming \r\n  or elsewhere that allows a party to alter the terms of a bilateral contract \r\n  by unilateral modification.  It is well established that â€œ[a] written contract \r\n  may be modified by a subsequent agreement of the parties, provided the subsequent \r\n  agreement contains all the requisites of a valid contract.â€  Florence City-County \r\n  Airport Commâ€™n v. Air Terminal Parking Co., 283 S.C. 337, 341, 322 S.E.2d \r\n  471, 473 (Ct. App. 1984).  The necessary elements of a contract are an offer, \r\n  acceptance, and valuable consideration.  A valid offer â€œidentifies the bargained \r\n  for exchange and creates a power of acceptance in the offeree.â€  Carolina \r\n  Amusement Co. v. Connecticut Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 215, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  122 (Ct. App. 1993).  \r\nThe Boardâ€™s Resolution and letter \r\n  to the leaseholders did not identify the bargained for exchange (the sale price) \r\n  or make acceptance an option.  The letter simply explained that all lots would \r\n  be resurveyed and appraised over the next 12 to 18 months.  Notification that \r\n  the Board had authorized Santee Cooper to sell the lots, and that Santee Cooper \r\n  would begin the process of survey and appraisal for future sale, does not constitute \r\n  an offer.  As such, the Appellantsâ€™ claim fails.\r\nFurthermore, as a practical matter, \r\n  the Boardâ€™s Resolution and letter to the leaseholders do not modify the terms \r\n  of the Appellantsâ€™ lease agreements.  Both the Resolution and the letter state \r\n  explicitly that the terms of the existing lease agreements will be honored.  \r\n  All of the Appellants had the option to continue leasing until the leases expire \r\n  at which point Santee Cooper agreed to renew the leases for an additional 10 \r\n  years.  Although the leaseholders may have expected that they would be able \r\n  to renew and extend their leases into perpetuity, their lease agreements did \r\n  not so provide.  All of the lease agreements were made for definite terms, and \r\n  each allowed for cancellation with 90 days notice, by either party, with or \r\n  without cause.  Therefore, we hold there is no genuine issue of material fact \r\n  to support Appellants breach of contract claim.\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Negligent Misrepresentation  \r\nAppellants contend that Santee \r\n  Cooper made two separate negligent misrepresentations to them: (1) that Santee \r\n  Cooper negligently misrepresented that the appraisals would establish fair market \r\n  value for the lots, and (2) that Santee Cooper negligently misrepresented the \r\n  truth when it told leaseholders prior to the Boardâ€™s Resolution that it would \r\n  not sell the lots.  Appellantsâ€™ brief fails to analyze the elements of this \r\n  cause of action or apprise the Court of how the facts of their case satisfy \r\n  the elements of negligent misrepresentation.  They simply assert that the representations \r\n  by Santee Cooper are â€œnegligent misrepresentationsâ€ and argue that the trial \r\n  court erred in finding there was no genuine issue of material fact to support \r\n  their cause of action.  We disagree.\r\nTo establish liability for negligent \r\n  misrepresentation, the plaintiff must show â€œ(1) the defendant made a false representation \r\n  to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the representation; \r\n  (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information \r\n  to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise \r\n  due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) \r\n  the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance \r\n  upon the representation.â€  AMA Management Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. \r\n  213, 420 S.E.2d 868 (Ct. App. 1992).  â€œEvidence of a mere broken promise is \r\n  not sufficient to prove negligent misrepresentation.â€  Winburn v. Insurance \r\n  Co. of North America, 287 S.C. 435, 443, 339 S.E.2d 142, 147 (Ct. App. 1985).  \r\n\r\nAppellants have not satisfied \r\n  the elements of negligent misrepresentation.  First, Santee Cooperâ€™s statement \r\n  that it would â€œengage qualified appraisal firms to establish fair market value \r\n  for each lotâ€ has not been proven false.  Appellants do not dispute that Santee \r\n  Cooper engaged qualified appraisal firms, they simply disagree with the appraisal \r\n  methodology employed by those firms.  Santee Cooperâ€™s appraisers did not consider \r\n  the value of the leasehold interests in their calculation of fair market value \r\n  because Santee Cooper told them that the lots would be offered for sale only \r\n  to the leaseholders.  Santee Cooper and its experts contend it did establish \r\n  fair market value for the lots and that the value of Appellantsâ€™ leasehold interests \r\n  were properly excluded from the appraisals based on the following rationale: [6]   \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Santee Cooper offered the lessees a choice; they could continue to lease or \r\n  cancel their leases and purchase their lots.  In other words, they were free \r\n  to accept or reject the offer.\r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The leases contained cancellation clauses that allowed the lessee and the lessor \r\n  to cancel the leases on 90 days notice.  Therefore, the leases were never true \r\n  long-term leases. \r\n(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The tenant was offered an opportunity to purchase the land in fee and cancel \r\n  the lease; it was not required to do so. \r\n\r\nAppellantsâ€™ expert, Robert Jaeger, \r\n  also submitted an affidavit.  He asserts the proper methodology is the â€œdiscounted \r\n  cash flow analysis.â€  Although only a small portion of Mr. Jaegerâ€™s deposition \r\n  was included in the record, it appears that Mr. Jaegerâ€™s opinion depends on \r\n  the lease continuing to the end of its term.  Mr. Jaeger was asked, â€œDoes all \r\n  of Paragraph 6 assume that the lease continues in place and runs to its term?â€  \r\n  Mr. Jaeger answered, â€œIt does.â€  Santee Cooper argues that Mr. Jaeger conceded \r\n  that his opinion depended on the lease not running to term.  Appellants have \r\n  done nothing to contradict Santee Cooperâ€™s assertion that Mr. Jaeger conceded \r\n  this point.  Similarly, Appellants have not disputed the fact that none of the \r\n  purchased leases would continue to term because the parties executed a mutual \r\n  cancellation of the lease upon purchase.  \r\nRegardless, Santee \r\n  Cooperâ€™s statement that it would establish fair market value for the lots is \r\n  a statement about the future.  The appraisals had not been conducted at the \r\n  time it made the statement.  As such, it is not actionable as a misrepresentation.  \r\n  To be actionable, â€œthe representation must relate to a present or pre-existing \r\n  fact and be false when made.â€ Koontz v. Thomas, 333 S.C. 702, 713, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d 407, 413 (Ct. App. 1999).  Representations based on statements as to \r\n  future events or unfulfilled promises are not usually actionable.  Id.\r\nThis rule applies with \r\n  equal force to bar Appellantsâ€™ claim that statements made by Santee Cooper to \r\n  the leaseholders that it would not or could not sell the leased lots were false \r\n  prior to 1995.  Santee Cooper was not authorized to sell the land by its Board \r\n  until the 1995 Resolution.  Accordingly, the statements were true when made.  \r\n  Therefore, we hold there is no genuine issue of material fact to support Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  negligent misrepresentation cause of action. \r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unjust Enrichment\r\nAppellants argue that the \r\n  trial court erred in holding no material issue of genuine fact exists to establish \r\n  the essential elements of the cause of action for unjust enrichment.  We disagree.\r\nRestitution is a remedy \r\n  designed to prevent unjust enrichment.  Stanley Smith &amp; Sons v. Limestone \r\n  College, 238 S.C. 430, 434, 322 S.E.2d 474, 478 (Ct. App. 1984).  To recover \r\n  on a theory of restitution, the plaintiff must show (1) that he conferred a \r\n  non-gratuitous benefit on the defendant; (2) that the defendant realized some \r\n  value from the benefit; and (3) that it would be inequitable for the defendant \r\n  to retain the benefit without paying the plaintiff for its value.  Niggel \r\n  Assoc., Inc. v. Poloâ€™s of North Myrtle Beach, Inc., 296 S.C. 530, 374 S.E.2d \r\n  507 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nIn Player v. Chandler, \r\n  299 S.C. 101, 382 S.E.2d 891 (1989), this Court found that the record \r\n  failed to establish a cause of action for unjust enrichment.  In Player, \r\n  the plaintiffs leased property from the defendant, and built a restaurant on \r\n  the property.  Id.  The lease contemplated improvements to the premises \r\n  and established that plaintiffs could enjoy the use of the improvements during \r\n  the term of the lease.  Id.  The dispute between the parties arose after \r\n  plaintiffs offered to purchase the property, and defendant declined to sell, \r\n  but said that he might be willing to extend the lease term.  Id.  The \r\n  day after this conversation, plaintiffs began construction of a second restaurant \r\n  on the property.  Three weeks later, defendant told plaintiffs he would not \r\n  extend the term of the lease unless additional terms and conditions were met.  \r\n  Id.  The plaintiffs claimed that defendant was unjustly enriched by refusing \r\n  to extend the lease.  This Court disagreed, and found the plaintiffs would be \r\n  able to enjoy their improvements for the term of the existing lease and that \r\n  any retention of benefit by the defendant was a result of the initial terms \r\n  of the lease.  Id.  \r\nIn our opinion, the facts \r\n  here are similar to those in Player.  Appellantsâ€™ lease agreements provided \r\n  that all improvements to the leased property would become the property of Santee \r\n  Cooper upon termination of the lease (other than upon termination by Santee \r\n  Cooper).  The leases in this case were for very long terms, and Appellants were \r\n  able to enjoy the improvements they made for many years.  Therefore, we find \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact to support Appellantsâ€™ claim for unjust enrichment.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIntervention \r\n   \r\nAppellants contend that \r\n  the trial court erred in denying Intervenor Appellantsâ€™ motion to terminate \r\n  intervention.  We disagree.\r\nRule 24, SCRCP, provides \r\n  for intervention of right and permissive intervention.  Without citing any authority, \r\n  Intervenor Appellants claim that because they intervened permissively under \r\n  Rule 24(b), not as of right, they should be allowed to terminate their intervention \r\n  whenever they choose.  Rule 24(b) does not provide for any method of termination \r\n  of intervention.\r\nAfter Judge Smoak denied \r\n  class certification, but while a motion to alter or amend that judgment was \r\n  pending, Intervenor Appellants moved for permissive intervention.  Judge Smoak \r\n  granted their motion to intervene on June 8, 2000.  A few days later, Judge \r\n  Smoak denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to alter or amend his order denying class certification.  \r\n  Intervenor Appellants then sought to terminate their intervention as a â€œresult \r\n  of denial of Plaintiffsâ€™ Motion for Reconsideration of the Class in the present \r\n  case.â€  \r\nJudge Buckner denied the \r\n  motion to terminate intervention finding that to do so would substantially alter \r\n  or affect Judge Smoakâ€™s prior orders.  See Dinkins v. Robbins, 203 S.C \r\n  199, 26 S.E.2d 689 (1943).  According to Dinkins, â€œthe prior order of \r\n  one Circuit Judge may not be modified by the subsequent order of another Circuit \r\n  Judge, except in cases where the right to do so has been reserved to the succeeding \r\n  Judge, when it is allowed by rule or statute, or when the subsequent order does \r\n  not substantially affect the ruling or decision represented by the previous \r\n  order.â€  203 S.C. at 202, 26 S.E.2d at 690.\r\nRespondent argues that terminating \r\n  intervention would have had a substantial affect on Judge Smoakâ€™s prior order \r\n  granting intervention.  We agree.  When Intervenor Appellants moved to intervene \r\n  in this action, they consented to the jurisdiction of the Orangeburg County \r\n  Court of Common Pleas and agreed to be bound by the rulings and judgment of \r\n  such court.  See 67A C.J.S. Parties Â§ 86, at 843 (1978).  By granting \r\n  the motion, Judge Smoak made the decision that the rights of Intervenor Appellants \r\n  would be adjudicated in this action.  Judge Smoak grant of intervention and \r\n  then denial of class certification indicate his intention for the ultimate judgment \r\n  in this case to bind the Intervenor Appellants and preclude the relitigation \r\n  of their claims in another forum.\r\nThe granting of intervention \r\n  is wholly discretionary with the trial court and will be reversed only for abuse \r\n  of discretion.  See South Carolina Tax Commn. v. Union City Treasurer, 295 \r\n  S.C. 257, 368 S.E.2d 72 (Ct. App. 1988).  We hold it was within Judge Bucknerâ€™s \r\n  discretion to deny Intervenor Appellantsâ€™ motion to terminate intervention.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nClass Certification \r\n   \r\nBecause we find there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact to support the Appellantsâ€™ causes of action, \r\n  we decline to address this issue.  \r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTort Claims Act \r\n   \r\nBecause we find there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact regarding Appellantsâ€™ negligent misrepresentation \r\n  claim, we find it is unnecessary to address this issue.  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we AFFIRM the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Santee \r\n  Cooper and the trial courtâ€™s denial of Intervenor Appellantsâ€™ motion to terminate \r\n  intervention.  We find it unnecessary to address the class certification and \r\n  Tort Claims Act issues.  \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann.

Thomas, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25649\r\nHeard April 1, 2003 - Filed May 12, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of the South Carolina Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant \r\n  Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and J. Gregory Hembree, \r\n  of Conway, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:  \r\n   Appellant was convicted of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to death.  \r\n  Appellant argues the trial judge erred by denying his motion for a new trial \r\n  on the basis that law enforcementâ€™s contact with jurorsâ€™ family members compromised \r\n  his right to a fair and impartial jury.  We agree.  \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was \r\n  indicted for the murder and armed robbery of Horry County Police Officer Dennis \r\n  Lyden.  Jury selection began on Monday, June 18, 2001.  The next day, members \r\n  of the jury pool were examined for the purpose of â€œdeath penalty qualification.â€  \r\n  On Wednesday, June 20, the parties agreed to select the jury from thirty-nine \r\n  death penalty qualified jurors.  Selection of the jury began on the morning \r\n  of Thursday, June 21.  The guilt phase of trial began the same day.  The sentencing \r\n  phase began on Sunday, June 24; the jury returned with its recommended sentence \r\n  on Monday, June 25.\r\nThe following \r\n  day, defense counsel learned improper contact may have been made with a member \r\n  of the jury pool.  After further investigation, appellant filed a motion for \r\n  a new trial alleging members of the prosecution and/or their agents contacted \r\n  jurorsâ€™ relatives after the jurors were death penalty qualified.  Appellant \r\n  attached two affidavits to his motion; they are summarized below:  \r\n\r\nAffiant 1:   Detective \r\n  George Merritt of the Horry County Police Department  telephoned her place of \r\n  employment on June 20, 2001.  He informed her he was conducting a background \r\n  check on potential Juror AA.  Affiant 1 stated she told Detective Merritt that \r\n  Juror AA was her daughter.  In addition to other questions, the detective asked \r\n  Affiant 1 if she thought Juror AA could vote for the death penalty and Affiant \r\n  1 responded affirmatively.  Detective Merritt told Affiant 1 their conversation \r\n  could remain between the two of them and she did not have to tell Juror AA he \r\n  had called.  When Juror AA arrived for work, Affiant 1 told her the police had \r\n  telephoned.   \r\nAffiant 2:  On June 21, \r\n  2001, a police detective contacted her by telephone at her place of employment. \r\n  The detective stated he was calling with questions regarding her husbandâ€™s jury \r\n  duty.  The detective stated â€œthey were trying to get a death penalty convictionâ€ \r\n  and inquired if her husband â€œcould sign the paper for death.â€  She told the \r\n  detective she and her husband believed in the death penalty.  The detective \r\n  instructed Affiant 2 not to tell her husband about the telephone call until \r\n  his jury service was completed. [1] \r\n             \r\n\r\nThe State filed \r\n  a response admitting it conducted investigations on the death penalty qualified \r\n  jurors, but claiming the contact with jurorsâ€™ family members was unintentional \r\n  and did not prejudice appellant.  The response stated the Solicitorâ€™s Office \r\n  specifically requested Horry County Police Department Detectives George Merritt \r\n  and Jamie Debari be assigned to conduct the inquiries because they had conducted \r\n  investigations in two prior capital cases.  The Solicitorâ€™s Office instructed \r\n  detectives to use the following protocol in conducting background investigations \r\n  of prospective jurors:\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An investigator may not call on the juror \r\n  or any member of the household or any immediate family member of any death qualified \r\n  juror, but may call on employers, neighbors, fellow church members, associates \r\n  and/or acquaintances of the juror. \r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigator must identify himself and \r\n  state the purpose of his inquiry from the outset of the communication.\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigator must instruct the party \r\n  to whom the inquiry is addressed that the fact that an inquiry has been made \r\n  or information communicated though the inquiry must not be communicated to a \r\n  death penalty qualified juror until after the trial of the Defendant is completed, \r\n  or in the case of a juror who is not selected as a member of the petit jury, \r\n  after jury selection is completed. \r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigator must end the inquiry immediately \r\n  if the party to whom the inquiry is addressed indicates an unwillingness to \r\n  speak with the investigator. \r\n\r\nThe State asserted \r\n  it was not aware of any irregularities in the investigation until July 11, 2001, \r\n  when the Solicitorâ€™s Office met with the Horry County Police Department detectives \r\n  to discuss appellantâ€™s new trial motion.  At that time, the Solicitorâ€™s Office \r\n  learned a Horry County Police Department detective directly contacted family \r\n  members of at least three death qualified jurors.  The Stateâ€™s reply asserted \r\n  the Solicitorâ€™s Office was unaware this detective had been appointed by the \r\n  Horry County Police Department to conduct jury investigation. \r\n The trial judge granted the Stateâ€™s \r\n  motion for an evidentiary hearing.  Prior to the hearing, the State and appellant \r\n  agreed the trial judge would individually voir dire the twelve jurors and two \r\n  alternates who sat on appellantâ€™s jury and ask a limited number of questions \r\n  submitted by the parties.  Summations of the jurorsâ€™ testimony follows:\r\n\r\nJuror N:  Between death \r\n  penalty qualification and being seated as a juror, she discovered Horry County \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department detectives had questioned her neighbors.  Initially, Juror \r\n  N thought the questioning was related to her upcoming marital separation hearing.  \r\n  When she overheard two jurors discussing contact, she realized the detectiveâ€™s \r\n  inquiries were about the trial.  \r\nJuror K:  After she was \r\n  death penalty qualified, she saw an undercover officer question her neighbor.  \r\n  Although the neighbor declined to speak with Juror K about the conversation, \r\n  Juror K assumed it was about the trial.  Another death penalty qualified juror \r\n  told Juror K a detective had questioned her neighbors, too.  \r\nJuror J:  After trial, \r\n  she learned detectives had gone to her husbandâ€™s employment, but her husband \r\n  was not present.  \r\nJuror H:  After he was \r\n  seated on the jury, he learned from Juror N that someone had spoken with her \r\n  neighbors.  \r\nJuror F:  After he was \r\n  seated on the jury, another juror mentioned a detective had contacted her family \r\n  member. \r\nJuror E:  While she was \r\n  sequestered, Juror Eâ€™s mother told her someone had contacted Juror Eâ€™s father \r\n  asking questions about Juror E.  Juror E assumed it was about the trial.  Juror \r\n  E testified Juror K told her someone had gone to her neighborâ€™s house and talked \r\n  to them.  \r\nJuror B:  He was aware \r\n  during trial that a detective had contacted his employer and spoken with some \r\n  of his coworkers; he assumed it was about the trial.  Juror B stated he overheard \r\n  other jurors discussing the fact that their neighbors or employers had been \r\n  contacted.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, \r\n  appellant submitted sworn statements from nine  death penalty qualified jurors.  \r\n  In seven of these statements, qualified jurors stated their relatives had been \r\n  questioned by either detectives or unknown individuals.  One juror stated an \r\n  unknown person questioned his great aunt, mother, and thirteen year old daughter.  \r\n  Some jurors stated concern about the investigation, one expressly noting he \r\n  felt as if the questioning amounted to jury tampering.  \r\nConcluding \r\n  appellantâ€™s right to an impartial jury as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment \r\n  was not violated, the trial judge denied appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial.    \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err by denying \r\n  appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial based on the assertion that contact between \r\n  law enforcement and jurorsâ€™ family members compromised the impartiality of the \r\n  jury in contravention of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution?  \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Sixth and \r\n  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution guarantee a defendant \r\n  a fair trial by a panel of impartial and indifferent jurors.  Estelle v. \r\n  Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); Irvin v. \r\n  Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961); see also \r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§Â§ 3 &amp; 14.  â€œ[I]n order to fully safeguard this protection, \r\n  it is required that the jury render its verdict free from outside influences \r\n  of whatever kind and nature.â€  State v. Cameron, 311 S.C. 204, 207, 428 \r\n  S.E.2d 10, 12 (Ct.App.1993).  In cases where a jurorâ€™s partiality is questioned \r\n  after trial, it is appropriate to conduct a hearing in which the defendant has \r\n  the opportunity to prove actual juror bias.  Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. \r\n  209, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982); Remmer v. United States, 347 \r\n  U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed.2d 654 (1954). \r\n  [2] \r\nAfter thorough \r\n  consideration of the trial record, the new trial hearing, and the applicable \r\n  law, we conclude appellantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a panel of impartial and \r\n  indifferent jurors was compromised by the Stateâ€™s action.  While we do not as \r\n  a rule disapprove of juror background investigations, \r\n  [3]  we can not condone the activity which admittedly occurred in this case. \r\n  [4]   \r\nHere, appellant was indicted on \r\n  a charge of capital murder for the death of a Horry County Police officer.  \r\n  After the State and appellant individually questioned each juror as to his or \r\n  her view on the death penalty and the trial judge determined that thirty-nine \r\n  jurors could fairly and impartially carry out their duties if seated on the \r\n  jury (i.e., impose a sentence of either life imprisonment or death based upon \r\n  the circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of appellant), \r\n  [5]  detectives from the Horry County Police Department contacted relatives \r\n  of the qualified jurors.  In at least two instances, the detectives asked family \r\n  members whether their relative could impose the death penalty.  In one instance, \r\n  the detective informed a jurorâ€™s wife the police wanted the death penalty.  \r\n  During the trial, the jurors were aware police investigators had contacted their \r\n  family members.  \r\n We find the questioning of jurorsâ€™ \r\n  family members by Horry County Police detectives in a case in which the victim \r\n  was a Horry County Police Department Officer was, at minimum, an attempt to \r\n  influence the jury.  See In the Matter of Two Anonymous Members of \r\n  the South Carolina Bar 278 S.C. 477, 298 S.E.2d 450 (1982) (explaining purpose \r\n  of former rule DR 7-108(F) prohibiting contact between lawyer and prospective \r\n  jurorâ€™s family was to eliminate ability of family member to exert influence).  \r\n  Under the circumstances, the questioning could have been perceived as an attempt \r\n  to intimidate jurors.  Given the nature of the case, the timing of the inquiries, \r\n  and the questions which were asked, we conclude the jury investigation produced \r\n  a jury which was not fair and impartial and, therefore, appellantâ€™s Sixth and \r\n  Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated.  \r\nAccordingly, appellantâ€™s conviction \r\n  and sentence are REVERSED. [6] \r\n    \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, \r\n  BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    State struck Juror AA; it excused Affiant 2â€™s husband as an alternate juror.   \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Both the trial judge and State rely on the Rules of Professional \r\n    Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR, to determine whether there was error.  We \r\n    note, however, that the RPC have no bearing on the constitutionality of a \r\n    criminal conviction.  Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 426 S.E.2d 793 \r\n    (1993); see Scope of RPC (â€œ[v]iolation of a Rule should not give rise \r\n    to a cause of action nor should it create any presumption that a legal duty \r\n    has been breached.â€).  For example, in Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, \r\n    514 S.E.2d 320 (1999), the Court explained prosecutorial misconduct resulting \r\n    from the failure to disclose information to the defense as required by the \r\n    Constitution is not â€œnecessarily synonymousâ€ with misconduct as defined in \r\n    the RPC because the focus of the analysis is different, i.e., the fairness \r\n    of the procedure against the defendant vs. the attorneyâ€™s alleged misconduct.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   \r\n    See Bailey v. State, 309 S.C. 455, 424 S.E.2d 503 (1992) (recognizing \r\n    need for background investigations of prospective jurors in capital trials); \r\n    Long v. Norris &amp; Assoc., Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 538 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. \r\n    App. 2000) (recognizing parties may conduct juror background checks so long \r\n    as investigation meets requirements of RPC and other authorities).   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    The State concedes it is responsible for the conduct of the police detectives.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    See State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d 845 (1997) (in \r\n    capital case, proper standard for determining qualification of a prospective \r\n    juror is whether the jurorâ€™s views would prevent or substantially impair the \r\n    performance of his or her duties in accordance with the instructions and oath). \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    We affirm Issue 3 pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authority:  \r\n    State v.  Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (party cannot \r\n    argue one basis for objection at trial and another ground on appeal).\r\n  In light of our disposition of this appeal, it is unnecessary \r\n    to rule on the remaining issues presented.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25651","title":"Kahn v.

We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner M.B. Kahn Construction Company (Contractor) \r\n  appeals the dismissal of its causes of action against respondent Three Rivers \r\n  Bank &amp; Trust Company (Bank) for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Bank is a Pennsylvania corporation \r\n  with its principal place of business in that state.  In 1997, Bank and RSI Properties/Spartanburg \r\n  L.L.C. (Owner) entered a construction loan agreement to finance the building \r\n  of an assisted living facility in Spartanburg.  Under the agreement, loan proceeds \r\n  of $7 million were to be disbursed as construction progressed and Owner would \r\n  pay Contractor from these proceeds.  To secure the loan, Owner gave Bank a mortgage \r\n  on the Spartanburg property.  \r\nIn 1999, Owner defaulted, giving \r\n  rise to foreclosure actions and litigation involving various lienholders. [1]   Contractor sued Bank on two causes of action for unjust enrichment \r\n  and promissory estoppel.  Essentially, Contractor asserted that despite the \r\n  loanâ€™s default status, Bank gave assurances of payment through its agent, causing \r\n  Contractor to continue work that improved the property to Bankâ€™s benefit.\r\nBank moved to dismiss contending \r\n  it had no contact with South Carolina other than the note and mortgage agreement \r\n  with Owner and the related foreclosure action.  In response, Contractor submitted \r\n  the affidavit of its project director, William P. Edmonds.  Edmonds stated that \r\n  he dealt regularly with Bob McKain, an employee of Management Engineering Corporation, \r\n  who was Bankâ€™s inspecting engineer at the project site in Spartanburg.  The \r\n  loan agreement between Owner and Bank provides the inspecting engineer was to \r\n  perform services on behalf of Bank.  Edmonds stated it was McKain who approved \r\n  Contractorâ€™s pay requests and processed them for payment.  Contractor relied \r\n  on McKainâ€™s assurance of payment in continuing to work on the project.  In addition, \r\n  Edmondsâ€™s affidavit references â€œContractorâ€™s Consentsâ€ executed by Contractor \r\n  in South Carolina and Ownerâ€™s assignment to Bank of the construction contract \r\n  performed in South Carolina. \r\nBank in return submitted \r\n  the affidavits of its vice-president, Vincent W. Locher, who stated McKain was \r\n  not Bankâ€™s agent but was â€œan independent third-party inspecting engineer,â€ and \r\n  McKain who stated he served as â€œan independent third party contractorâ€ in inspecting \r\n  the site.\r\nThe trial court found Bankâ€™s contact \r\n  with South Carolina was not sufficient to support long-arm jurisdiction and \r\n  dismissed Contractorâ€™s causes of action.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs long-arm jurisdiction proper \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803 (2003)?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSection 36-2-803 provides:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A court may exercise personal jurisdiction \r\n  over a person who acts directly or by an agent as to a cause of action \r\n  arising from the personâ€™s \r\n  \r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transacting any business \r\n  in this State;\r\n    \r\n. . . .\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When jurisdiction over a person is \r\n  based solely upon this section, only a cause of action arising from acts enumerated \r\n  in this section may be asserted against him. . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  Contractorâ€™s \r\n  causes of action allege McKain was acting as Bankâ€™s agent transacting business \r\n  on Bankâ€™s behalf in South Carolina.  \r\nAt the pre-trial stage, \r\n  only a prima facie showing is required to support jurisdiction.  Mid-State \r\n  Distribs., Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 \r\n  (1993).  On a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, factual disputes \r\n  arising by affidavit will be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.  Brown \r\n  v. Investment Management and Research, Inc., 323 S.C. 395, 475 S.E.2d 754 \r\n  (1996).  Where the non-moving party submits facts sufficient to make a prima \r\n  facie showing of an agency relationship supporting long-arm jurisdiction under \r\n  Â§ 36-2-803, the motion to dismiss should be denied.  Id.  \r\nEdmondsâ€™s affidavit \r\n  and the loan agreement are sufficient here to make a prima facie showing that \r\n  McKain was acting as Bankâ€™s agent when he gave false assurances of payment.  \r\n  Bankâ€™s contrary assertions do not defeat this showing.  The fact that someone \r\n  is employed as an independent contractor does not negate the fact that he may \r\n  be acting as an agent.  See Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 SC. \r\n  589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002) (where one who performs work for another represents \r\n  the will of that other, not only as to the result, but also as to the means \r\n  by which the result is accomplished, he is not an independent contractor but \r\n  an agent); Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 293 S.E.2d 424 (1982) \r\n  (agency may be implied or inferred and may be circumstantially proved by the \r\n  conduct of the purported agent).

Richardson, Jr., and Barbara M. Seymour, both of Columbia, for the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nCharles E. Feeley, of Ladson, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in \r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent \r\n  from the practice of law in this state. [1]   The facts, as set forth in the \r\n  agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nIn January 2002, respondent undertook the representation of a client for the \r\n  purpose of attempting to obtain a bond reduction.  The client's bond had been \r\n  set at approximately $1,500,000.  On February 14, 2002, respondent was successful \r\n  in getting the bond reduced to $650,000.  On that same date, the client posted \r\n  the full amount of the bond in cash.  Respondent's stated fee for this service \r\n  was $5,000.\r\nOn February 2, 2002, respondent made an online payment to his personal Visa \r\n  credit card account in the amount of $4,000, following specific instructions \r\n  from the client and using an electronic check bearing a check number, payer \r\n  bank, and account number provided by the client.  When prompted by the computer \r\n  to enter an account holder name, respondent inserted a name that the client \r\n  had mentioned during respondent's conversations with him.  The name used was \r\n  not the client's name and was an individual unknown to respondent.  Respondent \r\n  and the client agreed that this would be the method of  payment of respondent's \r\n  fee for his representation of the client in the bond reduction matter.  On February \r\n  8, 2002, the online payment to respondent's Visa account was reversed when the \r\n  electronic check was not honored by the payer bank.\r\nBetween February 11, 2002, and February 13, 2002, respondent prepared four \r\n  computer checks in varying amounts totaling $1,662,500 following the client's \r\n  specific instructions.  Respondent prepared the computer checks using check \r\n  preparation software purchased for this purpose at the client's instruction.  \r\n  The check numbers, account holder name, payer bank, and account number on the \r\n  computer checks were provided by the client.  The party listed as the account \r\n  holder on the computer checks was not the client and was unknown to respondent.  \r\n  Respondent delivered the computer checks to the client at the detention center.  \r\n  The client signed the checks using the listed account holder's name and not \r\n  his own.  Respondent deposited the computer checks into his trust accounts.  \r\n  Following the deposits of the computer checks, respondent wrote checks, obtained \r\n  cash from his trust account, and purchased a number of cashier's checks made \r\n  payable to third parties.  The computer checks were returned to respondent's \r\n  bank when the payer bank refused to honor them, resulting in the recall of trust \r\n  account checks respondent had previously written in connection with other client \r\n  matters.\r\nOn February 14, 2002, respondent delivered a cashier's check in the amount \r\n  of $650,000 to the clerk of the circuit court for the payment of the client's \r\n  bond.  The client was released shortly thereafter.  Respondent met with the \r\n  client following his release and gave him two cashier's checks payable to the \r\n  client's father totaling $70,000, and cash in the amount of $9,950.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.2(d) (a lawyer shall not assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows \r\n  is criminal or fraudulent); Rule 1.2(e) (when a lawyer knows a client expects \r\n  assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law, \r\n  the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations \r\n  on the lawyer's conduct); Rule 1.16(a) (a lawyer shall not represent a client \r\n  or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from representation of \r\n  a client if the representation will result in violation of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct or other law); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall hold property of clients that \r\n  is in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation separate from \r\n  the lawyer's own property and it shall be appropriately safeguarded); Rule 4.1 \r\n  (in the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a \r\n  false statement of material fact to a third person or fail to disclose a material \r\n  fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal \r\n  or fraudulent act by a client); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on \r\n  the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); \r\n  Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a \r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions of \r\n  the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to \r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law).  Finally, respondent has violated Rule 417, SCACR, \r\n  which sets forth the requirements for financial recordkeeping.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.  Within \r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice \r\n  of Law to the Clerk of Court.  Further, respondent shall, within thirty days \r\n  of the date of this opinion, pay the costs of this proceeding ($160.76).\r\n DISBARRED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In October 1997, respondent was suspended for \r\n    ninety days for failing to file a state income tax return.

David \r\n  Flowers, of Greenville, for Amicus Curiae South Carolina Trial Lawyers Association.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  We granted certiorari to review \r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals in Gaskins v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty \r\n  Insurance Company, 343 S.C. 666, 541 S.E.2d 269 (Ct. App. 2000).  We affirm \r\n  the decision as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRandy (â€œRandyâ€) and Linda Gaskins (collectively â€œGaskinsâ€) \r\n  sued Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Company (â€œSouthern Farmâ€) for fraudulently \r\n  inducing them to sign a claimâ€™s release.  Gaskinsâ€™ complaint alleges Randyâ€™s \r\n  father accidentally shot him while hunting.  Randy claims the shooting resulted \r\n  in severe injuries and accrued medical bills in excess of $36,000.  \r\nThe complaint alleges Southern Farm insured Randyâ€™s \r\n  father.  Further, the Gaskins allege a Southern Farm agent informed Randyâ€™s \r\n  father the policy limit was $9,000 although it was actually $100,000.  \r\nThe Gaskins complain they relied on the insurers erroneous \r\n  information when they accepted $9,000 in compensation for Randyâ€™s injuries in \r\n  exchange for releasing Southern Farm from any additional claims.  Accordingly, \r\n  the Gaskins seek to recover in tort against Southern Farm for fraudulently inducing \r\n  them to settle the claim.\r\nThe trial court dismissed the Gaskinsâ€™ fraud claim pursuant to Rule \r\n  12 (b)(6), SCRCP, citing Hopkins v. Fidelity Insurance Company, 240 S.C. \r\n  230, 125 S.E.2d 468 (1962).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding Hopkins \r\n  was a rule of pleading supplanted by the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals found Hopkins did not bar the suit.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in finding Hopkins inapplicable?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appeals ruled Hopkins inapplicable \r\n  because it did not involve applicable substantive law.  We disagree.\r\nIn Hopkins a plaintiff sued an insurance company \r\n  in tort for fraudulently inducing her to sign a release of all claims involving \r\n  the death of her daughter.  The trial court denied the defendantâ€™s demurrer.\r\nOn appeal, this Court relied upon three grounds to reverse the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s denial of the insurance companyâ€™s demurrer.  Importantly for the present \r\n  case, we found the trial court erred in denying the demurrer because plaintiff \r\n  suffered no damages as a result of the release.  \r\nHopkins asserted she was barred by the release from suing the tortfeasor.  \r\n  Therefore, she argued she should be allowed to sue the insurance company for \r\n  fraudulently obtaining the release.  This Court disagreed and concluded if the \r\n  tortfeasor was not found to be negligent of the underlying tort, then the plaintiff \r\n  has suffered no damage because of the fraudulently obtained release.  However, \r\n  if the tortfeasor was found negligent for the childâ€™s death, then any fraudulently \r\n  obtained release could not be enforced to bar plaintiff from recovering damages \r\n  on the underlying tort.\r\nThe Hopkins decision enunciated a substantive rule, contrary to the \r\n  Court of Appeals categorization of it as an outdated pleading requirement. See \r\n  also Pilkington v. McBain, 274 S.C. 312, 314, 262 S.E.2d 916, \r\n  917 (1980).\r\nSouth Carolina law prohibits an insurer from knowingly misrepresenting \r\n  to third-party claimants â€œpertinent facts or policy provisions relating to coverages \r\n  at issue or providing deceptive or misleading information with respect to coverages.â€  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-59-20 (1976).  This general prohibition is instructive of \r\n  legislative intent to prohibit such practices as complained of in this case. \r\n  But see Masterclean, Inc. v. Star Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 405, \r\n  556 S.E.2d 371 (2001) (Claims Practice Act does not create a private cause of \r\n  action).\r\nFurther, a majority of courts now recognize a tort against an insurance \r\n  company for fraudulently obtaining a release. [1]   A primary reason why courts recognize the \r\n  tort is to discourage insurance companies from engaging in fraud.  Phipps \r\n  v. Winneshiek County, 593 N.W.2d 143, 146 (Iowa 1999).  While the rationale \r\n  of Hopkins is sound, its rule does not clearly deter insurance companies \r\n  from fraudulently obtaining a release.  \r\nHowever, as noted in Hopkins, a plaintiff cannot maintain an action \r\n  against an insurer for fraudulently obtaining a release until he proves the \r\n  materiality of the false representation.  To establish the materiality element \r\n  of the tort of fraud, the plaintiff must demonstrate the insurer had an obligation \r\n  to pay by alleging and proving the liability of the tortfeasor.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nWe modify Hopkins in order to deter insurance companies from attempting \r\n  to defraud claimants while recognizing that a plaintiff must show the insurerâ€™s \r\n  false representation was material.  The Gaskins may sue Southern Farm in tort \r\n  for fraudulently inducing them to sign a release.  However, as a predicate to \r\n  recovery, if any, Gaskins must first allege and prove that Randyâ€™s father was \r\n  negligent in the underlying tort.\r\nThe trial court erred in dismissing the Gaskins complaint pursuant to Rule \r\n  12 (b)(6), SCRCP.  While the Court of Appeals correctly reversed the trial court, \r\n  it did so on a misunderstanding of the Hopkins decision.  We, therefore, \r\n  remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with \r\n  this opinion. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals decision is AFFIRM AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justices Marc H. Westbrook and \r\n  John W. Kittredge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  See, e.g., Matsuura \r\n    v.

Hot Shot dispatched Olmstead to various places to pick up and \r\n  deliver goods and materials.  Hot Shot paid Olmstead after he completed delivery \r\n  based on the number of miles he had driven. \r\nHot Shot sent Olmstead \r\n  to pick up a load of fiberglass utility poles from Shakespeareâ€™s plant in Newberry, \r\n  South Carolina for delivery to Shakespeareâ€™s customer in Montana.  On May 19, \r\n  1997, Olmstead arrived at Shakespeare and assisted Shakespeareâ€™s staff in loading \r\n  and strapping the large poles onto Olmsteadâ€™s flatbed trailer.  After all the \r\n  poles were loaded, Shakespeare instructed Olmstead that some of the poles needed \r\n  to be removed because they would not meet quality control and would not be accepted \r\n  by the customer in Montana.  Olmstead began loosening the straps around the \r\n  poles, and was injured when several of the poles fell off the trailer unexpectedly.  \r\n  At least one of the poles struck Olmstead.\r\nOlmstead filed his \r\n  original complaint against Shakespeare in September 1997.  Shakespeare filed \r\n  a motion to dismiss, alleging Olmstead was its statutory employee, and, therefore, \r\n  that workersâ€™ compensation provided Olmsteadâ€™s exclusive remedy.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2002). At some point, Shakespeare withdrew \r\n  its motion to dismiss, and Olmsteadâ€™s complaint was dismissed pursuant to Rule \r\n  40(j), SCRCP.  \r\nOlmstead re-filed his complaint \r\n  on May 14, 1999, along with Mrs. Olmsteadâ€™s loss of consortium claim. [1]   Shakespeare asserted statutory \r\n  employment as a defense in its answer, and filed a motion to dismiss on the \r\n  same ground.  After hearing arguments, the trial judge granted Shakespeareâ€™s \r\n  motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Olmstead v. Shakespeare, \r\n  348 S.C. 436, 559 S.E.2d 370 (Ct. App. 2002).  This Court granted Shakespeareâ€™s \r\n  petition for certiorari on the following issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in finding that Olmstead was not the statutory \r\n  employee of Shakespeare based on this Courtâ€™s decision in Abbott v. The Limited, \r\n  338 S.C. 161, 526 S.E.2d 513 (2000)?\r\n  \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err by indicating that the principles of workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  may operate differently when exclusivity of the statute is asserted by the defendant \r\n  as a shield to liability?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nI.  Abbott\r\nShakespeare argues that Abbott does \r\n  not apply to this case.  We disagree.\r\nIn Abbott, the plaintiff was employed \r\n  by a common carrier.  The carrier had contracted with the defendant retailer, \r\n  The Limited, Inc., to deliver goods to the defendant retailerâ€™s stores.  338 \r\n  S.C. at 162, 526 S.E.2d at 514.  The plaintiff was injured when he slipped and \r\n  fell while unloading boxes on the defendant retailerâ€™s premises.  Id.  The \r\n  plaintiff received workersâ€™ compensation benefits from his common carrier employer \r\n  and brought a negligence action against the defendant retailer.  Id.  The \r\n  defendant retailer moved to dismiss on grounds that plaintiff was its statutory \r\n  employee, and, therefore, that workersâ€™ compensation provided plaintiffâ€™s exclusive \r\n  remedy under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400.  Id.  The trial court granted \r\n  the motion to dismiss, but this Court reversed, holding that â€œthe mere recipient \r\n  of goods delivered by a common carrier is not the statutory employer of the \r\n  common carrierâ€™s employee.â€  Id. at 514, 526 S.E.2d at 163.   \r\nThe statutory employment concept is \r\n  based on South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400.  That section provides,  \r\n\r\n  When any person, in this section \r\n  and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 and 42-1-430 referred to as &quot;owner,&quot; undertakes to \r\n  perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or \r\n  occupation and contracts with any other person (in this section and \r\n  Â§Â§ 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 referred to as &quot;subcontractor&quot;) for the execution \r\n  or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the \r\n  work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman \r\n  employed in the work any compensation under this Title which he would have been \r\n  liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (Supp. \r\n  2002) (emphasis added).  In determining whether an employee is engaged in activity \r\n  that is â€œpart of [the ownerâ€™s] trade, business, or occupationâ€ as required under \r\n  section 42-1-400, this Court has applied three tests.  The activity is considered \r\n  â€œpart of [the ownerâ€™s] trade, business, or occupationâ€ for purposes of the statute \r\n  if it (1) is an important part of the ownerâ€™s business or trade; (2) is a necessary, \r\n  essential, and integral part of the ownerâ€™s business; or (3) has \r\n  previously been performed by the ownerâ€™s employees.  Glass v. Dow Chemical, \r\n  325 S.C. 198, 482 S.E.2d 49 (1997).  If the activity at issue meets even one \r\n  of these three criteria, the injured employee qualifies as the statutory \r\n  employee of â€œthe owner.â€  Id.  \r\nApplying these tests \r\n  in Abbott, the Court found that â€œthe fact that it was important to [defendant \r\n  retailer] to receive goods does not render the delivery of goods an important \r\n  part of [defendant retailerâ€™s] business.â€  Abbott, 338 S.C. at 163, 526 \r\n  S.E.2d at 514.  The Court explained further, â€œâ€˜[t]he mere fact that transportation \r\n  of goods to oneâ€™s place of business is essential for the conduct of the business \r\n  does not mean that the transportation of the goods is a part or process of the \r\n  business.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Caton v. Winslow Bros. &amp; Smith Co., 34 \r\n  N.E.2d 638, 641 (Mass. 1941)).  In so holding, the Court explicitly overruled \r\n  two cases to the extent they could be read to hold otherwise:  Neese v. Michelin \r\n  Tire Corp., 324 S.C. 465, 478 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding that plaintiff \r\n  truck driver employed by common carrier who was injured transporting raw materials \r\n  to and from Michelin pursuant to Michelinâ€™s contract with his employer qualified \r\n  as the statutory employee of Michelin), and Hairston v. Re: Leasing, Inc., \r\n  286 S.C. 493, 334 S.E.2d 825 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding plaintiff truck driver \r\n  qualified as statutory employee of defendant car dealership when he was injured \r\n  transporting cars to the dealership).  Abbott, 338 S.C. at 164, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 514, n. 1.\r\nShakespeare contends \r\n  Abbott is distinguishable from the present case.  Shakespeare argues \r\n  that the delivery to the defendant retailer in Abbott was not an essential \r\n  part of its business because plaintiff was delivering inventory that defendant \r\n  retailer then had to sell.  Conversely, Shakespeare argues delivery of the fiberglass \r\n  poles in this case was essential to its business because the sale would be complete \r\n  upon delivery.  In Shakespeareâ€™s words, â€œ[t]he distinction in this case is that \r\n  Olmstead was delivering a product to Shakespeareâ€™s customer and without that \r\n  delivery there would be no sale.â€  (Pet. Br. at 5).   Shakespeare also emphasizes \r\n  that Abbott involved delivery of goods to the defendant \r\n  while the present case involves delivery from the defendant.\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  refused to read Abbott so narrowly.  The court agreed that Abbott \r\n  involved the receipt of goods as opposed to delivery of goods, \r\n  and, as such, noted it was unnecessary for the Abbott court to address \r\n  the delivery of goods from a manufacturer to a customer because that factual \r\n  issue was not presented in Abbott.  348 S.C. at 372, 559 S.E.2d at 339.  \r\n  Further, the Court of Appeals noted that neither the Neese nor the Hairston \r\n  case, which this Court explicitly overruled, emphasized or even addressed \r\n  delivery in this context.  Id.\r\nIn our opinion, the \r\n  Court of Appeals correctly interpreted this Courtâ€™s decision in Abbott.  \r\n  We read their opinion as holding that Abbott is not limited to receipt \r\n  of goods cases, but applies equally to delivery of goods cases as long as the \r\n  transportation of goods is not the primary business of the company to whom or \r\n  from whom goods are being delivered.  Shakespeare manufactures fiberglass products \r\n  and was shipping a finished product to a customer via a common carrier.  As \r\n  this Court noted in Abbott, â€œ[t]he fact that it was important to [defendant \r\n  retailer] to receive goods does not render delivery of goods an important \r\n  part of the [defendant retailerâ€™s] businessâ€ for statutory employment purposes.  \r\n  338 S.C. at 163, 526 S.E.2d at 514.  Likewise, the fact that it was important \r\n  to Shakespeare to deliver its finished product to its customer in order to consummate \r\n  a sale does not render the delivery of its products an important part of its \r\n  business for purposes of statutory employment.\r\nThis Court has recognized \r\n  that the construction of the statutory employment statute, and the tests established \r\n  to interpret that statute, do not eliminate the need for an individualized determination \r\n  of the facts of each case in which statutory employment is alleged.  â€œSince \r\n  no easily applied formula can be laid down for determining whether work in a \r\n  particular case meets these tests, each case must be decided on its own facts.â€  \r\n  Dow, 325 S.C. at 201, 482 S.E.2d at 51 (citing Ost v. Integrated Prods., \r\n  Inc., 296 S.C. 241, 371 S.E.2d 796 (1988)).  Abbott does not change \r\n  the need for this case by case analysis; Abbott merely establishes that \r\n  transportation of goods is important to nearly all businesses, and, that transportation \r\n  of goods by a common carrier alone, without something more, does not qualify \r\n  as â€œpart of [the ownerâ€™s] trade, business, or occupationâ€ under any of the three \r\n  established tests for statutory employment.  \r\nShakespeare designs \r\n  and manufactures fiberglass products.  It is not in the transportation business; \r\n  it did not own any delivery trucks and none of its employees participated in \r\n  the delivery of its products beyond the loading stage. All of the raw materials \r\n  used to manufacture Shakespeareâ€™s products arrive at Shakespeare by common carrier \r\n  and almost all of its finished products leave the plant by common carrier.  \r\n  Shakespeareâ€™s representative testified in his deposition that Shakespeare pays \r\n  for delivery to its customer only when the order exceeds $3,000.  Although delivery \r\n  by common carrier was certainly important to Shakespeareâ€™s operation, it does \r\n  not follow that such delivery was â€œâ€˜part or processâ€™â€ of its manufacturing business.  \r\n  See Abbott, 338 S.C. at 164, 526 S.E.2d at 514 (quoting Caton, \r\n  34 N.E.2d at 641) (finding defendant manufacturer of wool was not statutory \r\n  employer of driver employed by common carrier to transport wool to defendantâ€™s \r\n  warehouse).  \r\nIn our opinion, the \r\n  Court of Appeals employed the correct analysis in finding that Olmstead was \r\n  not Shakespeareâ€™s statutory employee and we affirm their decision.  Abbott \r\n  represents a change in this stateâ€™s jurisprudence on what activity constitutes \r\n  â€œpart of [the ownerâ€™s] trade, business or occupationâ€ under section 42-1-400, \r\n  and likely conflicts with cases other than the ones we explicitly overruled \r\n  in footnote 1 of the Abbott opinion.  As such, we now overrule all prior \r\n  cases to the extent they are in conflict with our holding in Abbott and \r\n  now in this case.\r\nII.  Exclusivity As A Shield\r\nAfter the Court of Appeals concluded \r\n  that Olmstead was not the statutory employee of Shakespeare, it went on to comment \r\n  that the broad construction in favor of coverage normally employed in workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation cases was not â€œas pertinent where the statutory employee definition \r\n  and exclusive remedy provision are used as a shield to prevent recovery under \r\n  another theory.â€  Olmstead, 348 S.C. at 441, 559 S.E.2d at 372.  This \r\n  Court has not previously adopted a different standard of review for cases in \r\n  which the workersâ€™ compensation statute is used as a shield to liability under \r\n  another theory, and declines to do so now. [2]   \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM AS MODIFIED the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals and overrule prior cases to the extent they conflict \r\n  with our holding in this case and in Abbott.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES,JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The two-year period for filing a workersâ€™ compensation claim expired \r\n    on May 19, 1999.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  For instance, this Court made no such statement in Glass v. Dow \r\n    Chemical, in which the defendant asserted statutory employment as a shield \r\n    just as Shakespeare did in the present action.  325 S.C. 198, 482 S.E.2d 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Maria Reichmanis","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-05-15-01","description":"This order places Maria Reichmanis on interim suspension and appoints Michael A.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, and Assistant \r\n  Attorney General William Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nJohn Stafford Bryant, of Bryant, Fanning and Shuler, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE \r\n  BURNETT:  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the \r\n  Post-Conviction Relief (â€œPCRâ€) judge granting Quentin Anderson (â€œAndersonâ€) \r\n  relief.  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAnderson was indicted and convicted of assault and \r\n  battery with intent to kill and received a twenty-year sentence.  Janice Jenkins \r\n  Glover (â€œGloverâ€), Andersonâ€™s former girlfriend, testified at trial Anderson \r\n  had threatened to kill her or the other man if he saw her with another man.  \r\n  Glover testified she was at a club on the night of the crime talking to the \r\n  victim.  Anderson entered the club, and Glover walked away from the victim to \r\n  the bar.\r\nGlover testified Anderson approached her and slapped \r\n  her, knocking her to the floor.  As she left the club she heard a gunshot.  \r\n  When she heard a second gunshot, she saw Anderson outside the club with a gun.  \r\n  Three witnesses corroborated Gloverâ€™s testimony, including the victim who positively \r\n  identified Anderson as the man who shot him.         \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.  State v. Anderson, Op. \r\n  No. 98-UP-510 (Ct. App. Filed November 23, 1998).  A petition for a writ of \r\n  certiorari was not filed with this Court.\r\nAnderson subsequently filed a petition for PCR alleging appellate counsel provided \r\n  ineffective assistance by failing to petition for a writ of certiorari from \r\n  this Court.  The PCR court agreed noting that he would have prevailed on an \r\n  appeal to this Court under State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d 324\r\n(1998), a decision released subsequent to the Court of Appeals decision in Andersonâ€™s \r\n  case.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in concluding appellate counsel provided ineffective \r\n  assistance by not petitioning for a writ of certiorari to this Court to determine \r\n  if Andersonâ€™s threat to and assault of Glover were properly admitted at trial?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA defendant is constitutionally entitled to the effective assistance of appellate \r\n  counsel.  Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 105 S. Ct. 830, 83 L. Ed. 2d \r\n  821 (1985); Thrift v. State, 302 S.C. 535, 397 S.E.2d 523 (1990). \r\n  [1]   An applicant must prove ineffective assistance by showing counselâ€™s \r\n  performance deficient, and the deficient performance prejudiced the applicant.  \r\n  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d \r\n  674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989); Butler \r\n  v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985).  \r\nTo prove prejudice, the applicant must show that, but for counselâ€™s errors, \r\n  there is a reasonable probability he would have prevailed on appeal.  Strickland, \r\n  supra; Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  \r\n  That is, Anderson must prove prejudice by showing he would have prevailed on \r\n  appeal had a writ been filed by counsel and granted by this Court.  See \r\n  Butler, supra.\r\nAssuming, arguendo, appellate counsel was deficient in not seeking certiorari \r\n  from this Court, Anderson has failed to prove he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s \r\n  inaction.  Anderson asserts he would have prevailed on appeal because his threatening \r\n  statement to Glover and testimony of his slapping her at the bar were inadmissible \r\n  prior bad acts.  See Rule 404, SCRE; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, \r\n  118 S.E. 803 (1923).  We disagree.         \r\nRule 404, SCRE, the modern expression of the Lyle rule, excludes â€œevidence \r\n  of other crimes, wrongs, or actsâ€ offered to â€œprove the character of a person \r\n  in order to show action in conformity therewith.â€  Rule 404(b), SCRE.  The rule \r\n  creates an exception when the testimony is offered to show motive, identity, \r\n  the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, \r\n  or intent.  Id.  \r\nAndersonâ€™s threatening statement to Glover is not a prior bad act.  See \r\n  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 134, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682 (2000); see \r\n  also State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 636, 541 S.E.2d 833, 836-37 \r\n  (2001).  As such the bar against admitting prior bad acts is not applicable.\r\nFurther, Lyle is inapplicable to the testimony of Andersonâ€™s slapping \r\n  Glover.   A defendantâ€™s prior bad act is admissible if it forms part of the \r\n  res gestae of the crime.  See State v. Bolden, 303 S.C. 41, 43, \r\n  398 S.E.2d 494, 495, n. 1 (1990); see also State v. Smith, \r\n  309 S.C. 442, 451, 424 S.E.2d 496, 501 (1992) (Toal, J., dissenting).   \r\nEvidence of other crimes is admissible under the res gestae \r\n  theory when the other actions are so intimately connected with the crime charged \r\n  that their admission is necessary for a full presentation of the case.  State \r\n  v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71  (1996).  The evidence \r\n  of Andersonâ€™s slapping Glover is part of the res gestae of the crime.  The assault, \r\n  which took place moments before the shooting, provides the context of the shooting, \r\n  along with Andersonâ€™s earlier threatening statement.  A full presentation of \r\n  the crime necessarily includes Andersonâ€™s threat, testimony Anderson saw Glover \r\n  talking to a man, Andersonâ€™s assaulting Glover, and culminating in the shooting \r\n  of the victim.\r\nNeither Andersonâ€™s threat \r\n  nor his assault upon Glover are prior bad acts barred by Rule 404.  Anderson, \r\n  unable to prove the inadmissibility of the evidence, would not have prevailed \r\n  on appeal to this Court.
