Daniel Day, Jr., Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25552\r\nHeard September 17, 2002 - Filed November \r\n  4, 2002\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Assistant Deputy Attorney General J. Emory \r\n  Smith, Jr., and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel Barbara M. Seymour, all of Columbia, \r\n  for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.  \r\nR. Daniel Day, Jr., of Seneca, pro se.  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  This is an attorney disciplinary matter.  \r\n  After a hearing, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct concluded respondent committed \r\n  misconduct and recommended a public reprimand.  Neither the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel nor respondent except to the recommended sanction.  \r\nMatter I \r\nAt the hearing, \r\n  Attorney to Assist Disciplinary Counsel (ATA) Donald C. Coggins, Jr., testified \r\n  he mailed a letter to respondent requesting respondent contact him for an appointment.  \r\n  Coggins testified respondent did not respond.  Respondent testified he did not \r\n  remember receiving Cogginsâ€™ letter, but agreed he was responsible for mail delivered \r\n  to his office.  \r\nATA William M. Hagood, \r\n  III, testified he mailed respondent two letters, the second of which asked respondent \r\n  to contact him to schedule an appointment.  Hagood stated he left two messages \r\n  with respondentâ€™s office; respondent did not contact him.  Ultimately, respondent \r\n  complied with a deposition subpoena.  Respondent acknowledged he did not respond \r\n  to Hagood in a timely manner.  \r\nMatter II \r\nClient A \r\n  testified, although respondent withheld money for tax purposes during a real \r\n  estate transfer, he failed to forward the money to the Department of Revenue \r\n  ( DOR).  Client A stated he informed respondent of the error and it took approximately \r\n  six weeks to clear up the matter.  Client A testified, on occasion, respondent \r\n  failed to timely respond to his communications.  \r\nRespondent \r\n  testified his office erroneously closed Client Aâ€™s file.  He explained, once \r\n  he realized the DOR transaction had not been completed, he immediately contacted \r\n  the DOR, forwarded the taxes, plus interest, and eventually was able to get \r\n  the purchasers to sign the necessary documentation. [1]   Respondent accepted responsibility for this \r\n  matter, noting he should have corrected the matter more quickly.  \r\nMatter III \r\n\r\nClient B testified \r\n  he hired respondent to represent him in a criminal matter.  He stated, after \r\n  his conviction and sentence, he repeatedly contacted respondent for file material \r\n  but respondent was not forthcoming.  Respondent testified he gave Client \r\n  B his file when Client B was in court for an unrelated matter.  \r\n\r\nMatter IV \r\nRespondent \r\n  represented parties during a closing in early May 1998.  The seller intended \r\n  to convey 8.2 acres of land and retain approximately one acre of contiguous \r\n  property.  \r\nThe buyer \r\n  testified, a month or two after the closing, he discovered he had purchased \r\n  the one acre parcel and immediately went to respondentâ€™s office to discuss the \r\n  situation.  Respondent stated he would take care of the problem.  The buyer \r\n  testified he telephoned respondent approximately twenty times; respondent returned \r\n  only two calls.  The buyer was notified in late May 1999 that the corrected \r\n  deed had been filed in April 1999.           \r\nA mortgage \r\n  broker testified he obtained the loan and mortgage for the buyer.  He explained \r\n  how the closing documents erroneously described the sale of the one acre rather \r\n  than the eight acres.  The broker testified that once the error with the property \r\n  was discovered, respondent contacted him to correct the situation.  By this \r\n  time, the loan and mortgage had been sold to another lender and the new lender \r\n  had difficulty locating the documents.  The broker testified he and respondent \r\n  â€œworked constantlyâ€ in an attempt to get the new lender to locate the documents \r\n  as quickly as possible.  \r\nRespondent testified, at the closing, the parties \r\n  reviewed the survey and deed.  No one noticed any error.  Once the buyer contacted \r\n  him about the error, respondent stated he ordered a new survey of the eight \r\n  acres.  He testified it took quite a long time for the lender to locate the \r\n  original loan papers.  Respondent apologized to the buyer for the error.  \r\nMatter V \r\nClient C testified \r\n  he received a copy of an order appointing respondent to represent him on his \r\n  post-conviction relief application.  According to Client C, respondent did not \r\n  contact him until after he filed a complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. \r\n\r\nRespondent \r\n  stated he did not receive the order of appointment.  After he received communication \r\n  from the Commission on Lawyer Conduct informing him of Client Câ€™s complaint, \r\n  he obtained a copy of the order of appointment from the Oconee County Clerk \r\n  of Courtâ€™s office. [2]   Ultimately, \r\n  respondent represented Client C at the PCR hearing and obtained a favorable \r\n  ruling.  \r\nMatter VI \r\nParty A testified \r\n  he sued respondentâ€™s client, Client D,  in magistrateâ€™s court claiming Client \r\n  D owed him money for appraisal work.  According to Party A, while in magistrateâ€™s \r\n  office for jury selection, respondent telephoned Party A and asked for copies \r\n  of the invoices.  Party A testified respondent indicated Client D owed Party \r\n  A and a trial was unnecessary.  Immediately after the conversation, Party A \r\n  faxed the invoices to respondent but did not receive a response. \r\nA week later, \r\n  Party A sent a letter to respondent inquiring about the status of the unpaid \r\n  invoices; again, he received no response.  Thereafter, Party A testified he \r\n  telephoned respondentâ€™s office â€œprobably 25 days in a row,â€ but received no \r\n  response.  Ultimately, the case was restored to the trial roster.  Approximately \r\n  a year later, the parties settled.\r\nRespondent \r\n  testified, at the time he filed the answer, he requested Party A provide copies \r\n  of the appraisals.  The magistrate telephoned Party A when he did not appear \r\n  for jury selection.  According to respondent, Party A then sent some invoices, \r\n  but not the requested appraisals.  Respondent testified he never promised Party \r\n  A his client would settle the matter. \r\nMatter VII \r\n\r\nClient E testified \r\n  respondent agreed to represent her in a personal injury matter.  She admitted \r\n  respondent told her he had previously represented the potential defendants on \r\n  other matters, but at the time stated he did not have a conflict.  While she \r\n  admitted respondent sent her to two other attorneys, she testified these attorneys \r\n  were to assist respondent with her case.  Not until later did respondent tell \r\n  Client E he had a conflict and would not be able to represent her.\r\nRespondent \r\n  testified he immediately told Client E he could not represent her in her personal \r\n  injury claim as he had a conflict and, therefore, recommended two other attorneys.  \r\n  He stated he represented Client E on other matters.     \r\nMatter VIII \r\n\r\nClient F testified \r\n  she was charged with causing an automobile accident.  She retained respondent \r\n  the same month to represent her as a plaintiff in the matter.  Client F stated \r\n  respondent failed to return her telephone calls on five occasions.  She testified, \r\n  several months after she filed a complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, \r\n  respondent served the pleadings in the action.  \r\nClient \r\n  F agreed respondent advised it would be better to file suit after the traffic \r\n  charge against her was resolved.  She testified she did not remember respondent \r\n  informing her that her own insurance company had paid the defendantâ€™s damages \r\n  and was not supporting her claim.  \r\nRespondent testified he told Client F her claim would \r\n  be difficult to substantiate as the witnesses to the automobile accident were \r\n  â€œwishy-washy,â€ but admitted he could have been clearer.  He stated he did not \r\n  communicate with Client F properly or frequently enough. \r\n  [3]  \r\nMatter IX \r\nClient G paid \r\n  respondent a retainer on January 28, 1999, and terminated his representation \r\n  by letter dated February 15, 1999.  Client G complained respondent had not contacted \r\n  him and failed to return his telephone calls.\r\nOn March 15, \r\n  Client G filed a complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.  Three days \r\n  later, the Commission requested respondent provide a response.  By letter dated \r\n  April 7, 1999, Disciplinary Counsel again requested respondent respond to the \r\n  matter.  By letter dated April 14, 1999, respondent stated he had interviewed \r\n  Client G and prepared pleadings.  He stated his office advised Client G to return \r\n  to the office to review and sign the pleadings.\r\nRespondent \r\n  testified he did not remember receiving Client Gâ€™s February 15th \r\n  letter.  He stated he had prepared Client Gâ€™s pleadings and was waiting for \r\n  him to return to the office to review and sign the papers.    Respondent returned \r\n  Client Gâ€™s retainer.  \r\n After considering \r\n  the testimony and exhibits from the hearing, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct \r\n  concluded respondent breached various provisions of the Rules of  Professional \r\n  Conduct (Rule 407, SCACR) and the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement \r\n  (Rule 413, SCACR).  Finally, the Commission concluded respondent committed misconduct \r\n  by failing to cooperate with the investigations of the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel.  Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982). \r\nWhile this Court \r\n  is not bound by the findings of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, its findings \r\n  are entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from \r\n  the testimony depend on the credibility of witnesses.  Matter of Moore, \r\n  329 S.C. 294, 494 S.E.2d 804 (1997); Matter of Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, \r\n  488 S.E.2d 871 (1997).  Nonetheless, the Court may make its own findings of \r\n  fact and conclusions of law.  Id.  A disciplinary violation must be proven \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.  Id.\r\nWe conclude \r\n  the testimony at the hearing establishes by clear and convincing evidence respondent \r\n  engaged in misconduct by failing to handle client matters diligently and competently, \r\n  by failing to adequately communicate with clients, by failing to promptly deliver \r\n  funds, and by neglecting legal matters. [4]   In addition, we conclude respondent \r\n  failed to respond to requests for information from the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel.   In the Matter of Treacy, supra.  We note respondent \r\n  has acknowledged his error.  \r\nThis Court \r\n  has imposed a wide range of sanctions where misconduct involves neglect of legal \r\n  matters, failure to deliver funds, failure to handle client matters diligently \r\n  and competently, failure to communicate with clients, and failure to cooperate \r\n  with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.  See Matter of Mayer, 325 \r\n  S.C. 1, 478 S.E.2d 286 (1996) (public reprimand); Matter of Shibley, \r\n  320 S.C. 362, 465 S.E.2d 356 (1995) (60 day suspension); Matter of Tootle, \r\n  319 S.C. 392, 461 S.E.2d 824 (1995) (4 month suspension); Matter of Ballard, \r\n  312 S.C. 227, 439 S.E.2d 846 (1994) (1 year suspension); Matter of Nida, \r\n  315 S.C. 132, 432 S.E.2d 462 (1993) (9 month suspension); Matter of Acker, \r\n  308 S.C. 338, 417 S.E.2d 862 (1992) (6 month suspension).  In this instance, \r\n  we find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  Respondent is \r\n  hereby publicly reprimanded for his misconduct.  In addition, respondent is \r\n  ordered to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceeding ($2,504.78).  This amount \r\n  shall be remitted to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in accordance with Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n PUBLIC \r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., \r\n  MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    There is no claim respondent misappropriated these funds.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    According to the partiesâ€™ stipulation, the Oconee County Clerk of Court places \r\n    orders of appointment in cubbyholes at the courthouse.  As a result of this \r\n    incident, respondent stated he instructed the Clerk of Court to mail orders \r\n    to his office.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Respondent ultimately represented \r\n    Client F at trial.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  We find violations of Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule 1.15 (failure \r\n    to deliver promptly to client or third party funds or files the client or \r\n    third party was entitled to receive), Rule 1.3 (failure to act with reasonable \r\n    diligence and promptness in representing a client), Rule 1.4(a) (failure to \r\n    keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and comply \r\n    promptly for requests for information), Rule 1.1 (failure to represent a client \r\n    competently), Rule 1.2 (failure to consult with a client as to the objectives \r\n    of the representation and the means by which they are to be achieved), Rule \r\n    8.4(a) (violated the Rules of Professional Conduct), and Rule 8.4(e) (engaged \r\n    in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).

Ebener, of  Moore, Taylor, &amp; Thomas, P.A., of West Columbia, for petitioners.\r\n\r\nJoseph W. Hudgens, of Pope &amp; Hudgens, of Newberry, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether the unity of title needed to establish an easement by necessity can exist where\r\na person owns one tract of land in fee simple and an adjoining tract of land with another person as tenants in common.  We find unity of title is not so established and\r\naffirm the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioners and respondent are adjoining landowners of property.  Respondent's tract and petitioners' tract (hereinafter referred to as the land-locked tract) were\r\noriginally joined as one piece of property owned by Jacob Lindler.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Lindler conveyed the land-locked tract to S.B. Holley alone.  The deed mentions that the tract has a right of way to reach a road.  In 1888 and 1889, Lindler\r\nconveyed two tracts (respondent's tract), which adjoined the land-locked tract, to S.B. Holley and his wife, C.D. Holley.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, C.D. Holley died.  At the time of her death, she and S.B. Holley owned respondent's tract as tenants in common. (1)  By the terms of C.D. Holley's will, she\r\ndevised her interest in respondent's tract to S.B. Holley for life.  At his death, the Will directed that the property be sold and the proceeds equally divided among her\r\nchildren and a granddaughter, Carrie Parrot.\r\n\r\nS.B. Holley subsequently remarried and later died in 1917.  By his Will, he devised one-third of his interest in respondent's tract to his second wife, Mary Louise Holley. \r\nHe also devised a life estate in the land-locked tract to Mary Louise Holley with the remainder to his granddaughter, Carrie Parrot West (formerly Carrie Parrot) and her\r\nhusband, Nolan West.  The residuary clause was in favor of his children and Carrie Parrot West.\r\n\r\nFollowing the deaths of C.D. Holley and S.B. Holley, the ownership of the tracts was:  (1) respondent's tract:  one-sixth undivided interest in Mary Louise Holley and\r\nfive-sixths undivided interest in the children of S.B. and C.D. Holley and their granddaughter, Carrie Parrot West; (2) land-locked tract:  a life estate in Mary Louise\r\nHolley with remainder in Carrie and Nolan West.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in 1918, respondent's tract was conveyed to John A. Smith. (2)  Smith subsequently conveyed the tract to respondent in 1972.  As for the land-locked tract, in\r\n1923, Mary Louise Holley surrendered her life estate to Carrie Parrot West.  West and her husband then conveyed the property to the Lexington Water Power Company\r\nin 1928. After six more owners, the land-locked tract was conveyed to petitioners in 1989.\r\n\r\nPetitioners brought this action seeking an easement by necessity over property of several adjoining landowners, including respondent. (3)  Both parties moved for summary\r\njudgment.  The trial court found respondent was entitled to summary judgment on the ground that there was not the requisite unity of title, severance, and necessity at the\r\ntime of severance to give rise to an easement by necessity.  \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed.  Kennedy v. Bedenbaugh, Op. No. 2000-UP-288 (S.C. \r\n  Ct. App. filed April 18, 2000). The Court of Appeals found S.B. Holley's ownership \r\n  did not meet the requirements of unity of title because he owned respondent's \r\n  tract with his wife, C.D. Holley, as tenants in common, and therefore, did not \r\n  have absolute ownership of both tracts at the same time. Further, the only severance \r\n  that occurred while there was the requisite unity of title was Lindler's conveyances \r\n  of the two tracts at different times to different grantees. However, at this \r\n  time there was no necessity for a right of way because Lindler had granted S.B. \r\n  Holley a right of way to a road that apparently no longer exists. Accordingly, \r\n  the Court of Appeals concluded the trial court had properly granted respondent's \r\n  motion for summary judgment.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the unity of title needed to establish an easement by necessity can exist where a person owns one tract of land in fee simple and an adjoining tract of land with\r\nanother person as tenants in common?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\"From the earliest period of our judicial history the acquisition of an easement \r\n  of right of way over another's land, by necessity, has been clearly recognized \r\n  and protected.\"  Brasington v. Williams, 143 S.C. 223, 238, 141 S.E. 375, 380 \r\n  (1927). The legal requirements of an easement by necessity are: (1) unity of \r\n  title, (2) severance of title, and (3) necessity. Id. To establish \r\n  unity of title, the owner of the dominant estate must show that his land and \r\n  that of the owner of the servient estate once belonged to the same person. Id. \r\n  In other words, petitioners have to show that their land-locked tract and respondent's \r\n  tract were, at one time, owned by the same owner.\r\n\r\nWhile the tracts were at one time both owned by Jacob Lindler, this is not the time at which an easement by necessity could have arisen.  Lindler conveyed the land-locked tract to S.B. Holley.  The deed conveying the land-locked tract mentions that S.B. Holley's interest includes a right of way to a road. Therefore, an easement by\r\nnecessity could not have arisen at the time Lindler conveyed the land-locked tract to S.B. Holley because S.B. Holley had access to a road from the land-locked tract.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must determine whether there is another time at which unity of title existed.  Petitioners contend unity of title existed when S.B. Holley owned the land-locked tract in fee simple and owned respondent's tract with his wife, C.D. Holley, as tenants in common.  However, unity of title did not exist at this time.\r\n\r\nFor unity of title to exist there must have been an absolute ownership of both \r\n  tracts of land. See 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses \r\n  Â§ 39 (1996) (must have been absolute ownership of both tracts). See also \r\n  \r\n  Potter v. Potter, 112 S.E.2d 569, 572 (N.C. 1960) (unity of title must have \r\n  amounted to absolute ownership of both quasi-dominant and quasi-servient tenements);\r\n \r\n  Bradley v. Bradley, 96 S.E.2d 417, 420 (N.C. 1957) (same). S.B. Holley's holding \r\n  of respondent's tract as a tenant in common did not make him an absolute owner \r\n  of that tract. Without a right of survivorship, (4) \r\n  upon C.D. Holley's death, her one-half undivided interest in respondent's tract \r\n  went to her heirs, not to her husband. (5) Accordingly, \r\n  holding one tract in fee simple and the other tract as a tenant in common does \r\n  not meet the requisite unity of title needed for an easement by necessity to \r\n  be created. See 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 39 \r\n  (way of necessity does not arise, for example, where grantor merely owned undivided \r\n  interest in land over which right is claimed); 28A C.J.S. Easements \r\n  Â§ 94 (1996) (right of way of necessity does not exist over land owned by grantor \r\n  as tenant in common, or in favor of land formerly held jointly or in common \r\n  by grantor); 94 A.L.R.3d Unity of Title for Easement by Implication \r\n  Â§ 10 (1979) (insufficient unity of title to support, upon severance, an easement \r\n  by necessity where alleged common owner of relevant parcels held only an undivided \r\n  interest in common in one of parcels). See also   Gray v. Magee, 292 \r\n  P. 157 (Calif. App. 4 Dist. 1930) (right to easement by necessity does not arise \r\n  when only interest of grantor in adjoining land over which right of way is claimed \r\n  is that of co-tenant with other parties);  Garvin v. New York, 190 N.Y.S. 143 \r\n  (N.Y. Ct. Cl. 1921) (one cannot have right of way of necessity over land which \r\n  grantor never owned except as tenant in common). Cf.   Reed v.\r\nWest, \r\n  82 Mass. 283 (1860) (plaintiff's fee ownership of dominant tract and tenancy \r\n  in common ownership of servient tract did not create unity of title such that \r\n  use of easement by prescription over servient tract was extinguished).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court properly granted respondent's motion for summary judgment \r\n  because the unity of title needed to establish an easement by necessity does \r\n  not exist where a person owns one tract of land in fee simple and an adjoining \r\n  tract of land with another person as tenants in common. See   Garvin \r\n  v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 343 S.C. 625, 541 S.E.2d 831 (2001) (summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and conclusions \r\n  and inferences to be drawn from facts are undisputed). Given our conclusion \r\n  that summary judgment was properly granted on this ground, we need not address \r\n  petitioner's argument that the additional grounds cited by the trial court for \r\n  granting summary judgment were improper. Consequently, the decision of the Court \r\n  of Appeals is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Tenancy in common is \"[a] form of ownership whereby each tenant (i.e., owner) holds an undivided interest in property.  . . .  The interest of a tenant in common does\r\nnot terminate upon his or her prior death (i.e., there is no right of survivorship).\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1022 (Abridged 6th Ed. 1991).\r\n2. An action, known as the  Oxiner action, was brought to \r\n  approve this sale because Carrie Parrot West was a minor at the time. Carrie \r\n  appeared by guardian ad litem and stated the sale should be approved. \r\n3. All other defendants were subsequently dismissed from the action.\r\n4. There is no right of survivorship as between co-tenants \r\n  unless the parties attach such a right. See   Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. \r\n  182, 75 S.E.2d 46 (1953); 86 C.J.S. Tenancy in Common Â§5 (1997). \r\n5. S.B. Holley received a life estate of C.D. Holley's interest in respondent's tract upon her death.  However, his interest was limited to the duration of his life, and, as a\r\nresult, does not qualify as absolute ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25554","title":"State v.

Peeples, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25554\r\nHeard October 9, 2002 - Filed November \r\n  12, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, of South Carolina \r\n  Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General \r\n  Tracey Colton Green, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, \r\n  for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  We granted a writ of certiorari \r\n  to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming petitionerâ€™s direct appeal. [1]   State v. Khingratsaiphon, \r\n  Op. No. 2001-UP-052 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed January 29, 2001).  We affirm.         \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by holding evidence supported \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s determination the arresting officer had authority to frisk \r\n  petitioner and, therefore, properly denied petitionerâ€™s motion to suppress?  \r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by holding there was evidence which supported the trial judgeâ€™s determination \r\n  the arresting officer had authority to conduct a frisk.  Specifically, he contends \r\n  the trial judge incorrectly premised his ruling on a finding the arresting officer \r\n  heard â€œgunâ€ shouted prior to the frisk and, therefore, there was no evidence \r\n  supporting the trial judgeâ€™s ruling.  We disagree.  \r\nDuring the suppression hearing, the parties \r\n  offered the following evidence.  On June 23, 1997, between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 \r\n  a.m., an Aiken pawn shop was robbed and its owner was shot to death.  South \r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) Agent Roger Sharpe testified, the morning \r\n  following the crime, SLED agents conducted a roadblock next to the pawn shop.  \r\n  As a result of the roadblock, the agents determined a black Honda was parked \r\n  in the pawn shopâ€™s lot on the morning of the crime.  An Asian male was seen \r\n  standing beside the vehicle.  \r\nDuring the roadblock, Mr. Wilson who worked \r\n  across the street from the pawn shop, volunteered that his relative, Curtis \r\n  Kesl from Charlotte, North Carolina, had been in Aiken on the morning of the \r\n  crime.  Wilson was uneasy about Kesl.  He stated, in the past, Kesl had driven \r\n  a Honda.     \r\nAgent Sharpe spoke with other members \r\n  of Keslâ€™s family.  According to Sharpe, they were also uneasy about Kesl as \r\n  Kesl had been in trouble before.  \r\nKeslâ€™s cousin, Terry Wilson, testified, \r\n  two weeks before the pawn shop crime, an Asian male accompanied Kesl to Aiken.  \r\n  The men stayed with Wilson over the weekend.  Previously, Kesl made a collect \r\n  telephone call to Wilson.  Telephone records revealed Kesl had called Wilson \r\n  from a Charlotte location. \r\nLater on the morning of the roadblock, officers \r\n  located an abandoned black Honda and determined it had been stolen from Charlotte \r\n  on the morning of the shooting.  Agent Sharpe relayed the above information \r\n  to authorities in North Carolina and asked if Kesl could be located through \r\n  that telephone number. \r\nNorth Carolina authorities determined the Charlotte \r\n  telephone number provided by Ms. Wilson was registered to Oua Vang at 305 Jones \r\n  Street, Unit 3.   \r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Policeman G.C. Lyman testified \r\n  on June 25, 1997, he was contacted by an agent with the State Bureau of Investigation \r\n  in North Carolina and, among other information, was informed that an Asian had \r\n  a possible connection to the shooting at the Aiken pawn shop.  In addition, \r\n  he knew Curtis Kesl, a white male, was possibly connected with the case. \r\nOn the same day, Lyman and two other \r\n  officers proceeded to Vangâ€™s apartment.  Three Asian males were standing outside.  \r\n  Each were wearing warm clothing in spite of the hot, humid weather.  Lyman stated \r\n  they wore baggy, solid blue clothing with long sleeves and bandanas around their \r\n  necks, clothing which was consistent with gang attire.  Lyman observed the name \r\n  of a Hmong gang scrawled on a wall facing the apartment.  \r\nLyman stated the officers asked who lived in the apartment; \r\n  all three indicated they did not live there.  \r\n  [2]   According to Lyman, â€œsomebody muttered something about somebodyâ€™s \r\n  relative, but it was not very clear and they were not very responsive.â€  The \r\n  officers then asked the three men for identification.  Petitioner walked into \r\n  the apartment, stating his identification was inside.  Lyman testified that, \r\n  had he had time to respond to petitioner, he would have requested petitioner \r\n  not go inside; he was concerned both that his baggy clothing could be concealing \r\n  a weapon and that there could be a weapon inside the apartment.  \r\nLyman followed petitioner inside the apartment; he saw \r\n  a white male and an Asian male in the living room/kitchen.  He then followed \r\n  petitioner up the stairs.  Petitioner looked toward one bedroom then went into \r\n  another bedroom, reached behind a curtain, and retrieved a wallet.  Without \r\n  opening the wallet, he stated it was not his and replaced it.  At that point, \r\n  petitioner started to open the closet.  Because he did not want him to go into \r\n  the closet for fear petitioner could obtain a weapon, Lyman testified he told \r\n  petitioner he did not need identification and to return outside.  Petitioner \r\n  started down the stairs.  At the same time, the Asian man who had been in the \r\n  living room/kitchen was walking up the stairs.  Lyman stated he told both men \r\n  to go downstairs.  \r\nLyman testified:\r\n\r\nAt that point, I heard a commotion, which I subsequently \r\n  found out was Officer Simmons yelling â€œgun,â€ but I didnâ€™t hear him clearly because \r\n  of the distance involved.  I felt the need for a frisk at that time because \r\n  my safety was in jeopardy and quickly frisked him and immediately felt in the \r\n  front a large handgun.  Retrieved it, it was 45 caliber Llama automatic pistol, [3]  I stuck that in my back pocket.  \r\n\r\n\r\nLyman arrested petitioner for carrying a concealed \r\n  weapon and possession of a weapon by a minor.  \r\nAfter hearing argument, the trial judge stated as follows:\r\n\r\n. . . during the totality of the circumstances here, that \r\n  there was graffiti on the wall, that they did have information that it was an \r\n  Asian, and this gentlemen defendant is from Thailand, he is an Asian, and because \r\n  of the exigent circumstances of long-sleeved blue shirts, not normally worn \r\n  during the summertime, and blue bandanas, which was indicia of some gang problems \r\n  they had had up in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area.\r\nAnd I accept the testimony of the officer in this case that \r\n  when he said the fellow said he had no id and then he said he was going inside \r\n  to get his id that the door was open.  And under those suspect circumstances, \r\n  that it was proper for the officer to follow him into that house.  And, in particular, \r\n  even accepting the testimony of the defendant he was going in there to stash \r\n  the gun, or to throw it in the closet, I believe he testified to.  In particular, \r\n  when the fellow decided he better, the policeman decided he better take the \r\n  fellow back outside and, of course, â€œgunâ€ was hollered, he had the right to \r\n  search him for his own protection, just as he had the right to search the suspect \r\n  with baggy clothes on for which a gun or oozie or another dangerous type of \r\n  weapon could have been underneath the clothes, that they had the right to search \r\n  him. . . . \r\n\r\nThe pistol seized from petitioner during \r\n  the frisk was admitted at trial.  Petitionerâ€™s videotaped statement was also \r\n  admitted.  \r\n On appeal, petitioner argued the police \r\n  did not have reason to believe he was armed and dangerous and, therefore, the \r\n  frisk was illegal.  After reviewing the testimony from the suppression hearing, \r\n  the Court of Appeals held â€œthe record contains ample evidence supporting the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s determination that the circumstances amounted to reasonable suspicion \r\n  by the officer that [petitioner] was armed and dangerous.â€  State v. Khingratsaiphon, \r\n  supra.  The Court of Appeals referred to the trial judgeâ€™s language underlined \r\n  above, noting the trial judgeâ€™s decision was not premised on the belief Officer \r\n  Lyman heard the exclamation â€œgunâ€ before conducting the frisk, but rather simply \r\n  that â€œgunâ€ was shouted.  Id.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals concluded \r\n  the frisk was valid and the handgun and statement were properly admitted.  Id.  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States \r\n  Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.  Evidence seized \r\n  in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial.  See \r\n  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).  \r\nThe Fourth Amendment â€œapplies to all seizures \r\n  of the person, including seizures that involve only a brief detention short \r\n  of traditional arrest.â€  United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, \r\n  878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2578, 45 L.Ed.2d 607, 614 (1975).  A police officer may \r\n  stop and briefly detain and question a person for investigative purposes, without \r\n  treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when the officer has a reasonable \r\n  suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of probable cause for arrest, \r\n  that the person is involved in criminal activity.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 \r\n  U.S.1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).  â€œReasonable suspicionâ€ requires \r\n  a â€œparticularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another \r\n  of criminal activity.â€  United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 \r\n  S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, 629 (1981).  In determining whether reasonable \r\n  suspicion exists, â€œthe totality of the circumstances - the whole picture -â€ \r\n  must be considered.  Id. 449 U.S. at 417, 101 S.Ct. at 695, 66 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 629.  \r\nSubsequent to a valid Terry stop, \r\n  a police officer may search the individual for weapons where the officer has \r\n  reason to believe the person is armed and dangerous.  Ybarra v. Illinois, \r\n  444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979).  In assessing whether a suspect \r\n  is armed and dangerous, â€œ[t]he officer need not be absolutely certain that the \r\n  individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances \r\n  would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.â€  \r\n  Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 909.  â€œ[I]n justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be \r\n  able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational \r\n  inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.â€  Id. \r\n  392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906. \r\nIn State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. \r\n  57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000), this Court considered the standard of review \r\n  it would apply on appeal from a motion to suppress based on Fourth Amendment \r\n  grounds.  We concluded the appellate court would not review the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  ultimate determination de novo but, rather, would apply a deferential \r\n  standard of review.  We stated:\r\n\r\n[W]e will review the trial courtâ€™s ruling like any other \r\n  factual finding and reverse if there is clear error.  We will affirm if there \r\n  is any evidence to support the ruling.\r\n\r\nId. S.C. at 66, S.E.2d at 666.  \r\nContrary to petitionerâ€™s claim, Brockman \r\n  does not hold the appellate court may not conduct its own review of the record \r\n  to determine whether the trial judgeâ€™s decision is supported by the evidence.  \r\n\r\nApplying Brockman here, we conclude \r\n  the evidence from the suppression hearing supports the trial judgeâ€™s decision \r\n  a reasonably prudent man would have believed petitioner was armed and dangerous \r\n  when Officer Lyman conducted the frisk.  Officer Lyman knew an Asian male was \r\n  a suspect in the pawn shop shooting.  Petitioner, an Asian male, and two other \r\n  Asian males were outside the apartment from which a murder suspect had placed \r\n  a telephone call.  Petitioner and the two other men were dressed in baggy clothing \r\n  (which could easily conceal a weapon), attire which Officer Lyman associated \r\n  with â€œgang clothing,â€ and the name of an Asian gang appeared on a nearby wall.  \r\n  All three men denied living in the apartment.  Nevertheless, petitioner went \r\n  inside the apartment after stating his identification was inside.   \r\nFollowing petitioner inside the apartment, \r\n  Officer Lyman observed two other men, both of whom fit the description of the \r\n  murder suspect(s), inside the apartment.  After following petitioner upstairs \r\n  and observing petitioner search unsuccessfully for identification, Officer Lyman \r\n  directed petitioner downstairs.  At this moment, one of the men from the living \r\n  room/kitchen was walking upstairs towards Officer Lyman and petitioner.  At \r\n  the same time, the officer heard a commotion outside.  Because there are specific \r\n  and articulable facts in evidence which support the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion \r\n  a reasonably prudent man would have considered petitioner armed and dangerous, \r\n  the Court must affirm.  Id.\r\n Assuming the trial judge incorrectly \r\n  based his ruling on the fact Officer Lyman heard â€œgunâ€ before conducting the \r\n  frisk, the Court must nonetheless affirm his decision because other articulable \r\n  facts (baggy clothing, gang graffiti, the approach of another individual, hearing \r\n  a â€œcommotionâ€) support the trial judgeâ€™s decision upholding the frisk.  Id. \r\n  The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.  \r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., \r\n  concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Petitioner was convicted of murder, \r\n    possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, armed robbery, \r\n    and criminal conspiracy to commit armed robbery and sentenced to concurrent \r\n    terms of life, five years, thirty years, and five years, respectively.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Another investigator testified that the officers identified themselves as \r\n    police officers to the three men outside the apartment.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    It was later determined the weapon belonged to the pawn shop.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25555","title":"In the Matter of Douglas A.

Barker, Respondent\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25555\r\nHeard October 10, 2002 - Filed November \r\n  12, 2002\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, \r\n  for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nComing B. Gibbs, Jr., of Gibbs &amp; Holmes, of Charleston; \r\n  and Desa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary \r\n  matter, the Subpanel and the full Panel recommended respondent Douglas A. Barker \r\n  be definitely suspended for nine months.  We impose a six-month definite suspension.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 12, 1998, respondent, acting pro \r\n  se, initiated a divorce action against his wife, Diana Spreeuw Barker \r\n  (Wife).  Respondent alleged that â€œsince September 26, 1997, the parties hereto \r\n  have lived separate and apart due to irreconcilable differences and seek a decree \r\n  of divorce on the ground of separation for a period of one year.â€  The complaint \r\n  also sought joint custody for the coupleâ€™s two daughters.  Respondent prepared \r\n  Wifeâ€™s pro se Answer admitting to the allegations in the Complaint \r\n  and asking the family court to adopt their settlement agreement.\r\nOn October 26, 1998, both respondent and Wife appeared \r\n  pro se before the family court.  At the hearing, respondent testified \r\n  that he and his wife had â€œbeen living separate and apart since September 26, \r\n  1997.â€ In addition, respondent called a corroborating witness who testified \r\n  that respondent and Wife had been living separate and apart since September \r\n  1997.  The family court granted respondent a divorce based on one yearâ€™s continuous \r\n  separation and approved the settlement agreement which included a joint custody \r\n  arrangement for the coupleâ€™s two children.\r\nRespondent and Wife, however, had not been continuously \r\n  separated for that year.  In April 1999, respondent filed a Rule 60, SCRCP, \r\n  motion with the family court informing the court of this fact. \r\n  [1]   As a result of the false statements made by respondent, the family \r\n  court vacated the divorce as well as the approval of their agreement. \r\nIn addition to the false statements regarding the \r\n  coupleâ€™s continuous separation, respondent was charged with making a false statement \r\n  to the family court on the financial declaration he filed at the October 1998 \r\n  hearing.  Respondent listed no creditors on the declaration, and no entry was \r\n  made regarding a retirement fund.  During the divorce litigation that ensued \r\n  after the October 1998 divorce order was vacated, respondent listed several \r\n  debts and a retirement fund.\r\nRespondent testified at \r\n  the hearing before the Subpanel.  He admitted that the statements regarding \r\n  continuous separation in the divorce complaint and at the hearing were false \r\n  and that he made the misrepresentations to the family court with the intention \r\n  of getting both the divorce granted and the settlement agreement approved.  \r\n  Moreover, he stated the corroborating witness knew her testimony was false.  \r\n  He explained his primary concern was joint custody of the children because he \r\n  was their primary caregiver.    Regarding the financial declaration, respondent \r\n  stated that any omissions were not made with the intent to deceive Wife.  Respondent \r\n  acknowledged, however, that he did not make full financial disclosure to \r\n  the court at the October 1998 divorce hearing.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Subpanel recommended a definite suspension \r\n  for nine months and that respondent pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.  \r\n  Respondent filed exceptions, but the Full Panel adopted the Subpanelâ€™s report.  \r\n\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner \r\n  in which discipline is given rests entirely with this Court.  E.g., In \r\n  re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).  The Court may make its own \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation.  \r\n  E.g., In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).  The \r\n  Court must administer the sanction it deems appropriate after a thorough review \r\n  of the record.  Id.\r\nRespondent has admitted \r\n  the above facts and clearly has committed numerous acts of misconduct.  Specifically, \r\n  we find respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule \r\n  407, SCACR:  (1) Rule 1.1 (failing to provide competent representation); (2) \r\n  Rule 1.7 (conflict of interest in representing both himself and Wife in the \r\n  1998 divorce proceeding); (3) Rule 3.1 (presenting a claim that was not meritorious \r\n  in the 1998 divorce proceeding); (4) Rule 3.3 (candor towards the tribunal, \r\n  by making false statements of fact and law to the family court); (5) Rule 3.4 \r\n  (fairness to opposing party); (6) Rule 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others); \r\n  and (7) Rule 8.4 (violating the rules of professional conduct; committing a \r\n  criminal act, i.e., perjury, that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, \r\n  or fitness as a lawyer; engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude; engaging \r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and engaging \r\n  in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nIn addition, respondent violated the following \r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (violating \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct);  Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending \r\n  to pollute the administration of justice or bring the courts or legal profession \r\n  into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law);  and \r\n  Rule 7(a)(6) (conduct violating the oath of office taken upon the admission \r\n  to practice law in this State).\r\nIn mitigation, respondent \r\n  asks the Court to recognize he was under the emotional stress of a divorce and \r\n  acted solely out of concern for his children.\r\nWe conclude a six-month definite \r\n  suspension is the appropriate sanction.  See In re Diggs, 344 \r\n  S.C. 397, 544 S.E.2d 628 (2001) (90-day suspension imposed on attorney who gave \r\n  false statements under oath on his CLE compliance report); In re Blake, \r\n  343 S.C. 441, 539 S.E.2d 710 (2000) (four-month definite suspension imposed \r\n  on attorney who made false representations to the family court as to why he \r\n  needed a continuance for a clientâ€™s hearing); In re Murphy, 336 S.C. \r\n  196, 519 S.E.2d 791 (1999) (nine-month definite suspension imposed where attorney, \r\n  inter alia, made misrepresentations to the probate court while acting \r\n  as co-personal representative of his auntâ€™s estate).\r\nAccordingly, we definitely suspend respondent for \r\n  six months and order him to pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings.  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of the Rules \r\n  for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent also filed a self-report with Disciplinary \r\n    Counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25556","title":"In the Matter of Hal J.

Warlick, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25556\r\nHeard September 18, 2002 - Filed November \r\n  12, 2002\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Senior Assistant Attorney General James \r\n  G. Bogle, Jr., and Henry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, all of Columbia, \r\n  for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nHal J. Warlick, of Georgetown, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, \r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against respondent, \r\n  [1]  regarding numerous matters of misconduct. [2]   We agree with the Panelâ€™s recommendation that \r\n  respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.\r\nFACTS\r\nAccount Matters\r\n          In many of the Formal Charges, respondent has admitted that he failed \r\n  to maintain a proper trust account and that he commingled personal funds with \r\n  client funds and other funds in his possession.  The records of respondentâ€™s \r\n  Greenville National Bank Special Account \r\n  [3]  show the account had a negative balance on at least six occasions.  \r\n  Throughout the time period covered in these charges, the Subpanel found that \r\n  respondent continuously violated Rule 1.15, of Rule 407, SCACR, regarding the \r\n  safekeeping of property.  In seventeen separate matters, respondent violated \r\n  Rule 1.15 and Rule 8.4, of Rule 407, SCACR, regarding attorney misconduct. [4] \r\nMildred Burgess \r\n  Matter\r\nRespondent settled Mildred Burgessâ€™s case for $18,000.  He prepared \r\n  a settlement sheet that showed a receipt of $18,000, deductions for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees of $4,500 and other expenses, and a net to the client of $12,328.50.  On \r\n  the settlement sheet, respondent offered his client three options as to how \r\n  she would receive the money.\r\nAfter some discussion, Burgess elected to take a different option \r\n  of receiving a portion of the settlement immediately and $11,000 via a post-dated \r\n  check.  Burgess testified she believed she was loaning money to respondent that \r\n  would be repaid at ten percent interest.  Respondent testified he did not advise \r\n  Burgess of her right to seek independent counsel regarding the loan transaction.  \r\n  Respondent issued a counter check to Burgess drawn on his Greenville National \r\n  Bank Special Account.  Burgess negotiated the check.  Respondent also gave her \r\n  a post-dated check, drawn on the same account; however, Burgess was unable to \r\n  negotiate this check because respondentâ€™s accounts were frozen.\r\nThe Subpanel found respondent did not maintain his clientâ€™s funds in a trust \r\n  account and commingled the funds with other funds.  The Subpanel found respondent \r\n  entered into a business transaction with Burgess, the terms of which were not \r\n  fair and reasonable to the client and were not fully disclosed and transmitted \r\n  in writing in a manner that the client could reasonably understand.  Further, \r\n  respondent failed to give his client a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice \r\n  of independent counsel regarding this transaction.\r\nThe Subpanel concluded that respondent had violated the following rules of \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.4 (communication), Rule 1.5 (fees), Rule 1.8 (prohibited \r\n  transactions), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), Rule 2.1 (advisor), and Rule \r\n  8.4 (misconduct).\r\nFred Howard Matter\r\nRespondent represented Fred Howard in a workersâ€™ compensation matter.  During \r\n  the course of representation, Howard received payments, routed through respondentâ€™s \r\n  office, from an insurance company.    \r\nIn October 1998, the insurance company issued a check in the amount of $6,101.21 \r\n  payable to Howard.  Respondent allegedly forged his clientâ€™s name to the check.  \r\n  SLED Agent Joyce A. Lauterbach testified that, in her expert opinion, respondent \r\n  â€œprobably wroteâ€ Howardâ€™s name to the check.  In determining whether a signature \r\n  was written by the actual person, the highest degree of certainty is identification, \r\n  the second is highly probably, the third probable, the fourth is indications, \r\n  and the fifth is no conclusion.  Therefore, the possibility respondent forged \r\n  Howardâ€™s name was in the median range.\r\nRespondent testified he saw Howard at a gas station and happened to have his \r\n  checks with him.  Respondent gave a $265 check and the $6,101 check to Howard \r\n  to sign.  He told Howard he needed the check for the larger amount back because \r\n  his attorneyâ€™s fee had not been paid out of the settlement yet.  Respondent \r\n  left the checks with Howard while he paid for his gas, and, therefore, did not \r\n  see Howard sign the check.  He retrieved the check that had already been placed \r\n  back in its envelope from Howard, who indicated respondent could mail the balance \r\n  from the check to him later.  Respondent stated he did not forge Howardâ€™s name \r\n  to the check.\r\nThe Subpanel found that Howard did not endorse the check.  However, \r\n  the Subpanel found the evidence was not clear and convincing that respondent \r\n  signed Howardâ€™s name to the check or caused another to do so. \r\n  [5]   The Subpanel found the check was deposited into respondentâ€™s Special \r\n  Account, which was not a proper trust account and was commingled with respondentâ€™s \r\n  funds and others.  By November 4th, that account had a negative balance \r\n  and no intervening disbursements had been made to Howard. \r\nThe Subpanel concluded that respondent had violated the following rules of \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (competence), [6]  Rule 1.3 (diligence), Rule 1.4 \r\n  (communication), Rule 1.5 (fees), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), and Rule \r\n  8.4 (misconduct). \r\nErnest and Edna Galloway Matter\r\nErnest Galloway was 89 years old at the time this matter arose. [7]   He maintained an investment account, through \r\n  MFS/Sun Life of Canada (hereinafter referred to as Sun Life), in his wifeâ€™s \r\n  name with a balance of approximately $100,000. \r\nThe Galloways consulted respondent concerning their unhappiness with the amount \r\n  of income they were receiving from their investment.  Respondent suggested he \r\n  could borrow their funds and pay them $800 per month in interest.  As a result, \r\n  the Galloways cashed in the Sun Life account and delivered a $94,625.11 check \r\n  to respondent.  The Galloways incurred a Sun Life surrender charge of $5,067.33.\r\nRespondent executed a handwritten document acknowledging receipt of the check, \r\n  and promising to return the principal plus 10.2% interest payable monthly at \r\n  the rate of $800 per month.  Respondent indicated he entered into the agreement, \r\n  which he acknowledged was an extremely unwise thing to do, in an effort to alleviate \r\n  some of his financial problems.\r\nThe Subpanel found respondent entered into a business transaction with his \r\n  client. [8]   The Subpanel found the terms \r\n  on which respondent acquired his interest were not fair and reasonable to the \r\n  client, and were not fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner \r\n  in which the client could understand.  Further, respondent failed to give his \r\n  client a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel regarding \r\n  the transaction.\r\nRespondent used the Gallowaysâ€™ check to open his Warlick Law Office \r\n  Special Account at Greenville National Bank on September 23, 1998.  After depositing \r\n  those funds, the balance never again rose above the amount of the check.  By \r\n  October 1, 1998, the Special Account balance dropped to about $7,000.  From \r\n  September 23rd through October 1st, no funds were issued \r\n  from that account to the Galloways.\r\nRespondent paid what he described as â€œloan paymentsâ€ to the Galloways, \r\n  in the initial amount of $400 and two subsequent $800 payments, all in cash.  \r\n  Thereafter, he made five payments, two of which were drawn from the Special \r\n  Account, one drawn on an operating account at BB&amp;T, one drawn on respondentâ€™s \r\n  wifeâ€™s account, and one drawn on respondentâ€™s motherâ€™s account. \r\nWhen the Galloways learned respondent had been placed on interim suspension, \r\n  they expressed concerns to respondent about the loan.  Respondent delivered \r\n  a mortgage on property owned by him in Pickens County to the Galloways.  Respondent \r\n  did not record this mortgage and it had not been recorded as of March 25, 1999.  \r\n  At that time, there were three other mortgages on record against the same property.  \r\n  This property was eventually foreclosed upon and the Galloways did not receive \r\n  any money from that sale. \r\nIn an effort to assure the Galloways their money would be repaid, \r\n  respondent also delivered to them an Assignment, dated March 9, 1999.  In this \r\n  document, respondent transferred to the Galloways his anticipated fees from \r\n  a workers compensation case, Stanley Dockins v. English Homes.\r\nThe Subpanel concluded that respondent had violated the following \r\n  rules of Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.4 (communication), Rule 1.8 (prohibited transactions), \r\n  Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), Rule 2.1 (advisor), and Rule 8.4 (misconduct). \r\n\r\nKathleen Kimbrough Matter\r\nKathleen Kimbrough came to respondent on February 6, 1999, the day \r\n  after he had been placed on interim suspension, about an urgent family court \r\n  matter.  Respondent informed Kimbrough â€œweâ€™ll need a retainer.â€  Kimbrough paid \r\n  $100 to be applied towards her legal fee.  Respondent admitted he did not advise \r\n  her he had been placed on interim suspension.  He left the $100 he received \r\n  from her for an associate with notes concerning the problem.\r\nThe Subpanel found respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law in violation of Rule 5.5 of Rule 407, SCACR.  The Subpanel also found \r\n  he had violated Rule 8.4 of Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nShirley Weaver Matter\r\nRespondent represented Grady Gillespie on a criminal matter.  Respondent \r\n  was paid $3,500 in legal fees.\r\nGrady Gillespieâ€™s brother-in-law, Cecil A. Weaver, Jr., came to respondentâ€™s \r\n  office on February 6, 1999, without an appointment, while respondent was clearing \r\n  out his office after being informed of his interim suspension on February 5th.  \r\n  Weaver left some court documents with respondent that Gillespie had received.  \r\n  One document involved the signing up for a drug, alcohol abuse, and sexual predator \r\n  program, and the other document indicated Gillespie should appear in court on \r\n  February 24, 1999.  Regarding the rehabilitation program, Weaver testified respondent \r\n  told him Gillespie should show cooperation and attend it.  As for the court \r\n  hearing, Weaver testified respondent stated he would be at the hearing.  He \r\n  further stated that respondent did not tell him he had been suspended from the \r\n  practice of law.\r\nRespondent acknowledged receiving the documents and testified he \r\n  told Weaver that someone would meet Gillespie at a court hearing.  Respondent \r\n  testified that he then left the documents for an associate.  Respondent admitted \r\n  he did not inform Weaver that he had been placed on interim suspension.\r\nThe Subpanel found respondent had engaged in the practice of law \r\n  after being suspended.  The Subpanel concluded that respondent had violated \r\n  the following rules of Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 5.5 (unauthorized practice of \r\n  law) and Rule 8.4 (misconduct).\r\nBrenda Gail Alexander Matter\r\nBrenda Alexander and her husband retained respondent to sue the Toyota \r\n  Company because of a problem with their truck.  Respondent prepared a settlement \r\n  statement, showing a settlement of $25,000, less attorneyâ€™s fees, and also showing \r\n  a deduction for a State Farm lien.\r\nWhen the Alexanders retrieved their client file after respondentâ€™s \r\n  suspension, they discovered a $5,000 check from respondent to State Farm.  As \r\n  a result, there remained $7,500 due them from their settlement.\r\nThe Subpanel found respondent failed to return the $7,500 to the \r\n  Alexanders and failed to make an accounting to the Alexanders as to how the \r\n  $7,500 was applied.  Respondent testified the $7,500 which he did not return \r\n  to the Alexanders was kept by him as a retainer on another case which he was \r\n  handling for Mrs. Alexander.  The Subpanel found there was no documentation \r\n  to substantiate respondentâ€™s testimony.\r\nThe Subpanel found respondent failed to maintain the Alexandersâ€™ \r\n  settlement check in a proper trust account and commingled the funds with his \r\n  own funds and the funds of others.  Respondent admitted he did not maintain \r\n  a proper trust account.  The Subpanel concluded that respondent had violated \r\n  the following rules of Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.4 (communications), Rule 1.5 \r\n  (fees), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), and Rule 8.4 (misconduct).\r\nLaazora Hutchins Matter\r\nRespondent represented Clyde and Laazora Hutchins in a civil action, \r\n  filed November 20, 1998, in the Pickens County Court of Common Pleas.  The allegations \r\n  were that the defendants had agreed to sell real estate to the Hutchins, that \r\n  the Hutchins had placed a deposit of $250 on the sale, and the defendants had \r\n  failed to complete the sale.  The purchase price for the real estate was $15,000.\r\nPrior to filing suit, respondent requested $14,750 from Mrs. Hutchins, \r\n  promising to use those funds to complete the real estate transaction within \r\n  a short time.  On September 8, 1998, Mrs. Hutchins provided a cashierâ€™s check \r\n  to respondent in the amount of $14,750.  When no action was taken, Mrs. Hutchins \r\n  spoke with respondent.  In response, he gave her a signed written document, \r\n  dated October 17, 1998, acknowledging receipt of the money, which he was holding \r\n  pursuant to the pending suit.  Respondent represented to Mrs. Hutchins that \r\n  the $14,750 was earning interest for her at the annual rate of seven percent \r\n  and would be used for the purchase of the real estate or returned to her within \r\n  sixty days.  The funds were not returned within sixty days.\r\nRespondent provided a check, drawn on his wifeâ€™s BB&amp;T bank account \r\n  and dated February 20, 1999, to Mrs. Hutchins in the amount of $15,750.  He \r\n  represented to Mrs. Hutchins that the check represented her original $14,750 \r\n  plus $1,000 â€œinterest.â€  This check was returned for insufficient funds and \r\n  Mrs. Hutchinsâ€™ personal bank account was debited and resulted in her incurring \r\n  a service charge.\r\nThe Subpanel found the funds that respondent attempted to deliver \r\n  to Mrs. Hutchins were not her funds.  Further, the Subpanel found respondent \r\n  did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law by attempting to make restitution \r\n  to Hutchins by delivering a check to her on February 20, 1999.  However, the \r\n  Subpanel concluded respondent violated the following rules of Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), and Rule 8.4 (misconduct). \r\n\r\nRobert E. Belt Matter\r\nRobert Belt and his wife operated a plumbing company.  ProSource, \r\n  Inc., a plumbing supply house, received a judgment against the Belts for about \r\n  $21,000.  The Belts hired respondent to attempt to reduce the judgment so that \r\n  it could be paid.  Respondent informed the Belts he had negotiated the judgment \r\n  down to $12,000.\r\nThe Belts paid respondent $12,000 to be given to ProSource to satisfy \r\n  the judgment.  The money was delivered by a $2,000 check, a $8,000 check, and \r\n  by $2,000 cash by August 31, 1998.  Respondent did not conclude the Belt matter \r\n  with the adverse party prior to his interim suspension.  A review of respondentâ€™s \r\n  BB&amp;T bank statements and Greenville National Bank statements showed that \r\n  respondent had not deposited the Beltsâ€™ money in either of those accounts.  \r\n  The Subpanel found respondent did not maintain the $12,000 in a proper trust \r\n  account and commingled the funds with his own funds and that of others.\r\nThe Subpanel concluded that respondent had violated the following \r\n  rules of Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.3 (communication), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping \r\n  property), and Rule 8.4 (a) - (e) (misconduct). \r\nEric V. Yule Matter\r\nThe Yules hired respondent to represent them in a motor vehicle accident \r\n  case.  Mrs. Yule sought counseling as a result of the accident.  The counselor \r\n  recommended Mrs. Yule keep a journal of her activities and details relating \r\n  to the accident and the effect it had on her.\r\nWhen Mrs. Yule was deposed, respondent and defense counsel learned \r\n  of her journal.  It was agreed during the deposition that a copy of the journal \r\n  would be provided to defense counsel.  Respondent did not read Mrs. Yuleâ€™s journal \r\n  prior to turning it over to defense counsel.  He testified he did not realize \r\n  there was sensitive material in the journal and that Mrs. Yule did not forbid \r\n  him to turn over the original journal.  \r\nThe Subpanel noted it had been contended the journal contained personal \r\n  information, unrelated to the accident, which should not have been disclosed \r\n  to defense counsel.  It was further contended that Mrs. Yule did not want the \r\n  original journal turned over.  However, after reviewing the evidence presented \r\n  and Mr. Yuleâ€™s testimony, the Subpanel concluded that both Mr. and Mrs. Yule \r\n  understood, or were at least aware, that a copy of the entire journal would \r\n  be disclosed to opposing counsel.\r\nThe Subpanel found insufficient evidence to conclude respondent committed \r\n  misconduct regarding the journal or that he made false representations to his \r\n  client about possible settlement offers.  Therefore, the Subpanel recommended \r\n  the merits of this matter be dismissed.  However, the Subpanel found respondent \r\n  failed to reply to two inquiry letters from the Commission on Lawyer Conduct \r\n  regarding this matter in violation of Rule 8.1(b) of Rule 407, SCACR. \r\nSuzanne Amos Glymph Matter\r\nDuring the time this matter arose, Brian K. James was an attorney \r\n  working out of respondentâ€™s office.  James represented Suzanne Amos Glymph in \r\n  a workersâ€™ compensation case.  The case was settled on November 1, 1998, for \r\n  $16,500.  After attorneyâ€™s fees, the balance due to Glymph was $12,238.25.  \r\n  Respondent deposited the settlement check into the Special Account on November \r\n  16, 1998.\r\nAfter the deposit of Glymphâ€™s funds, the balance in the account dropped \r\n  to $322 by November 30th.  No disbursement was made to Glymph in \r\n  the intervening time.  As admitted by respondent, the Subpanel found he failed \r\n  to maintain the settlement funds in a proper trust account and commingled the \r\n  funds with his own funds and that of others.\r\nOn December 4, 1998, respondent wrote a check from the Special Account, \r\n  payable to Glymph, in the amount of $12,380.25, representing the proceeds from \r\n  her settlement.  The source of those funds, however, was not from her funds.\r\nThe Subpanel noted it was alleged that respondent forged Glymphâ€™s \r\n  and Brian Jamesâ€™s signatures to the settlement check.  Agent Joyce A. Lauterbach \r\n  testified that she was unable to reach a conclusion as to whether respondent \r\n  forged Brian Jamesâ€™s signature; however, she concluded that respondent â€œprobably \r\n  wrote the . . . Glymph signature.â€  Brian James testified he did not sign the \r\n  back of Glymphâ€™s settlement check and that he did not give respondent permission \r\n  to do so.  Glymph testified she never saw nor signed the original settlement \r\n  check, and that she did not authorize anyone to sign her name to the check.\r\nThe Subpanel stated that, after careful consideration of the expert testimony \r\n  presented by Agent Lauterbach, it was unable to conclude by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence that respondent committed forgery.  However, the Subpanel concluded \r\n  respondent had violated the following rules of Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.15 (safekeeping \r\n  property) and Rule 8.4 (misconduct).\r\nDisciplinary Counsel Matter\r\nRespondent drafted wills for two clients.  In these wills, respondent \r\n  designated himself as Personal Representative, without the necessity of securing \r\n  a bond, and as Trustee.  Respondent did not disclose any potential conflict \r\n  of interest, nor did he seek any waiver from the clients regarding any potential \r\n  conflict.  The Subpanel found that respondent violated Rule 1.7 (conflict of \r\n  interest).\r\nThe full Panel adopted the Subpanelâ€™s report.&nbsp;  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Panel found, with regard to most of the matters, violations of \r\n  Rule 8.4, misconduct.  The Panel further found violations of the following:  \r\n  (1) Rule 1.1, competent representation (one violation); (2) Rule 1.3, diligence \r\n  (two violations); (3) Rule 1.4, communication (four violations); (4) Rule 1.5, \r\n  fees (three violations); (5) Rule 1.7, conflict of interest (one violation); \r\n  (6) Rule 1.8, prohibited transactions (two violations); (7) Rule 1.15, safekeeping \r\n  property (seventeen violations); (8) Rule 2.1, advisor (two violations); (9) \r\n  Rule 5.5, unauthorized practice of law (two violations); and (10) Rule 8.1(b), \r\n  failure to respond to a demand from a disciplinary authority (one violation).  \r\n  The Panel recommended disbarment.\r\nFurther, although the Panel did not so find, we find respondent has \r\n  violated the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule \r\n  7(a)(1) (violating Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice or to bring courts or \r\n  legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice \r\n  law). \r\nIn determining the appropriate punishment, we look to the punishment \r\n  given to other attorneys for similar behavior.  In re Larkin, \r\n  336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).  We do not regard financial misconduct \r\n  lightly, particularly when such misconduct concerns expenditure of client funds \r\n  or other improper use of trust funds.  In re McMillan, \r\n  327 S.C. 98, 490 S.E.2d 1 (1997).\r\nIn light of respondentâ€™s egregious misconduct, we find the Panel \r\n  correctly concluded he should be disbarred.  The Court has deemed disbarment \r\n  the appropriate sanction in similar cases involving financial misconduct.  See \r\n  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 539 S.E.2d 396 (2000) (disbarment \r\n  for mishandling of trust account, commingling of funds, and use of trust accounts \r\n  in check kiting scheme); In re Miller, 328 S.C. 283, 494 \r\n  S.E.2d 120 (1997) (disbarment for repeated instances of misconduct regarding \r\n  client funds); In re McMillan, supra (disbarment \r\n  for using client trust funds and settlement proceeds for personal expenses and \r\n  law firm operating expenses, and for failing to cooperate with disciplinary \r\n  board); In re Hendricks, 319 S.C. 465, 462 S.E.2d 286 (1995) \r\n  (disbarment for misappropriating funds, neglecting client matters, and practicing \r\n  law while under suspension); In re Bowers, 303 S.C. 282, \r\n  400 S.E.2d 134 (1991) (disbarment for misappropriating funds to invest in future \r\n  trading options).  Here, respondent committed financial misconduct in several \r\n  matters, practiced law while under suspension, and involved himself in financial \r\n  transactions with his clients.\r\nConsequently, we disbar respondent, effective as of the date of this opinion, \r\n  and order him to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.  We also order \r\n  respondent to make restitution to all injured parties, including clients and \r\n  the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  shall determine the amount of restitution and implement a plan for restitution. [9]   Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, \r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has \r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his \r\n  Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n DISBARRED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Respondent \r\n    was placed on interim suspension on February 5, 1999.  In re Warlick, \r\n    334 S.C. 243, 513 S.E.2d 352 (1999).  Previously, respondent was indefinitely \r\n    suspended from the practice of law based on his conviction of contempt in \r\n    federal court.  In re Warlick, 287 S.C. 380, 339 S.E.2d \r\n    110 (1986).  See also United States v. Warlick, 742 F.2d 113 \r\n    (4th Cir. 1984).  He was later readmitted.  In re Warlick, \r\n    296 S.C. 350, 372 S.E.2d 910 (1988).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Upon \r\n    motion of the prosecutor, three matters were dismissed for lack of evidence.  \r\n    After the hearing, the Subpanel dismissed four matters and portions of five \r\n    different matters for lack of evidence.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Respondent \r\n    used the Special Account for a variety of purposes, including the processing \r\n    of client funds, bills, family expenses, and the payment of operating expenses.  \r\n    The account was not a trust account.  The Special Account was opened with \r\n    funds received from a client, Ernest Galloway (see Ernest and Edna Galloway \r\n    Matter infra), through an initial deposit on September 23, 1998, of \r\n    $94,625.11.  This account dropped to a negative balance on November 4, 1998.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] In \r\n    ten matters, respondentâ€™s only rule violations were Rules 1.15 and 8.4.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Following \r\n    the hearing, respondent was tried and acquitted of forgery.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] We \r\n    disagree with the Subpanelâ€™s finding that respondent violated Rule 1.1, which \r\n    states â€œ[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.  Competent \r\n    representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation \r\n    reasonably necessary for representation.â€  Nowhere was it alleged or proven \r\n    that respondent did not provide Howard competent representation in his workersâ€™ \r\n    compensation case. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Mr. \r\n    Galloway passed away on June 26, 1999. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] Respondentâ€™s \r\n    office had represented Mr. Galloway in the past. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9] In \r\n    determining a restitution plan, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel shall give \r\n    priority to Mrs. Burgess and Mrs. Galloway.  Further, the amount owed Mrs. \r\n    Galloway shall include the $5,067.33 surrender charge the Galloways incurred \r\n    when the Sun Life account was cashed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25557","title":"In the Matter of Mariano Frank Cruz","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25557","description":"Opinion definately suspending attorney for a variety of violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct including failing to provide competent representation, and knowingly making false statemtns of material fact in connection with a disciplinary investigation.","date":"2002-11-12","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n25557\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-indent:1.0in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyText2\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent2\r\n\t{text-indent:.5in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      In the Matter of Mariano Frank Cruz,\r\n      Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25557\r\nSubmitted October 10, 2002 - Filed November \r\n  12, 2002\r\n\r\nDEFINITE\r\nSUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, \r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nRobert G. Price, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to \r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent conditionally \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension from the practice of \r\n  law for a period of eighteen months up to twenty-four months.  We accept the \r\n  agreement and suspend respondent for twenty-four months. [1]   The facts as admitted in the agreement are \r\n  as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.&nbsp; Matter A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn June 19, 1998, respondent was a partner in a law \r\n  firm with another lawyer (Lawyer).  During this time, the firm was retained \r\n  to represent Client for injuries sustained in an automobile accident.  Respondent \r\n  requested that Lawyer assist him with the case.  Lawyer negotiated a settlement \r\n  for the insurance company to pay the policy limits of $100,000.  \r\nOn July 21, 1999, respondent and Lawyer dissolved their \r\n  partnership.  Respondent then prepared, and had Client sign, a letter terminating \r\n  Lawyerâ€™s representation of Client.  Shortly thereafter, respondent contacted \r\n  the insurance company adjuster stating that he and Client would settle her claims \r\n  for the policy limits of $100,000 and sign mutual releases in exchange for a \r\n  check written to respondent and Client.  The adjuster subsequently sent a proposed \r\n  settlement agreement and a release of all claims to respondent.  Respondent \r\n  replied by writing on the adjusterâ€™s letter, â€œ I agree and consent to the above-listed \r\n  terms,â€ and signed the notation as â€œattorney for [Client].â€\r\nDespite the fact that she could not read, Client signed \r\n  the release on the advice of respondent.  Respondent did not read the release \r\n  to Client or explain the legal significance of its terms.  After executing the \r\n  release, respondent contacted another insurance company regarding underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage.  However, the company refused to settle because the company \r\n  and its insured had been released from all claims by the release signed by Client \r\n  on respondentâ€™s advice.  The release precluded Client from collecting underinsured \r\n  coverage of up to $30,000.\r\nFollowing the settlement of the claim, Lawyer filed \r\n  suit against respondent, another attorney, and Client alleging that respondent \r\n  failed to pay him his portion of the attorneyâ€™s fee generated by the settlement \r\n  of Clientâ€™s claim.  Respondent answered Lawyerâ€™s complaint on behalf of himself \r\n  and Client.  Since Client had a potential claim against respondent for his failure \r\n  to secure underinsured motorist coverage, respondentâ€™s answering the suit on \r\n  Clientâ€™s behalf was a conflict of interest.  Respondent failed to inform Client \r\n  of the conflict and the potential claim against him.  Respondent also failed \r\n  to advise Client to seek the advice of independent counsel.\r\nOn May 19, 2000, and May 20, 2000, attorneys representing \r\n  Lawyer wrote respondent raising concerns about the conflict of interest respondent \r\n  had in representing both Client and himself in the lawsuit.  Despite the receipt \r\n  of these two letters, respondent failed to advise Client of the conflict of \r\n  interest and failed to withdraw as her attorney.\r\nOn July 17, 2000, respondent was removed as counsel \r\n  for Client by order of the circuit court and Client was advised to retain independent \r\n  counsel.  Respondent and his associate refused to cooperate with Clientâ€™s new \r\n  counsel despite his repeated attempts to obtain Clientâ€™s file.\r\nDespite the fact that he had been removed from representation \r\n  of Client by order of the circuit court, on July 27, 2000, respondent prepared \r\n  and advised Client to sign a document entitled â€œRevocation of all Power of Attorneys.â€  \r\n  Client had previously executed a power of attorney in favor of her son.  Respondent \r\n  informed Client that he would file the document, but failed to do so. \r\nAlso on July 27, 2000, respondent prepared an affidavit \r\n  for Client to sign, that respondent intended to submit in support of his motion \r\n  for summary judgment in the lawsuit brought by Lawyer.  The affidavit stated \r\n  in part, â€œI am satisfied with the services of [respondent].  He negotiated my \r\n  hospital lien of $80,000 to $40,000.  Therefore, my portion of the settlement \r\n  is $35,000 after paying the lien.  I received more from the $100,000 than I \r\n  would have received from an additional $30,000 underinsured motorist, since \r\n  if I had recovered there, the hospital lien would not have been negotiated and \r\n  I would have to pay the hospital $80,000.â€  The affidavit further stated, â€œI \r\n  have ratified the General Release.â€\r\nThe affidavit was an attempt by respondent to relieve \r\n  himself of liability, both professional and financial, to Client.  Further, \r\n  respondent failed to explain the legal significance of the affidavit to Client \r\n  and failed to advise her to seek independent counsel prior to signing it.        \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Matter B\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Client in a wrongful \r\n  termination case.  Client paid respondent an initial retainer fee of $300, plus \r\n  $148 for the cost of a deposition.  Respondent filed the action in federal court.  \r\n  However, respondent did not notify Client that he would be leaving his practice \r\n  in South Carolina and relocating to North Carolina, and then California.  Respondent \r\n  failed to return telephone calls to Client and failed to communicate with her.  \r\n  Respondent closed his practice and subsequently moved without informing Client. \r\nRespondent failed to return Clientâ€™s file to her; however, \r\n  Client eventually obtained her file from respondentâ€™s assistant, who, while \r\n  licensed to practice law in California, was not licensed in South Carolina.  \r\n  Respondent had left his Client files with his assistant.\r\nRespondent also failed to move before the United States \r\n  District Court for leave to withdraw, or take any other action to protect Clientâ€™s \r\n  interests before leaving South Carolina. \r\nAfter receiving Clientâ€™s complaint, the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conduct wrote respondent on September 20, 2000, requesting a reply within 15 \r\n  days.  On October 12, 2000, respondent replied that he wanted to file an amended \r\n  reply after reviewing Clientâ€™s file.  On December 14, 2000, a Commission staff \r\n  attorney wrote respondent requesting additional information; however, respondent \r\n  did not submit the amended reply nor did he respond to the staff attorneyâ€™s \r\n  letter.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Matter C  \r\nClient and her husband retained respondent \r\n  to file a bankruptcy action in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District \r\n  of South Carolina.  On April 21, 2000, respondent filed a Chapter 7 action and \r\n  a trustee was appointed.  Respondent abandoned his law practice in South Carolina \r\n  and moved out of state without notifying Client and without taking steps to \r\n  protect Clientâ€™s interests in the bankruptcy proceeding.  Respondent also failed \r\n  to take the necessary steps to protect Clientâ€™s furniture.  Respondent failed \r\n  to reply to Clientâ€™s inquiries about the case and did not return Clientâ€™s file.  \r\n  On August 23, 2000, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order discharging the debtors \r\n  and the trustee and closing the case.  Respondent also left Clientâ€™s file with \r\n  his associate who was not licensed to practice law in South Carolina.\r\nAfter receiving Clientâ€™s complaint, the \r\n  Commission wrote to respondent on November 27, 2000, seeking a reply.  Respondent \r\n  did not respond.  The Commission sent respondent a second letter on January \r\n  9, 2001, again asking for a reply to the complaint and reminding respondent \r\n  that failure to cooperate with an investigation could constitute a violation \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Respondent did not reply.  On February \r\n  5, 2001, the Commission sent respondent a Notice of Full Investigation.  Respondent \r\n  still did not reply.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Matter D \r\nIn May 2000, Client, a resident of North \r\n  Carolina, hired respondent to bring a quiet title action involving property \r\n  she jointly owned in Myrtle Beach.  Client paid respondent a fee of $1,750, \r\n  by personal check, and signed the fee agreement respondent mailed to her.  Respondent \r\n  assured Client that the fee would be held in his trust account until earned \r\n  and that any unearned portion of the fee would be returned to her.\r\nRespondent failed to communicate with \r\n  Client after receiving his fee and failed to reply to her telephone calls regarding \r\n  the matter.  Respondent did not file the quiet title action nor take any other \r\n  action on Clientâ€™s behalf.  Respondent abandoned his law practice in South Carolina \r\n  and moved out of state without notifying Client.  Respondent failed to return \r\n  Clientâ€™s file to her or take appropriate steps to protect her interests when \r\n  he left South Carolina.\r\nClient eventually located respondent \r\n  in October 2000 and respondent assured her that he would refund a portion of \r\n  her money.  In November 2000, respondent mailed Client a check, drawn on his \r\n  wifeâ€™s account, in the amount of $1,000.  However, respondent stopped payment \r\n  on the check without notice or explanation to Client.\r\nRespondent failed to respond to letters \r\n  sent by the Commission on December 15, 2000 and January 9, 2001.  Respondent \r\n  also failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation sent by the Commission \r\n  on February 5, 2001.  Respondent also left Clientâ€™s file with his associate \r\n  who is not licensed to practice law in South Carolina.     \r\nV.&nbsp; Matter E\r\nIn May 1999, Client retained respondent \r\n  to represent him in a bankruptcy matter and paid him a fee.  At the time, Client \r\n  was at least two payments behind on his mortgage and expressed to respondent \r\n  that he did not want lose his home because it had belonged to his grandfather.  \r\n  However, respondent failed to advise Client that he should keep his mortgage \r\n  payments current.  Further, respondent failed to promptly file for relief from \r\n  the remaining debts.  During the delay, a foreclosure action was started against \r\n  Client.  Respondent received a settlement offer from the mortgage holder which \r\n  incorporated payment terms that Client could not make.  Respondent then filed \r\n  a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action.\r\nRespondent failed to communicate and \r\n  respond to all the inquires of Client during the representation.  As a result, \r\n  Client retained the services of attorney Lucy McDow, who converted the case \r\n  to Chapter 13.  Had this not been done, Client would have lost his home.  Respondent \r\n  also failed to answer a motion filed by the mortgage holder and did not move \r\n  for an extension of time to file the answer.  \r\nWhen Client terminated respondentâ€™s services, \r\n  respondent failed to provide a full refund of the attorneyâ€™s fees and did not \r\n  provide any accounting as to how the fee had been earned.  Respondent did tender \r\n  a check for $125, which included the following notation, â€œTermination of representation \r\n  full refund.â€  Attorney McDow returned the check to respondent with a request \r\n  that it be re-issued without the â€œfull refundâ€ language; however, respondent \r\n  refused.  McDow then filed a motion to refund excessive legal fee and respondent \r\n  filed a response in opposition to the motion.  The Bankruptcy Court issued a \r\n  consent order requiring respondent to refund $1,250 in attorneyâ€™s fees by paying \r\n  $75 per week to the Chapter 13 trustee.  Lawyer failed to make any payments, \r\n  and on August 30, 2000, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order finding respondent \r\n  in willful contempt of the courtâ€™s previous order, and required respondent to \r\n  purge himself of civil contempt by paying the entire $1,250 to the trustee within \r\n  seven days.  The order also required respondent to pay Clientâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  and costs of $470.70.        \r\nAfter receiving Clientâ€™s complaint, the \r\n  Commission wrote respondent on January 20, 2000, and respondent replied on March \r\n  2, 2000.  Thereafter, the Commission appointed attorney Robert S. Hudspeth, \r\n  Esquire, to conduct a preliminary investigation.  Mr. Hudspeth requested that \r\n  respondent provide him bank records relating to Clientâ€™s case, but respondent \r\n  failed to do so.  A notice of full investigation was authorized by the Commission \r\n  and mailed to respondentâ€™s Rock Hill address on September 13, 2000; however, \r\n  it was returned as undeliverable.  The notice was re-mailed on October 2, 2000, \r\n  to respondentâ€™s California address.  Respondent did not reply.\r\n  VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Cooperate with Investigation \r\n   \r\nAfter residing in California, respondent relocated to New \r\n  Jersey and wrote to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, requesting that all \r\n  future correspondence to him be forwarded to an address in Hackensack, New Jersey.  \r\n  On March 12, 2001, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel procured from the Commission \r\n  on Lawyer Conduct, a subpoena ducus tecum for five Client files and bank records.  \r\n  The subpoena was mailed to respondentâ€™s New Jersey address; however, respondent \r\n  failed to respond to the subpoena, and did not provide the documents that were \r\n  requested.  \r\nOn March 26, 2001, respondent wrote the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel, expressing a desire to discuss pending cases and to submit written \r\n  replies.  Thereafter, the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office sent copies of the notices \r\n  of full investigation and letters of complaint regarding pending cases to respondentâ€™s \r\n  New Jersey address.  Respondent did not respond.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that his conduct violated the following \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (failing to provide \r\n  competent representation); Rule 1.2 (failing to abide by the clientâ€™s decisions \r\n  concerning the objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (failing to act with \r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness while representing a client); Rule 1.4 (failing \r\n  to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and failing \r\n  to promptly comply with requests for information); Rule 1.7 (a lawyer shall \r\n  not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially \r\n  limited by the lawyer's own interests); Rule 1.9 (a lawyer who has formerly \r\n  represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person \r\n  in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests \r\n  are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former \r\n  client consents after consultation); Rule 1.15 (failing to keep clientsâ€™ funds \r\n  in a separate account and failing to keep records of such funds); Rule 1.16 \r\n  (failing to withdraw from representation when continued representation would \r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 2.1 (failing to exercise independent \r\n  professional judgment and render candid advice); Rule 3.2 (failing to make reasonable \r\n  efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); \r\n  Rule 8.1 (knowingly making false statements of material fact in connection with \r\n  a disciplinary investigation and failing to respond to a lawful demand for information \r\n  from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4, subsections (a) (violating the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); (c) (engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude); \r\n  and (e) (engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).  \r\n\r\nRespondent also admits that he violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a), subsections (1) (violating the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); (3) (willfully violating a valid order of the Supreme \r\n  Court, Commission or panels of the Commission in a proceeding under these rules, \r\n  willfully failing to appear personally as directed, willfully failing to comply \r\n  with a subpoena issued under these rules, and knowingly failing to respond to \r\n  a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); (5) (engaging in conduct prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice and bringing the courts and the legal profession \r\n  into disrepute); (6) (violating the oath of office taken to practice law in \r\n  this State); and (7) (willfully violating a court order issued by a court of \r\n  this state). \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a definite suspension.  Accordingly, \r\n  we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from \r\n  the practice of law for twenty-four months.  Within fifteen days of the date \r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court \r\n  showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent was placed on interim suspension by \r\n    order of this Court dated February 23, 2001.

Benjamin Aplin, all of South Carolina Department of Probation,\r\nParole and Pardon Services, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:   Appellant, Larry Dean Dawkins (\"Dawkins\"), appeals the circuit court's ruling that his probationary period does not begin to run until after\r\nhe successfully completes his community supervision program. \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nDawkins pled guilty to assault and battery with \r\n  intent to kill (\"ABIK\") on February 24, 1999. He was sentenced to five years, \r\n  suspended to five years probation upon service of two years. His sentence \r\n  began when he was arrested on November 16, 1998. As a condition of his sentence, \r\n  Dawkins was prohibited from having any contact with the victim or her family. \r\n  Further, Dawkins was required to pay restitution to the victim and \r\n  to spend six months in a Restitution Center (\"RC\") after his release.\r\n\r\n    In May 2000, the RC refused to accept Dawkins because his ABIK conviction constituted a violent offense.  As a result, the requirement that Dawkins spend six\r\nmonths at a RC was deleted.  On July 28, 2000, Dawkins was released from prison, after serving 620 days (85%) of his two year sentence, to a community supervision\r\nprogram (\"CSP\") pursuant to section 24-21-560 of the South Carolina Code. (1)  According to the terms of the CSP Certificate issued by the South Carolina Department\r\nof Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (\"Department\"), Dawkins was required to participate in the CSP for 2 years, until July 27, 2002. (2)  \r\n\r\nWithin the first month of his participation in the CSP, Dawkins violated the terms of the program.  Dawkins concedes he violated the terms of the CSP by failing to abide\r\nby the electronic monitoring rules, failing to report to his agent as instructed, and failing to follow the advice and instruction of his agent.  Specifically, Dawkins moved from\r\nhis approved residence without telling his CSP agent, left his approved residence while on home detention, and, finally, cut his electronic monitoring bracelet off of his\r\nankle and threw it away. \r\n\r\nAn administrative hearing was held by the Department on September 8, 2000 to address Dawkins' violations.  Based on the testimony of the  CSP agent and Dawkins'\r\nown admissions mentioned above, the hearing officer concluded that Dawkins' placement in the CSP should be revoked. \r\n\r\nOn October 30, 2000, the circuit court held a hearing to address the hearing officer's recommendation for revocation.  Again, Dawkins conceded he had committed the\r\nviolations, but argued that successful completion of the CSP would satisfy his original five year probation sentence.  The State contended, instead, that Dawkins' five year\r\nprobation sentence was distinct from the time he was required to spend in the CSP, and that his probation would begin when he  successfully completed the CSP. \r\nUltimately, the judge agreed with the State.  The judge sentenced Dawkins to 1 year in prison for his wilful violation of the terms of the CSP pursuant to section 24-21-560(C) of the South Carolina Code, and found that his probation period would be tolled until his release from the CSP. (3)  \r\n\r\nDawkins raised the following issue on appeal: (4)\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the circuit judge err in ruling that Dawkins' five-year probation sentence is tolled until he successfully completes the CSP?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nDawkins argues his five-year probation sentence is discharged upon successful completion of the CSP under section 24-21-560(E).\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 24-21-560(E) provides, \"[a] prisoner who successfully completes a [CSP] pursuant to this section has satisfied his sentence and must be\r\ndischarged from his sentence.\"  Dawkins argues his five years of probation are part of his \"sentence\" and, therefore, are discharged by successful completion of the\r\nCSP. (5)  Dawkins bases his appeal on this section 24-21-560(E) argument, and on the well-settled principle that penal statutes are to be strictly construed against the state\r\nand in favor of the defendant.  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991).  Dawkins' contends the most reasonable interpretation of the statute is that\r\nprobation and community supervision run concurrently, and that probation is discharged by completion of the CSP.  \r\n\r\nIn response, the State submits that the section 24-21-560(E) argument is not ripe for review as Dawkins has not completed the CSP. (6)  Additionally, the State argues that\r\nsection 24-21-560(E) must be read in conjunction with section 24-21-560(A), applying its definition of \"sentence.\"  Section A provides that \"any sentence for a 'no-parole offense' . . . must include any term of incarceration and completion of a [CSP]. . . .\"  Because the legislature did not mention probation in this definition, the State\r\nargues that probation is not part of the sentence that is discharged upon successful completion of the CSP.\r\n\r\nAs Dawkins points out, section 24-21-560 is penal, and should be construed strictly against the State.  Blackmon.  However, \"even though penal statutes are to be\r\nstrictly construed, 'the canons of construction certainly allow the court to consider the statute as a whole and to interpret its words in light of the context.'\"  Rorrer v. P. J.\r\nClub, Inc., 347 S.C. 560, 568, 556 S.E.2d 726, 730 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing State v. Standard Oil Co. of N.J., 195 S.C. 267, 288, 10 S.E.2d 778, 788 (1940)).  The\r\nCourt \"does not look merely at a particular clause in which a word may be used, but rather [should look] at the word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of\r\nthe whole statute, and in light of the object and policy of the law.\"  S.C. Coastal Council v. S.C. State Ethics Comm'n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, 410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991). \r\nFurther, the interpretation of a term within a statute \"should support the statute and should not lead to an absurd result.\"  Id. (citing Hamm v. S.C. P.S.C., 287 S.C. 180,\r\n336 S.E.2d 470 (1985)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, all parties agree the statutory scheme \r\n  is convoluted. Construing the statute against the State as we must, however, \r\n  we believe Part E mandates that the prisoner's entire sentence be discharged, \r\n  including any residual probation, after he completes the mandatory CSP. The \r\n  CSP is a more stringent, closely monitored form of supervision than normal probation. \r\n  Even considering Part E in the context of the statute as a whole, we believe \r\n  the legislature intended mandatory participation in the CSP to serve as a more \r\n  rigorous term of probation for those convicted of no-parole offenses, in lieu \r\n  of normal probation. Accordingly, Dawkins' sentence, including probation, is \r\n  discharged upon successful completion of the CSP.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the circuit court's ruling to the extent that it held Dawkins' probation is tolled during his participation in the CSP. \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A) (Supp. 1998).  This section provides, in part: \r\n\r\n[A]ny sentence for a \"no parole offense\" as defined in Section 24-13-100 must include any term of incarceration and completion of a [CSP] operated by the Department\r\n. . . .  No prisoner who is serving a sentence for a \"no parole offense\" is eligible to participate in a [CSP] until he has served the minimum period of incarceration as set\r\nforth in Section 24-13-150.\r\n\r\nABIK is a no parole offense for which a prisoner must serve at least 85% of his sentence under South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-150 before participating in a CSP.    \r\n2. Section 24-21-560(B) gives the Department discretion to set the period of time and the terms and conditions of a prisoner's CSP based on guidelines developed by the\r\nDirector of the Department, but limits the amount of time a prisoner can spend in a CSP to two continuous years.  \"A [CSP] . . . must last no more than two continuous\r\nyears.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(B) (Supp. 1998).  \r\n3. Section 24-21-560(C) provides: \r\n\r\n  If the court determines that a prisoner has wilfully violated a term or condition of the [CSP], the court may impose any other terms or conditions considered appropriate\r\nand may continue the prisoner on community supervision, or the court may revoke the prisoner's community supervision and impose a sentence of up to one year for\r\nviolation of the [CSP].  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(C) (Supp. 1998).\r\n4. This case was set to be argued before the Court of Appeals, but after the parties filed their briefs, it was transferred to this Court.\r\n5. The record does not indicate that Dawkins has completed his CSP successfully.  As discussed, Dawkins' CSP was revoked and he was sentenced to one year of\r\nimprisonment in August of 2000 because he violated the terms of his CSP.  The record provides no further information regarding Dawkins' current status.\r\n6. The State argues that Dawkins' argument is not ripe because he has not completed the CSP yet, which is a condition to discharge under section 24-21-560(E). \r\nAlthough it is a condition of discharge, we believe the question is ripe now because Dawkins will eventually complete the CSP, and the judge who revoked his CSP in\r\nAugust 2000 included an order that his probation be tolled during his participation in the CSP.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25559","title":"Elledge v.

Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, 341 S.C.\r\n473, 534 S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. 2000).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1994, nine-year-old Ginger Sierra (Ginger) slipped and fell on a piece of playground equipment at Irmo Elementary School where she attended fourth\r\ngrade.  The playground equipment was a metal monkey bar device which the children walked upon; it extended above the ground approximately two feet.  As a result of\r\nthe fall, Ginger broke her right leg.  The growth plate in that leg was significantly damaged, and Ginger eventually underwent surgery in both legs to remove the growth\r\nplates. (1)\r\n\r\nGinger and her mother, Christine Elledge (collectively respondents), sued petitioner Richland/Lexington School District Five (the District) for negligence.  A jury returned a\r\nverdict for the District.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.\r\n  Elledge, supra.\r\n\r\nAt trial, James Shirley, the principal at Irmo Elementary since 1990, testified that shortly after he arrived at the school, he had concerns about the school's playground.  He\r\nwas especially concerned by the lack of a fall surface and by the height of some of the playground equipment.  As to the monkey bar which Ginger fell on, Shirley stated\r\nthat children had been walking on it and this was also a concern.  In 1991, Shirley contacted Jim Mosteller who redesigned the playground.  As part of the playground\r\nrenovations, the monkey bar which Ginger fell on was modified by Mosteller.  Originally, the monkey bar was higher and had a bench underneath it.  As part of the\r\nmodifications performed in 1991, the height was lowered from about four feet to two feet, and the bench was removed.  On the modified monkey bar, students would\r\nwalk or crawl across it, although there were no hand-held supports on the side.  Shirley testified that he knew the children were walking across the apparatus after the\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nBoth of respondents' playground safety experts testified that the monkey bar was, in its original form, designed to develop children's upper body strength.  Archibald\r\nHardy stated that this piece of equipment was known as a \"pull and slide\" and the children were supposed to lie back on the bench underneath the bars and pull\r\nthemselves along the apparatus.  According to Hardy, the original design \"definitely wasn't for walking\" because the metal rungs were small enough for children's hands\r\nand were \"fairly slick.\"  The modification to the equipment encouraged children to \"run up and jump on top of it;\" however, Hardy stated that children \"shouldn't have\r\nbeen playing on top of it at all.\"  Hardy, who sold to and installed playground equipment for Irmo Elementary, had visited the playground on several occasions since 1992,\r\nand had recommended to Shirley that all the older equipment on the playground be \"bulldozed.\"\r\n\r\nSteven Bernheim, respondents' other expert, similarly testified about the equipment and stated that it \"was not meant as a climber.\"  According to Bernheim, the\r\nequipment was safe as originally designed, but in its modified form, it was unsafe because the narrow bars were originally designed for hands, not feet, and no grit had\r\nbeen placed on the metal bars to prevent slipping.  \r\n\r\nBernheim stated generally that the playground at Irmo Elementary did not meet the proper safety standards in the industry.  Respondents sought, however, to introduce\r\nspecific evidence regarding the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) guidelines for playground safety and the American Society for Testing and Materials\r\n(ASTM) standards for playground equipment.  The trial court granted the District's motion in limine to exclude this evidence.  At trial, respondents argued that this\r\nevidence was relevant to establishing the District's common law duty of care.  The trial court found the evidence inadmissible because the guidelines were not \"binding\" on\r\nthe District and the District had not \"adopted\" them in any way.\r\n\r\nRespondents proffered the following evidence.  Bernheim would have testified that in 1994, when Ginger fell, the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards were in effect\r\nand would have applied to \"any group . . . utilizing the playground equipment for public use,\" including a school district.  He stated that these guidelines are industry\r\nstandards and are distributed to schools via superintendents' or principals' meetings.  Significantly, Bernheim opined that the District should have had policies and\r\nprocedures in place for retrofitting existing equipment so that it complied with the guidelines.  Furthermore, Bernheim believed the modified monkey bar did not comply\r\nwith the national guidelines because there were no handrails and no grit on the walking surface.  According to Bernheim, because Ginger's injury involved getting caught in\r\nan entrapment between the ladder areas, it was the type of injury the guidelines are designed to prevent.  While Bernheim acknowledged that the industry standards were\r\nguidelines only, he stated they are what the playground equipment industry \"stands by.\"\r\n\r\nRespondents also proffered testimony from the District's purchasing coordinator, Joe Tommie.  According to Tommie, the District would specify in its bids for purchasing\r\nnew playground equipment that the equipment must meet the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards.  He stated:  \"That's normally the standard we use to ensure that we\r\npurchase safe equipment.\" (2)\r\n\r\nOn appeal, respondents argued the exclusion of this evidence was prejudicial error.  The Court of Appeals agreed.  Stating that \"[e]vidence of industry standards,\r\ncustoms, and practices is 'often highly probative when defining a standard of care,'\" the Court of Appeals held the trial court erred by excluding evidence of the CPSC\r\nguidelines and ASTM standards.  Elledge, 341 S.C. at 477, 534 S.E.2d at 290-91 (citation omitted).  The Court of Appeals found the trial court was under \"the mistaken\r\nbelief that the District must have adopted these national protocols before such evidence was admissible. . . . [W]hile such proof might be necessary in attempting to\r\nestablish negligence per se, it is not required when the evidence is offered to demonstrate an applicable standard of care.\"  Id. at 478, 534 S.E.2d at 291.  As to the\r\nDistrict's argument there was no prejudice from any error, the Court of Appeals stated that the \"exclusion of this testimony was clearly prejudicial since such evidence\r\nwould tend to show the District's compliance with industry standards, which directly conflicts with the District's assertion that such standards were never recognized.\"  Id.\r\nat 480, 534 S.E.2d at 292.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals correctly decide that the trial court's exclusion of the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards evidence was reversible error?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe District argues that the trial court correctly excluded the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards evidence.  Specifically, the District maintains respondents failed to\r\nestablish that these guidelines were accepted and used by school districts in South Carolina to determine the safety of existing playground equipment.  In addition, the\r\nDistrict contends that even if the trial court erred, the error was not prejudicial.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nTo establish a cause of action in negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following three elements:  (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff;  (2) breach of that duty\r\nby a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.\r\n  E.g., Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d 710 (2000).  Evidence\r\nis relevant and admissible if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\nthan it would be without the evidence.  Rules 401, 402, SCRE.  It is well settled that the admission and rejection of testimony is largely within the trial court's sound\r\ndiscretion, the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\r\n  E.g., Pike v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234,\r\n540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000).  \r\n\r\nIn our opinion, respondents' proffered evidence was relevant to, and admissible on, the first required element of negligence - the District's duty of care to respondents.\r\n \r\nSee Bloom v. Ravoira, supra; Rules 401, 402, SCRE.  We agree with Chief Judge Hearn's observation that the trial court was under \"the mistaken belief that the District\r\nmust have adopted these national protocols before such evidence was admissible.\"  Elledge, 341 S.C. at 478, 534 S.E.2d at 291.\r\n\r\nAs recognized by the Court of Appeals, the general rule is that evidence of industry safety standards is relevant to establishing the standard of care in a negligence case.\r\n \r\nSee, e.g., McComish v. DeSoi, 200 A.2d 116, 120-21 (N.J. 1964) (holding that construction safety manuals and codes were properly admitted as objective standards of\r\nsafe construction); Walheim v. Kirkpatrick, 451 A.2d 1033, 1034-35 (Pa. Super. 1982) (holding that safety standards regarding the safe design and use of trampolines,\r\nincluding ASTM standards, were admissible on the issue of the defendants' negligence, even though the defendants were unaware of the standards); Stone v. United\r\nEng'g, 475 S.E.2d 439, 453-55 (W.Va. 1996) (no error to admit evidence of safety standards for the design and guarding of conveyors even though the standards had\r\nnot been imposed by statute and did not have \"the force of law\");  see generally  Daniel E. Feld, Annotation, Admissibility in Evidence, on Issue of Negligence, of\r\nCodes or Standards of Safety Issued or Sponsored by Governmental Body or by Voluntary Association, 58 A.L.R.3d 148, 154 (1974) (modern trend is to admit\r\nsafety codes on the issue of negligence).  This kind of evidence is admitted not because it has \"the force of law,\" but rather as \"illustrative evidence of safety practices or\r\nrules generally prevailing in the industry.\"  McComish v. DeSoi, 200 A.2d at 121.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the District even acknowledges this is the general rule.  Respondents' expert, Bernheim, laid an adequate foundation for the admission of these safety standards\r\nwhen he stated they:  (1) were in effect at the time of Ginger's accident, (3) and (2) would have applied to any group using playground equipment for public use, including a\r\nschool district.  Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly held that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards. \r\n\r\nThe District, however, argues this evidence was inadmissible because respondents did not show that school districts generally accepted or followed the guidelines with\r\nregard to existing playground equipment. (4)  We find this argument completely unavailing.  Since the evidence showed the District followed the CPSC guidelines when\r\npurchasing new playground equipment, and the guidelines are intended for general playground safety which logically includes the maintenance of existing playground\r\nequipment, the District's contention that the safety standards somehow did not apply to it on existing equipment is simply untenable.  It is clear to us that a public school is\r\nexactly the type of entity to which the public playground safety guidelines should, and do, apply.  Simply because the District did not utilize the guidelines in 1994 with\r\nregard to existing equipment does not mean that it should not have. (5)\r\n\r\nWe find this evidence is highly probative on the issue of defining the District's duty of care.  Rules 401, 402, SCRE (evidence is relevant and admissible if it has any\r\ntendency to make the existence of any fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence);\r\n see also Elledge, 341 S.C. at 477,\r\n534 S.E.2d at 290 (\"Evidence of industry standards, customs, and practices is 'often highly probative when defining a standard of care.'\") (quoting 57A Am.Jur.2d\r\nNegligence Â§ 185 (1999)).  Consequently, we hold the trial court abused its discretion by excluding this evidence. (6)\r\n\r\nThe District further argues that any error made by the trial court did not result in prejudice to respondents.  The District contends that the evidence was cumulative to the\r\nadmitted testimony of respondents' experts and the expert testimony was limited only by excluding specific references to the safety standards.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nEvidence of objective safety standards is generally offered \"in connection with expert testimony which identifies it as illustrative evidence of  safety practices or rules\r\ngenerally prevailing in the industry, and as such it provides support for the opinion of the expert concerning the proper standard of care.\"  McComish v. DeSoi, 200 A.2d\r\nat 121 (emphasis added);  see also Brown v. Clark Equip. Co., 618 P.2d 267, 276 (Haw. 1980) (evidence of safety codes is \"admissible as an alternative to or utilized to\r\nbuttress expert testimony\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nRespondents sought to introduce evidence of industry standards to identify and establish the duty of care owed by the District to respondents.  According to respondents'\r\nexpert, the modified monkey bar did not comply with the guidelines.  According to the District's purchasing coordinator, the District utilized the guidelines to ensure the\r\nsafety of new equipment purchases.  The import of the expert's evidence is clear.  Respondents sought to show that the same standards that were used to purchase safe\r\nnew equipment, should have been used to safely modify and/or maintain the existing equipment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this type of evidence constitutes an objective standard and as such would have greatly enhanced the opinions offered by respondents' experts.  We\r\ntherefore disagree with the District's argument that the evidence would have been cumulative to the experts' testimony.  One of the main purposes of industry standard\r\nevidence is to provide support for an expert's opinion on what the applicable standard of care is, and thus, the evidence is not merely cumulative to the expert's testimony.\r\n \r\nSee id.    \r\n\r\nIn addition, we note that the bulk of the experts' testimony went to the element of breach of duty whereas the specific evidence of industry standards was intended to\r\nestablish the applicable duty of care.  In other words, while respondents' experts were allowed to offer their opinions that the equipment did not conform with the\r\nindustry's guidelines and was not meant to be walked upon, this testimony primarily relates to breach of a duty, not to demonstrating precisely what the objective duty of\r\ncare was.  Since the evidence at issue went to a different element on the negligence cause of action - duty versus breach - clearly the evidence cannot be considered\r\ncumulative.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold the trial court's error in excluding this evidence prejudiced respondents' case.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe general rule is that evidence of industry safety standards is admissible to establish the standard of care in a negligence case.  The evidence of CPSC guidelines and\r\nASTM standards which respondents sought to have admitted in the instant case is exactly the type of evidence contemplated by this general rule.  The Court of Appeals\r\ncorrectly held the trial court committed reversible error in excluding the evidence.  Therefore, the Court of Appeals' opinion is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE MOORE\r\n(dissenting):&nbsp; I respectfully dissent because I disagree that the Court\r\nof Appeals correctly found the trial court had committed reversible error by\r\nexcluding evidence of the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards (hereinafter\r\ncollectively referred to as â€œthe guidelinesâ€).&nbsp; While the majority\r\nopinion and the decision of the Court of Appeals focus on whether the guidelines\r\nwere adopted by Richland/Lexington School District Five (the District), I\r\nbelieve this is an improper predicate upon which to base the ruling.&nbsp; The\r\nmore appropriate question is whether the guidelines are applicable to the\r\nDistrictâ€™s existing playground equipment.\r\nGiven that\r\nrespondents did not present evidence the guidelines were applicable to the existing\r\nplayground equipment on the Districtâ€™s property, the trial court properly\r\ndisallowed evidence regarding those guidelines.&nbsp; While respondentsâ€™\r\nexpert, Steven Bernheim, testified the District should have had policies and\r\nprocedures regarding the existing equipmentâ€™s compliance to the guidelines,\r\nBernheim never testified, nor was it shown as the majority opinion contends,\r\nthat the guidelines in fact applied to existing playground equipment.&nbsp;\r\nBernheim merely testified the District should have had procedures in place for\r\nretrofitting existing equipment in accordance with the guidelines.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, he did not opine that the guidelines applied to existing\r\nplayground equipment.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion when it rejected the proffered testimony.&nbsp; See Pike v.\r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000) (admission\r\nand rejection of testimony is largely within trial courtâ€™s sound discretion,\r\nthe exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of that\r\ndiscretion).\r\nFurther, even if the\r\ntrial court had committed error by not admitting the evidence, respondents were\r\nnot prejudiced by the alleged error.&nbsp; The proffered evidence was cumulative\r\nto the admitted testimony of respondentsâ€™ experts.&nbsp; At trial, Bernheim\r\ntestified that, â€œaccording to the standards and practices of the industry,\r\n[the playground equipment] did not meet the proper safety standards.â€&nbsp;\r\nFurther, the Districtâ€™s equipment purchaser, Joe Tommie, testified, in bids\r\nfor purchasing new playground equipment, the District specified the new\r\nequipment must meet the guidelines.&nbsp; Therefore, while specific evidence\r\nregarding the guidelines was not admitted, respondents were still able to show\r\nthat the equipment did not meet the standards set by the playground equipment\r\nindustry.&nbsp; Additionally, both Bernheim and respondentsâ€™ other expert,\r\nArchibald Hardy, testified the monkey bar was not meant to be walked upon.&nbsp;\r\nHardy also testified that he had recommended to the Irmo Elementary School\r\nprincipal that all of the older equipment on the playground be â€œbulldozed.â€&nbsp;\r\nGiven the above testimony, additional information regarding the guidelines would\r\nnot have bolstered respondentsâ€™ case any further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhile the majority\r\nopinion contends respondents were prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s decision\r\nbecause the bulk of the expertsâ€™ testimony went to the element of breach of\r\nduty and that evidence of the guidelines would have established the applicable\r\nduty of care, respondents were able to present evidence of the applicable duty\r\nof care through the testimony of Bernheim and Tommie as noted above.&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, I do not find this contention persuasive as to why respondents\r\nwere prejudiced by the alleged trial court error.\r\nFor the above stated\r\nreasons, I would reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision because the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by rejecting respondentsâ€™ proffered\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n1. Removing the growth plates in both legs prevents uneven growth, but also retards growth in the legs.  Ginger's doctor testified that this procedure would have the effect\r\nof making Ginger shorter than she would have been.\r\n2. We note that while this portion of Tommie's testimony was part of the proffer, and therefore excluded by the trial court's ruling, it nevertheless was brought out before\r\nthe jury.\r\n3. Bernheim would have testified that the CPSC guidelines were first published in 1981 and that ASTM standards applied to schools since at least 1993.\r\n4. The District contends that Bernheim \"refused to discuss\" the application of the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards to existing equipment.  This is an inaccurate\r\nportrayal of the record.  As stated above, Bernheim would have testified that with regard to existing equipment, the District should have had policies in place to ensure\r\ncompliance with the industry standards.  Specifically, we note that the excluded testimony included the following exchange:\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  And again regarding the compliance for the standards for existing playground equipment, should [the District] have had in place policies and procedures?\r\n\r\n  A.  I think so, in my humble and professional opinion, yes.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the District makes much of a comment Bernheim made at a later point in his proffered testimony.  Bernheim stated that, in his experience, all requests for\r\nnew playground equipment purchases required that the equipment conform with the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards.  In this context, when the District asked\r\nwhether this was for new equipment, Bernheim replied:  \"For the purchase of new equipment.  I don't want to discuss retrofitting.\"  Despite Bernheim's response that he\r\ndid not want to discuss retrofitting, Bernheim had already testified as to his opinion regarding the District's duty to maintain existing equipment and the application of the\r\nstandards to existing equipment.  The District cannot isolate this portion of Bernheim's testimony and, by so doing, erase the other pertinent testimony on this issue which\r\nwas offered by respondents.\r\n5. Indeed, since July 1997, the District has utilized the CPSC guidelines in conjunction with the inspection and maintenance of its playgrounds.6. The dissent, adopting the District's argument, states respondents did not show that the guidelines applied to existing playground equipment.  However, because\r\nBernheim specifically testified that the playground equipment guidelines applied to any group using playground equipment for public use, we find it irrelevant that he did not\r\nspecifically testify \"the guidelines applied to existing equipment.\"  It is beyond dispute that Bernheim's testimony established that the guidelines were in effect at the time of\r\nGinger's accident, they applied to public playground equipment, schools would have had notice of the guidelines, and the District should have had procedures in place to\r\nguarantee compliance with the guidelines.  Moreover, testimony was admitted that the District required that new equipment comply with the guidelines.  We therefore\r\nbelieve this evidence, when taken together, establishes the guidelines applied to existing\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25560","title":"Pee v.

Trial Lawyers \r\n  Association.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  Respondent (Claimant) was awarded workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  benefits for disability from carpal tunnel syndrome resulting from repetitive \r\n  trauma to both wrists. [1]   Petitioners \r\n  (Employer) appealed.  The circuit court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  [2]   The only issue is whether a \r\n  repetitive trauma injury is compensable under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act.  We find it is and affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nClaimant worked for \r\n  Employer in various capacities beginning in 1987.  Each of her jobs involved \r\n  the repetitive use of her hands.  In the spring of 1995 she began experiencing \r\n  tingling and numbness in both hands.  On April 25, 1995, she was diagnosed with \r\n  moderately severe carpal tunnel syndrome caused by compression of the median \r\n  nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist.  The evidence is \r\n  uncontradicted that claimantâ€™s injury is work-related.  \r\nAfter surgery in June 1995, Claimantâ€™s left wrist improved \r\n  temporarily but her symptoms returned within six months.  Claimantâ€™s treating \r\n  doctor removed her from work beginning April 20, 1996.  By May 1996, she had \r\n  severe carpal tunnel syndrome in her right wrist.  Surgery was recommended for \r\n  her right wrist in October 1996 with no guarantee of relief from her symptoms.\r\nMeanwhile, on July \r\n  21, 1996, Claimant filed this action claiming benefits for an on-the-job injury.  \r\n  Claimant was awarded temporary total benefits continuing until she reaches maximum \r\n  medical improvement.\r\nThe circuit court and the Court of Appeals held a repetitive \r\n  trauma injury is compensable as an â€œinjury by accidentâ€ as provided in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2001).  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs a repetitive trauma injury compensable as an injury by accident?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nEmployer contends a repetitive trauma injury does not \r\n  qualify as an â€œinjury by accidentâ€ because the cause of the injury is not unexpected \r\n  and the injury lacks definiteness of time.  In the alternative, Employer contends \r\n  injury from repetitive trauma should be compensable as an occupational disease \r\n  if compensable at all.\r\n1.  Unexpectedness\r\nEmployer contends the \r\n  repetitive event which causes a repetitive trauma injury is not unexpected but \r\n  is part of the workerâ€™s normal work activity.  Because the event causing the \r\n  injury is not unexpected, Employer argues repetitive trauma injury cannot be \r\n  compensable as an injury by accident.  \r\nUnder Â§ 42-1-160, a claimant is \r\n  entitled to benefits for an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course \r\n  of employment.â€  In Layton v. Hammond-Brown-Jennings Co., 190 S.C. 425, \r\n  3 S.E.2d 492 (1939), we interpreted for the first time the meaning of â€œinjury \r\n  by accidentâ€ under the newly enacted Workmanâ€™s Compensation Act.  We noted that \r\n  two lines of cases had evolved in other jurisdictions:  some jurisdictions, \r\n  including North Carolina upon which our Act is modeled, held there must be some \r\n  unusual or unlooked-for mishap resulting in injury to constitute an accident; \r\n  other jurisdictions held no mishap was required for an accident so long as there \r\n  was an unexpected injury occurring while the employee was performing his usual \r\n  duties in his customary manner.  We chose the latter definition, focusing on \r\n  the unexpected nature of the injury rather than requiring that the event \r\n  causing the injury be unexpected.  This definition of accident as an unexpected \r\n  injury has been reiterated in a long line of cases.  See, e.g., Colvin \r\n  v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours Co., 227 S.C. 465, 88 S.E.2d 581 (1955) (injury \r\n  by accident is an injury occurring unexpectedly without the prior occurrence \r\n  of any external event of an accidental nature); Hiers v. Brunson Const. Co., \r\n  221 S.C. 212, 70 S.E.2d 211 (1952) (injury by accident is an injury that is \r\n  accidental in that it is unforeseen and unexpected). \r\n  [3]   \r\nAs we more recently stated, â€œin \r\n  determining whether something constitutes an injury by accident the focus is \r\n  not on some specific event, but rather on the injury itself.â€  Stokes v. \r\n  First Natâ€™l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991).  Further, \r\n  an injury is unexpected, bringing it within the category of accident, if the \r\n  worker did not intend it or expect it would result from what he was doing.  \r\n  Colvin, 227 S.C. at 468-69, 88 S.E.2d at 582 (emphasis added).  Therefore, \r\n  if an injury is unexpected from the workerâ€™s point of view, it qualifies as \r\n  an injury by accident.  Here, there is no evidence Claimant intended or expected \r\n  to be injured as a result of her repetitive work activity.\r\nEmployerâ€™s contention that the \r\n  cause of the injury must be unexpected is incorrect.  Under South Carolina law, \r\n  if the injury itself is unexpected, it is compensable as an injury by accident.\r\n2.  Definiteness \r\n  of time\r\nEmployer contends the injury resulting \r\n  from repetitive trauma has no definite time of occurrence and therefore it is \r\n  not compensable as an injury by accident. \r\nDefiniteness of time, while relevant \r\n  to proving causation, is not required to prove an injury qualifies as an injury \r\n  by accident.  For instance, in Sturkie v. Ballenger Corp., 268 S.C. 536, \r\n  235 S.E.2d 120 (1977), we found the claimantâ€™s emphysema, which developed gradually, \r\n  was caused by repeated exposure to high humidity and dust on the job and was \r\n  therefore compensable as an injury by accident.  Similarly, in Stokes, \r\n  supra, we found a psychological disorder which developed over a period \r\n  of months compensable as an injury by accident.  \r\nFurther, under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2001), a disease, which typically has a gradual onset, is \r\n  compensable as an injury by accident â€œwhen it results naturally and unavoidably \r\n  from the accident.â€  This provision indicates the legislature intended an accident \r\n  to be compensable under the Act, even where the effects of the accident develop \r\n  gradually.  The fact that a repetitive trauma injury is disease-like in its \r\n  gradual onset does not preclude it from coverage as an injury by accident.\r\nHere, it is uncontested that Claimantâ€™s \r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her work activities. \r\n  [4]   The lack of a definite time of injury is therefore not dispositive.\r\n3.  Repetitive \r\n  trauma injury as occupational disease\r\nEmployer contends that if a repetitive \r\n  trauma injury is compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, it should \r\n  be compensable only as an occupational disease and not as an injury by accident.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument and followed the rationale of other \r\n  courts that have focused on the commonly understood meaning of the word â€œdiseaseâ€ \r\n  to conclude repetitive trauma is not an occupational disease.  See Lutrell \r\n  v. Ind. Commâ€™n, 507 N.E.2d 533 (Ill. App. 1987) (injury results from a specific \r\n  identifiable trauma or physical event whereas disease originates from a source \r\n  that is neither traumatic nor physical); Duvall v. ICI Americas, Inc., \r\n  621 N.E.2d 1122 (Ind. App. 1993) (occupational disease results from exposure \r\n  to conditions in the workplace; exposure is a passive relationship rather than \r\n  an event or occurrence); Noble v. Lamoni Prods., 512 N.W.2d 290 (Iowa \r\n  1994) (none of the common definitions trace the cause of disease to trauma). \r\n\r\nWhether a repetitive trauma injury \r\n  is compensable either as an injury by accident or an occupational disease has \r\n  not been squarely addressed by this Court. \r\n  [5]   As other courts have recognized, the difficulty in deciding this issue \r\n  arises from the fact that a repetitive trauma injury has some of the characteristics \r\n  of both accidental injury and occupational disease -- it is the cumulative effect \r\n  of repeated and distinct events that ultimately produces the disability.  See \r\n  Berry v. Boeing Military Airplanes, 885 P.2d 1261 (Kan. 1994); Crosby \r\n  v. American Stores, 298 N.W.2d 157 (Neb. 1980).  There is a split of authority \r\n  on this issue with no real majority view. [6]   \r\nFurther, it is not obvious that \r\n  either approach is more favorable to finding coverage.  See Mauldin \r\n  v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992) (Court will \r\n  liberally construe Act in favor of coverage).  Presumably, Employer is advocating \r\n  the occupational disease approach based on case law from other jurisdictions \r\n  where repetitive trauma is treated as an occupational disease and courts have \r\n  found no coverage because the claimant failed to show a required element.  For \r\n  instance, in Fuller v. Motel 6, 526 S.E.2d 480 (N.C. App. 2000), the \r\n  North Carolina Court of Appeals found no coverage for carpal tunnel syndrome \r\n  where the claimant failed to show it was caused by conditions peculiar to her \r\n  employment that excluded all ordinary diseases to which the general public is \r\n  equally exposed.  \r\nIn South Carolina, our statute \r\n  defines an occupational disease as â€œa disease arising out of and in the course \r\n  of employment which is due to hazards in excess of those ordinarily incident \r\n  to employment and is peculiar to the occupation in which the employee is engaged.â€  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-10 (1985).  Unlike the North Carolina courts, however, \r\n  we have not construed the definition of occupational disease so rigidly.  The \r\n  statute is satisfied where the claimant is able to show simply that the employment \r\n  increased the risk of the disease.  See Mohasco Corp. v. Rising, \r\n  292 S.C. 489, 357 S.E.2d 456 (1987).  Under our more liberal approach, it is \r\n  not clear that proof of a repetitive trauma injury as an occupational disease \r\n  would be a more onerous burden than proving it as an injury by accident.\r\nIn any event, the commission found \r\n  Claimantâ€™s repetitive trauma injury was compensable as an injury by accident.  \r\n  We find a repetitive trauma injury meets the definition of injury by accident \r\n  in that it is an unforeseen injury caused by trauma.  We therefore conclude \r\n  the commissionâ€™s finding is supported by substantial evidence.  See Anderson \r\n  v. Baptist Med. Center, 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001) (findings of \r\n  commission are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by \r\n  substantial evidence).  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Carpal tunnel syndrome may also result from one traumatic event or as a secondary \r\n    effect of another condition such as diabetes or pregnancy, which is not at \r\n    issue here.  See The Merck Manual of Medical Information (1997).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Pee \r\n    v. AVM, Inc., 344 S.C. 162, 543 S.E.2d 232 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] In Hiers, we noted the policy reason for adopting such a definition:\r\n  \r\n  If [the injury] results from \r\n    the conditions under which the work is carried on, there is no reason why \r\n    it should not be held compensable.  In such case, it is one of the casualties \r\n    of business; and it is the purpose of the compensation statutes to place the \r\n    burden of casualties upon the business and not upon the unfortunate employee.\r\n  \r\n  70 S.E.2d at 221.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    Employerâ€™s claim that our holding makes compensable all the effects of aging \r\n    is without merit since causation must always be established.  Whether there \r\n    is any causal connection between employment and an injury is a question of \r\n    fact for the Commission.  Sharpe v. Case Produce Inc., 336 S.C. 154, \r\n    519 S.E.2d 102 (1999).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    In Minor v. Philips Prods., 329 S.C. 321, 494 S.E.2d 819 (1997), the \r\n    appellant/employer raised the issue whether a repetitive motion injury should \r\n    be considered an occupational disease rather than an injury by accident.  \r\n    We did not expressly answer this question but simply found substantial evidence \r\n    supported the award of benefits as an injury by accident.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    Compare Kinney v. Tupperware Co., 792 P.2d 330 (Idaho 1990); \r\n    Crosby v. American Stores, 298 N.W.2d 157 (Neb. 1980) (occupational \r\n    disease) with TRW/REDA Pump v.

The \r\n  single commissioner, the full commission, and the Court of Appeals \r\n  [2]  found his claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations found \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2001). [3]   We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts relevant to this issue are undisputed.  \r\n  Claimant worked as a fireman for more than twenty-four years.  For most of this \r\n  time he held the position of captain, requiring him to ride in the passenger \r\n  seat of the fire truck only a few feet from the siren and air horn which sounded \r\n  continuously on each call.  In addition, the volume on the fire truck radio \r\n  was turned up in order to be audible over the noise of the siren and horn.\r\nOn April 14, 1995, Claimant was given a hearing \r\n  test by the fire department physician as part of a routine annual physical.  \r\n  The doctor found some noise-induced hearing loss but concluded Claimant was \r\n  capable of performing his job.  Claimant was referred to the Charleston Speech \r\n  and Hearing Center where he was examined on May 3.  He was diagnosed with a \r\n  moderate bilateral loss of hearing and recommended for a binaural hearing aid \r\n  evaluation.  \r\n On May 10, Claimant was evaluated by his private \r\n  physician, Dr. Fenwick, who diagnosed Claimant with bilateral hearing loss from \r\n  noise exposure.  Dr. Fenwick recommended a yearly audiogram and predicted Claimant \r\n  would ultimately need hearing aids, although probably not for another ten years.  \r\n\r\nThe following year, on February 29, 1996, Claimant \r\n  had his yearly audiogram which detected hearing loss in both ears.  The report \r\n  noted â€œextended exposure to loud noises may make this loss worse.â€  \r\nClaimant left the fire department for unrelated medical \r\n  reasons in August 1997.  On December 1, 1997, Claimant again had his hearing \r\n  checked by his private physician, Dr. Fenwick, who noted Claimantâ€™s hearing \r\n  had decreased since the May 1995 examination.  Claimant was diagnosed with a \r\n  hearing impairment of 22.5% to his right ear and 37.5% to his left, resulting \r\n  in a hearing impairment for both ears of 12.5%.\r\nOn May 6, 1998, Claimant filed this workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claim for noise-induced bilateral hearing loss.  The commissioner found Claimant \r\n  knew he had a workersâ€™ compensation claim for hearing loss at least by May 1995 \r\n  and concluded the May 1998 filing was outside the two-year limitation.  The \r\n  full commission affirmed.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with a separate concurring opinion \r\n  by Judge Howard.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhen does the two-year statute of limitations begin \r\n  to run in a repetitive trauma case?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals found Claimant failed to timely file a claim within two \r\n  years.  In so holding, it applied the discovery rule of Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack \r\n  Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992), and concluded Claimant knew \r\n  or should have known of his compensable injury at the latest by February 1996 \r\n  when he had his last work-related audiogram.  Judge Howard reluctantly concurred, \r\n  noting the harsh result but feeling constrained by this Courtâ€™s precedent in \r\n  Mauldin.\r\nMauldin involved a claimant who was originally misdiagnosed with a sprain.  \r\n  It was not until more than two years after the accident that she was finally \r\n  diagnosed with a torn medial meniscus, a compensable injury.  We applied the \r\n  discovery rule and held the two-year time period began to run when the claimant \r\n  knew or should have known she had a compensable injury.  \r\nRepetitive trauma injuries, unlike the injury in Mauldin which \r\n  occurred on a specific date but simply was misdiagnosed, have a gradual onset \r\n  caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive traumatic events or â€œmini-accidents.â€  \r\n  As noted by other courts, it is difficult to determine the date an accident \r\n  occurs in a repetitive trauma case because there is no definite time of injury.  \r\n  See Lawson v. Lear Seating Corp., 944 S.W.2d 340 (Tenn. 1997); \r\n  Berry v. Boeing Military Airplanes, 885 P.2d 1261 (Kan. App. 1994).  \r\n  Applying the discovery rule to such an injury often works to the prejudice of \r\n  an employee who discovers symptoms of a repetitive trauma injury but continues \r\n  to work.  King v. D.C. Dept. of Employment Servs., 742 A.2d 460 (D.C. \r\n  1999); Oscar Meyer &amp; Co. v. Ind. Commâ€™n, 531 N.E.2d 174 (Ill. App. \r\n  1988).\r\nAlthough there is no overwhelming consensus, courts seeking to liberally \r\n  provide for workersâ€™ compensation coverage have adopted the â€œlast day of exposureâ€ \r\n  or the â€œlast day workedâ€ rule premised on the recognition that the injury is \r\n  caused by trauma that occurs repeatedly until the particular employment ends.  \r\n  See Lawson, supra; Berry, supra; Brooks \r\n  Drug, Inc. v. Workmenâ€™s Comp. Appeal Bd., 636 A.2d 246 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1993).\r\nThis approach is consistent with our policy to liberally \r\n  construe the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in favor of coverage.  Mauldin, \r\n  supra.  Further, it has the added advantage of fixing an outside date \r\n  for filing that avoids the need to litigate the date of injury.  We also note \r\n  the separate requirement that a worker give the employer notice of an \r\n  injury.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985). \r\n  [4]   This notice requirement ensures the employer will not be unfairly \r\n  prejudiced by a two-year period for filing that begins from the last date of \r\n  exposure. \r\nWe hold the last day of exposure is the date from which the statute of limitations \r\n  begins to run in a repetitive trauma case.  Applying this rule to the case at \r\n  hand, we reverse the ruling that Claimantâ€™s action is time-barred since he filed \r\n  his claim within two years of his last date of exposure.  The case is remanded \r\n  to the commissioner to address the merits of the claim.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    In Pee v.

Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  This case is before us upon remand \r\n  from the United States Supreme Court.  Previously, in State v. Shafer, \r\n  340 S.C. 291, 531 S.E.2d 524 (2000), we held appellant, a capital defendant, \r\n  was not entitled to a jury instruction that he was parole ineligible because \r\n  Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187 (1994) [1]  was inapplicable under the stateâ€™s new sentencing scheme. \r\n  [2] \r\nThe United States Supreme Court reversed, finding Simmons \r\n  was applicable to the stateâ€™s new sentencing scheme.  Shafer v. South Carolina, \r\n  532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263 (2001).  The Court held that whenever future dangerousness \r\n  is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolinaâ€™s new scheme, \r\n  due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries \r\n  no possibility of parole.  Shafer, 532 U.S. at 51, 121 S.Ct. at 1273.  \r\n  However, the Court remanded the case for us to determine whether the prosecutorâ€™s \r\n  evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed appellantâ€™s future \r\n  dangerousness at issue.  Id. at 54-55, 121 S.Ct. at 1274-1275.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was charged with murder, attempted armed robbery, and conspiracy \r\n  for his involvement in the shooting of a convenience store clerk.  After the \r\n  jury found appellant guilty as charged, his trial entered the penalty phase.\r\nDuring the penalty phase, the State introduced evidence of appellantâ€™s \r\n  criminal record, probation violations, and misbehavior in prison.  The State \r\n  introduced the following evidence:\r\n\r\n(1) appellant was convicted of burglary and criminal sexual conduct (CSC) at \r\n  age seventeen, after he and others confessed to taking two twelve-year-old girls \r\n  to an empty house and having sexual intercourse and fellatio with them;\r\n(2) after receiving a probationary sentence for his burglary and CSC convictions, \r\n  appellant violated probation by being rearrested for burglary and driving under \r\n  suspension, by twice testing positive for marijuana, and by failing to report \r\n  both to his probation officer and to court-ordered sex offender counseling;\r\n(3) on the night of his arrest for murder, appellant asked a jailer whether \r\n  his father would get his pistol back after it had been seized as the murder \r\n  weapon;\r\n(4) while awaiting trial on the murder charge, appellant was charged with assaulting \r\n  a female staff member at the Detention Center after he became enraged and verbally \r\n  abusive because she turned off the telephones;\r\n(5) while in jail, appellant was charged with possession of contraband for illegally \r\n  possessing and smoking cigarettes; and\r\n(6) when discussing the murder with a fellow jail inmate shortly after his arrest, \r\n  appellant acted as if the murder â€œdidnâ€™t even bother him.â€\r\n\r\nDuring an in camera hearing on jury instructions, the State \r\n  argued that it had not made future dangerousness an issue in the case nor would \r\n  it be arguing future dangerousness in closing argument and therefore appellant \r\n  was not entitled to a charge on parole ineligibility.  Defense counsel protested \r\n  on the ground the State should not be allowed to introduce evidence of future \r\n  dangerousness, and then say they were not going to argue it and thereby avoid \r\n  a charge on the law.  The State countered that the evidence was introduced to \r\n  show appellantâ€™s character and to show his adaptability to prison, not future \r\n  dangerousness.\r\nThe trial judge ruled that parole ineligibility would not be charged \r\n  unless the State argued future dangerousness.\r\nDefense counsel then sought permission to read in his closing argument \r\n  to the jury lines from the controlling statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A), \r\n  stating plainly that a life sentence in South Carolina carries no possibility \r\n  of parole.  Section 16-3-20(A) provides:\r\n\r\nIf the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance \r\n  is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C), and \r\n  a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence \r\n  of life imprisonment.  For purposes of this section, â€œlife imprisonmentâ€ means \r\n  until death of the offender.  No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant \r\n  to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early \r\n  release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education \r\n  credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory \r\n  life imprisonment required by this section.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge denied the request.\r\n          In closing argument, the State discussed a video that portrayed the \r\n  aftermath of the victimâ€™s murder, where some girls discovered the victimâ€™s body.  \r\n  The State argued the following:\r\n\r\n. . . do you remember the girls that came in and when Jamie Palmer \r\n  was saying, â€œOh God; oh, God; Ray, Rayâ€ and the girls were running in and out, \r\n  weâ€™ve got to go, weâ€™ve got to go, . . . but what is really etched in my mind \r\n  is Monica Inman.  Remember Jamie picks up the phone and sheâ€™s calling 911, and \r\n  Monica Inman says â€œcome on, Jamie, they might come back, they might come \r\n  back.â€\r\n. . . So that the next time somebody with a pistol thinks about loading \r\n  up, coming across that river to Lockhart, over to Jonesville or out to Buffalo \r\n  or anywhere in this county, and they might come back, they might come back, \r\n  they will remember this day, and they will remember this jury, and they will \r\n  remember this verdict.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nAt the conclusion of the argument, defense counsel renewed the request \r\n  for a life without parole charge on the grounds that the State again raised \r\n  future dangerousness by discussing Jamieâ€™s fear that â€œthey might come back, \r\n  they might come back.â€  The trial court ruled, â€œWell, I listened very carefully \r\n  because I have to admit I had some concern when that argument was entered into \r\n  as to whether we had crossed the line.  . . . I find that it comes close, but \r\n  did not; so, I deny [appellantâ€™s] motion.â€\r\nInstructing the jury, the judge explained:\r\n\r\nIf you do not unanimously find the existence of the aggravating circumstance \r\n  as set forth on the form [murder during the commission of an attempted armed \r\n  robbery], you do not need to go any further. \r\nIf you find unanimously the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance \r\n  . . . you will go further and continue your deliberations. \r\nOnce you have unanimously found and signed as to the presence of an aggravated \r\n  circumstance, you then further deliberate, and determine whether or not Wesley \r\n  Aaron Shafer should be sentence[d] to life imprisonment or death.\r\n\r\nThe judge told the jury twice that â€œlife imprisonment means until \r\n  the death of the defendant.â€  After the judge instructed the jury, the defense \r\n  again renewed its objection that the statutory language on parole ineligibility \r\n  was not charged.  The objection was overruled.\r\nAfter about three and a half hours into sentencing deliberations, \r\n  the jury sent a note to the trial judge containing two questions:  (1) Is there \r\n  any remote chance for someone convicted of murder to become eligible for parole?; \r\n  and (2) Under what conditions would someone convicted for murder be eligible? [3] \r\nDefense counsel again urged the court to read to the jury the previously \r\n  requested portion of Â§ 16-3-20(A).  Counsel argued the judgeâ€™s charge, which \r\n  partially quoted from Â§ 16-3-20 (â€œlife imprisonment means until death of the \r\n  offenderâ€), omitted the portion of the statute that explained what â€œuntil death \r\n  of the offenderâ€ means.\r\nThe trial judge decided not to charge the jury about parole ineligibility, \r\n  and instructed the jury: \r\n\r\nSection 16-3-20 of our Code of Laws as applies to this case in the process weâ€™re \r\n  in, states that, quote, for the purposes of this section life imprisonment means \r\n  until the death of the offender.  Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not \r\n  for your consideration. \r\n\r\nThe jury returned one hour and twenty minutes later. The jury unanimously \r\n  found beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factor of murder while attempting \r\n  armed robbery, and recommended the death penalty.  After the jury was polled \r\n  as to their assent to the aggravating circumstance finding and to the death \r\n  penalty recommendation, defense counsel requested the jury be polled on â€œthe \r\n  specific question as to whether parole eligibility, their belief therein, gave \r\n  rise to the verdict.â€  The judge denied the request and imposed the death sentence.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI. Whether future dangerousness was an issue in appellantâ€™s case such that he \r\n  was entitled to a parole ineligibility instruction?\r\nII. Whether the Court should follow the rule of Yarbrough v. Commonwealth, \r\n  519 S.E.2d 602 (Va. 1999), to require that sentencing juries be instructed on \r\n  parole eligibility in all cases?\r\nIII. Whether the sentencing jury should be informed that a life without parole \r\n  sentence does not necessarily mean the defendant will never be released from \r\n  prison?\r\n\r\nI\r\nFollowing appellantâ€™s trial and his appeal, the United States Supreme Court \r\n  expanded the law governing whether the evidence submitted by or the argument \r\n  of the prosecution raises future dangerousness.  Kelly v. South Carolina, \r\n  534 U.S. 246, 122 S.Ct. 726 (2002).  In Kelly, the Court found that evidence \r\n  of violent behavior in prison can raise a strong implication of generalized \r\n  future dangerousness. [4]   The Kelly Court stated â€œ[a] jury hearing evidence of \r\n  a defendantâ€™s demonstrated propensity for violence reasonably will conclude \r\n  that he presents a risk of violent behavior, whether locked up or free, and \r\n  whether free as a fugitive or as a parolee.â€  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. \r\n  at 731.\r\nThe Court stated â€œthat evidence of dangerous â€˜characterâ€™ may show \r\n  â€˜characteristicâ€™ future dangerousness.â€  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. \r\n  at 732.   Further, the Court stated that â€œ[e]vidence of future dangerousness \r\n  under Simmons is evidence with a tendency to prove dangerousness in the \r\n  future; its relevance to that point does not disappear merely because it might \r\n  support other inferences or be described in other terms.â€  534 U.S. at     , \r\n  122 S.Ct. at 732.\r\nAs for the prosecution argument in Kelly, the Court found \r\n  â€œ[t]he prosecutor accentuated the clear implication of future dangerousness \r\n  raised by the evidence and placed the case within the four corners of Simmons.â€  \r\n  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. at 732.  The Court found the following portions \r\n  of the prosecution argument important:  (1) the prosecution expressed its hope \r\n  the jurors would â€œnever in [their] lives again have to experience . . . [b]eing \r\n  some thirty feet away from such a person;â€ (2) the prosecution characterized \r\n  Kelly as a dangerous bloody butcher, and while those statements went to retribution, \r\n  they also implied Kelly would be dangerous in the future; (3) the prosecution \r\n  stated Kelly was â€œmore frightening than a serial killerâ€ and that â€œmurderers \r\n  will be murderers.â€  With these facts, the Court found that â€œKellyâ€™s jury, like \r\n  its predecessor in Simmons, [was] invited to infer â€˜that petitioner is \r\n  a vicious predator who would pose a continuing threat to the community.â€™â€  534 \r\n  U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. at 732-33.\r\nApplying the Kelly analysis to the evidence introduced by \r\n  the State in appellantâ€™s case, we conclude the State made future dangerousness \r\n  an issue.  The evidence presented addressed appellantâ€™s character and adaptability \r\n  to prison, as the State argued at trial; however, the evidence also tended to \r\n  show that appellant could be dangerous in the future.  The relevance of the \r\n  evidence to future dangerousness did not disappear merely because the evidence \r\n  supported other inferences.  As Kelly noted, evidence of violent behavior \r\n  in prison can raise a strong implication of generalized future dangerousness.  \r\n  Here, the State presented evidence that appellant became enraged and verbally \r\n  abusive to a staff member of the Detention Center when she turned off the telephones.  \r\n\r\nThe State also introduced evidence that appellant was incapable of \r\n  following rules by showing he had violated his probation in the past and had \r\n  been charged for possession of contraband in the jail.  Further, the State showed \r\n  that appellant was a repeat criminal offender.  While this evidence implied \r\n  that appellant had a bad character, the evidence also raised the implication \r\n  of future dangerousness such that appellant was entitled to an instruction on \r\n  parole ineligibility.\r\nThe Stateâ€™s penalty phase closing argument also raised future dangerousness.  \r\n  The language, â€œthey might come back, they might come back,â€ in the Stateâ€™s argument \r\n  implied that appellant might come back and commit future crimes if he is not \r\n  executed.  This language is similar to language in Kelly where the prosecutor \r\n  informed the jurors that he hoped they would never in their lives have to experience \r\n  being thirty feet away from such a person as Kelly.  The Kelly Court \r\n  found that language accentuated the clear implication of future dangerousness \r\n  raised by the evidence in Kelly.\r\nThe State admits that some of the evidence it introduced was the \r\n  â€œsort of evidence Kelly found to have the tendency to raise future \r\n  dangerousness.â€  However, the State argues that because it did not argue \r\n  that evidence during appellantâ€™s penalty phase, a claim with which we disagree, \r\n  this case falls outside of Kelly.  The State alleges that footnote 4 \r\n  of Kelly [5]  requires \r\n  that both evidence of future dangerousness and argument on future \r\n  dangerousness must exist for the defense to be entitled to the parole ineligibility \r\n  instruction.  \r\nContrary to the Stateâ€™s argument, this footnote does not make such \r\n  an assertion.  Initially, we note the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s clear instructions \r\n  to this Court were to determine whether the prosecutorâ€™s evidentiary submissions \r\n  or closing argument in fact placed appellantâ€™s future dangerousness at \r\n  issue.  Also, the majority language in Kelly belies such an assertion.  \r\n  For instance, the Kelly Court noted that this Court posed the legal issue \r\n  accurately in Kelly, â€œfor in considering the applicability of Simmons \r\n  [this Court] asked whether Kellyâ€™s future dangerousness was â€˜a logical inference \r\n  from the evidence,â€™ or was â€˜injected into the case through the Stateâ€™s \r\n  closing argument.â€™â€  534 U.S. at    , 122 S.Ct. at 731 (emphasis added).\r\nFurther, the Stateâ€™s argument is illogical because if the State succeeded \r\n  in this argument, then the State would have the ability to introduce evidence \r\n  raising a defendantâ€™s future dangerousness, but avoid a parole ineligibility \r\n  instruction simply by being careful not to argue future dangerousness.  This \r\n  tactic would undermine the Simmons line of cases.\r\nII\r\nAppellant argues the Court should follow the rule of Yarbrough \r\n  v. Commonwealth, 519 S.E.2d 602 (Va. 1999), to require that sentencing juries \r\n  be instructed on parole eligibility in all capital cases.\r\nIn Yarbrough v. Commonwealth, supra, the Virginia Supreme \r\n  Court held:\r\n\r\nin response to a proffer of a proper instruction from the defendant prior to \r\n  submitting the issue of penalty-determination to the jury or where the defendant \r\n  asks for such an instruction following an inquiry from the jury during deliberations, \r\n  the trial court shall instruct the jury that the words â€˜imprisonment for lifeâ€™ \r\n  mean â€˜imprisonment for life without possibility of parole.â€™\r\n\r\nYarbrough, 519 S.E.2d at 616.  The Yarbrough court emphasized \r\n  that the defendant must request the instruction and the trial court is not required \r\n  to give the instruction sua sponte.  Id. at 616, n.11.\r\nWe do not find any reason for adopting the Yarbrough rule \r\n  because the Legislature has already adopted such a rule.  The Legislature amended \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 2001), effective May 28, 2002, to revise the \r\n  definition of â€œlife imprisonmentâ€ and provide that, when requested by the state \r\n  or the defendant, the judge must charge the jury in his instructions that life \r\n  imprisonment means until the death of the defendant without the possibility \r\n  of parole, and in cases where the defendant is eligible for parole, the judge \r\n  must charge the applicable parole eligibility statute.  Accordingly, by legislative \r\n  amendment, appellant has received the relief he requests.\r\nIII\r\nThe State argues a capital sentencing jury should be informed that \r\n  a life without parole sentence does not necessarily mean the defendant will \r\n  never be released from prison.\r\nIn South Carolina, the Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon \r\n  Services (Parole Board) has the sole authority, upon request by the Department \r\n  of Corrections, to alter a life without parole sentence via a pardon or parole.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 2001); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-970 \r\n  (1989).  A person sentenced to life without parole may be paroled if the following \r\n  occurs:\r\n\r\n(1) the Department of Corrections requests the Department of Probation, \r\n  Parole, and Pardon Services to consider the person for parole; and\r\n(2) the Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services determines \r\n  that due to the personâ€™s health or age he is no longer a threat to society; \r\n  and\r\n(a) the person has served at least thirty years of the sentence imposed \r\n  pursuant to this section and has reached at least sixty-five years of age; or\r\n(b) the person has served at least twenty years of the sentence imposed \r\n  pursuant to this section and has reached at least seventy years of age; or\r\n(c) the person is afflicted with a terminal illness where life expectancy \r\n  is one year or less; or\r\n(d) the person can produce evidence comprising the most extraordinary \r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (E) (Supp. 2001).  Further, a life without parole \r\n  inmate can be considered for pardon if the inmate is â€œafflicted with a  terminal \r\n  illness where life expectancy is one year or less.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-970 \r\n  (1989).\r\nGiven that a life without parole sentence is generally immutable \r\n  under South Carolina law, a charge regarding the possibility of pardon or parole \r\n  is too speculative.  We find the State is not entitled to such a charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find a parole ineligibility instruction was warranted in the sentencing \r\n  phase of appellantâ€™s trial because the prosecution made future dangerousness \r\n  an issue in his trial.  Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.  We further \r\n  note that, given the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Kelly, \r\n  the better practice is for trial judges to give the capital sentencing jury \r\n  a parole ineligibility charge whether it is requested or not.\r\nREMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I agree that we should remand\r\nthis case for a new sentencing proceeding.&nbsp; Consistent with my dissent in State\r\nv. Kelly, 343 S.C. 350, 540 S.E.2d 851 (2001), I would grant this relief\r\nsolely because appellant requested a parole ineligibility charge at his first\r\ntrial.&nbsp; Further, I agree with the majority that the decision whether to\r\ngive such a charge in future capital sentencing proceedings is governed by the\r\namended version of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 2001), effective May 28,\r\n2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] In \r\n    Simmons, supra, the United States Supreme Court held that due \r\n    process is violated where a trial judge refuses to instruct a sentencing jury \r\n    that, under South Carolina law, life imprisonment meant no possibility of \r\n    parole, where a death sentence is secured, at least in part, due to the defendantâ€™s \r\n    future dangerousness.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]  South Carolinaâ€™s sentencing scheme, which became \r\n    effective on January 1, 1996, states that a capital jury must first decide \r\n    whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence \r\n    of any statutory aggravating circumstance.  If the jury fails to agree unanimously \r\n    on the presence of a statutory aggravator, it does not make a sentencing recommendation, \r\n    and the trial judge, in that event, sentences the defendant to either life \r\n    imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of thirty years imprisonment.  S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B).  If, on the other hand, the jury unanimously finds \r\n    a statutory aggravator, the jury then recommends one of two potential sentences \r\n    -- death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(A), (B).  No sentencing option other than death or life without \r\n    parole is available to the jury. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] The \r\n    parties agreed the second question could not be answered. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The \r\n    Kelly prosecutor introduced evidence that Kelly took part in escape \r\n    attempts, carried a shank, and had been caught carrying a weapon and planning \r\n    or participating in escape attempts. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Footnote \r\n    4 states:\r\n  As THE CHIEF JUSTICE says . . . it may well be that \r\n    the evidence in a substantial proportion, if not all, capital cases will show \r\n    a defendant likely to be dangerous in the future.   . . . But this is not \r\n    an issue here, nor is there an issue about a defendantâ€™s entitlement to instruction \r\n    on a parole ineligibility law when the Stateâ€™s evidence shows future dangerousness \r\n    but the prosecutor does not argue it.  The only questions in this case are \r\n    whether the evidence presented and the argument made at Kellyâ€™s trial placed \r\n    future dangerousness at issue.  The answer to each question is yes; and we \r\n    need go no further than Simmons in our discussion.\r\n  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. at 732, n.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
