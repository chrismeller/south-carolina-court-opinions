Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26981\r\nHeard January 6, 2011 - Filed June 6, 2011Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James Fletcher Thompson, of Spartanburg,\r\n          for Appellants.\r\n        Andrew F. Lindemann, of Davidson &amp;\r\n          Lindemann, of Columbia and Ronald H. Colvin, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â  Two issues are presented in this\r\n  appeal:Â  (1) whether the two-tier statutory cap in the South Carolina Tort\r\n  Claims Act is constitutional, and (2) whether two separate governmental\r\n  entities' negligent acts, which resulted in severe injuries to Larry Lee and\r\n  Jeannie Boiter (collectively, the Boiters) constitute one or two occurrences\r\n  under the Tort Claims Act.Â Â Â  The circuit court found the statutory caps\r\n  constitutional and that only one occurrence was presented by the facts.Â  We\r\n  affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Boiters were\r\n  injured when the motorcycle they were riding collided with a car driven by\r\n  Nancy Kochenower at an intersection near Inman, South Carolina.Â  The red signal\r\n  light bulbs for the road that Kochenower was traveling had burned out earlier\r\n  that day.Â  The Boiters suffered significant injuries as a result of being\r\n  thrown from the motorcycle, requiring lengthy hospital stays and incurring\r\n  $888,756 in medical bills and $203,897 in lost wages.Â Â  They settled with\r\n  Kochenower for her policy limits of $50,000.Â Â  \r\nThe Boiters filed\r\n  four separate lawsuits against South Carolina Department of Transportation\r\n  (SCDOT) and South Carolina Department of Public Safety (SCDPS) (collectively,\r\n  Respondents), alleging negligence in their failure to prevent the accident.Â \r\n  With respect to SCDOT, the Boiters alleged SCDOT failed to implement an\r\n  appropriate re-lamping policy to replace bulbs in traffic signals before they\r\n  burn out.Â  With respect to SCDPS, the Boiters alleged that a citizen's call one\r\n  hour and twenty-seven minutes prior to the accident reporting the outage should\r\n  have resulted in SCDPS notifying a trooper to report to the scene and direct\r\n  traffic.Â Â  The negligence of both agencies is undisputed in this appeal.Â  At\r\n  trial, the jury found in favor of the Boiters and awarded each of them a total of 1.875\r\n  million dollars.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Respondents filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new\r\n  trial, and to reduce the verdict amount pursuant to the Tort Claims Act.Â  In\r\n  response, the Boiters filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the\r\n  two-tier cap in the Tort Claims Act, and in the alternative, asserted that\r\n  Respondents' negligence constituted two separate occurrences under the Act.Â \r\n  The circuit court denied Respondents' motions for judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict and a new trial as well as the Boiters' motion challenging the cap's\r\n  constitutionality, but the court found there was only one occurrence and granted\r\n  Respondents' motion to reduce the verdict pursuant to the Act.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  Boiters' verdict was reduced to $300,000 each, for a total of $600,000.Â Â  This\r\n  appeal followed. \r\nISSUES\r\nThe Boiters raise\r\n  two issues on appeal: \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; Did the circuit court\r\n    err in failing to find that the two-tier cap on damages under the Tort Claims\r\n    Act is unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection?\r\n  (2)&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in failing to\r\n    find that two separate occurrences gave rise to the Boiters' injuries? \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSTITUTIONALITY\r\n  OF CAP\r\nSection 15-78-120\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2005) states the following, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  (1) Except\r\n    as provided in Section 15-78-120(a)(3), no person shall recover . . . a sum\r\n    exceeding three hundred thousand dollars because of loss arising from a single\r\n    occurrence regardless of the number of agencies or political subdivisions\r\n    involved. \r\n  (2) Â Except\r\n    as provided in Section 15-78-120(a)(4), the total sum recovered hereunder\r\n    arising out of a single occurrence shall not exceed six hundred thousand\r\n    dollars regardless of the number of agencies or political subdivisions or\r\n    claims or actions involved. \r\n  (3) No\r\n    person may recover in any action or claim . . . caused by the tort of any\r\n    licensed physician or dentist, employed by a governmental entity and acting\r\n    within the scope of his profession, a sum exceeding one million two hundred\r\n    thousand dollars because of loss arising from a single occurrence . . . .\r\n  (4)&nbsp; The\r\n    total sum recovered hereunder arising out of a single occurrence of liability\r\n    of any governmental entity for any tort caused by any licensed physician or\r\n    dentist, employed by a governmental entity and acting within the scope of his\r\n    profession, may not exceed one million two hundred thousand dollars regardless\r\n    of the number of agencies or political subdivisions or claims or actions\r\n    involved.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a\r\n  two-tier statutory cap on damages exists based on who allegedly committed the\r\n  act.Â  For state-employed physicians and dentists, the cap is 1.2 million\r\n  dollars per person and per occurrence.Â  For all other state entities, the cap\r\n  is $300,000 per person and $600,000 per occurrence.Â Â  The Boiters allege this\r\n  disparate treatment based solely on the identity of the tortfeasor violates their\r\n  constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.\r\nBecause no\r\n  fundamental right has been infringed, we focus our analysis on the rational\r\n  basis test.Â  See Wright v. Colleton County School Dist., 301 S.C. 282,\r\n  291, 391 S.E.2d 564, 570 (1990).Â Â  Under this framework, the Equal Protection\r\n  Clause is satisfied if: (1) the classification bears a reasonable relation to\r\n  the legislative purpose sought to be effected; (2) the members of the class are\r\n  treated alike under similar circumstances and conditions; and (3) the\r\n  classification rests on some reasonable basis.Â  Samson v. Greenville Hospital System, 295 S.C. 359, 368 S.E.2d 665 (1988).Â  &quot;Those attacking the validity of legislation [under the\r\n  rational basis test of the Equal Protection Clause] have the burden to negate\r\n  every conceivable basis which might support it.&quot;Â Â  Lee v. SC Dept. of\r\n    Natural Resources, 339 S.C. 463, 470 n.8, 530 S.E.2d 112, 115 n.8 (2000)\r\n  (citing to Fed'l Commc'ns Comm'n v. Beach Comm'n, Inc., 508 U.S. 307\r\n  (1993)). Â The Boiters argue the two-tier cap's different\r\n  treatment of injured plaintiffs based on the identity of the tortfeasor does\r\n  not have a rational basis sufficient to withstand constitutional scrutiny.Â \r\n  Respondents counter that this Court has consistently upheld the\r\n  constitutionality of the monetary caps, and the Boiters have not put forth\r\n  sufficient evidence to depart from this precedent.Â  \r\nThis Court has\r\n  upheld the constitutionality of the statutory caps in three prior cases.Â  In Wright,\r\n  the Court upheld the general existence of statutory caps. Wright, 301\r\n  S.C. at 292, 391 S.E.2d at 570.Â  There, a child was injured while working with\r\n  a product on the school district's premises.Â Â  Id. at 284, 391 S.E.2d at\r\n  566.Â  Wright, who was the child's mother, and the child filed actions against\r\n  the school district, among other entities.Â  See id.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted judgment to Wright and the child in the amount of $750,000.Â Â  Id. at 285, 391 S.E.2d at 566.Â  Wright and the child appealed, arguing numerous\r\n  constitutional challenges, including equal protection.Â  See id. at 290,\r\n  391 S.E.2d at 569.Â Â  This Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute,\r\n  finding: \r\n\r\n  The limitation on damages as set forth in the statute bears a\r\n    reasonable relationship to the legislative objectives as expressed in Section\r\n    15-78-20(a) of relieving the government from hardships of unlimited and\r\n    unqualified liability and preserving the finite assets of governmental entities\r\n    which are needed for an effective and efficient government.Â  The limitations\r\n    set forth in the statute rest on a reasonable basis and are not arbitrary in\r\n    that the legislature has balanced the needs for services and demand for\r\n    reasonable taxes against the fair reimbursement of injured tort victims.Â \r\n    Finally, we find that the damage limitation provisions apply to similar\r\n    plaintiffs in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nId. at 291, 391 S.E.2d at 570. \r\nIn Foster v.\r\n  South Carolina Department of Highways &amp; Public Transportation, 306 S.C.\r\n  519, 413 S.E.2d 31 (1992), the Court had an opportunity to examine the two-tier\r\n  cap at issue in this case.Â  Foster sued the Highway Department after she was\r\n  involved in a car accident, claiming the Highway Department failed to give\r\n  proper warning of a low shoulder and failed to maintain the highway.Â Â  Foster\r\n  was awarded three million dollars, and the circuit court reduced the verdict\r\n  amount to $250,000.Â  Id. at 522, 413 S.E.2d at 33-34.Â  Foster appealed,\r\n  claiming the two-tier cap was unconstitutional as a violation of her right to\r\n  equal protection.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court found\r\n  Foster, as the party asserting the unconstitutionality of the statute, failed\r\n  to meet her burden of proof to show that the classification was arbitrary and\r\n  without any reasonable basis.Â  See id. at 526-27, 413 S.E.2d at 36.Â  The\r\n  Court noted that it affords great deference to a legislative classification and\r\n  will uphold a classification if it is &quot;not plainly arbitrary and there is\r\n  any reasonable hypothesis to support it.&quot;Â  Id. at 526, 413 S.E.2d\r\n  at 36.Â  In finding against Foster, we said, &quot;The fact that the\r\n  classification results in some inequity does not render it in violation of the\r\n  Constitution.&quot; Id. at 527, 413 S.E.2d at 36 (citing State v.\r\n    Smith, 271 S.C. 317, 247 S.E.2d 331 (1978)).Â Â  The Court also articulated a\r\n  specific basis found in the statute for the two tiers: &quot;These higher\r\n  limits and mandated coverages are recognition by the General Assembly of\r\n  significantly higher damages in cases of medical malpractice.&quot;Â Â  In\r\n  regards to Foster's burden of proof, the Court instructed, \r\n\r\n  Foster\r\n    must offer evidence that the legislative finding of higher awards in actions of\r\n    medical malpractice was unfounded and thus no rational basis for the classification\r\n    existed. She has not met her burden of proof by the bare assertion that her\r\n    damages are as high as damages that might be assessed against a physician or\r\n    dentist.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nSixteen years\r\n  after Foster, this Court decided Giannini v. South Carolina\r\n    Department of Transportation, 378 S.C. 573, 664 S.E.2d 450 (2008).Â  There,\r\n  a car hydroplaned and crossed into the other lane of traffic, striking two\r\n  cars; one person was killed and two others suffered serious bodily injuries.Â  Id. at 578, 664 S.E.2d at 452.Â  After citing to both Wright and Foster,\r\n  this Court found the &quot;[l]egislature's aggregate limitation on liability is\r\n  supported by a rational basis such that there is no equal protection violation.&quot;Â  Id. at 584, 664 S.E.2d at 456.Â Â  This Court noted the legislation was in\r\n  line with the purposes of preserving finite governmental assets and treating\r\n  similar plaintiffs in a similar manner.Â  See id.Â Â  This Court then cited\r\n  to cases from other jurisdictions which have also held that general liability\r\n  caps do not violate equal protection.Â  See id. at 585, 664 S.E.2d at 456\r\n  (citing Wilson v. Gipson, 753 P.2d 1349 (Ok. 1988) and Lee v.\r\n    Colorado Dep't of Health, 718 P.2d 221 (Colo. 1986)).Â  \r\nWith these three\r\n  cases in mind, we now turn to the Boiters' argument.Â  At the hearing before the\r\n  circuit court on the constitutionality of the two-tier system, the Boiters\r\n  produced substantial evidence in the form of national and state studies\r\n  designed to establish that there is no empirical evidence to justify the\r\n  difference in the respective caps. Â Â The Boiters submitted the following in support\r\n  of the cap's unconstitutionality: (1) Three U.S. Department of Justice\r\n  Bulletins detailing the number of trials and verdicts in large counties for\r\n  civil cases, tort cases, and medical malpractice cases; (2) U.S. Department of\r\n  Justice report on Medical Malpractice Insurance Claims in Seven States[1]; (3) South Carolina Legislative Audit\r\n  Council Report in 2000 and 2004, reviewing the Medical Malpractice Compensation\r\n  Fund; (4) SCDOT and SCDPS budgets for 2007- 2008; and (5) correspondence from the\r\n  State Budget and Control Board, Boiters' counsel, and Respondents' counsels\r\n  regarding the above reports.Â  The Boiters argue that consistent with the degree\r\n  of proof suggested by the Court in Foster, they introduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate the\r\n  constitutional infirmity in the two-tier system. Â However,\r\n  even taking all of their evidence into account, it cannot overcome the great\r\n  deference this Court must give to the General Assembly's stated\r\n  classification.Â  Under settled principles, we will sustain such classifications\r\n  if any reasonable hypothesis exists to support them.Â  Samson, 295\r\n  S.C. at 367, 368 S.E.2d at 665; Foster, 306 S.C. at 526, 413 S.E.2d at\r\n  36. \r\nÂ Two reasonable\r\n  hypotheses exist in the code to substantiate section 15-78-120: (1) relieving\r\n  the government from the hardships of unlimited liability; and (2) furthering\r\n  accountable and competent healthcare while promoting affordable medical\r\n  liability insurance.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(a), (g) (2005).Â \r\n  The evidence submitted by the Boiters before the circuit court does not overcome\r\n  these two reasonable hypotheses, and we\r\n  are not persuaded that the General Assembly's two-tier classification is arbitrary or without rational basis.Â  Moreover, our precedent\r\n  in this area, although perhaps not as compelling from a factual or evidentiary\r\n  standpoint as this case, convinces us that the Boiters' constitutional\r\n  challenge should be denied.Â  Therefore, we find that the two-tier cap meets the\r\n  rational basis test, and we affirm the circuit court's finding of\r\n  constitutionality. \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; OCCURRENCE\r\nThe Boiters argue\r\n  that the circuit court erred in failing to find two separate occurrences in the\r\n  two separate acts of negligence committed by SCDOT and SCDPS.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUnder Section\r\n  15-78-30(g) of the South Carolina Code (2005), &quot;occurrence&quot; is\r\n  defined as an &quot;unfolding sequence of events which proximately flow from a\r\n  single act of negligence.&quot;Â Â  In its order denying the Boiters' arguments\r\n  that there were two separate occurrences, the circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n  The Plaintiffs present a logical argument as to the statutory\r\n    construction of the term 'occurrence,' but under the facts of this case, where\r\n    the jury's verdict has to be read as finding both Defendants as concurrently at\r\n    fault in bringing about the damages to the Plaintiffs, the definition of\r\n    occurrence limits the award to the statutory cap.\r\n\r\nÂ We disagree and\r\n  find the facts here present a classic case of two occurrences.\r\nQuestions of\r\n  statutory construction are a matter of law.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp;\r\n    Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).Â  &quot;All\r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative\r\n  intent must prevail if it reasonably can be discovered in the language used,\r\n  and the language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the\r\n  statute.&quot;Â  Sumter Police Dep't v. Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371,\r\n  375, 498 S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  &quot;In construing statutory\r\n  language, the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of\r\n  the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given\r\n  effect.&quot;Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611,\r\n  620, 503 S.E.2d 471, 476 (1998).Â  \r\nOnly one appellate\r\n  case[2] in South Carolina has considered the\r\n  issue of occurrence under section 15-78-30.Â  In Chastain v. AnMed Health Foundation, 388 S.C. 170, 694 S.E.2d\r\n  541 (2010), the plaintiff suffered severe and permanent injuries as a result of\r\n  the poor care given to her by six nurses at AnMed, a charitable institution. Id. at 171-72, 694 S.E.2d at 542.Â  The jury returned a general verdict against\r\n  AnMed for 2.2 million dollars, and the trial judge reduced it to the $300,000\r\n  statutory cap based on his finding of one occurrence. Id. at 172-73, 694\r\n  S.E.2d at 542-43.Â  In affirming the verdict reduction, this Court noted that\r\n  the burden to prove more than one occurrence rested on the plaintiff and that\r\n  from the general verdict rendered, it was impossible to conclude that the jury\r\n  had found more than one occurrence.Â  Id. at 174, 695 S.E.2d at\r\n  543.Â Â  Because the facts presented here are so different than those involved in Chastain, that case provides little guidance to us.\r\nCases from other\r\n  jurisdictions are similarly inapposite because they involve a single\r\n  governmental entity which committed multiple acts of negligence, a completely\r\n  different situation than the one before us.Â  See Tex. Dep't of Mental Health\r\n    &amp; Mental Retardation v. Petty By &amp; Through Kauffman, 848 S.W.2d 680\r\n  (Tex. 1992) (one occurrence after department committed multiple acts of\r\n  negligence); Folz v. State, 797 P.2d 246 (N.M. 1990) (negligence by\r\n  highway department which resulted in truck striking five separate vehicles in\r\n  collision was only one occurrence under statute); cf. Brooks v.\r\n    Memphis &amp; Shelby County Hosp. Auth., 717 S.W.2d 292 (Tenn. App. 1986)\r\n  (finding two occurrences when one employee negligently let patient fall off\r\n  stretcher and a second employee negligently gave an overdose of medication,\r\n  resulting in patient's death).Â  Accordingly, we determine the issue before us\r\n  based solely on the peculiar facts of this case.\r\nIn order to\r\n  determine the number of occurrences, the Boiters urge this Court to focus on\r\n  the number of negligent acts; in contrast, Respondents contend we should look\r\n  to the number of injuries caused by those acts.Â  The circuit court specifically\r\n  found in its order that &quot;each of [the Respondents] committed a separate\r\n  wrongful act that led to the damages,&quot; and that &quot;[t]he wrongful acts\r\n  [of Respondents] were separate and distinct.&quot;Â Â  Nevertheless, the circuit\r\n  court found that each act of negligence was &quot;a part of the same 'unfolding\r\n  sequence of events' that resulted in the Boiters' damages.&quot;Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court accepted Respondents' argument and equated occurrence with\r\n  the number of injuries sustained by the Boiters.Â Â  While we do not adopt a\r\n  bright-line test based on the existence of multiple acts of negligence, we find\r\n  the circuit court erred in tying the number of occurrences to the number of\r\n  injuries sustained by the Boiters.\r\nWe are persuaded\r\n  that two independent and separate acts of negligence occurred here - one by\r\n  SCDOT and one by SCDPS.Â  There is no indication that the Respondents' actions\r\n  combined to form a single act of negligence. Unlike the situation presented in Chastain, we have two separate and\r\n  distinct acts of negligence involving two separate and distinct entities\r\n  together with separate verdicts against each of them.Â \r\n  As found by the jury, SCDOT was negligent in not having a re-lamping policy in\r\n  place, and SCDPS was negligent in not following its own policy to notify a\r\n  SCDOT technician when a light had burned out.Â  Based on the facts presented\r\n  here, we cannot see how SCDOT's negligent act &quot;unfolded&quot; into SCDPS'\r\n  negligent act.Â  SCDPS only became involved due to a citizen call regarding the\r\n  burned-out light bulb; SCDOT never called SCDPS regarding the light, and SCDPS\r\n  never informed SCDOT about the citizen call.Â Â  We can find no causal connection\r\n  between the actions of SCDOT and SCDPS; had the jury not found SCDOT negligent,\r\n  the verdict against SCDPS could still stand, and the converse is also true.Â \r\n  Therefore, we do not believe that these two separate and independent acts of\r\n  negligence constituted an unfolding sequence of events which injured the\r\n  Boiters. \r\nRespondents cite\r\n  to language found in section 15-78-120(2),[3] arguing that it demonstrates the General Assembly's recognition that the number\r\n  of governmental entities involved in a particular occurrence does not increase\r\n  the statutory limits on liability.Â  While we do not disagree with Respondents'\r\n  view, we do not believe this ends the inquiry.Â  In many situations, negligent\r\n  acts from more than one entity would still equal but one occurrence.Â  However,\r\n  under these facts, there were two separate entities which committed two\r\n  separate and independent acts of negligence, and we do not believe the General\r\n  Assembly's intent was to limit recovery in such situations based on there being\r\n  only one occurrence.Â  Accordingly, we hold each Respondent's act of negligence\r\n  was a separate occurrence entitling the Boiters to a combined verdict of 1.2\r\n  million dollars, and we reverse the circuit court. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the\r\n  two-tier statutory cap on damages is constitutional against an equal protection\r\n  challenge.Â  However, we also hold that more than one occurrence existed in this\r\n  situation.Â  Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part the circuit court's\r\n  order.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\r\n  part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with\r\n  the majority that the differential caps created by the Tort Claims Act (TCA)\r\n  are constitutional.Â  I disagree, however, with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that\r\n  there was more than one occurrence here.Â  I would therefore affirm the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order.\r\nIn my opinion, the majority\r\n  errs when it focuses on the number of acts of negligence rather than on the\r\n  TCAâ€™s definition of occurrence:Â  â€œan unfolding sequence of events which proximately\r\n  flow from a single act of negligence.â€Â  S.C.

Â§ 15-78-30(g) (2005).Â \r\n  Under the TCA, an occurrence is not defined by the number of individual\r\n  acts of negligence, nor does it require, as would the majority, a â€œcausal\r\n  connectionâ€ between these independent acts.Â  Here, appellantsâ€™ theory was that\r\n  as the result of the SCDOTâ€™s negligent failure to have a replacement bulb\r\n  policy a traffic light was not functioning properly, and when a concerned\r\n  citizen notified SCDPS of the dangerous situation, that agency negligently\r\n  failed to send a trooper to the scene to direct traffic.Â  This unfolding\r\n  sequence of events proximately led to the accident and appellants losses.\r\nIn my view, an occurrence is\r\n  not defined by the number of agencies involved, or by the acts of negligence\r\n  committed, nor by temporal proximity.Â  Instead, the occurrence ends when the\r\n  unfolding sequence of events is broken by an unnatural or intervening cause.Â \r\n  Here, there was no such break, and thus appellants each suffered only one\r\n  compensable loss as the result of a single occurrence.\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] South Carolina was not one of the seven states\r\n  discussed in this report.Â  \r\n[2] In Williamson v. South Carolina\r\n  Insurance Reserve Fund, two different physicians examined a mother during\r\n  childbirth and failed to take necessary steps, at different times during the\r\n  delivery, to prevent harm to the child.Â  See 355 S.C. 420, 422, 586\r\n  S.E.2d 115, 116 (2003).Â  The circuit court found two occurrences had been\r\n  established for purposes of the Tort Claims Act because neither doctorâ€™s\r\n  actions was the result of the other's.Â  See id. at 423, 586 S.E.2d at\r\n  116.Â  On appeal, this Court declined to address whether two occurrences\r\n  existed.Â  See id. at 426, 586 S.E.2d at 118. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[3] The subsection notes that liability is limited\r\n  to $600,000 regardless of the number of agencies or political subdivisions\r\n  involved. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26982","title":"McConnell v.

Hitchcock, John P. Hazzard, IV, Kenneth M. Moffitt, of\r\n          Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Kevin A. Hall, Karl S. Bowers, Jr., and M. Todd Carroll, of Hall\r\n          &amp; Bowers, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondent and Intervenors.\r\n        Thaddaeus Viers, pro se, of Myrtle Beach, for Amicus Curiae. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL, JUSTICE BEATTY, AND JUSTICE HEARN: Petitioner asks this Court, in its original\r\n  jurisdiction, to declare an executive order issued by respondent to be an\r\n  unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers and to enjoin,\r\n  temporarily and permanently, the implementation and effects of the executive\r\n  order.Â  We grant the petition for original jurisdiction, dispense with further\r\n  briefing, and stay the executive order.\r\n\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina General Assembly adopted a sine die resolution on June 1, 2011,\r\n  providing for the extension of the regular 2011 annual session after\r\n  adjournment at 5:00 p.m. on June 2, 2011.Â  The resolution requires the General\r\n  Assembly to reconvene on June 14, 2011, and continue in session no later than\r\n  July 1, 2011.Â  In addition, the resolution sets forth the matters which the\r\n  General Assembly may consider during the extended session.Â  On June 2, 2011,\r\n  respondent issued an executive order requiring an extra session of the General\r\n  Assembly to convene at 10:00 a.m. on June 7, 2011.Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Const. art. I, Â§ 8 provides: &quot;the legislative, executive, and\r\n  judicial powers of the government shall be forever separate and distinct from\r\n  each other, and no person or persons exercising the functions of one of said\r\n  departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.&quot;Â  The\r\n  executive order challenged by petitioner was issued pursuant to S.C. Const.\r\n  art. IV, Â§ 19.Â  That section provides, &quot;[t]he Governor may on\r\n    extraordinary occasions convene the General Assembly in extra session.&quot; Â (emphasis added). Â The term &quot;extraordinary occasions&quot;\r\n  is not defined by the Constitution.Â  \r\nState constitutional provisions will not be construed to\r\n  impose limitations beyond their clear meaning.Â  Segars-Andrews v. Judicial\r\n    Merit Selection Comm'n, 387 S.C. 109, 691 S.E.2d 453 (2010).Â  Because\r\n  there is no indication in the Constitution as to what constitutes an\r\n  &quot;extraordinary occasion&quot; to justify an extra session of the General\r\n  Assembly, this matter must be left to the discretion of the Governor and this\r\n  Court may notÂ  review that decision.Â  See Farrelly v. Cole, 56 P. 492\r\n  (Kan. 1899).Â  \r\nHowever, S.C. Const. art. IV, Â§ 19 limits the Governor's power\r\n  to convening only an &quot;extra&quot; session of the General\r\n  Assembly.Â  Although the General Assembly is currently in recess, it has not\r\n  adjourned sine die and, therefore, is still in its annual session.Â  Under\r\n  these specific facts, respondent cannot convene an &quot;extra&quot; session of the General Assembly since it is currently in session.Â  To do so\r\n  would interrupt the annual session and would violate the General Assembly's\r\n  authority to set its calendar and agenda and would constitute a violation of\r\n  the separation of powers provision.Â  See S.C. Const. art. III, Â§9 (the\r\n  General Assembly has the authority to recede for a time period from its regular\r\n  annual session); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-1-180 (2005) (the General Assembly may\r\n  extend its regular annual session).Â  Respondent may only convene an extra session of the General Assembly after the sine die adjournment.[1]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we grant the request to permanently stay and enjoin the executive\r\n  order dated June 2, 2011.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  I would accept the Petition in the Court's original jurisdiction, and then\r\n  dismiss the Petition.Â  The Governor has the absolute authority under the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution to convene the General Assembly in extra session &quot;on\r\n  extraordinary occasions,&quot; and Petitioner so concurs.Â  The Petition's sole\r\n  objection to the Governor's exercise of convening an extra session is that the\r\n  matters included in the Governor's Executive Order are not included in the\r\n  General Assembly's sine die resolution.Â  Moreover, the Petition even\r\n  acknowledges the Governor's authority to convene an extra session exists prior\r\n  to expiration of the sine die resolution &quot;to address matters that were\r\n  truly unforeseen at the time the sine die resolution was adopted.&quot;Â  The\r\n  Petition gives examples of an intervening natural disaster or an unanticipated\r\n  drop in tax revenues.Â  The inescapable conclusion is that the Petition seeks to\r\n  assess the merits of the Governor's decision to call an extra session.Â  The\r\n  exercise of discretion in this regard by a Governor is unassailable, and the law\r\n  in this regard is uniform.\r\n\r\n  Under\r\n    most constitutions, the governor's power to call a special legislative session\r\n    is absolute, and his opinion concerning the existence of an emergency or\r\n    special circumstances demanding immediate legislative attention is\r\n    unimpeachable by the courts.\r\n\r\n1 Sutherland Statutory\r\n  Construction Â§ 5.5, at 235 (7th ed. 2010).\r\n\r\n  Where\r\n    the constitution authorizes the calling of such [special] sessions by the\r\n    governor, he or she is the sole judge as to whether occasion for such session\r\n    exists, and the exercise of such discretion is not subject to challenge or\r\n    review by the courts.\r\n\r\n81A C.J.S. States Â§\r\n  105, at 438 (2004).\r\nRather\r\n  than deal with the legal issue as presented in the Petition, the majority\r\n  recasts the issue as one of &quot;timing&quot; and focuses on the word\r\n  &quot;extra.&quot;Â  The basis for the majority's decision is not even argued by\r\n  Petitioner.Â  \r\n I\r\n  would follow the prevailing law in this country and dismiss the Petition.Â  I\r\n  would adhere to the analysis of the Kansas Supreme Court in Farrelly v. Cole,\r\n  56 P. 492 (Kan. 1899):\r\n\r\n  It would\r\n    be an unseemly and unprecedented proceeding for this court, or any court, to\r\n    entertain a controversy wherein, by proof obtained from witnesses sworn in the\r\n    cause, it sought to ascertain judicially whether an extraordinary occasion\r\n    existed, of sufficient gravity to authorize the governor to convene the\r\n    legislature in extra session. If jurisdiction is retained of such a cause, what\r\n    is the rule as to the quantum of evidence necessary to establish that there was\r\n    no emergency? . . . It perverts and destroys the meaning of the word to hold\r\n    that exercise of discretion may be reviewed or controlled by some other person\r\n    or tribunal than the person on whom it is conferred.\r\n\r\nId. at 497.\r\n As for\r\n  the General Assembly's response to the Governor's called extra session, it is\r\n  free to act as it deems appropriate in the exercise of its constitutional\r\n  authority.Â  In other words, the convening of an extra session by the Governor\r\n  in no manner compels the General Assembly to address the matters raised by the\r\n  Governor in any particular manner or fashion.Â  The Farrelly Court\r\n  addressed this matter as well:\r\n\r\n  Now, the\r\n    legislature are to enact the laws upon their own view of necessity and\r\n    expediency and they will refuse to pass the desired statute, if they regard it\r\n    as unwise or unimportant. Â But in so doing they indirectly review the governor's\r\n    decision, especially if, in refusing to pass the law, they do so on the ground\r\n    that the specific event was not one calling for action on their part. Â In such\r\n    case it is clear that while the decision of the governor is final, so far as to\r\n    require the legislature to meet, it is not final in any sense that would bind\r\n    the legislative department to accept and act upon it when they enter upon the\r\n    performance of their duty in the making of laws.\r\n\r\nId. at 500.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] If an extra session is properly convened, there is no\r\n  requirement that the General Assembly act on the bills referred to by\r\n  respondent.Â  Although the Governor may convene the extra session, she may not\r\n  dictate the manner in which the General Assembly proceeds at that session or\r\n  the topics considered.Â  Farrelly v.

Â Complainant C obtained the assistance of another\r\n  attorney to contact respondent to determine why the monies had not been\r\n  disbursed as set forth by the Settlement Statement.Â  On or about January 17,\r\n  2007, respondent paid the insurance assessment and late charges to Complainant\r\n  C.Â Â  \r\nIn addition, according to the Settlement Statement,\r\n  respondent was to withhold $5,259.94 from the seller for disbursement to the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Revenue.Â  The monies payable to the Department of\r\n  Revenue were not received in a timely manner.Â  \r\nRespondent maintains that, after the closing, he permitted\r\n  his paralegal to make the disbursements from his trust account consistent with\r\n  the Settlement Statement.Â  Respondent acknowledges he did not adequately\r\n  supervise the disbursements. Â In addition, he acknowledges that he did not\r\n  reconcile his trust account as required under Rule 417, SCACR, which prevented\r\n  him from discovering the errors more quickly.Â  Respondent has now paid the\r\n  overdue tax monies to the Department of Revenue.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nOn June 29, 2009, respondent conducted a real estate closing\r\n  in which Complainant D was refinancing his current mortgages.Â  Lend America was\r\n  the lender in this transaction.Â  Respondent was retained by Carolina Attorney\r\n  Network Services to perform the closing.Â  \r\nAfter the closing, respondent forwarded the executed\r\n  documents to Lend America for disbursement and recordation of the new\r\n  mortgage.Â  Respondent did not record the new mortgage and failed to take any\r\n  affirmative action to confirm that the mortgage was properly recorded.Â  Respondent\r\n  represents that he did request the appropriate disbursement documents from\r\n  Carolina Attorney Network Services.Â  The initial mortgages were not paid off by\r\n  Lend America until August 3, 2009.Â  \r\nRespondent was not informed of the difficulties with the\r\n  closing until he was contacted by Complainant D on September 8, 2009.Â \r\n  Respondent attempted to assist in resolving Complainant D's issues with Lend\r\n  America until Complainant D indicated that he wanted respondent to bring a\r\n  lawsuit against Lend America.Â  Respondent informed Complainant D that he would\r\n  have to retain new counsel.Â  \r\n  LAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has\r\n  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule\r\n  1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client property), Rule 4.5 (lawyer shall not\r\n  threaten to present professional disciplinary charges solely to obtain an\r\n  advantage in a civil matter), and Rule 8.1(a) (lawyer shall not knowingly make\r\n  a false statement of material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent further admits that he violated the recordkeeping\r\n  provisions of Rule 417, SCACR. Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and\r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct. Â In addition, respondent\r\n  shall pay the costs associated with the investigation and prosecution of this\r\n  matter.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26984","title":"Doe v.

Peter Shahid, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondents the\r\n          Bishop of Charleston, a Corporation Sole, et al.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal follows a long and complex series of\r\n  motions related to a class action settlement that was administered in\r\n  Dorchester County.Â  The underlying class action dealt with allegations that\r\n  certain minors were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of agents of the\r\n  Diocese of Charleston.[1]Â  Appellants objected to\r\n  and opted out of the class action, then reached an independent settlement with\r\n  the Diocese.Â  Pursuant to that settlement, Appellants executed releases that\r\n  explicitly discharged all claims against the Diocese.Â  We dismiss this\r\n  appeal as moot.\r\nI.\r\nThe plaintiffs in the underlying class action consisted\r\n  of two classes: one for victims of childhood sexual abuse by agents of the\r\n  Diocese and one for the spouses and parents of victims.Â  As chief\r\n  administrative judge for Dorchester County, Judge Goodstein designated the case\r\n  &quot;complex,&quot; and she assigned herself exclusive jurisdiction over it.Â  Judge\r\n  Goodstein subsequently approved a settlement in the class action over\r\n  Appellants' objections.Â  Appellants moved to alter or amend the order approving\r\n  the settlement.\r\nWhile Appellants' motion to alter or amend was\r\n  pending, they reached a separate settlement agreement (&quot;the opt-out\r\n  agreement&quot;) with the Diocese and class counsel.Â  This agreement provided\r\n  that the Diocese would pay Appellants $1.375 million to settle their  claims, in\r\n  exchange for Appellants' agreement to opt out of the class action, execute\r\n  releases, and withdraw all pending motions and objections with prejudice.Â  Judge\r\n  Goodstein entered an order dated August 31, 2007, approving the agreement and\r\n  adopting it as the order of the court to the extent that it resolved the\r\n  pending motions and objections.\r\nOn March 6, 2008, Appellants filed a complaint in Charleston\r\n  County alleging payment was due under the opt-out agreement.Â  Because the\r\n  opt-out agreement arose from the Dorchester County class action, the Diocese\r\n  moved to enforce the opt-out agreement in Dorchester County and to deposit the $1.375\r\n  million with the Dorchester County clerk of court.Â  Appellants moved to dismiss\r\n  the Diocese's Dorchester County motions and moved for Judge Goodstein to recuse\r\n  herself.\r\nJudge Goodstein held a hearing on these motions on January\r\n  29, 2009.Â  After Judge Goodstein orally denied Appellants' motions to dismiss\r\n  and to recuse, Appellants moved to compel the Diocese to pay the $1.375 million\r\n  plus pre or postjudgment interest.\r\nFollowing the January 29 hearing, and while\r\n  Appellants' motions for interest remained under advisement, Appellants signed\r\n  releases bearing the title &quot;FULL AND COMPLETE RELEASE,&quot; which provided\r\n  in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  For and\r\n    in consideration of my having received payment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hereby\r\n    release, acquit, and forever discharge: The Diocese of Charleston . . . from\r\n    any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, costs, loss of\r\n    services, expenses and compensation, up to and including the date of this\r\n    release, on account of, or in any way growing out of:\r\n\r\n1. The\r\n  obligations under the letter agreement dated August 30, 2007, incorporated into\r\n  and adopted as an order of the Dorchester County Court of Common Pleas dated\r\n  August 31, 2007 . . .;\r\n. . . .\r\n3. Any\r\n  and all claims and/or allegations contained in or relating to the civil action\r\n  styled Johns Doe C et al. v. The Diocese of Charleston, et al. . . . now\r\n  pending in the Court of Common Pleas for the Ninth Judicial Circuit (the\r\n  &quot;Charleston case&quot;), or which could have been alleged in the\r\n  Charleston case;\r\n4. Further,\r\n  in consideration of said payment, I do hereby authorize and direct my attorney\r\n  to dismiss with prejudice the Charleston case, now pending in the Circuit Court\r\n  for Charleston County.\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  It is\r\n    further understood and agreed that there is no promise or agreement on the part\r\n    of the persons, firms and corporations who are hereby released to do or omit to\r\n    do any act or thing not herein mentioned, that this Release contains the entire\r\n    agreement between the parties hereto, and that the terms of this Release are\r\n    contractual and not a mere recital.\r\n\r\nThe releases were provided to the Dorchester County clerk\r\n  of court in exchange for payment of the $1.375 million on deposit with the\r\n  clerk.Â  As a result, Appellants' counsel received the funds due under the opt-out\r\n  agreement.Â  Thereafter, by order dated March 23, 2009, Judge Goodstein ended\r\n  the matter and denied Appellants' motions for pre and postjudgment interest.\r\n\r\nAppellants now appeal the denial of their motions and raise\r\n  challenges to the class action settlement from which they opted out.Â  We\r\n  certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.\r\nII.\r\nAppellants opted out of the class action settlement, released\r\n  all claims against the Diocese, and received payment in exchange for their\r\n  releases.Â  Thus, as a practical matter, the only relief Appellants could\r\n  receive from a judgment in their favor is an award of prejudgment interest.[2]Â \r\n  However, Appellants waived any right to interest when they signed releases discharging\r\n  the Diocese from liability for all &quot;actions, causes of action, claims, demands\r\n  .&nbsp;. . and compensation, up to and including the date of th[e] release.&quot;Â \r\n  The releases did not reserve any rights as to any pending motions.Â  Rather, by\r\n  their plain language, the releases resolved all of Appellants' claims.Â  See Southern Glass &amp; Plastics Co. v. Duke, 367 S.C. 421, 428, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  19, 22 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;A release is a contract, and the scope of a\r\n  release is gathered by its terms.&quot; (citing Gardner v. City of Columbia\r\n    Police Dep't, 216 S.C. 219, 223, 57 S.E.2d 308, 309-10 (1950))).Â  Therefore,\r\n  this appeal is moot.Â  Sloan v. Friends of the Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20,\r\n  26, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006) (&quot;A moot case exists where a judgment\r\n  rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon an existing\r\n  controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of effectual relief\r\n  impossible for the reviewing court.&quot;).\r\nMoreover, while Appellants now present us with\r\n  complaints about the administration of the class action, Appellants opted out\r\n  of the class and thus could not be harmed by any of the irregularities they\r\n  allege.Â  In fact, Appellants assert their opt-out agreement afforded them more\r\n  favorable relief than the class action settlement would have.Â  Thus, Appellants\r\n  can claim no harm from the manner in which the class action settlement was\r\n  handled.Â  See Bivens v. Knight, 254 S.C. 10, 13, 173 S.E.2d 150,\r\n  152 (1970) (&quot;A party . . . cannot appeal from a decision which does not\r\n  affect his interest, however erroneous and prejudicial it may be to the rights\r\n  and interests of some other person.&quot;).\r\nAt oral argument, perhaps in\r\n  recognition of the fact that Appellants have waived all claims by their\r\n  releases, Appellants' counsel insisted that this appeal was not moot because\r\n  John Doe B did not sign the release quoted above.Â  This assertion is without\r\n  merit.Â  John Doe Bâ€™s claim is not before this Court.Â  Â Â John Doe B did not fall\r\n  within the definition of the class, nor was he a party to the opt-out agreement\r\n  the Diocese sought to enforce.Â  Rather, it appears that the Appellants may have\r\n  agreed among themselves to distribute a portion of their settlement to John Doe\r\n  B.Â  No exceptions to the order on appeal were made on John Doe B's behalf, and Appellants'\r\n  counsel conceded at oral argument that John Doe B's separate claim against the\r\n  Diocese has been resolved by agreement and John Doe B has signed a release.Â  In\r\n  sum, the attempt by Appellants to resurrect this appeal through John Doe B is without\r\n  merit.\r\nIII.\r\nWe dismiss this appeal as moot.Â \r\n  Appellants executed full and complete releases without any reservation of\r\n  rights, and they received the funds due to them under the opt-out agreement in\r\n  return.Â  Moreover, Appellants have no stake in the issues they raise regarding\r\n  the class action settlement because they opted out of the class.Â  Thus, a\r\n  decision in Appellants' favor would have no practical effect.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For simplicity, we refer to both &quot;the Bishop of\r\n  Charleston, a Corporation Sole,&quot; and the Bishop of the Diocese of Charleston,\r\n  in his official capacity, as &quot;the Diocese.&quot;\r\n[2] If Appellants were entitled to interest, it would be\r\n  prejudgment interest, not postjudgment interest, because the funds due under\r\n  the opt-out agreement were not payable immediately upon entry of the August 31,\r\n  2007, order. Â The opt-out agreement provided: &quot;The $1.375 million will be\r\n  paid from the surplus funds, if any, after the [class action] claims process\r\n  has been completed. . . . Payment is expected sometime after January 1,\r\n  2008.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26985","title":"Rockville Haven v.

Building Orientation, in that\r\n  &quot;proposed structures shall not impede scenic rural views from the main\r\n  road, from existing structures or from natural settings&quot; (the Guideline).\r\nAlthough appellants raise\r\n  numerous issues on appeal, we find it necessary to address only one:[4]\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    circuit court err in finding evidentiary support for the DRB's conclusion that\r\n    the proposed dock and walkway would impede a scenic rural view?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe sole question before the\r\n  Court is whether there is evidence that the view across the marsh from the\r\n  road, admittedly both rural and scenic, would be impeded by appellants' dock\r\n  and walkway.Â  In finding evidence supporting the DRB's conclusion that it\r\n  would, the circuit court relied upon the statements of two interested persons\r\n  (Vinson and Brabham) at a DRB meeting, and upon aerial photographs of the area\r\n  submitted at this same meeting.Â  A close reading of the two statements reveals\r\n  nothing related to the purported impediment which would be created by this\r\n  proposed dock and walkway, nor do the aerial photos demonstrate that the view\r\n  from the roadway would be impeded by a handrail-less dock and walkway\r\n  constructed at marsh level.Â  Moreover, the Guideline does not purport to forbid\r\n  the construction of structures such docks and walkways, but simply requires\r\n  that they be constructed, â€œwhere reasonably practical,â€ so as not to obstruct\r\n  scenic rural views. \r\nMs. Vinson spoke generally\r\n  about the beauty of unspoiled places, other municipalities with dock\r\n  ordinances, and warned of the dangers of allowing a dock in this area and the\r\n  precedent it will set.Â  As for this particular dock, the DRB report reflects:\r\nThere\r\n  is not much to be gained by allowing this dock, a boat can't be put into it and\r\n  it is not navigable[5] in her view.Â  The property owner may be able to get a slightly different view\r\n  but would not really gain a particular [sic] better one by standing on the road\r\n  and looking over the marsh or from his home.Â  The reason the ordinance was\r\n  created was to protect the view.\r\nThe DRB report reflects this\r\n  regarding Ms. Brabham's statements:\r\n\r\n  She has\r\n    studied this a good bit, and that she fears the precedent that would be set if\r\n    a dock is built is very risky, knowing that there are other houses above\r\n    [appellants'], and other small creeks (such as the creek behind her home) would\r\n    also be placed at risk, thus interrupting and upsetting the scenery of the\r\n    marshes of the town.Â  You can see it from the road and other people's houses,\r\n    and from experience, noting her little creek behind her home being the same as\r\n    this, the OCRM did not let her know of the dock that was being built to come up\r\n    right up to her marsh viewâ€¦[t]he dock stops the eye and the beautiful expanse\r\n    she did have is cut off, not blocked out but cut off.Â  &quot;The scenic and\r\n    rural views from the town that DRB is supposed to protect need to be thought\r\n    about as this makes all other small creeks at riskâ€¦I know how it looks.Â  My\r\n    main objection is the precedent of allowing the first one.&quot;\r\n\r\nMs. Vinson and Ms. Brabham\r\n  offered no evidence that appellants' dock and walkway would impede a scenic\r\n  rural view, instead raising concerns about the impact of multiple docks on such\r\n  views.Â  In addition, Ms. Brabham stated that her view was &quot;cut off&quot;\r\n  by an existing dock, but did not suggest whether that dock had handrails or was\r\n  built at marsh height.Â  The only statement of the impact of appellants'\r\n  proposed dock and walkway was given by a code enforcement officer, who\r\n  acknowledged that it would &quot;almost disappear&quot; and be &quot;hidden\r\n  from view.&quot;\r\nWe agree with respondents\r\n  that state law permits local governments to require docks and walkways comply\r\n  with local laws and regulations, including those which address aesthetic\r\n  concerns.Â  Here, however, there is simply nothing in the record to support the\r\n  DRB's finding, affirmed by the circuit court, that appellants' dock and walkway\r\n  would impede a scenic rural view within the meaning of the Guideline.Â  For this\r\n  reason, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Merrill subsequently assigned the permit to appellant Rockville Haven, LLC.Â  \r\n[2] See Rockville Town Code Â§ 5.109 (2009); Town of Rockville Unified Dev.\r\n  Ord., Appendix C.Â  \r\n[3] See S.C.

Â§Â§ 30-4-10 to -165 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2010) (FOIA).Â  Friends denied\r\n  that it was subject to FOIA and declined to produce the documents for Sloan.\r\nSloan filed a\r\n  complaint on July 18, 2001, seeking production of the documents based on Friends'\r\n  status either as a public body under FOIA or as an alter ego of the Hunley\r\n  Commission.Â  On August 16, 2001, approximately one month later, Friends fully complied\r\n  with Sloan's document request, but stated that it was not tendering the\r\n  documents &quot;due to any concession that [Friends] is subject to the Freedom\r\n  of Information Act,&quot; but &quot;in the spirit of cooperation.&quot;Â \r\n  Following a series of cross-motions, the trial court granted Friends' motion\r\n  for summary judgment, finding Sloan lacked standing to maintain the action and\r\n  that no justiciable controversy existed since Friends had produced the very\r\n  documents sought in the complaint.\r\nSloan appealed\r\n  that order, which was heard by this Court.Â  Prior to oral argument, Friends\r\n  conceded it was a public body for purposes of this action.Â  In Sloan I, we\r\n  affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the basis that the\r\n  action was moot and non-justiciable in light of Friends' production of the\r\n  documents.[2] 369 S.C. at 25-28, 630 S.E.2d at 477-478.\r\nFollowing our\r\n  decision, Sloan moved in the trial court for an award of attorney's fees under\r\n  FOIA.Â  In 2009, the trial court granted Sloan's motion and awarded attorney's\r\n  fees to include those incurred from the beginning of the litigation up to the\r\n  granting of the motion.Â  Friends appealed, which we certified pursuant to Rule\r\n  204, SCACR. \r\nII.\r\nFriends challenges the FOIA-based\r\n  attorney's fee award to Sloan.Â  Specifically, Friends argues Sloan was not a\r\n  prevailing party and, in any event, was not entitled to relief beyond the date\r\n  the requested documents were produced.Â  \r\n&quot;The decision to award\r\n  or deny attorneys' fees under a state statute will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Kiriakides v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville\r\n  County, 382 S.C. 8, 20, 675 S.E.2d 439, 445 (2009) (citing Layman v.\r\n  State, 376 S.C. 434, 444, 658 S.E.2d 320, 325 (2008)).Â  &quot;An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court are either controlled\r\n  by an error of law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions.&quot;Â  Id.,\r\n  675 S.E.2d at 445 (quoting Layman, 376 S.C. at 444, 658 S.E.2d at 325).Â \r\n  The issue before the Court presents a series of legal questions in terms of determining\r\n  (1) whether Sloan may be considered a prevailing party under the FOIA statute;\r\n  (2) if Sloan is a prevailing party, whether his entitlement to fees may extend beyond\r\n  the production of the requested documents; and (3) whether the law of the case\r\n  from Sloan I affects the time period for the attorney fee award. Â \r\nSection 30-4-100(b) of our\r\n  FOIA statute provides for an award of attorney's fees in a FOIA dispute:\r\n\r\n  If a\r\n    person or entity seeking such [declaratory or injunctive] relief prevails, he\r\n    or it may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and other costs of litigation. If\r\n    such person or entity prevails in part, the court may in its discretion award\r\n    him or it reasonable attorney fees or an appropriate portion thereof. \r\n\r\nThe initial question turns on\r\n  whether Sloan was a prevailing party under the statute.Â  While the statute does\r\n  not define prevailing party, this Court has previously stated that a prevailing\r\n  party is &quot;one who successfully prosecutes an action or successfully\r\n  defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent\r\n  of the original contention [and] is the one in whose favor the decision or\r\n  verdict is rendered and judgment entered.&quot;Â  Heath v. County of Aiken,\r\n  302 S.C. 178, 182-83, 394 S.E. 2d 709, 711 (1990) (alteration in original) (quoting Buza v. Columbia Lumber Co., 395 P.2d 511, 514 (Alaska 1964)).Â Â Â Â  \r\nFriends argues that Sloan was\r\n  not a prevailing party under this definition &quot;because Sloan did not\r\n  receive any of the relief he requested in his complaint . . . .&quot;Â  We reject\r\n  Friends' position and agree with the trial court that Sloan was a prevailing\r\n  party for purposes of the FOIA attorney's fees provision.Â  We find persuasive\r\n  the decision of the Montana Supreme Court in Havre Daily News, LLC v. City\r\n  of Havre, 142 P.3d 864 (Mont. 2006).Â  The Havre court addressed\r\n  whether the post-complaint voluntary production of disputed documents precludes\r\n  prevailing party status to a plaintiff:\r\n\r\n  Although\r\n    Havre correctly observes that the Newspaper did not technically &quot;prevail&quot;\r\n    in its action in the District Court, the court granted summary judgment in\r\n    favor of Havre precisely because Havre mooted the case by providing the\r\n    Newspaper with unredacted copies of the Reports. Absent Havre's conduct, the\r\n    case would not have become moot. In mooting the case, Havre provided the\r\n      Newspaper with the very relief it sought to procure through litigation; thus,\r\n      the Newspaper has prevailed in substance, albeit without court intervention. Given these circumstances, we will consider the Newspaper to be the prevailing\r\n    party with respect to its request for unredacted copies of the Reports.\r\n    Otherwise, a similarly situated party could, after extensive litigation, at the\r\n    eleventh hour, and facing imminent defeat, simply moot a case in order to dodge\r\n    this fee-shifting statute.\r\n\r\nId. at 878 (emphasis added).Â  Similarly, under the facts\r\n  of this case, we find that Sloan is the prevailing party under section\r\n  30-4-100(b).Â  When a public body frustrates a citizen's FOIA request to the\r\n  extent that the citizen must seek relief in the courts and incur litigation\r\n  costs, the public body should not be able to preclude prevailing party status to\r\n  the citizen by producing the documents after litigation is filed.Â  See Litchfield\r\n  Plantation Co. v. Georgetown County Water &amp; Sewer Dist., 314 S.C. 30,\r\n  34, 443 S.E.2d 574, 576 (1994) (Toal, J., concurring in part, dissenting in\r\n  part) (&quot;A governmental agency should not be allowed to stonewall an FOIA\r\n  request without some penalty for its actions.&quot;); see also Wildlands\r\n  CPR v. U.S. Forest Serv., 558 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1098 (D. Mont. 2008)\r\n  (finding that if a complainant receives relief &quot;via . . . unilateral\r\n  change in position by the agency,&quot; he is entitled to fees under the\r\n  federal FOIA statute); Spokane Research &amp; Def. Fund v. City of Spokane,\r\n  117 P.3d 1117, 1125 (Wash. 2005) (en banc) (&quot;[P]ermitting an agency to\r\n  avoid attorney fees by disclosing the documents after the plaintiff has been\r\n  forced to file a lawsuit . . . would undercut the policy behind the act.&quot; (alteration\r\n  in original) (quoting Coal. on Gov't Spying v. King County Dep't of Pub.\r\n  Safety, 801 P.2d 1009, 1013 (Wash. Ct. App. 1990))). \r\nWe believe this approach is in\r\n  harmony with legislative intent, as expressed in the preamble to our FOIA\r\n  statute: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    General Assembly finds that it is vital in a democratic society that public\r\n    business be performed in an open and public manner so that citizens shall be\r\n    advised of the performance of public officials and of the decisions that are\r\n    reached in public activity and in the formulation of public policy. Toward this\r\n    end, provisions of this chapter must be construed so as to make it possible for\r\n    citizens, or their representatives, to learn and report fully the activities of\r\n    their public officials at a minimum cost or delay to the persons seeking\r\n    access to public documents or meetings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Honoring legislative intent as expressed in FOIA by awarding\r\n  attorney's fees in these circumstances may serve as an impetus for public\r\n  bodies to comply with a FOIA request and thus avoid the imposition of an\r\n  attorney's fee award.Â  See Soc'y of Prof'l Journalists v. Sexton,\r\n  283 S.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d 313 (1984) (finding attorney's fees may be awarded to\r\n  encourage agencies to comply with FOIA requests). \r\nHere, Sloan's complaint\r\n  prompted Friends to do what a series of FOIA letter-requests could not\r\n  accomplishâ€”produce the requested documents.Â  Accordingly, Sloan prevailed and\r\n  is entitled to an award of attorney's fees.Â  However, we are constrained to\r\n  reverse the award of fees beyond the time Friends produced the requested\r\n  documents.Â  In Sloan I, we affirmed the trial court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment because the production of the requested documents rendered the\r\n  complaint moot and non-justiciable.Â  369 S.C. at 26, 630 S.E.2d at 477\r\n  (&quot;[O]nce the requested documents are produced, a justiciable controversy\r\n  no longer exists.&quot;).Â  These declarations of mootness and\r\n  non-justiciability are the law of this case.Â  The parties and this Court are\r\n  bound by Sloan I, which clearly limits the time period for which Sloan\r\n  would be entitled to an award of attorney's fees.Â  Rather than delay the matter\r\n  further by remand, we have reviewed the appropriate billing records and modify\r\n  Sloan's award to $6,467.50.[3] Â Â \r\nWe affirm the trial court's finding\r\n  that Sloan is a prevailing party under FOIA and is thus entitled to an award of\r\n  his attorney's fees.Â  We reverse the award of fees beyond the time Friends\r\n  produced the requested documents and modify Sloan's attorney's fees award to\r\n  $6,467.50.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Sloan sought Friends' bylaws, minutes from board\r\n  meetings, tax information, financial statements, retail sales information, and\r\n  a list of Friends-owned real estate.Â  \r\n[2] We further found that the trial court erred in\r\n  denying Sloan standing to bring the action, but that finding has no bearing on\r\n  this appeal.Â  369 S.C. at 28 - 29, 630 S.E.2d at 479.Â  \r\n[3]  Prior to oral argument, we requested the\r\n  billing records and the attorney's affidavit from Sloan's counsel.Â  Friends\r\n  does not challenge the reasonableness of Sloan's attorney's fees.Â  That\r\n  concession allows this Court to end the matter.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26987","title":"Judy v.

Judy, 383 S.C. 1, 677 S.E.2d\r\n213 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; This Court granted James's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals as to whether res\r\njudicata operated to preclude the waste lawsuit.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nOn May 13, 1983, Vesta Rumph (&quot;Mrs. Rumph&quot;) died testate, leaving three parcels of real property in Dorchester County to be distributed equally\r\nbetween Ronnie and James.&nbsp; The three parcels included:&nbsp; (1) a 10.9-acre tract (&quot;10.9-acre Tract&quot;); (2) a 9.29-acre tract, on which the Rumph\r\nfamily homestead stood (&quot;Homestead Tract&quot;); and (3) a 134.71-acre tract, which included an 11-acre, man-made pond (&quot;Pond Tract&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nAlthough the property was not formally distributed for many years, the brothers orally agreed that Ronnie would take possession of the Homestead Tract and\r\nlive in the Rumph homestead, and James would take possession of the remaining two tracts. &nbsp;From July 1983 until October 15, 2001, Ronnie served as personal\r\nrepresentative of Mrs. Rumph's estate (&quot;Estate&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn February 8, 2001, James filed suit in probate court[1] seeking partition of the Estate's property.[2]&nbsp; On February 12, 2001, Ronnie executed a Deed of Distribution in his capacity as personal representative of the\r\nEstate granting ownership of the three tracts to himself and James as the heirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs a result of alleged dubious transactions regarding the property, James petitioned to have Ronnie removed as personal representative of the Estate.&nbsp;\r\nOn October 15, 2001, the probate court removed Ronnie as personal representative of the Estate and appointed James in his place.\r\nIn early May 2003, someone operating a backhoe damaged the earthen dam supporting the eleven-acre, man-made pond on the Pond Tract, and the pond drained\r\ncompletely.&nbsp; On May 5, 2003, detectives with the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office investigated the destruction of the pond.&nbsp; During their\r\ninvestigation, the detectives discovered that the locked gate to the pond had been forcibly torn down, and backhoe tracks were found leading from the breached\r\ndam into Ronnie's backyard where his backhoe was located.\r\nOn November 7, 2003, James again petitioned the probate court to partition the property.&nbsp; In his petition, James requested the probate court take into\r\nconsideration the co-devisees' conduct before issuing an order equitably partitioning the subject property, including &quot;Ronnie F. Judy's negligent, grossly\r\nnegligent, or intentional acts causing the destruction of the fishing pond located on the subject property.&quot;&nbsp; During the partition hearing, James\r\npresented expert testimony that established the value of the Pond Tract would have been worth $1,000 more per acre had the pond not been destroyed.\r\nBy order dated January 7, 2004, the probate court granted the requested relief.&nbsp; The probate court awarded ownership of the Pond Tract to James and the\r\n10.9-acre Tract and Homestead Tract to Ronnie. &nbsp;In assessing the value of the three parcels, the court did not consider Ronnie's &quot;alleged\r\ndestruction&quot; of the pond because James specifically withdrew this claim and requested that the court not &quot;factor in such loss of value when computing\r\nthe amount of property each party shall receive.&quot;&nbsp; The court held &quot;all other issues regarding money owed to either party on these parcels of land\r\nto be moot.&quot;\r\nOn November 29, 2005, James filed an action against Ronnie in circuit court arising out of the destruction of the man-made pond.[3]&nbsp; In his Complaint, James alleged &quot;the acts of [Ronnie] in willfully and maliciously destroying the earthen dam of\r\nRumph's pond constitute[d] waste.&quot;&nbsp; Due to the loss of the pond, James sought actual and punitive damages.&nbsp; In response, Ronnie filed a pro\r\nse Answer in which he generally denied the allegations. &nbsp;On the eve of trial, Ronnie's recently-retained counsel moved to dismiss for lack of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that James's lawsuit was barred by the doctrines of laches, collateral estoppel, and res judicata.&nbsp;\r\nAdditionally, counsel moved to amend Ronnie's Answer to add the defense of waiver.&nbsp;\r\nOn April 9, 2007, the circuit court conducted a jury trial on James's cause of action for waste.&nbsp; Prior to trial, the circuit court denied Ronnie's\r\nmotion to dismiss but indicated that the issues could be addressed at the directed verdict stage of the trial.\r\nDuring the trial, the probate court's order was introduced as evidence and discussed during James's testimony.&nbsp; During James's cross-examination, he\r\nacknowledged that he had filed an action in probate court alleging that Ronnie destroyed the dam but requested that the probate court not rule on the matter\r\nbecause he &quot;would settle this at a later date.&quot; &nbsp;James further admitted that his expert, who testified during the circuit court proceedings,\r\ntestified at the probate court hearing regarding the reduction in the overall value of the Pond Tract due to the destruction of the pond.\r\nAt the close of the case, Ronnie renewed his motion to dismiss.&nbsp; In denying the motion to dismiss, the circuit court found an &quot;ambiguity&quot; in\r\nthe probate court's order that was to be construed in favor of James.\r\nSubsequently, Ronnie moved to amend his Answer to allege the doctrines of laches, waiver, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.&nbsp; Although the\r\ncourt permitted the amendments with the exception of waiver, the court ruled against Ronnie and submitted the case to the jury.&nbsp;\r\nThe jury found in favor of James and awarded him $67,350 actual damages and $22,650 punitive damages.\r\nAfter the circuit court denied Ronnie's post-trial motions, Ronnie appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's\r\nrefusal to dismiss James's suit on the basis of collateral estoppel and laches, but found that James's suit for waste was barred on the basis of res judicata.&nbsp;\r\nJudy v. Judy, 383 S.C. 1, 677 S.E.2d 213 (Ct. App. 2009).[4]&nbsp; In reaching this conclusion, the court held\r\n&quot;the identity of the subject matter of the two suits rests not in their forms of action or the relief sought, but rather, in the combination of the facts\r\nand law that give rise to a claim for relief.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 10, 677 S.E.2d at 218.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nJames contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding that his lawsuit for waste was barred by res judicata.&nbsp; In support of this contention, James\r\nclaims the prior probate court action was conducted for the limited purpose of partitioning the real property of the Estate.&nbsp; Because the subject matter of\r\nhis waste claim was not identical to the partition action, James asserts that the requisite elements of the doctrine of res judicata were not\r\nsatisfied.&nbsp; Thus, he avers that he should not have been precluded from pursuing his claim for waste in the circuit court.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere are very few reported cases discussing the tort of waste.&nbsp; However, one decision defined this tort as:&nbsp; &quot;At common law, waste is any\r\npermanent injury to lands, houses, gardens, trees, or other corporeal hereditaments done or permitted by the tenant of an estate less than a fee to the\r\nprejudice of him in reversion or remainder.&quot;&nbsp; Wingard v. Lee, 287 S.C. 57, 60, 336 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 1985).&nbsp; &quot;Waste may be\r\ncommitted by acts or omissions which tend to the lasting destruction, deterioration, or material alteration of the freehold and the improvements thereto or\r\nwhich diminish the permanent value of the inheritance.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; &quot;Whether particular acts or omissions constitute waste depends on\r\nmatters of fact, including:&nbsp; the nature, purpose, and duration of the tenancy; the character of the property; whether the acts complained of are related to\r\nthe use and enjoyment of the property; whether the use is reasonable in the circumstances; and whether the acts complained of are reasonably necessary to\r\neffectuate such use.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nIn order for res judicata to operate as a bar to James's lawsuit for waste, the following elements needed to be proven:&nbsp; (1) identity of the\r\nparties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit. &nbsp;Riedman Corp. v. Greenville Steel Structures, Inc.,\r\n308 S.C. 467, 419 S.E.2d 217 (1992).\r\nOur courts, however, have found that the doctrine of res judicata is not an &quot;ironclad&quot; bar to a later lawsuit. &nbsp;Garris v. Governing\r\nBd. of the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 449, 511 S.E.2d 48, 57 (1998).\r\nSignificantly, the Restatement (Second) of Judgments has recognized exceptions to the application of this doctrine.[5]&nbsp; See Restatement (Second) of Judgments Â§ 26 (1982 &amp; Supp. 2011); id. (noting in commentary that section 26\r\n&quot;presents a set of exceptional cases in which, after judgment that would otherwise extinguish the claim under the rules of merger or bar . . . , the\r\nplaintiff is nevertheless free to maintain a second action on the same claim or part of it.&quot;).\r\nIn view of these exceptions, we must answer the threshold question of whether the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate James's claim\r\nfor waste.&nbsp; See Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 115, 382 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1989) (differentiating jurisdiction of the probate court and\r\nthe circuit court; recognizing that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived and should be taken notice of by this Court).\r\nIf the probate court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim, then our analysis ends as James could have only pursued his claim in circuit court.\r\nThus, under the exception identified in section 26(1)(c) of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, res judicata could not have operated to bar\r\nJames's lawsuit for waste. &nbsp;Alternatively, if the probate court had jurisdiction over the claim of waste, we must then determine whether the elements of res\r\njudicata were proven.\r\nTurning to the jurisdiction of the probate court, we have definitively recognized that the probate court is not a constitutional court.&nbsp; See Davis\r\nv. Davis, 214 S.C. 247, 52 S.E.2d 192 (1949) (recognizing the probate court has only such jurisdiction as vested in it by the General Assembly); S.C. Const.\r\nart. V, Â§ 12 (&quot;Jurisdiction in matters testamentary and of administration . . . shall be vested as the General Assembly may provide, consistent with the\r\nprovisions of Section 1 of this article.&quot;); see also Anderson, 299 S.C. at 115, 382 S.E.2d at 900 (&quot;The jurisdiction of a court over the\r\nsubject matter of a proceeding is determined by the Constitution, the laws of the state, and is fundamental.&quot;).&nbsp; Thus, the extent of the probate\r\ncourt's jurisdiction is defined by our legislature.&nbsp; A decision regarding the jurisdiction of the probate court requires us to review two statutes,\r\nsections 62-1-302 and 62-3-620 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nSection 62-1-302 generally defines the probate court's jurisdiction and provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (a) To the full extent permitted by the Constitution, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction over\r\n  all subject matter related to:\r\n  (1) estates of decedents, including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of\r\n  protected persons.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(1) (2009 &amp; Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).&nbsp; In conjunction with this code section, the general definitional section in\r\nthe Probate Court defines &quot;claims&quot; as including &quot;liabilities of the decedent or protected person whether arising in contract, in tort, or\r\notherwise, and liabilities of the estate which arise at or after the death of the decedent or after the appointment of a conservator . . . .&quot;&nbsp; S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(4) (2009) (emphasis added).\r\nGiven the broad wording of the above-outlined code sections, particularly the phrase &quot;all subject matter related to estates of decedents,&quot; we find\r\nthe probate court was statutorily authorized to rule on the waste action.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, although the tort of waste is generally filed in circuit court, the General Assembly has provided limited jurisdiction for the probate court to\r\nconsider actions for waste in the context of testamentary matters.&nbsp; Specifically, section 62-3-620 states:\r\n\r\n  The judge of probate of the county in which a deceased person may have died may, either of his own accord or at the instance of any creditor or other\r\n  person interested in the estate of the deceased, cite before him such person as, neither being appointed personal representative nor having obtained\r\n  administration of the effects of such deceased person, shall nevertheless possess himself of the goods, chattels, rights, and credits of such person\r\n  deceased and, upon such person being cited as aforesaid, the judge of probate shall require of him a discovery and account of all and singular the goods,\r\n  chattels, rights, and credits of the deceased and shall proceed to decree against him for the value of the estate and effects of the deceased which he may\r\n  have wasted or which may have been lost by his illegal interference, charging him as executors of their own wrong are made liable at common law as far as\r\n  assets shall have come into his hands.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-620 (2009) (emphasis added); see Greenfield v. Greenfield, 245 S.C. 604, 614, 141 S.E.2d 920, 926 (1965) (discussing the\r\nprecursor to section 62-3-620 and stating &quot;the statute authorizes the entry of a judgment against the executor de son tort for the value of such assets as\r\nmay have been wasted or lost by the illegal interference&quot;).\r\nApplying the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we conclude the probate court had jurisdiction to consider James's claim for waste given Ronnie's\r\nconduct classified him as an &quot;executor de son tort&quot; under section 62-3-620.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt the time Ronnie allegedly destroyed the pond in May 2003, he was no longer the personal representative of the Estate as the probate court had replaced him\r\nand appointed James in October 2001.&nbsp; Therefore, Ronnie's destruction of the Estate's real property operated to place James's claim within the purview of\r\nsection 62-3-620 and, in turn, authorized the probate court to adjudicate this claim. &nbsp;See Haley v. Thames, 30 S.C. 270, 276, 9 S.E. 110, 112\r\n(1889) (discussing precursor to section 62-3-620 and defining &quot;executor de son tort&quot; as &quot;[i]f a stranger takes upon himself the office of\r\nexecutor by intrusion, not being so constituted by the demand nor appointed administrator&quot; (citation omitted)).\r\nFurthermore, this Court has found that where a court has jurisdiction over a partition action then any cause of action that is incident to the right of\r\npartition, including waste, should simultaneously be adjudicated. &nbsp;Vaughn v. Lanford, 81 S.C. 282, 62 S.E. 316 (1908).&nbsp; In Vaughn, this\r\nCourt stated that &quot;[a]ccounting for waste, for betterments, and for rents among cotenants is now recognized as an incident to the right of partition, and\r\nthe universal practice of the court of equity is to adjust all these matters in the suit for partition.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 288, 62 S.E. at 318.&nbsp; The\r\nCourt explained that where a court has proper jurisdiction of a partition case &quot;there is hardly any question in relation to property which this Court may\r\nnot determine incidentally for the purpose of doing complete justice and preventing multiplicity of litigation.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; In reaching this\r\nconclusion, the Court reasoned that &quot;[t]his rule is just and in accord with the principle that, when all the parties and the property are before the court\r\nof equity, it will do full justice to all before releasing its hold.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 289, 62 S.E. at 319.\r\nHaving found the probate court had jurisdiction to adjudicate James's claim of waste, the question becomes whether the &quot;identity of the subject\r\nmatter&quot; between the partition action and the waste action was the same for the purposes of res judicata.[6]\r\nAlthough there is no dispute in our jurisprudence regarding the three elements of res judicata, our courts have utilized at least four tests in\r\ndetermining whether a claim should have been raised in a prior suit.[7] &nbsp;Because a determination of whether res\r\njudicata precludes a subsequent suit cannot be reduced to a formulaic process, we decline to adopt or attempt to define a single standard.&nbsp; See Aliff\r\nv. Joy Mfg. Co., 914 F.2d 39, 43 (4th Cir. 1990) (&quot;There is no simple test to determine what constitutes the same cause of action for res judicata\r\npurposes.&nbsp; Each case presents different facts that must be assessed within the conceptual framework of the doctrine.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nInstead, we reiterate and rely on the conceptual framework recognized in Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 512 S.E.2d 106 (1999),\r\nwherein we stated:\r\n\r\n  Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior\r\n  action between those parties.&nbsp; Under the doctrine of res judicata, &quot;[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the\r\n  former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former suit.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. at 34, 512 S.E.2d at 109 (citations omitted).\r\nIn Plum Creek, we also recognized that simply seeking a different remedy in the second lawsuit for the same cause of action does not negate the\r\nidentical nature of the subjects of the two actions.&nbsp; Plum Creek Dev. Co., 334 S.C. at 35 n.4, 512 S.E.2d at 109 n.4.&nbsp; We explained that\r\n&quot;[a] claim for damages is a claim for relief rather than an assertion of a different cause of action for purposes of determining the applicability of res\r\njudicata.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 35, 512 S.E.2d at 109 (quoting 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments Â§ 536 (1994)).&nbsp; Furthermore, we noted that &quot;for\r\npurposes of res judicata, 'cause of action' is not the form of action in which a claim is asserted but, rather the 'cause for action, meaning the underlying\r\nfacts combined with the law giving the party a right to a remedy of one form or another based thereon.'&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 36, 512 S.E.2d at 110 (quoting\r\n50 C.J.S. Judgment Â§ 749 (1997)).\r\nBecause this conceptual framework is fundamentally sound, we take this opportunity to definitively rule that the four tests previously used by our appellate\r\ncourts should be considered merely as factors rather than rigid, independent tests.[8]&nbsp; We believe this approach\r\neffectuates the fundamental purpose of res judicata, which is to ensure that &quot;no one should be twice sued for the same cause of action.&quot;&nbsp; First\r\nNat'l Bank of Greenville v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, 24, 35 S.E.2d 47, 56 (1945).\r\nCognizant of this conceptual framework, we conclude that James clearly raised a waste cause of action in his probate court pleadings.&nbsp; Even though James\r\ndid not delineate waste as a separate cause of action, the allegations in his pleadings set forth the elements of this tort.&nbsp; James, however, specifically\r\nrequested that the probate court not rule on this claim.&nbsp; Due to James's request, the probate court withheld a ruling on this issue. &nbsp;\r\nBecause the tort duties that were breached and the evidence was the same in both proceedings, there was &quot;identity of subject matter&quot; for the\r\npurposes of res judicata.&nbsp; Yet, in violation of the doctrine of res judicata, James attempted to &quot;split&quot; his cause of action for\r\nwaste by pursuing and procuring another remedy in circuit court for an identical claim.&nbsp; Given the probate court could have fully adjudicated the waste\r\ncause of action, James was precluded from initiating a second lawsuit in the circuit court as this cause of action could have been raised in the former\r\nsuit.&nbsp; Furthermore, the probate court definitively resolved James's claims regarding the property by ruling that it would &quot;consider all other issues\r\nregarding money owed to either party on these parcels of land to be moot.&quot;\r\nEven if the probate court could have adjudicated his claim for waste, James contends that the probate court could not have awarded punitive damages; thus, he\r\nasserts that res judicata should not operate as a bar to recovering these damages in circuit court. &nbsp;\r\nWe disagree with James's arguments given he chose the probate court as the forum to adjudicate his claims for partition and waste of the Estate\r\nproperty.&nbsp; If he desired to recover punitive damages, James could have filed both claims in circuit court or removed his lawsuit in its entirety to the\r\ncircuit court for an adjudication of all claims.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-50 (2005) (providing circuit court with jurisdiction to partition in\r\nkind or by sale real and personal estates); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(d)(5) (2009) (providing &quot;actions in which a party has a\r\nright to trial by jury and which involve an amount in controversy of at least five thousand dollars in value&quot; must be removed to the circuit court).\r\n&nbsp;Accordingly, we hold that James's election to proceed in probate court effectively waived his right to recover punitive damages.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find res judicata precluded James from adjudicating his lawsuit for waste in the circuit court.[9]&nbsp; Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent.&nbsp; Although I agree with the majority that the doctrine of res judicata would ordinarily bar James\r\nJudy's tort action for waste, I believe this case is excepted from claim preclusion under section 26, subsection 1(a) of the Restatements (Second) of\r\nJudgments.&nbsp; That section provides:\r\n\r\n  (1) &nbsp;When any of the following circumstances exists, the general rule of [claim preclusion] does not apply to extinguish the claim, and part or all of\r\n  the claim subsists as a possible basis for a second action by the plaintiff against the defendant:\r\n  \r\n    (a) &nbsp;The parties have agreed in terms or in effect that the plaintiff may split the claim, or the defendant acquiesced therein;\r\n    . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments Â§ 26 (1982 &amp; Supp. 2011) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Beazer East, Inc. v. United States Navy, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit cited this Restatement exception, stating,\r\n&quot;acquiescence to the filing of two separate lawsuits has also been determined to constitute consent.&quot;&nbsp; No. 96-1736, 1997 WL 173225 (4th Cir. Apr.\r\n11, 1997).&nbsp; In that case, the court found the defendant did not acquiesce in the plaintiff's splitting of claims by filing an opposition to plaintiff's\r\nmotion to consolidate the claims.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; In the instant case, James requested the probate court consider Ronnie's willful destruction of the\r\nfishing pond located on the Pond Tract in his Petition to Partition Real Property.&nbsp; At the partition hearing, James produced an expert who testified the\r\nproperty was worth $1,000 less per acre without the pond.&nbsp; However, before the probate court issued its order partitioning the property, James requested\r\nthat the court not consider that loss of value when computing the amount each party would receive.&nbsp; There is no evidence in the record that Ronnie objected\r\nto this request.&nbsp; Therefore, in my opinion, Ronnie cannot invoke the doctrine of res judicata as protection against a tort action in circuit court, aimed\r\nat righting the wrong he allegedly committed, when he allowed that claim to be ignored during the action for partition in probate court.&nbsp; I would reverse\r\nthe court of appeals' decision that the circuit court action was barred on the basis of res judicata, and reinstate the circuit court order awarding actual and\r\npunitive damages to James.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-911 (2009) (&quot;When two or more heirs or devisees are entitled to\r\ndistribution of undivided interests in any personal or real property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of the heirs or devisees may\r\npetition the court prior to the closing of the estate, to make partition.&quot;).\r\n[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; The property was not partitioned as the result of that suit.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Weeks later, James sold the Pond Tract for $1,280,000.&nbsp; Notably, in his petition to the probate\r\ncourt, the appraiser hired by James assigned the Pond Tract a value of $375,000.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Based on its decision, the court declined to rule on the issue of waiver.&nbsp; Judy, 383 S.C. at\r\n10, 677 S.E.2d at 219.\r\n[5]&nbsp; Section 26 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (1) When any of the following circumstances exists, the general rule of Â§ 24 does not apply to extinguish the claim, and part or all of the claim subsists\r\n  as a possible basis for a second action by the plaintiff against the defendant:\r\n  (a) The parties have agreed in terms or in effect that the plaintiff may split his claim, or the defendant has acquiesced therein; or\r\n  (b) The court in the first action has expressly reserved the plaintiff's right to maintain the second action; or\r\n  (c) The plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of the\r\n  limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts or restrictions on their authority to entertain multiple theories or demands for multiple\r\n  remedies or forms of relief in a single action, and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief.\r\n\r\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments Â§ 26 (1982 &amp; Supp. 2011) (emphasis added).\r\n[6]&nbsp; We have confined our analysis to the critical element regarding the &quot;identity of the subject\r\nmatter&quot; as there is no dispute regarding the remaining two elements, i.e., the identity of the parties and adjudication of the issue in the former\r\nsuit.\r\n[7]&nbsp; See James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 649-50 (2d ed. 1996) (&quot;South\r\nCarolina courts have used at least four tests to determine when a claim should have been raised in the first suit:&nbsp; (1) when there is identity of the\r\nsubject matter in both cases; (2) when the first and second cases involve the same primary right held by the plaintiff and one primary wrong committed by the\r\ndefendant; (3) when there is the same evidence in both cases; and recently, (4) when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the\r\nsubject of the prior action.&quot;).\r\n[8]&nbsp; Although we implicitly recognized this distinction in Plum Creek, we did not affirmatively\r\nresolve the application and import of the four tests.&nbsp; Plum Creek Dev. Co., 334 S.C. at 35 n.3, 512 S.E.2d at 109 n.3 (discussing the doctrine of res\r\njudicata and referencing, but not definitively relying on, the four tests used by South Carolina courts in determining whether a claim should have been\r\nraised in a prior suit).\r\n[9]&nbsp; The dissent based its position to reverse on its view that Respondent acquiesced in Petitioner's\r\nsplitting of his claim.&nbsp; However, there is no evidence in the record before us that Respondent acquiesced.&nbsp; It is undisputed that Petitioner raised\r\nthe issue of waste in the probate court and offered expert testimony in support of his position and the amount of damages he suffered.&nbsp; It is also\r\nundisputed that Petitioner, without explanation, requested that the court not consider Respondent's waste.&nbsp; A litigant is not required to object to a\r\nwithdrawal of a claim against him, nor is there a requirement that he demand an explanation for the generosity of his opponent, especially if the opponent is\r\nhis brother.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, it is undisputed that the trial court's order specifically stated it &quot;considered all other issues regarding money owed to either party\r\non these parcels of land to be moot.&quot; (emphasis added).&nbsp; This ruling by the probate court would reasonably lead any litigant to believe that\r\nall issues regarding the property were resolved.&nbsp; The Petitioner did not object; therefore, if we apply the dissent's logic, we would have to conclude that\r\nPetitioner acquiesced in waiving his waste claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26988","title":"Cole Vision v.

Hobbs, 384 S.C. 283, 680 S.E.2d 923\r\n(Ct. App. 2009), which reversed the circuit court's dismissal of Hobbs' counterclaim for spoliation of evidence. &nbsp;Cole Vision Corporation (Cole Vision)\r\nargues the tort of negligent spoliation of evidence is not cognizable under South Carolina law. &nbsp;We agree and reverse the court of appeals.&nbsp;\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSteven C. Hobbs, an optometrist, sublet space leased by Cole Vision Corporation (Cole Vision) from Sears Roebuck and Company (Sears) for his optometry\r\npractice. &nbsp;The sublease agreement between Hobbs and Cole Vision contained indemnity provisions whereby Hobbs agreed to defend Cole Vision and Sears against\r\nany and all liabilities arising from events occurring in Hobbs' business location or as a result of Hobbs' activities at the business.&nbsp; This agreement also\r\npurportedly required Cole Vision to retain copies of Hobbs' patient records. &nbsp;Pursuant to the agreement, Hobbs obtained professional liability insurance\r\nwith NCMIC Insurance Company (NCMIC).\r\nMary and John Lewis (collectively, the Lewises) sued Hobbs, Cole Vision, and Sears based on Hobbs' alleged malpractice in failing to properly diagnose and\r\ntreat Mary Lewis. &nbsp;The Lewises contend Mary Lewis's glaucoma went undetected due to Hobbs' negligent treatment, and as a result, she was rendered blind.\r\n&nbsp;Cole Vision and Sears brought this action for declaratory relief after Hobbs and NCMIC refused to defend them in the malpractice suit. &nbsp;Although the\r\nLewises' case was pending when Cole Vision brought this declaratory judgment action, it eventually settled.\r\nThe case brought by Cole Vision and Sears seeks a declaration that Hobbs and NCMIC were obligated to defend and indemnify them pursuant to the sublease\r\nagreement between Hobbs, Cole Vision, and Sears. &nbsp;Cole Vision and Sears also sought judgment against Hobbs and NCMIC for defense costs and settlement\r\namounts of the claims asserted in the malpractice action brought by the Lewises.[1]\r\nIn response to the complaint, Hobbs filed a defense and counterclaim for negligent spoliation of evidence against Cole Vision and Sears stemming from the\r\nloss of Mary Lewis's patient profile sheet. &nbsp;Hobbs contended that Cole Vision lost the profile sheet, which was a key piece of evidence needed to defend\r\nthe malpractice claim. &nbsp;According to Hobbs, he incurred costs and attorney fees as a result of his inability to adequately defend against the Lewises'\r\nclaim for malpractice. &nbsp;Cole Vision's reply asserted that the counterclaim failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and did not\r\narise from the same transaction or occurrence.\r\nCole Vision filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, on the ground that South Carolina does not recognize a cause of action for spoliation\r\nof evidence. &nbsp;The circuit court agreed and granted the motion to dismiss. &nbsp;Hobbs appealed the circuit court's order and the court of appeals reversed\r\nthe circuit court, finding that Hobbs pled facts sufficient to constitute a general negligence cause of action. &nbsp;The court of appeals did not determine\r\nwhether South Carolina recognizes a cause of action for negligent spoliation, instead reversing the circuit court based on its characterization of Hobbs' claim\r\nas sounding in general negligence.&nbsp; See Cole Vision Corp. v. Hobbs, 384 S.C. 283, 680 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; Cole Vision's\r\npetition for rehearing included a discussion of Austin v. Beaufort County Sheriff's Office, 377 S.C. 31, 659 S.E.2d 122 (2008), which had been decided by\r\nthis Court after the issuance of the court of appeals' decision, but the court of appeals denied the petition.[2]\r\n&nbsp;We granted Cole Vision's petition for certiorari.\r\nISSUES\r\nCole Vision presents three issues to this Court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n      Did Hobbs preserve the issue of general negligence based on the spoliation of evidence for appellate review?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n      Did the court of appeals err in reversing the circuit court's order granting Cole Vision's motion to dismiss Hobbs'\r\n        counterclaim for spoliation of evidence?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n      If negligent spoliation does exist under South Carolina law, did Hobbs fail to plead an essential element?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a party may move to dismiss a complaint against him based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\r\nSpence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 116, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874 (2006).&nbsp; In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the circuit court must\r\nbase its ruling solely on the allegations set forth in the complaint. Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 645 S.E.2d 245 (2007).&nbsp; Such a motion may not be\r\nsustained if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case. Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe question is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for\r\nrelief. Id. &nbsp;In reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the appellate court applies the same standard as the circuit\r\ncourt.&nbsp; Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; PRESERVATION\r\nCole Vision asserts, as it did before the court of appeals, that Hobbs' attempt to characterize his counterclaim as one for general negligence is unpreserved\r\nbecause it was not addressed in the circuit court's order granting the motion to dismiss, and Hobbs did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion. Hobbs responds\r\nthat he specifically raised this issue to the circuit court during the hearing and the circuit court ruled on it.&nbsp;\r\nIt is true that Hobbsâ€™ counsel raised the issue of general negligence in arguments before the circuit court and that, in the oral ruling from the bench,\r\nthe circuit court recognized the cause of action may have some reference to negligence.&nbsp; However, the written order is based solely on spoliation of\r\nevidence.&nbsp;\r\nIt is well settled that when there is a discrepancy between an oral ruling of the court and its written order, the written order controls.&nbsp; See Ford\r\nv. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001); Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 620, 571 S.E.2d 92, 96 (Ct. App. 2002); Parag\r\nv. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, 226, 508 S.E.2d 590, 592 (Ct. App. 1998). Thus, Cole Vision is correct in its assertion that Hobbsâ€™ characterization of\r\nhis counterclaim before the court of appeals as one for general negligence is unpreserved.&nbsp; Even if we were to find Hobbsâ€™ characterization of his\r\ncounterclaim as sounding in general negligence to be preserved, his position would still be unavailing; regardless of how his counterclaim is labeled, we\r\nanalyze it under the same rubric as a claim based on spoliation of evidence.[3]&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; SPOLIATION OF EVIDENCE\r\nCole Vision urges us to find Austin controlling in this case.&nbsp; Hobbs argues that Austin is distinguishable and should therefore not be\r\npersuasive.&nbsp; While we agree with Hobbs that Austin is distinguishable, we decline to adopt the tort of negligent spoliation in this State.&nbsp;\r\nIn Austin, Austin's son was found dead in his neighbor's garage from a drug overdose. 377 S.C. at 33, 659 S.E.2d at 123.&nbsp; The Sheriff's Office\r\nbegan an investigation into his death and collected various items from the scene, but it then destroyed all the evidence collected. Id.&nbsp; When Austin\r\nlater discovered that the evidence was destroyed, she filed suit against the Sheriff's Office, claiming damages because the destruction of evidence impaired her\r\nability to bring a potential wrongful death action. Id.&nbsp; The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the Sheriff's Office, and Austin\r\nappealed. Id. at 34, 659 S.E.2d at 123.\r\nAustin urged this Court to adopt the tort of third party spoliation of evidence, specifically arguing that West Virginia's version of the tort as expressed\r\nin Hannah v. Heeter, 584 S.E.2d 560 (W. Va. 2003), should be recognized. Id.&nbsp; After articulating what the Hannah court held to be the\r\nelements of negligent spoliation of evidence by a third party,[4] we determined that, even if we were to recognize\r\nthis tort, Austin's allegations did not rise to the level of stating a claim as she would fail to meet its elements. Id. at 35, 659 S.E.2d at 124.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough we rejected Austin's claim, we specifically &quot;decline[d] to address whether we would, under other factual circumstances, adopt the tort of third\r\nparty spoliation of evidence.&quot; Id. at 36, 659 S.E.2d at 124.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe believe Austin is distinguishable from the present case.&nbsp; Austin was a pure third party spoliation case; the Sheriff's Office would not\r\nhave been a party to the wrongful death action between Austin and whoever allegedly was responsible for her son's death.&nbsp; This case, however, presents a\r\nunique situation.&nbsp; As opposed to being true third parties to the underlying case where the lost evidence was to be used, Cole Vision and Sears were\r\nco-defendants with Hobbs. &nbsp;This case is also not a true first-party spoliation case, where the claim is against an opposing party.&nbsp; In addition, Hobbs\r\nalleged that Cole Vision required all patient profile sheets be kept within their custody and control.&nbsp; At the 12(b)(6) stage, we are required to accept\r\nthis allegation as true.&nbsp; Therefore, we have a potential contractual obligation between Cole Vision and Hobbs, while none existed in Austin.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the fact that Austin can be distinguished does not resolve the issue presented here: whether South Carolina should recognize a stand-alone\r\ntort for spoliation of evidence.&nbsp; We hold that while Hobbs may continue to assert Cole Vision's failure to maintain the document at issue as a defense to\r\nits claim for indemnification, the circuit court properly held that South Carolina does not recognize an independent tort for the negligent spoliation of\r\nevidence, third-party or otherwise.\r\nWe recognize that some states have adopted an independent action for spoliation of evidence. See, e.g., Rizzuto v. Davidson Ladders, Inc., 905 A.2d\r\n1165, 1178 (Conn. 2006) (recognizing intentional first-party spoliation); Holmes v. Amerex Rent-A-Car, 710 A.2d 846, 849 (D.C. Ct. App. 1998)\r\n(recognizing cause of action for negligent spoliation of evidence against third parties).&nbsp; Other states have refused to adopt an independent tort action,\r\nbut have permitted recovery for spoliation under traditional negligence principles. See, e.g., Smith v. Atkinson, 771 So. 2d 429, 432-33 (Ala. 2000)\r\n(permitting spoliation claim under existing negligence law, but applying a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff would have recovered in the underlying\r\nlitigation); Boyd v. Travelers Ins. Co., 652 N.E.2d 267, 270 (Ill. 1995) (finding a claim for negligent spoliation of evidence could be stated under\r\nexisting negligence law).&nbsp; Most states, however, have refused to recognize an independent spoliation tort and continue to rely on traditional non-tort\r\nremedies such as sanctions and adverse jury instructions for redress. See, e.g., Lips v. Scottsdale Healthcare Corp., 229 P.3d 1008, 1011 (Ariz.\r\n2010) (declining to recognizing a cause of action for third-party negligent spoliation); Owens v. Am. Refuse Sys., Inc. 536 S.E.2d 782, 784 (Ga. App.\r\n2000) (declining to recognize an independent third-party tort of evidence spoliation); Goin v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Corp., 890 A.2d 894, 898 (Md. App.\r\n2006) (refusing to recognize separate tort action for negligent or intentional spoliation); Austin v. Consolidation Coal Co., 501 S.E.2d 161, 163 (Va.\r\n1998) (declining to recognize a third-party spoliation tort under the facts of the particular case).&nbsp;\r\nWe also believe public policy considerations weigh heavily against adopting the tort in this State. &nbsp;First, other remedies are already available with\r\nrespect to first-party claims.&nbsp; For example, the court of appeals has struck a party's pleadings or approved the use of adverse jury instructions against a\r\nparty found to have lost or destroyed relevant evidence in the case where the evidence was to be presented. See, e.g., Stokes v. Spartanburg Reg'l\r\nMed. Ctr., 368 S.C. 515, 522, 629 S.E.2d 675, 679 (Ct. App. 2006) (ordering a new trial for failure to give a jury instruction on the adverse inference of\r\nthe import of evidence lost or destroyed by the defendant); QZO, Inc. v. Moyer, 358 S.C. 246, 258, 594 S.E.2d 541, 548 (Ct. App. 2004) (affirming the\r\ncircuit court's decision to strike appellant's pleadings after appellant destroyed relevant evidence).&nbsp; However, Hobbs foreclosed his opportunity to obtain\r\nthis relief when he settled the case brought by the Lewises.&nbsp;\r\nThe speculative nature of the damages calculation also militates against recognizing a negligent spoliation cause of action.&nbsp; In Trevino v. Ortega,\r\n969 S.W.2d 950 (1998), the Supreme Court of Texas, in rejecting the tort of evidence spoliation, found, &quot;[e]ven those courts that have recognized an\r\nevidence spoliation tort note that damages are speculative.&nbsp; The reason that the damages inquiry is difficult is because evidence spoliation tips the\r\nbalance in a lawsuit; it does not create damages amenable to monetary compensation.&quot; 969 S.W.2d at 952-53; see also Coprich v. Superior Court,\r\n80 Cal. App. 4th 1081, 1089 (Ct. App. 2000) (articulating the uncertainty concerning the nature and effect of missing evidence in negligent spoliation\r\nclaims).&nbsp; This is particularly true where, as here, the parties to the underlying suit have settled.\r\nThe final policy consideration which weighs against adoption of the tort of negligent spoliation concerns the potential for duplicative and inconsistent\r\nlitigation.&nbsp; If a subsequent claim for spoliation is permitted by this Court outside of the original action, that claim would require a &quot;retrial\r\nwithin a trial in which all the evidence presented in the underlying action would be presented again for the trier of fact to determine what effect the\r\nspoliated evidence might have had in light of the other evidence.&quot; Coprich, 80 Cal. App. 4th at 1088-89.&nbsp; This could occur regardless of\r\nwhether the trial court in the principal action determined that the spoliation warranted sanctions or adverse jury instructions, thus potentially giving rise to\r\ninconsistent results.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, our conclusion that Hobbs is unable to bring an independent claim does not preclude him from asserting spoliation as a defense to the declaratory\r\njudgment action brought by Cole Vision and Sears.&nbsp; &quot;[T]he effect of the doctrine of spoliation, when applied in a defensive manner, is to allow a\r\ndefendant to exculpate itself from liability because the plaintiff has barred it from obtaining evidence . . . .&quot; Robert L. Tucker, The Flexible\r\nDoctrine of Spoliation of Evidence: Cause of Action, Defense, Evidentiary Presumption, and Discovery Sanction, 27 U. Tol. L. Rev. 67, 75 (1995).&nbsp; Other\r\nstates have allowed spoliation to be used as a defense while denying its availability as an independent cause of action. See, e.g., Hirsch v. General\r\nMotors Corp., 628 A.2d 1108, 1118-19 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1993) (discussing the use of negligent spoliation in New Jersey). &nbsp;Here, Hobbs'\r\nallegation that Cole Vision lost a key piece of evidence which it was contractually obligated to maintain, while not a legally cognizable counterclaim, remains\r\na viable defense in this action for indemnity.&nbsp;\r\nThe court of appeals reversed the circuit court's dismissal of Hobbs' counterclaim because it interpreted the claim as sounding in general negligence, and\r\nHobbs urges us to uphold the court of appeals' decision on this basis. However, we believe this semantic change does not render his counterclaim any more\r\nviable. &nbsp;&quot;It is the substance of the requested relief that matters 'regardless of the form in which the request for relief was framed.'&quot; Richland\r\nCounty v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 94, 567 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Mungo, 306 S.C. 22, 26, 410\r\nS.E.2d 18, 20 (Ct. App. 1991)).&nbsp; Whether denominated as a claim for spoliation of evidence or as a general negligence claim based on spoliation of\r\nevidence, the substance of this claim is the same: both are based on the allegation that Cole Vision breached its duty to maintain a key document, the absence\r\nof which harmed Hobbs in the underlying lawsuit.&nbsp; Therefore, we do not believe Hobbs' counterclaim survives simply by calling it a negligence claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhile Hobbs' claim that Cole Vision breached a contractual duty to maintain the document at issue remains a viable defense in this action for\r\nindemnification, because we decline to recognize the tort of negligent spoliation of evidence, the circuit court properly dismissed it as a counterclaim.&nbsp;\r\nThe decision of the court of appeals is therefore\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] While NCMIC was a party to the declaratory judgment action, it is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[2] &nbsp;&nbsp;Cole Vision claims that based on Austin, this Court does not recognize a cause of action\r\nfor spoliation of evidence, but that even if we were to recognize such a cause of action, Hobbs failed to plead an essential element of it.\r\n[3] â€œWhatâ€™s in a name?&nbsp; That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.â€&nbsp;\r\nWilliam Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, II, 11, 1-2.\r\n[4] In Hannah, the Supreme Court of West Virginia identified the following elements for the tort of\r\nnegligent spoliation of evidence by a third party: (1) the existence of a pending or potential civil action; (2) the alleged spoliator had actual knowledge of\r\nthe pending or potential civil action; (3) a duty to preserve evidence arising from a contract, agreement, statute, administrative rule, voluntary assumption of\r\nduty, or other special circumstances; (4) spoliation of the evidence; (5) the spoliated evidence was vital to a party's ability to prevail in a pending or\r\npotential civil action; and (6) damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; See Hannah, 584 S.E.2d at 569-70.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hannah court refused to recognize first\r\nparty negligent spoliation of evidence. &nbsp;Austin, 377 S.C. at 34 n.3, 659 S.E.2d at 124 n.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26989","title":"Cabiness v.

Clark, 360\r\n  S.C. 86, 600 S.E.2d 529 (2004).Â  While our opinion today does not make the\r\n  third time the proverbial charm for Town because we find its incorporation petition\r\n  was not sufficient, we reach the other issues presented in this case in the\r\n  interest of judicial economy to supply a sufficient framework for Town and\r\n  other unincorporated areas to successfully petition for incorporation in the\r\n  future.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTown\r\n  is located on an island just to the south of peninsular Charleston, South\r\n  Carolina, with approximately 20,000 inhabitants.Â  Over the years, the City of Charleston\r\n  and the City of Folly Beach have annexed various portions of James Island, all\r\n  done legally under the annexation statutes, resulting in various\r\n  &quot;pods&quot; and &quot;enclaves&quot; of incorporated areas on the island.Â \r\n  While Town does not now challenge the validity of these annexations, Charleston's\r\n  ever-growing presence on the island was the impetus for Town's incorporation\r\n  movement.\r\nIn Glaze, we invalidated Town's first attempt at incorporation on the\r\n  ground that the boundaries of the proposed town were not contiguous. 324 S.C.\r\n  at 254, 478 S.E.2d at 844.Â  Because there was no statutory definition of\r\n  contiguity in effect at the time, we supplied our own and found Town could not\r\n  satisfy it.Â  Specifically, we declined to permit Town to use waterways already\r\n  annexed by Charleston and Folly Beach to establish contiguity between areas it\r\n  sought to incorporate. Id. at 253-54, 478 S.E.2d at 844.Â  In response to\r\n  the definition of contiguity we announced in Glaze, the General Assembly\r\n  amended the incorporation statutes to include the following provision: \r\n\r\n  Contiguity is not destroyed by an intervening\r\n    marshland located in the tidal flow or an intervening publicly-owned waterway,\r\n    whether or not the marshland located in the tidal flow or the publicly-owned\r\n    waterway has been previously incorporated or annexed by another municipality.Â \r\n    The incorporation of a marshland located in the tidal flow or a publicly-owned\r\n    waterway does not preclude the marshland located in the tidal flow or the\r\n    publicly-owned waterway from subsequently being used by any other municipality\r\n    to established contiguity for purposes of an incorporation if the distance from\r\n    the highland to highland of the area being incorporated is not greater than\r\n    three-fourths of a mile.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 5-1-30(A)(4) (2000).Â  Town accordingly sought to incorporate again\r\n  using this revised definition of contiguity.Â  However, in Kizer we found\r\n  this new definition was unconstitutional special legislation because it singled\r\n  out incorporated areas seeking to use tidal marshes and waterways in\r\n  conjunction with incorporation, and not freshwater marshes, parks, or highways,\r\n  without a rational reason for doing so. 360 S.C. at 95, 600 S.E.2d at 533-34.\r\n Following\r\n  our decision in Kizer, the General Assembly again amended the\r\n  incorporation statutes, this time through 2005 Act No. 77 (Act 77), to address\r\n  the problems identified by this Court.Â  The requirement for contiguity now\r\n  reads: &quot;'Contiguous' means adjacent properties that share a continuous\r\n  border.Â  If a publicly-owned property intervenes between the two areas proposed\r\n  to be incorporated together, which but for the intervening publicly-owned\r\n  property would be adjacent and share a continuous border, the intervening\r\n  publicly-owned property does not destroy contiguity.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  5-1-30(A)(4) (Supp. 2010).Â  Publicly-owned property is &quot;any\r\n  federally-owned, state-owned, or county-owned land or water area.&quot; Id. Â§ 5-1-20(2).\r\nWith\r\n  this new, broader definition of contiguity, Town again sought incorporation.Â \r\n  It is this attempt at incorporation that is currently before the Court.Â  The\r\n  description of the proposed area to be incorporated contained in Town's Petition\r\n  for Incorporation (Petition) submitted to the Secretary of State's (Secretary)\r\n  office described Town's boundaries as the physical space commonly thought of as\r\n  the island of James Island but\r\n\r\n  specifically excluding all property legally annexed\r\n    into Folly Beach and Charleston, [and] specifically excluding those properties\r\n    for which contiguity is not established pursuant to Â§ 5-1-30([A])(4), as\r\n    represented and listed by [Tax Map Sequence (TMS)] numbers contained in Exhibit\r\n    A, attached hereto by reference and made a part thereof.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Petition contained a map identifying the properties to be included within Town's\r\n  corporate limits.Â  The list of TMS numbers attached to the Petition[1] contained the following disclaimer:\r\n\r\n  The attached list of TMS Numbers identifies properties\r\n    to be included in the proposed Town boundaries.Â  Because this list was obtained\r\n    from Charleston [C]ounty, it contains TMS Numbers which are not intended to be\r\n    included; thus, TMS numbers for properties not to be included have been struck\r\n    through or underscored by hand.Â  [D]o not include those properties struck\r\n    through or underscored in defining the proposed town's boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n  list of TMS numbers came from various sources, including Charleston County, Charleston,\r\n  and Folly Beach.Â  However, none of the over 9,200 TMS numbers included in that\r\n  list were struck through or underscored.Â  Additionally, the list and the\r\n  proposed map of Town's boundaries had some inconsistencies: 144 properties on\r\n  the TMS list were not marked on the map as being included in Town, and 117\r\n  properties identified on the map were not found in the TMS list.Â  Furthermore, Charleston\r\n  annexed 121 properties located on either the list or the map after Town filed\r\n  its Petition and Â­Â­Â­116 during the time prior to Town's filing of the Petition\r\n  but while it was organizing to do so.Â  Due to the fluctuating state of the\r\n  incorporated areas of James Island, Town re-checked and updated its data\r\n  throughout the Petition process in an attempt to stay current.\r\nAfter\r\n  receiving the Petition, the Secretary's office forwarded Town's Petition to the\r\n  Joint Legislative Committee on Municipal Incorporation (Committee).Â  The\r\n  Committee found the Petition sufficient and recommended that the Secretary\r\n  certify a local special election to determine whether the incorporation should\r\n  take place.Â  On the eve of the election, Town sent an e-mail to the Charleston\r\n  County Board of Elections, which was organizing the special election, striking\r\n  some twenty-four properties from the election roll because they were not\r\n  contiguous.[2]Â \r\n  Town did not inform the Secretary's office of this deletion.Â  The voters were\r\n  in favor of incorporation by a margin of three-to-one, and the Secretary's\r\n  office issued a Certificate of Incorporation to Town.Â  Appellants subsequently\r\n  challenged the election in the circuit court in a timely manner.\r\nBefore\r\n  the circuit court, Appellants first alleged that the most recent amendments to\r\n  the incorporation statutes effected by Act 77 were unconstitutional special\r\n  legislation.Â  Additionally, Appellants argued that Town's Petition was\r\n  insufficient and sought to incorporate property that is not contiguous.Â  The\r\n  court found for Town on all of Appellants' issues.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Does Town's Petition satisfy the\r\n  requirements of Section 5-1-24 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010)?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     Are the incorporation statutes\r\n  concerning contiguity and publicly-owned property unconstitutional special\r\n  legislation?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Does the definition of contiguity\r\n  supplied by section 5-1-30(A)(4) permit an area seeking to incorporate to use\r\n  publicly-owned property already incorporated or annexed into an existing\r\n  municipality to affirmatively establish contiguity?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Sufficiency of Petition\r\nAppellants argue Town's Petition failed to comply with\r\n  the requirements of section 5-1-24.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 5-1-24 lays out the content requirements for a\r\n  petition for incorporation.Â  It requires that the petition set out the\r\n  corporate limits for the proposed municipality and the number of inhabitants\r\n  residing therein. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-1-24(A)(1).Â  The petition must then be\r\n  signed by fifteen percent of the qualified electors who reside within those\r\n  limits. Id.Â  Finally, the petition must contain documentation concerning\r\n  the minimum service standards set out in section 5-1-30. Id. Â§\r\n  5-1-24(A)(2).Â  Appellants only challenge Town's compliance with the first\r\n  requirement, arguing that Town did not set forth its proposed limits with\r\n  sufficient specificity.\r\nIn its Petition, Town described the general metes and\r\n  bounds of the island of James Island and then specifically excluded all\r\n  property annexed by either Folly Beach or Charleston and property that is not\r\n  contiguous under section 5-1-30(A)(4).Â  Appellants point out that properties on\r\n  the map and the TMS list included with the Petition were not identical, each\r\n  containing properties not listed on the other as being included within Town's\r\n  boundaries; the boundaries of Town are subject to change due to challenges\r\n  regarding the contiguity of Town's limits, as well as Charleston's continuing\r\n  annexations; and twenty-four properties were stricken from the voter rolls on\r\n  the eve of the election.Â  Appellants therefore argue the Petition submitted by\r\n  Town was incomplete, contained inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and was\r\n  conditional upon the resolution of certain issues and Charleston's actions.Â \r\n  Accordingly, they believe it is void because it was not sufficiently clear to\r\n  enable the Secretary and the Committee to determine the proposed limits of\r\n  Town.Â  The circuit court disagreed, finding that Town substantially complied\r\n  with the requirements of section 5-1-24.\r\nBecause this section is a recent addition to South\r\n  Carolina's code, the appellate courts of this State have not yet had an\r\n  opportunity to address the requirements under it.Â  However, other jurisdictions\r\n  have squarely faced this issue with similar statutes.Â  In People ex rel.\r\n  Village of Worth v. Idhe, 177 N.E.2d 313 (Ill. 1961), the Supreme Court of\r\n  Illinois held that &quot;[d]escriptions of municipal boundaries are not\r\n  construed with the same strictness as those contained in deeds and contracts[,]\r\n  and if the incorporating petition and accompanying map, when viewed together,\r\n  fairly apprise the public of the property involved, the description will be\r\n  considered proper.&quot; Id. at 315.Â  So long as the variance in the\r\n  descriptions is not so great &quot;as to cause public misapprehension upon the\r\n  point,&quot; the petition is valid. Id.Â  In Wisconsin, &quot;if the\r\n  description and the map, when viewed together, fairly apprise the public of the\r\n  territory to be incorporated, the statute will be satisfied notwithstanding\r\n  certain errors or omissions.&quot; In re Incorporation of Town of Port\r\n  Washington as a Village, 637 N.W.2d 442, 446 (Wis. Ct. App. 2001).\r\nWe find the rules enunciated in Village of Worth and Town of Washington to be fair statements of the requirement under\r\n  section 5-1-24.Â  The language of section 5-1-24 does not require strict\r\n  construction of incorporation petitions, nor would such a requirement be reasonable.Â \r\n  During the time it takes to incorporate a municipality, many different\r\n  eventualities may occur that are out of the incorporating body's control.Â \r\n  Annexation into an existing municipality is a prime example.Â  During the\r\n  pendency of a petition for incorporation, an existing municipality can validly\r\n  annex properties that are within the proposed limits of the new entity.Â  Such\r\n  an act is perfectly lawful, and we do not wish to punish areas seeking to\r\n  incorporate by holding their petitions invalid because the precise limits are\r\n  in a state of flux due to continuing annexations.Â  Penalizing the municipality\r\n  for these actions would be inconsistent with the goal of allowing and\r\n  encouraging local areas to attain self-governance by permitting an adjoining\r\n  area to thwart these noble efforts.Â  Furthermore, when areas comprised of\r\n  thousands of separate properties seek to join together into a unified\r\n  municipality, requiring one-hundred percent accuracy for the boundary\r\n  description may be practically impossible.Â  County and local tax maps may not\r\n  be in sync, and there are often discrepancies between which properties lie in\r\n  unincorporated areas and which have already been incorporated or annexed.Â \r\n  Again, we cannot hold the expectant municipality accountable for such errors.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  a petition will sufficiently describe the boundaries of the proposed\r\n  municipality so long as it fairly apprises the public of what is to be\r\n  included, even if there are some errors or inconsistencies.\r\nHowever, we do not believe Town has met this\r\n  requirement.Â  The problem lies not with the continuing annexations performed by\r\n  Charleston, nor with the discrepancies between the map and the TMS list, which\r\n  only account for a relatively small number of the total properties sought to be\r\n  incorporated.[3]Â \r\n  There is also no deficiency in excluding all areas already incorporated into\r\n  Folly Beach and Charleston, as most people would know whether their property is\r\n  within the unincorporated part of James Island or either of those cities.Â \r\n  Additionally, Town did not err in striking properties from the election roll on\r\n  the eve of the election as these properties were not contiguous with Town and\r\n  therefore not part of it to begin with.Â  The total effect of all those issues\r\n  is, at most, de minimis, and the result of the realities of the\r\n  incorporation process.\r\nInstead, the flaw in Town's Petition emanates solely\r\n  from the language simply excluding all properties that are not contiguous under\r\n  section 5-1-30(A)(4).Â  As the parties made clear through the various exhibits\r\n  used during the trial, our final interpretation of contiguity has the potential\r\n  to affect the inclusion of well over one thousand properties, which cannot be\r\n  considered to be de minimis.Â  We recognize that the reason why\r\n  contiguity is an issue in this case is the piecemeal annexation of properties\r\n  on James Island by Charleston before, during, and after the filing of the\r\n  Petition.Â  While the mere fact that Charleston was annexing properties during\r\n  this time does not by itself impact the sufficiency of Town's Petition, we must\r\n  draw the line where those actions potentially impact the inclusion of large\r\n  portions of the properties sought to be incorporated by cutting off sizeable\r\n  areas from the main body of Town.Â  When this happens, we are no longer faced\r\n  with &quot;certain errors or omissions&quot; or a fair notification of what is\r\n  to be included.Â  Instead, we are confronted with a situation where the\r\n  inclusion of a significant number of properties is contingent upon a post\r\n  hoc judicial determination, which leaves the voters unaware of whether\r\n  large portions of Town will ever be incorporated at the time they cast their\r\n  votes.Â  In the case before us, this causes sufficient uncertainty over what the\r\n  public believes is included within Town such that they could not be fairly apprised\r\n  of the property involved.\r\nWe recognize that this places Town in the unenviable\r\n  position of attempting to define an area it seeks to include without much\r\n  guidance from the applicable statutes or case law and with much disagreement as\r\n  to what properly can be included.Â  However, Town took no preliminary steps to\r\n  determine what it may be able to incorporate despite knowing of this contingency.Â \r\n  This created a major risk that Town may be seeking to exclude a large number of\r\n  non-contiguous properties by merely excluding a broad and vague category of\r\n  properties in the Petition.Â  It is the uncertainty generated by this risk that\r\n  renders the Petition insufficient.Â  As best as we can tell, this risk is fairly\r\n  unique due to Town's relationship with Charleston, but it is still a\r\n  substantial risk nonetheless.Â  Despite the inclusion of a map and list of TMS\r\n  numbers[4] to illustrate what Town was attempting to incorporate, the uncertainty\r\n  surrounding the inclusion of large tracts of property within Town's proposed limits\r\n  renders the Petition insufficient.[5]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court.Â  We realize our conclusion that Town's Petition was not\r\n  sufficient is dispositive of this case.Â  However, in the interest of judicial\r\n  economy and the likely event of Town re-filing its Petition, we reach the\r\n  remaining issues to provide guidance for future incorporation petitions and\r\n  help alleviate the ambiguities that plagued Town's most recent petition.\r\n\r\nII. Constitutionality of\r\n  Contiguity Provisions\r\nNext, we consider the question of whether the\r\n  contiguity provisions enacted through Act 77 are unconstitutional special\r\n  legislation.Â  Appellants contend the 2005 amendments are\r\n  unconstitutional because they treat those annexing into an existing municipality\r\n  differently than those seeking to incorporate separately.Â  In particular, they\r\n  allege persons seeking to incorporate can cross over and &quot;disregard&quot;\r\n  existing municipal boundaries to establish contiguity, while the same is not\r\n  permitted for property owners attempting to annex.Â  In response, Town argues\r\n  those incorporating and those annexing are not part of the same class,\r\n  therefore the amendments do not result in disparate treatment among class\r\n  members, which is the hallmark of special legislation.Â  We agree with Town and\r\n  hold the statute constitutional.\r\nOur Constitution provides, &quot;The General Assembly\r\n  of this State shall not enact local or special laws concerning any of the\r\n  following subjects or for any of the following purposes, to wit: . . . To\r\n  incorporate cities, towns or villages, or change, amend, or extend charter\r\n  thereof.&quot; S.C. Const. art III, Â§ 34, cl. II.Â  When a statute is challenged\r\n  on the ground that it is special legislation, the first step is to identify the\r\n  class of persons to whom the legislation applies. Kizer, 360 S.C. at\r\n  92-93, 600 S.E.2d at 532.Â  In this regard, our special legislation framework\r\n  largely tracks that for determining whether a statute violates one's right to\r\n  equal protection. Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 533.Â  If the statute treats\r\n  all class members equally, then the law is general legislation and permissible. Id. at 92-93, 600 S.E.2d at 532.Â  The law must be general both in form\r\n  and in operation. Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 532.\r\nIf the legislation does not apply uniformly, the second\r\n  step is to determine the basis for that classification. Id. Â It is\r\n  well-settled that the mere fact a statute creates a classification does not\r\n  render it unconstitutional special legislation. Id.Â  Rather, it is only\r\n  arbitrary classifications with no reasonable hypothesis to support them that\r\n  are prohibited. Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 533.Â  Again, this parallels our\r\n  analysis under the rational basis test for equal protection challenges.Â  A\r\n  classification is constitutional &quot;if some intrinsic reason exists why the\r\n  law should operate upon some and not upon all, or should affect some\r\n  differently than others,&quot; or the special law &quot;best meet[s] the\r\n  exigencies of a particular situation.&quot; Id.Â  Put another way,\r\n  &quot;[t]he classification must bear some reasonable relation to the object\r\n  sought to be obtained by the law.&quot; U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. City of\r\n  Columbia, 252 S.C. 55, 61, 165 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1969).Â  As always, statutes\r\n  are presumed constitutional, and the party challenging them must prove their\r\n  infirmity beyond a reasonable doubt. McElveen v. Stokes, 240 S.C. 1, 6,\r\n  124 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1962).Â  &quot;We will not overrule the [General\r\n  Assembly]'s judgment that a special law is necessary unless there has been a\r\n  clear and palpable abuse of legislative discretion.&quot; Kizer, 360\r\n  S.C. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 533.\r\nTurning to the case before us, we must first determine\r\n  the proper class to which Act 77 applies.Â  Appellants argue the class created\r\n  is the broader group of all those seeking to effect changes in municipal\r\n  boundaries, be it through incorporation or annexation.Â  Town argues, and we\r\n  agree, that the class is comprised solely of people seeking to incorporate;\r\n  those attempting to annex are in a separate class unto themselves.Â  First, the\r\n  statute by its very terms applies only to those incorporating; the provisions\r\n  for annexation are found in another chapter of the code.Â  Second, there are\r\n  myriad differences between incorporation and annexation such that those\r\n  attempting to accomplish either are not similarly situated. Compare S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 5-1-10, et seq. (incorporation statutes) with S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-10, et seq. (annexation statutes).[6]Â \r\n  Therefore, those incorporating and those annexing are dissimilar enough that\r\n  they are not in the same class for purposes of our special legislation analysis.Â \r\n  Because the contiguity statute treats all members of the class of incorporators\r\n  similarly on its face, it is general legislation in form.\r\nFurther, we find no evidence that Act 77 in practice\r\n  affects only a certain number of individuals seeking to incorporate, which was\r\n  the first constitutional defect identified in Kizer.Â  Although the\r\n  contiguity statute in effect at that time in Kizer applied generally on\r\n  its face, we determined that in reality it applied only to &quot;any\r\n  unincorporated area that is geographically configured so that it may\r\n  establish contiguity using previously annexed marshland and waterways.&quot; Kizer, 360 S.C. at 94, 600 S.E.2d at 533 (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  legislation therefore implicitly created two different groups of incorporators:\r\n  those using previously annexed marshland and waterways and those seeking to use\r\n  other previously annexed property. Id. at 95, 600 S.E.2d at 534.Â  Because\r\n  of this disparity, we proceeded to determine whether the classification was\r\n  arbitrary and unreasonable. Id. at 94, 600 S.E.2d at 533.Â  Here, the\r\n  statute is not so limited.Â  In Kizer, we were troubled that only areas\r\n  situated next to tidal marshlands and waterways could take advantage of\r\n  provisions of the statute, which amounted to a very small number of\r\n  unincorporated areas in the State. Id. Â Although a class comprised of\r\n  one member certainly can be constitutional, id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at\r\n  532, we found the statute created two distinct groups within the class of\r\n  incorporators, id. at 94, 600 S.E.2d 533.Â  The version of the statute\r\n  now before the Court addressed that concern by permitting the use of any publicly-owned property, regardless of where it exists in the State.Â  While an\r\n  area seeking to incorporate only benefits from the current version of section\r\n  5-1-30(A)(4) if there is publicly-owned property available for use in the\r\n  manner prescribed, the current language does not present the same geographically\r\n  targeted approach as that at issue in Kizer.Â  In fact, Appellants appear\r\n  to concede that Act 77 creates no true subclasses within the broader class of\r\n  incorporators.Â  Therefore, Appellants have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n  that Act 77 implicitly creates two groups of incorporators, and we find it is\r\n  general in operation.Â  We accordingly hold that the amendments contained in Act\r\n  77 are constitutional.\r\nBecause we hold that the statute in question is\r\n  general legislation as it creates no disparate treatment within the applicable\r\n  class, we need not reach the second question in our special legislation\r\n  analysis of whether any subclass created is reasonable.Â  Contrary to\r\n  Appellants' argument that &quot;the legal underpinning of any law is its rationality,\r\n  regardless of its general application or whether it creates a class,&quot; a\r\n  law cannot be unconstitutional special legislation unless it is first, indeed,\r\n  special.Â  Were we to examine the rationality of a law irrespective of any\r\n  classification it creates, we would impermissibly step from our position as the\r\n  arbiter of a statute's constitutionality and into the seats of the General\r\n  Assembly.Â  The mere fact that a law may be irrational does not automatically\r\n  make it unconstitutional.Â  Such arguments must be made at the ballot box, not\r\n  to the bench.\r\nIII. Definition of Contiguity\r\nThe resolution of the challenge regarding the\r\n  definition of contiguity revolves around two issues: (1) whether ownership of\r\n  property for purposes of section 5-1-20(2) requires fee simple ownership or\r\n  embraces other possessory interests such as easements and right of ways and (2)\r\n  whether an area seeking to incorporate can use publicly-owned property to\r\n  affirmatively establish and create contiguity with another area.Â  Town argues\r\n  that a strict interpretation of the definition of ownership contravenes the express\r\n  intent of the General Assembly, and we agree.Â  As to precise application of\r\n  contiguity, Appellants urge us to focus on the words &quot;but for&quot;\r\n  contained in the statute and argue for a stricter interpretation of\r\n  contiguity.Â  Town, on the other hand, argues for a broader view of contiguity,\r\n  in essence arguing that so long as unincorporated areas can be connected by\r\n  publicly-owned propertyâ€”even if that includes &quot;running down&quot; public roads\r\n  to do soâ€”the incorporating area has met the contiguity requirement.[7]Â \r\n  As to this issue, we agree with Appellants.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is that\r\n  the intent of the legislature must prevail if it reasonably can be discerned\r\n  from the words used in the statute. Eagle Container Co. v. County of\r\n  Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 571, 666 S.E.2d 892, 895 (2008).Â  These words must\r\n  be construed in context and in light of the intended purpose of the statute in\r\n  a manner &quot;which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its\r\n  general purpose.&quot; Id. at 570, 666 S.E.2d at 896.Â  The meaning of\r\n  certain words can be ascertained by reference to associated words in the\r\n  statute. Id.Â  However, if the language is plain and unambiguous, we must\r\n  enforce the plain and clear meaning of the words used. Id.Â  But if applying\r\n  the plain language would lead to an absurd result, we will interpret the words\r\n  in such a way as to escape the absurdity. Ventures S.C., LLC v. S.C.\r\n  Dep't of Revenue, 378 S.C. 5, 9, 661 S.E.2d 339, 341 (2008).Â  A merely\r\n  conjectural absurdity is not enough; the result must be &quot;so patently\r\n  absurd that it is clear that the [General Assembly] could not have intended\r\n  such a result.&quot; Harris v. Anderson County Sheriff's Office, 381\r\n  S.C. 357, 363 n.1, 673 S.E.2d 423, 426 n.1 (2009).\r\nThe current version of the incorporation statutes\r\n  generally states that areas seeking to incorporate must be contiguous, meaning\r\n  they are adjacent and share a continuous border. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  5-1-30(A)(4).Â  However, if publicly-owned property intervenes between two areas\r\n  sought to be incorporated together as one, which but for that property would be\r\n  contiguous, then they are still considered contiguous for incorporation\r\n  purposes. Id.Â  In other words, contiguity is not &quot;destroyed&quot;\r\n  by that publicly-owned property. Id.Â  Publicly-owned property is any\r\n  federally-owned, state-owned, or county-owned land or water. Id. Â§\r\n  5-1-20(2).Â  Publicly-owned property will not destroy contiguity even if it\r\n  already has been annexed by an existing municipality. Id. Â§\r\n  5-1-24(A)(2).\r\nIn addition to the plain language of these particular\r\n  provisions, the General Assembly included various policy statements in the code\r\n  and in Act 77 regarding incorporation.Â  Section 5-1-22 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2010) reads,\r\n\r\n  The General Assembly finds and declares the following\r\n    to be the public policy of the State of South Carolina:\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; publicly-owned property may be\r\n      incorporated or annexed by a municipality as provided by the state's statutory\r\n      law; however, publicly-owned property is for the benefit of all citizens of the\r\n      State and is not the exclusive territory of any one municipality; and\r\n    \r\n      \r\n      (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incorporation or annexation of\r\n      publicly-owned property does not confer or convey to a municipality control over\r\n      the publicly-owned property that in any way:    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interferes with the superior\r\n        authority of the federal, state, or county government; or\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevents an area seeking to be\r\n        incorporated from using the publicly-owned property to establish contiguity as\r\n        provided in Section 5-1-30(A)(4).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe preamble to Act 77 contains similar language:\r\n\r\n  Whereas, municipal boundaries are limited\r\n    only by the state's statutory law requirements; and\r\n   Whereas, some municipalities already extend\r\n    across county lines; and\r\n  Whereas, if a publicly-owned property, such\r\n    as a road or waterway, is within the exclusive territory of a single\r\n    municipality, that municipality could extend its boundaries across the State,\r\n    preventing areas that otherwise meet the statutory requirements for municipal\r\n    incorporation from attaining local self-governance; and\r\n  Whereas, the General Assembly finds and\r\n    declares that publicly-owned property is for the benefit of all citizens of the\r\n    State and not to be used as the exclusive territory of any one municipality.\r\n\r\nWe do not read the word &quot;owned&quot; as being\r\n  limited to only fee simple ownership.Â  When federal, state, county, or local\r\n  governments have an interest in a road, there is little else the fee simple\r\n  owner can do with that property.Â  Not only does the evidence before us show\r\n  that these bodies hold their interests in perpetuity, but should the fee simple\r\n  owner object to the government's use, the government could simply condemn the\r\n  property and take title in fee simple.Â  In these instances, there is little, if\r\n  anything, the private owner could do to the detriment of the rights he or his\r\n  predecessor granted to the public body.Â  For all intents and purposes, the\r\n  government therefore is the owner of the property for purposes of incorporation.\r\n  Â As evidence of the absurdity created by Appellants' position, Town points out\r\n  that one of the roads in question in this case has two owners: the inner two\r\n  lanes of it are privately owned with the state holding a right of way, while\r\n  the state owns the outer two lanes in fee simple.Â  Declaring only one-half of\r\n  the road to be publicly-owned property, while the general populace has an equal\r\n  right to use the entirety of it regardless of which lane they happen to be\r\n  traveling in, cannot be the result intended by the General Assembly. Â Such a\r\n  result would be contrary to the General Assembly's express intent of fostering\r\n  incorporation by not permitting public roads and waterways to destroy the\r\n  required contiguity.Â  The thrust of property being publicly-owned is that it be\r\n  for the benefit of the public, which is not dictated solely by who owns the\r\n  underlying earth.\r\nHowever, we disagree with Town and the circuit court\r\n  as to the ultimate application of the principle of contiguity.Â  We agree with\r\n  Appellants that the &quot;but for&quot; language used in section 5-1-30(A)(4)\r\n  means that if the publicly-owned property simply were to be removed, the\r\n  question is whether the properties then share a continuous border.[8]Â \r\n  The record compiled by the parties for this appeal contains numerous, well-executed\r\n  exhibits illustrating this principle.Â  Perhaps the most convincing exhibits\r\n  illustrated the &quot;but for&quot; concept of contiguity in a &quot;MAD\r\n  Magazine&quot; style back-page folding manner,[9] where a map of two areas alleged to be contiguous was folded in such a manner\r\n  as to eliminate the previously-annexed publicly-owned property.Â  As an added\r\n  illustration, the language of the statute requires taking a zipper and closing\r\n  up the publicly-owned property so that it does not exist for these purposes.Â \r\n  It is only then that one truly can determine if but for that\r\n  publicly-owned property would the areas touch.Â  While the specific property\r\n  lines and geographic configuration of some areas may make this analysis\r\n  somewhat difficult, every effort must be made to close up the publicly-owned\r\n  property in question for purposes of this analysis.Â  Under the analysis accepted\r\n  by the circuit court and argued by Town, publicly-owned property may not be the\r\n  only thing between the areas sought to be incorporated, yet the areas would\r\n  still be contiguous.Â  In numerous instances, for example, once the\r\n  publicly-owned property was removed from the equation, other properties already\r\n  annexed by Charleston intervened between what Town seeks to incorporate.Â  In\r\n  those cases, it is only by traversing the length of the road and around these\r\n  other properties that one can connect the properties claimed to be contiguous.Â \r\n  This affirmative use of publicly-owned property to establish contiguity ignores\r\n  the plain &quot;but for&quot; language contained therein.Â  Furthermore, it improperly\r\n  inverts the language that publicly-owned property does not destroy contiguity\r\n  into the proposition that publicly-owned property can affirmatively establish\r\n  it.Â  \r\nTown argues that this construction of contiguity is\r\n  contrary to the stated public policy of more freedom in using publicly-owned property\r\n  for purposes of incorporation.Â  Indeed, we just concluded supra that the\r\n  strict interpretation of the word &quot;owned&quot; contravenes that policy and\r\n  the intent of the General Assembly.Â  However, the same is not true when\r\n  applying the plain language of the contiguity definition.Â  The code provides\r\n  that publicly-owned property is &quot;for the benefit of all citizens of the\r\n  State and is not the exclusive territory of any one municipality.&quot; Id. Â§ 5-1-22(1).Â  It also states that no municipality can exercise control over\r\n  publicly-owned property in any way that prevents it from being used to\r\n  establish contiguity under section 5-1-30(A)(4). Id. Â§ 5-1-22(2)(b)\r\n  (citing id. Â§ 5-1-30(A)(4)).Â  Those provisions, however, do not create\r\n  an unfettered right inuring to unincorporated areas to use publicly-owned\r\n  property for incorporation purposes.Â  Instead, they specifically refer to and\r\n  are controlled by the statute governing contiguity.Â  Nothing in our\r\n  interpretation of contiguity would enable an existing municipality to prevent\r\n  an area seeking to incorporate from using publicly-owned property, and nothing\r\n  places it in the hands of any one municipality.Â  What prevents Town from using\r\n  certain parcels of publicly-owned property to establish contiguity is not the\r\n  manner in which Charleston uses it, but the limitations imposed by the statute.\r\nTherefore, while we found strict adherence to the\r\n  plain language of the definition of publicly-owned property produced results contrary\r\n  to the express intent of the General Assembly, nothing compels us to do the\r\n  same here.Â  We must ensure that the absurd results exception to the plain\r\n  language rule of statutory construction remains an exception and apply it only\r\n  when the absurdity is clear. See Harris, 381 S.C. at 363 n.1, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  at 426 n.1 (&quot;While we may be concerned with the unintended consequences of\r\n  applying the clear meaning of [the statute] in every conceivable circumstance,\r\n  such concerns in this case fall short of an absurdity that would warrant\r\n  applying this rule of statutory construction.&quot;).Â  Here, we find no patent\r\n  violation of the public policy announced by the General Assembly.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we adhere to the plain language of the definition of contiguity and require incorporating\r\n  areas with issues pertaining to contiguity to conceptually eliminate\r\n  publicly-owned property from the map of their proposed boundaries and determine\r\n  if the properties would then touch.[10]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, we hold Town's Petition was not sufficient under section 5-1-24,\r\n  and therefore we reverse the order of the circuit court upholding Town's most\r\n  recent attempt at incorporation.Â  Accordingly, we remand this matter to the\r\n  circuit court for entry of judgment in favor of Appellants.Â  However, because\r\n  of the need for clarity in this area, we reach the remaining issues presented\r\n  by Appellants.Â  In doing so, we affirm the circuit court's conclusion that the\r\n  incorporation scheme at issue here is not unconstitutional special\r\n  legislation.Â  We further affirm the circuit court's holding that the term &quot;publicly-owned\r\n  property&quot; does not require fee simple ownership by the federal, state, or\r\n  county governments.Â  However, we reverse the circuit court's analysis of\r\n  contiguity and hold that it is not proper for an area seeking to incorporate to\r\n  &quot;run down&quot; the length of a public road to add more properties to the\r\n  proposed municipality.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur, but write separately as I believe that\r\n  the issue of the sufficiency of the petition is dispositive of the appeal.Â  I\r\n  therefore join only Part I of the majorityâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n[1] This list was not found in &quot;Exhibit A,&quot; the\r\n  exhibit referenced in the description of the boundaries.Â  The document titled\r\n  Exhibit A to the Petition was a Certification of Population Density.Â  This list\r\n  of TMS numbers was identified as part of Attachment 1 to Exhibit H, a\r\n  feasibility study.\r\n[2] Appellants claim to not know why Town asked these\r\n  properties be stricken from the roll.Â  However, the circuit court specifically\r\n  found these properties were not contiguous to the main body of the proposed\r\n  town.Â  Because Appellants have not challenged that finding on appeal, it is the\r\n  law of the case. See Johnson v. Hunter, 386 S.C. 452, 455, 688 S.E.2d\r\n  593, 595 (Ct. App. 2010). Â Â Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal these\r\n  properties are not, nor were they ever, part of the area to be incorporated.\r\n[3] Town argues that because TMS numbers are not required\r\n  by the statute to be included in a petition for incorporation, their inaccuracy\r\n  in this case does not affect its incorporation.Â  However, because Town\r\n  specifically referenced and included these TMS numbers in the Petition, we\r\n  cannot disregard them.\r\n[4] Although Town's Petition did include a list of TMS\r\n  numbers for properties it said were included within its boundaries, the\r\n  list contained a notation that properties it did not seek to include had been\r\n  struck through or underscored.Â  Because none of the numbers were marked out, we\r\n  do not believe the public could fairly rely on this list to determine what was\r\n  to be included in Town.Â  \r\n[5] We do not hold that any uncertainty or the threat of\r\n  any legal challenge to the precise boundaries of a proposed town will render\r\n  the incorporation petition insufficient.Â  Rather, it is in a case such as this\r\n  where the inclusion of sizeable portions of the municipality is at stake that\r\n  the sufficiency of the petition come into question.\r\n[6] Although these differences are rooted in statute,\r\n  Appellants do not argue they represent disparate treatment between\r\n  incorporation and annexation.Â  Rather, these provisions demonstrate the\r\n  fundamental differences between property owners attempting to annex into an\r\n  existing municipality versus those seeking to incorporate separately. \r\n[7] In instances where Town seeks to incorporate\r\n  publicly-owned property, this problem does not arise.Â  There, the\r\n  publicly-owned property is to be part of Town and there is no issue of it\r\n  &quot;destroying&quot; contiguity.Â  This issue only arises where publicly-owned\r\n  property already annexed by Charleston intervenes between areas Town\r\n  seeks to incorporate.\r\n[8] Under this requirement, if two parcels touch even at\r\n  just one point, they are contiguous.Â  Appellants argue that in order to be\r\n  contiguous, the parcels' boundaries must overlap to some degree, no matter how\r\n  small.Â  Under their view, if two parcels touch at just one point, they are not\r\n  contiguous because under principles of geometry, one can pass through a single\r\n  point only once and cannot return through it again.Â  However correct this\r\n  argument may be geometrically, it is not in tune with the statutory requirements\r\n  involved here.Â  Section 5-1-30(A)(4) does not require overlap between the\r\n  properties; it only requires that they share a continuous border.Â  It was\r\n  conceded at trial that even when two properties touch at one point, the border\r\n  they share is continuous.Â  \r\n[9] For those not familiar with this reference, we\r\n  suggest examining the following compilation of MAD Magazine fold-ins from the\r\n  New York Times: Fold-Ins, Past and Present - Interactive Feature - NYTimes.com,\r\n  http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/03/28/arts/20080330_FOLD_IN_FEATURE.html#.\r\n[10] The contiguity provision for annexation contains the\r\n  same &quot;but for&quot; language as the incorporation statute. Compare S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-150 (annexation) with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-1-30(A)(4)\r\n  (incorporation).Â  The only difference is the annexation statute specifically\r\n  states the property mentionedâ€”which is not the familiar publicly-owned\r\n  propertyâ€”cannot be used to affirmatively establish contiguity. Id. Â§\r\n  5-3-150.Â  While the incorporation statute does not have the same express\r\n  statement that publicly-owned property does not affirmatively create\r\n  contiguity, the fact both statutes have identical &quot;but for&quot;\r\n  provisions is certainly probative of the General Assembly's intent that they\r\n  are to operate in the same way.

Risher's critical area permit application to construct a bridge over a portion of wetlands contained within his property on Fripp Island, South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRisher is the record owner of a 0.475 acre piece of property identified as Lot 1, Block B, Subdivision 13, Fripp Island and Beaufort County, South Carolina\r\n(Lot).&nbsp; The Lot consists of 0.269 acres of upland high ground (buildable portion), and the remainder, which partially surrounds the buildable portion, is\r\ncomposed of wetlands.&nbsp; The Lot abuts a man-made, paved, non-vehicular foot/bike path on one side, which is maintained by the Fripp Island Property Owners\r\nAssociation.&nbsp;\r\nOne year prior to Risher's purchase of the Lot, his predecessor in title applied with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)\r\nand was approved for a critical area permit to construct a vehicular bridge across the non-buildable wetland portion of the Lot, connecting with the nearest\r\nvehicular road, Tarpon Boulevard.&nbsp; Risher purchased the Lot in 1997 and testified he understood his purchase to include the bridge permit.[1]&nbsp; Risher did not have the funds to construct the bridge pursuant to the permit immediately after his purchase;\r\ntherefore, the Lot remained undeveloped.&nbsp;\r\nIn 2006, Risher contracted with O'Quinn Marine Construction, Inc. to construct a bridge similar to the one previously submitted and approved by his\r\npredecessor in title. &nbsp;To that end, Risher submitted a permit application to DHEC's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM).&nbsp; The\r\napplication requested permission to construct a concrete bridge measuring twelve feet wide, eighty-five feet long, at a height of three feet above the existing\r\nwetland grade.&nbsp; OCRM took the matter under advisement, but ultimately denied Risher's application based on its finding that the upland buildable portion of\r\nthe Lot qualified as a coastal island which was too small to allow bridge access.&nbsp;\r\nAfter exhausting DHEC's review options, Risher filed a Request for a Contested Case Hearing with the Administrative Law Court (ALC).&nbsp; Subsequently, both\r\nthe South Carolina Attorney General's office and the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League filed motions to intervene before the ALC, which were\r\ngranted.&nbsp; A hearing was held, and the ALC issued an order reversing DHEC's denial of Risher's permit request.&nbsp; The State filed a motion to alter or\r\namend the judgment seeking to be dismissed as a party from the action.&nbsp; The State's motion was granted, and thereafter the ALC issued an amended final\r\norder noting the State's dismissal.&nbsp; Both DHEC and the Conservation League (collectively Appellants) appeal the ALC's determination and present the\r\nfollowing issues to the Court on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n      Did the ALC err as a matter of law in admitting the opinion testimony of an unqualified witness and then relying\r\n        upon that testimony for the basis of its decision?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n      Did the ALC err in making itself a witness, when it made findings and conclusions based on its own on-site\r\n        inspection?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n      Is the decision of the ALC supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record?[2]\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes this Court's standard of review for cases decided by the ALC and is set forth in Section 1-23-610(B) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (Supp. 2009), which provides:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  The review of the administrative law judge's order must be confined to the record.&nbsp; The court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the\r\n  administrative law judge as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.&nbsp; The court of appeals may affirm the decision or remand the case for\r\n  further proceedings; or, it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding,\r\n  conclusion, or decision is:\r\n  \r\n    (a)&nbsp; in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n    (b)&nbsp; in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    (c)&nbsp; made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n    (d)&nbsp; affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e)&nbsp; clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n    (f)&nbsp; arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n  \r\n\r\nA decision of the ALC should be upheld, therefore, if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Qualifications of Testifying Witness\r\nAppellants first assert the ALC erred in admitting the opinion testimony of an unqualified witness and then relying upon that testimony for the basis of its\r\ndecision.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nLorick Fanning was called to testify on behalf of Risher.&nbsp; As will soon become apparent, Appellants consistently objected to Fanning's ability to\r\ntestify as to the facts and circumstances of this case, as well as the conclusions he drew therefrom.&nbsp; On appeal, Appellants assert the ALC committed\r\nreversible error in allowing Fanning to repeatedly testify beyond the scope of what they perceived to be his area of expertise.\r\nFanning held undergraduate degrees in geology and forestry and had continuing education courses in land surveying, forestry, wetlands, and hydric soils, in\r\naddition to being registered as both a land surveyor and a forester in the State.&nbsp; The ALC qualified Fanning as an expert in forestry and land surveying,\r\nand, over objection, in the identification of wetland boundaries, including critical area boundaries.&nbsp; In support of his qualifications, Fanning testified\r\nhe had delineated wetlands &quot;at least 1000 times,&quot; with the vast majority of those delineations dealing with coastal topography and critical area\r\ndeterminations.&nbsp; Later in his testimony, Fanning described the role that soil interpretations play in the analysis of wetland boundary determinations,\r\nrelying on his academic background in hydric soils as well as his degree in geology; however, Fanning did not hold himself out as an expert in soil\r\nclassification.&nbsp; Again, over objection, the ALC permitted Fanning to testify as to the role soils played in his determination of the Lot's wetland and\r\ncritical boundary.&nbsp;\r\nShortly thereafter, Appellants further objected to Fanning's ability to testify as to whether the Lot was a part of Fripp Island, based on his own\r\nperformance of a mean high water survey.[3]&nbsp; The ALC overruled Appellants' objections, and Fanning\r\nwas permitted to testify that the Lot was indeed a part of Fripp Island.&nbsp; Appellants again objected to Fanning's testimony regarding whether or not the Lot\r\nwas an integral part of the surrounding area's estuarine system.[4]&nbsp; Here, the ALC initially\r\nsustained Appellants' objection regarding Fanning's qualifications to testify; however, the court later reversed its ruling on Appellants' objection and allowed\r\nFanning to be recalled for the purpose of testifying as to his opinion on the Lot's inclusion in the estuarine system.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;To be competent to testify as an expert, a witness must have acquired by reason of study or experience or both such knowledge and skill in a profession\r\nor science that he is better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of his testimony.&quot;&nbsp; Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier\r\nHosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997) (citation omitted); Rule 702, SCRE (&quot;If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\r\nwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\r\ntraining, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&quot;).&nbsp; &quot;Qualification depends on the particular witness'\r\nreference to the subject.&quot;&nbsp; Gooding, 326 S.C. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598.\r\n&quot;The qualification of a witness as an expert and admissibility of his testimony are matters largely within the discretion of the trial judge; however,\r\nthe exercise of this discretion will be reversed where an abuse of discretion has occurred.&quot;&nbsp; Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 60-61, 495 S.E.2d\r\n205, 211 (1998) (citation omitted).&nbsp; As discussed in a recent opinion of this Court, trial courts have a gatekeeping role with respect to all evidence\r\nsought to be admitted under Rule 702.&nbsp; State v. White, 382 S.C. 265, 274, 676 S.E.2d 684, 689 (2009).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  In the discharge of its gatekeeping role, a trial court must assess the threshold foundational requirements of qualifications and reliability and further\r\n  find that the proposed evidence will assist the trier of fact. The familiar evidentiary mantra that a challenge to evidence goes to &quot;weight, not\r\n  admissibility&quot; may be invoked only after the trial court has vetted the matters of qualifications and reliability and admitted the evidence.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nIn support of their contention that Fanning was unqualified to give his opinions on a variety of pertinent subjects, Appellants rely on two principal\r\ncases:&nbsp; Nelson v. Taylor, 347 S.C. 210, 553 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 2001); and State v. Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 547 S.E.2d 490 (2001).&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.&nbsp; The record shows the ALC properly considered both the amount and quality of Fanning's educational qualifications in the first instance, as well\r\nas the reliability of the proffered testimony on each subject once he was duly qualified.&nbsp; The court was vigilant in its efforts to ensure Fanning's\r\ntestimony did not go beyond the scope of his expertise, and correctly decided that the matters upon which he testified were subjects about which he could\r\nreliably address.&nbsp; Consequently, the ALC did not abuse its discretion in either qualifying Fanning or in admitting his testimony.\r\nII. Onsite Inspection by the ALC\r\nAppellants next contend the ALC erred in making itself a witness when it made findings and conclusions based on its own on-site inspection.&nbsp; We find\r\nthis issue is not preserved for review.\r\nFollowing the close of all the evidence, the ALC decided sua sponte to view the lot on his own.&nbsp; Both parties consented on the record to his\r\nproposed visit.&nbsp; Following the judge's on-site inspection, he issued an order containing the following factual findings:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Based on this Court's own inspection of the Petitioner's lot, it is possible to walk unassisted and without crossing any standing water from Tarpon Blvd.\r\n  to the 0.269 acres of high ground at the location of the bridge proposed in the Permit Application.\r\n\r\nThe ALC also included the following footnote after this finding of fact:\r\n\r\n  Petitioner's lot was admitted into evidence at the Court's suggestion and with the consent of all parties.&nbsp; On December 11, 2008, this Court inspected\r\n  Petitioner's lot at low tide, giving special attention to the area that the proposed bridge would cross.&nbsp; I was left with a lasting impression that if\r\n  the area between Tarpon Blvd. and the upland portion of Petitioner's lot was mowed, it would look like a lawn.&nbsp; Moreover, I could walk across that area\r\n  without getting mud on my shoes.\r\n\r\nAppellants, relying on Rule 605, SCRE, argue that a presiding judge should not testify in a trial as a witness.&nbsp; While Appellants acknowledge that the\r\nALJ did not actually &quot;testify,&quot; they maintain he clearly testified in his final order &quot;when it was too late for any party to object or to even\r\nattempt to cross-examine or rebut this new witness.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nThe ALC, as the ultimate finder of fact in this action, was free to visit the Lot and draw its own conclusions therefrom.&nbsp; See Brown v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560 S.E.2d 410, 413 (2002) (stating the ALC acts as the fact-finder in reviewing permitting\r\ndecisions and is not restricted by the findings of the administrative agency); see also Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 273-74, 363\r\nS.E.2d 891, 895-96 (1987) (approving the ability of a trial judge, also acting as a trier of fact, to conduct an on-site inspection of the premises in\r\nquestion).&nbsp; The Chief Justice makes a persuasive argument concerning the problems that result from an ALC's inclusion of facts and observations not\r\notherwise admitted as evidence, but when the ALC here included its first-hand observations of the Lot in its final order, Appellants failed to file a motion for\r\nreconsideration or a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rules 29 or 68 of the Rules of Procedure for the Administrative Law Court, or Rules 59(e)\r\nor 60, SCRCP.[5]&nbsp; Consequently, we decline to reach the merits of Appellants' contention because, in our view,\r\nit is unpreserved for this Court's review. See Brown, 348 S.C. at 519, 560 S.E.2d at 417 (stating issues not raised to and ruled upon by the ALC are\r\nunpreserved for appellate review).\r\nIII. Substantial Evidence to Support the ALC's Final Order\r\nFinally, Appellants contend the ALC erred in concluding the Lot was exempt from Coastal Island Regulation because it was part of Fripp Island.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nThe ALC found the South Carolina Coastal Zone Management Act[6] did not apply for three distinct and equally\r\ndispositive reasons. &nbsp;The ALC first determined the Lot was exempted from regulation establishing access to coastal islands under Regulation 30-12.N because\r\nFripp Island was expressly excluded by the General Assembly's definition of coastal island in Regulation 30.1.D(11). 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12.N (Supp.\r\n2009); 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1.D(11). &nbsp;Regulation 30-12.N explains that the section applies to applications for permits for bridges and docks as a\r\nmeans of obtaining access to coastal islands. &nbsp;Regulation 30-1.D(11) defines a coastal island as: &quot;an area of high ground above the critical area of\r\ndelineation that is separated from other high ground areas by coastal tidelands or waters.&quot; &nbsp;The definition of coastal island further states, in\r\npertinent part, that:\r\n\r\n  The purpose of this definition is to include all islands except those that are essentially mainland, i.e., those that already have publicly accessible\r\n  bridges and/or causeways. &nbsp;The following islands shall not be deemed a coastal island subject to this section due to their large size and developed\r\n  nature: . . . Fripp Island . . . .\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 30-1.D(11).\r\nThe State called as a witness Sidney C. Miller, who was duly qualified as an expert in the field of tidal datum.[7]\r\n&nbsp;Miller undertook a study of the Lot in order to compare the Lot's elevation to the benchmark tidal data which had previously been compiled by the National\r\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). &nbsp;Miller, in a previous employ, oversaw NOAA's project to establish tidal boundaries for South Carolina's\r\ncoast. &nbsp;One of the points NOAA selected to benchmark was the Hunting Island Bridge (Bridge),[8] which connects\r\nFripp Island to Hunting Island to the north. &nbsp;Using the data collected by the tide gauge at the Bridge, which was collected by NOAA over the course of\r\nthree years and established mean high water (MHW), mean high high water (MHHW), mean low water (MLW), mean low low water (MLLW) and various other tidal datums,[9] Miller measured the elevations at the Lot. &nbsp;Miller's calculations revealed no portion of the Lot was below\r\nMHW or MHHW, and in fact, the lowest spot of the Lot &quot;is about a foot above mean high water.&quot; &nbsp;This conclusion was later confirmed by both of\r\nRisher's experts, David Youmans and Fanning, and was undisputed by Appellants.\r\nThe ALC determined that because the Lot was contiguous to land agreed to by all parties as being part of Fripp Island, and no portion of the Lot was lower\r\nthan the established MHW or MHHW marks, then it was also a part of Fripp Island. &nbsp;Based on Regulation 30-1.D(11)'s exclusion of Fripp Island from its\r\ndefinition of a &quot;coastal island,&quot; the ALC found the requirements of Regulation 30-12.N inapplicable. &nbsp;The court's determination of whether or not\r\nthe Lot is a part of Fripp Island is not a legal question that is determined under the rubric of a regulation; instead, it is a finding of fact properly left\r\nwithin the purview of the fact finding body, and only reversible if unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\r\nA reviewing court may reverse or modify an administrative decision if the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005). &nbsp;&quot;Substantial evidence is 'evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\nconclusion that the administrative agency reached.'&quot; Southeast Res. Recovery, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 402, 407,\r\n595 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004) (quoting Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)).&nbsp; &quot;[T]he possibility of drawing two\r\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.&quot; Palmetto\r\nAlliance, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984).\r\nIn our view, the ALC's determination that the Lot is a part of Fripp Island, based on the tidal datum introduced at trial, is a reasonable one which is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence. See Bursey v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 369 S.C. 176, 188-89, 631 S.E.2d 899, 906 (2006)\r\n(stating where conflicting evidence exists as to an issue, the Court's substantial evidence standard of review defers to the findings of the fact-finder).\r\n&nbsp;Because this issue is dispositive of OCRM's sole reason of denying Risher's permit,[10] it is unnecessary for\r\nthe Court to address the remaining grounds on which the ALC based its final order.[11] See Futch v.\r\nMcAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\ndetermination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal). &nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the ALC is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:&nbsp; I concur with the majority but write separately to address the ALJ's site\r\nvisit.&nbsp; While I agree that a judge sitting as the finder of fact may make a site visit, I believe that in this case the ALJ improperly found new facts upon\r\nthe visit and impermissibly based the order upon those facts.&nbsp;\r\nI agree with Appellant that the ALJ improperly found his own facts during his site visit and impermissibly based his order upon those findings.&nbsp;\r\nRecently, in Tarpley v. Hornyak, 174 S.W.3d 736 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), the Tennessee Court of Appeals thoroughly discussed the various state approaches\r\nto site visits by judges.&nbsp; In that case, the trial judge visited the site where a bridge allegedly caused a creek to flood a nearby property.&nbsp; The\r\njudge viewed the flood as it was happening and determined the bridge was causing the waters to back up and therefore was a nuisance. &nbsp;Id. at 738-39.&nbsp;\r\nThe reviewing court of appeals found the judge based his ruling on his own observations at the site, rather than on the evidence presented by the parties.&nbsp;\r\nId. at 740.\r\nIn determining whether the judge's observations during the site visit and reliance upon those observations was error, the reviewing Tarpley court\r\nfirst considered whether a fact-finder's observations are evidence. &nbsp;Id. at 742.&nbsp; The court first discussed Wigmore's position that the view is\r\nevidence, but only because the view is limited to matters that can be directly perceived without making an inference.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The Tarpley\r\ncourt explained that in the case before it, the only fact that could properly be determined from the site visit was that the land was flooded; the trial judge\r\nhad to infer the flooding was caused by the bridge.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;After reviewing multiple cases from other jurisdictions, the court held that a view\r\nmay only be used to understand evidence already in the record, not to find new facts.&nbsp; Id. at 742-43.&nbsp; Thus, the court found the most\r\nimportant question was not whether the observations from a view are evidence, but rather what use a judge makes of those observations.&nbsp; Id. at 744.\r\nThe Tarpley court then explained that because a view is only properly used to assist in understanding the evidence presented, a fact-finder may not\r\nbase his ruling upon the information observed during a view.&nbsp; Id. at 745.&nbsp; The court found two important considerations for this limitation: a\r\njudge cannot be a witness in a case before him, and facts found during a view are not preserved in the record for appellate review.&nbsp; Id. at 746-48.&nbsp;\r\nThus, the Tarpley court aligned with the majority of jurisdictions, holding:\r\n[A] trial judge has the inherent discretion to take a view of the site of a property dispute, a crime, an accident, or any other location,\r\nwhere such a view will enable the judge to assess the credibility of witnesses, to resolve conflicting evidence, or to obtain a clearer understanding of the\r\nissues.&nbsp; However, the view cannot be made to obtain additional evidence or to replace the requirement that evidence be produced at trial with the judge's\r\npersonal observations of the site.&nbsp; Thus, the proper purpose of a view is to enable the judge to better understand the evidence that has been presented in\r\ncourt, not as a substitute for such evidence.\r\nId. at 749.&nbsp;\r\nI find the Tennessee court's analysis and conclusion correct, and in the absence of South Carolina cases discussing this issue, would adopt the Tennessee\r\napproach.&nbsp;\r\nIn my view, two vital considerations ought to bear on the outcome of this case: the great deference accorded an administrative tribunal's finding, and the\r\nnecessity for a full and accurate record.&nbsp; The bright line rule of review for administrative tribunals is that we will uphold a tribunal's finding if it is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2009); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135-36, 276 S.E.2d\r\n304, 307 (1981).&nbsp; To ensure this deferential standard remains appropriate, it is critically important that the ALJ stays firmly within his role as a judge\r\nand not bleed into other roles, such as prosecutor, expert, or witness.&nbsp; Allowing an ALJ to cross those boundaries creates an unpredictable environment in\r\nthe courtroom.&nbsp; This sort of abuse and stretching of authority is precisely why some parties justifiably are displeased with administrative\r\ntribunals.&nbsp; Further, allowing an ALJ to gather his own evidence and base his order upon that evidence deprives the reviewing appellate court of its\r\nlifeblood: a full and accurate record of the proceedings in the trial court.&nbsp; The extreme deference accorded an ALJ only makes sense if the record is pure\r\nand complete.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot allow a judge to present his own evidence after a site visit because that evidence is not properly in the record and is\r\nunavailable to the reviewing court.&nbsp;\r\nApplying the above reasoning to the case at hand, I would find the ALJ improperly found new evidence during the site visit, and that basing his order upon\r\nthat evidence was error.&nbsp; I concur with the result reached by the majority, however, because even without the ALJ's improper findings the record contains\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the ALJ's ruling.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] The permit awarded to Risher's predecessor in title is not an issue before the Court, as Risher failed to act\r\non the permit prior to its expiration.\r\n[2] This issue addresses Appellants' combined issues two and four, which argue the ALC's determination that the\r\nCoastal Island Regulations are inapplicable to Risher's permit application, is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\r\n[3] The definition of mean high water and its relevance to the ALC's determination of whether the Lot is subject\r\nto DHEC's coastal island regulation is thoroughly developed in issue three below.\r\n[4] An estuary, although not defined in our code of laws or regulations, has been defined as a &quot;part of a\r\nriver or stream or other body of water having unimpaired connection with the open sea, where the sea water is measurably diluted with fresh water derived from\r\nland drainage.&quot;&nbsp; 16 U.S.C.A Â§ 1453(7) (2000).\r\n[5] At the time this case was before the ALC, the issue of whether or not a Rule 59(e) motion was cognizable to an\r\nALC had not been decided.&nbsp; This Court's pronouncement in Home Medical Systems, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Revenue, 382 S.C. 556, 677\r\nS.E.2d 582 (2009), which definitively stated that Rule 59(e) motions were permitted in ALC proceedings, was not published until April 20, 2009. Id. at\r\n563, 677 S.E.2d at 586.&nbsp; However, despite any uncertainty that might have existed prior to Home Medical Systems, this Court has long enforced and\r\nrelied upon issue preservation rules in administrative appeals. Id. at 562-63, 677 S.E.2d at 586.\r\n[6] 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1, et seq. (Supp. 2009).&nbsp; Throughout the order, the ALJ refers to the\r\nregulations involved in this case as the &quot;Coastal Zone Management Act.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; These regulations are, of course, not the Act itself, but instead\r\nare the regulations implementing and carrying out the provisions of that Act.&nbsp;\r\n[7] Tidal datum can be loosely defined as measurements of the sea level, accounting for different water depths and\r\nthe heights of tides over the course of a certain period of time.\r\n[8] Hunting Island Bridge is alternately referred to as Fripp Island Bridge in the record, but they are, in fact,\r\none in the same.\r\n[9] The coast of South Carolina experiences semi-diurnal tides, i.e. two high tides and two low tides in a\r\ntwenty-four-hour day. &nbsp;Of the two high tides, one is generally higher than the other. &quot;Mean high water&quot; is defined as the nineteen-year average\r\nheight of all the high tides at a given location over the nineteen-year tidal datum cycle. &nbsp;&quot;Mean high high water&quot; is defined as the\r\nnineteen-year average of all the higher of the two daily high tides at a given location.\r\n[10] As the ALC noted, OCRM also denied the permit application based on the mistaken assumptions that Risher did\r\nnot own the land where the proposed bridge would connect with Tarpon Boulevard. &nbsp;However, Risher presented contrary evidence at the hearing indicating that\r\nhe did, in fact, own the land connecting to Tarpon, and such evidence was not rebutted by Appellants.\r\n[11] Appellants also contended the ALC erred in finding: (1) the Lot was exempted from Regulation 30-12.N based\r\non the Regulation's definition of &quot;upland areas&quot;; and (2) that the Lot was not a part of the surrounding Estuarine System.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William Ashley Boyd, Petitioner.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2011-06-14-01","description":"","date":"2011-06-20","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of William Ashley Boyd, Petitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRespondent was suspended on August 9, 2010, for a period of six  months.&nbsp; He has now filed an affidavit  requesting reinstatement pursuant to Rule 32, of the Rules for Lawyer  Disciplinary Enforcement contained in Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nThe request is granted and he is hereby reinstated to the  practice of law in this state.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    JEAN H.

Brown,\r\n  Jr.'s request for an award of attorney's fees in excess of the $3,500 statutory\r\n  limit in S.C. Code Ann. section 17-3-50\r\n  (2003).Â  We find no abuse of discretion under the unique facts and\r\n  circumstances presented and affirm.\r\nDuring the pendency of the\r\n  appeal, the Court accepted an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar concerning the potential constitutional implications arising from\r\n  the court appointment of attorneys to represent indigent clients.Â  We elect to\r\n  address this matter of significant public interest.Â  We hold today that the\r\n  Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution is\r\n  implicated when an attorney is appointed by the court to represent an indigent litigant.Â \r\n  In such circumstances, the attorney's services constitute property entitling\r\n  the attorney to just compensation.\r\nI.\r\nAppellant was appointed on\r\n  March 1, 2007, pursuant to Rule 608, SCACR, to represent Alfonzo J. Howard, an\r\n  indigent.Â  Howard was charged with multiple crimes, including first degree criminal sexual conduct, two counts of\r\n  kidnapping, two counts of armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during the\r\n  commission of a crime.\r\nFrom the beginning, Appellant\r\n  complained about the appointment to represent Howard, first to the circuit's\r\n  chief administrative judge, Perry M. Buckner, and then to the trial judge,\r\n  Carmen T. Mullen. Â Appellant asked to be relieved as counsel, stating that his\r\n  obligations to an appointed capital case were taking up substantial amounts of\r\n  time.Â  Judge Buckner's involvement was minimal, as he refused to relieve\r\n  Appellant, noting that Appellant had not been denied payment.Â  Appellant even\r\n  filed a motion to &quot;halt prosecution.&quot;Â  \r\nAppellant wrote the trial\r\n  judge, Judge Mullen, stating, &quot;[T]he failure to [exceed the fee cap] now\r\n  leaves me with no choice but to discontinue working on [Howard's case].&quot;Â \r\n  Judge Mullen indicated that she would consider awarding attorney's fees beyond\r\n  the &quot;cap&quot; ($3,500) after trial, upon submission of affidavits as to\r\n  time, hourly rates, and overhead. She stated, &quot;I think it's best to do\r\n  after the trial is over, so we know exactly how much time has, in fact been\r\n  expended . . . .&quot; \r\nJudge Mullen's preferred\r\n  timeline did not suit Appellant, however.Â  At a pretrial hearing, the following\r\n  exchange took place: \r\n\r\n  Appellant: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Well, Your Honor, I respectfully\r\n    no longer desire to do any work in this case, and I'll stop.\r\n  Court:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Well, respectfully, Mr. Brown, that's not your choice.\r\n  Appellant:Â  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I'm not doing anymore work, I'm sorry. \r\n  Court:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mr. Brown ---\r\n  Appellant:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I'm not going to do anymore work.\r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  --- if you're going to speak\r\n    to the Court, you're going to stand up.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  --- Mr. Brown, stop.Â  Sir, I'm\r\n    going to repeat something to you . . . . Respectfully sir you are going to\r\n    continue on this case.\r\n\r\nAfter the judge explained her\r\n  decision and began to continue with the hearing, Brown again refused to move\r\n  forward on the case: \r\n\r\n  Appellant: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Your Honor, I'm not going to\r\n    proceed on these motions.Â  I move to withdraw.\r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Respectfully, I'm denying your\r\n    motion to withdraw. . . .\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n    . . .\r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mr. Brown, you are an officer\r\n    of this Court, sir.Â  I am telling you that you are going forward.Â  I am\r\n    ordering you to go forward.\r\n  Appellant:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I can't ---\r\n  Court:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  You have one choice, as you understand ---\r\n  Appellant:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I cannot do it.\r\n  Court:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  --- I can hold you in contempt.\r\n  Appellant:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I just can't. \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n    . . .\r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sir, you're gonna have two\r\n    choices right now.Â  You're either going to go forward or I'm going to take you\r\n    into custody.Â  One of two things, that's what we're doing here, Mr. Brown.\r\n  Appellant: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I will say this, I'm not going\r\n    to be able to go forward . . . .\r\n  Court:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This Court is telling you to go forward \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n    . . .\r\n\r\nThe charges against Howard\r\n  proceeded to trial.Â  During the trial, Appellant's belligerent unwillingness to\r\n  comply with the court's order continued:\r\n\r\n  Appellant: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I'm going to ask to withdraw.Â  I\r\n    cannot be an effective lawyer for my client.\r\n  Court:\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion denied. \r\n  Appellant: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I cannot go forward . . . . I\r\n    cannot go forward . . . . I cannot go forward.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court, displaying\r\n  remarkable patience, only threatened Appellant with contempt and instructed\r\n  Appellant to proceed.Â  Appellant then invoked his right to counsel.Â  The\r\n  trial against Howard was briefly continued to allow Appellant's attorney to\r\n  appear.Â  Addressing Appellant's attorney, Judge Mullen said, \r\n\r\n  [W]hat I\r\n    can't have . . . is when I rule against [Appellant] [he is] saying he is going\r\n    to withdraw as counsel.Â  [Appellant has] done that three times, and he's sat\r\n    down and refused to proceed with the case.Â  That is simply not professional.Â \r\n    It is not consistent with his oath.\r\n  . .\r\n    . . \r\n  [Appellant]\r\n    has consistently refused at different points throughout the pre-hearing trial\r\n    and now during the trial of this case to continue and has sat down . . . .\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with his\r\n  attorney, Appellant finally decided to continue with representation of the\r\n  indigent defendant.\r\n\r\n  Judge Mullen awarded $17,268.03 as\r\n    costs for investigative work and expert fees, which was substantially in excess\r\n    of the statutory cap of $500.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-3-50(B).Â  However, Judge\r\n    Mullen denied Appellant's motion to award attorney's fees in excess of the\r\n    statutory amount, $3,500.Â  Â§17-3-50(A).Â Â  The sole basis for denying Appellant\r\n    an award of fees in excess of the statutory cap was his unprofessional\r\n    conduct.Â  Judge Mullen stated:\r\n  Because\r\n    of Mr. Brown's actions and antics during the trial of this matter, I find his\r\n    efforts do not demand nor justify exceeding the statutory maximum fee of $3,500\r\n    as provided by our legislature, and therefore, order attorney's fees of $3,500\r\n    to be paid to Mr. Brown for his services in this case.Â  \r\n  . . . While I should have held Mr. Brown in contempt\r\n    of Court for his unprofessional behavior - this Court knows all too well that\r\n    to do so would require at the least, a mistrial, which would be unfair to both\r\n    the Defendant and the victims. \r\n\r\nII.\r\nSection\r\n  17-3-50 provides:\r\n\r\n  (A) When private counsel is\r\n    appointed pursuant to this chapter, he must be paid a reasonable fee to be determined on the basis of forty dollars an hour for time spent out of\r\n    court and sixty dollars an hour for time spent in court. The same hourly rates\r\n    apply in post-conviction proceedings. Compensation may not exceed three\r\n      thousand five hundred dollars in a case in which one or more felonies is\r\n      charged and one thousand dollars in a case in which only misdemeanors are\r\n    charged. Compensation must be paid from funds available to the Office of\r\n    Indigent Defense for the defense of indigents represented by court-appointed,\r\n    private counsel. The same basis must be employed to determine the value of\r\n    services provided by the office of the public defender for purposes of Section\r\n    17-3-40. \r\n  (B) Upon a finding in ex parte\r\n    proceedings that investigative, expert, or other services are reasonably\r\n      necessary for the representation of the defendant, the court shall\r\n        authorize the defendant's attorney to obtain such services on behalf of the\r\n    defendant and shall order the payment, from funds available to the Office of\r\n    Indigent Defense, of fees and expenses not to exceed five hundred dollars as the court considers appropriate.\r\n  (C) Payment in excess of the\r\n    hourly rates and limits in subsection (A) or (B) is authorized only if the\r\n    court certifies, in a written order with specific findings of fact, that\r\n    payment in excess of the rates is necessary to provide compensation adequate to\r\n    ensure effective assistance of counsel and payment in excess of the limit is\r\n    appropriate because the services provided were reasonably and necessarily\r\n    incurred.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  \r\nAn award of attorney's fees\r\n  in excess of the section 17-3-50 statutory cap is &quot;within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial judge.&quot;Â  Bailey v. State, 309 S.C. 455,\r\n  464, 424 S.E.2d 503, 508 (1992).Â Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  ruling lacks evidentiary support or is controlled by an error of law.Â  Patel\r\n    v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004).\r\nAppellant presents the issue\r\n  as one of law: may a trial court properly deny a request to exceed the\r\n  statutory cap for attorney's fees based on the attorney's unprofessional\r\n  conduct?Â  We answer that question &quot;yes&quot; under the unique and\r\n  compelling circumstances presented.Â  Given the egregious level \r\n\r\nof Appellant's inexcusable\r\n  conduct and persistent disregard of the trial court's orders, we find the trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award fees in excess of the\r\n  statutory cap.\r\nIII.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Bar appears Amicus Curiae.Â  The Bar contends that the\r\n  appointment of attorneys to represent indigent litigants implicates the Takings\r\n  Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See U.S. Const. amend. V (&quot;[N]or shall private property be taken for public\r\n  use without just compensation.&quot;).[1]Â  We agree and hold today\r\n  that the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause is implicated when an attorney is\r\n  appointed to represent an indigent litigant.Â  In such circumstances, the\r\n  attorney's services constitute property entitling the attorney to just\r\n  compensation.\r\nOur\r\n  willingness to consider the Bar's request and our ruling today in no manner\r\n  changes the nature of the practice of law in this state.Â  Our holding is a\r\n  narrow one, limited to an attorney's constitutional entitlement to compensation\r\n  in appointed cases.Â  We continue to adhere to the view that the license to\r\n  practice law is a privilege and not a right.Â  As such, the practice of law remains\r\n  subject to control, regulation, and disciplineâ€”all as this Court directs.Â  \r\nA.\r\nThe Sixth and Fourteenth\r\n  Amendments to the United States Constitution compel states to provide counsel\r\n  to indigent criminal defendants.Â  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335\r\n  (1963); see also United States v. Dillon, 346 F.2d 633, 635 (9th\r\n  Cir. 1965) (stating &quot;the obligation of the legal profession to serve\r\n  indigents on court order is an ancient and established tradition . . .\r\n  .&quot;).Â  In South Carolina, this historic obligation of the legal profession\r\n  is largely administered through Rule 608, SCACR.Â  \r\nRule 608(a) requires members\r\n  of the South Carolina Bar to &quot;serve as counsel for indigent persons in the\r\n  circuit and family courts pursuant to statutory and constitutional\r\n  mandates.&quot;Â  The vast majority of attorneys have commendably discharged\r\n  this responsibility in a manner reflecting the highest and noblest traditions\r\n  of the legal profession.Â  Such laudable service is woven into the fabric of the\r\n  legal profession, as exemplified in the lawyer's oath, in which an attorney\r\n  affirms that &quot;I will assist the\r\n  defenseless or oppressed by ensuring that justice is available to all citizens\r\n  and will not delay any person's cause for profit or malice.&quot; Â Rule 402(k)(3), SCACR.Â  \r\nWe believe the South Carolina\r\n  General Assembly recognizes the inherent fairness in providing for an award of\r\n  attorney's fees and costs in appointed cases, as evidenced by section 17-3-50.Â \r\n  Section 17-3-50 addresses appointment in criminal cases and post-conviction\r\n  relief proceedings.Â  Moreover, section 17-3-100 speaks more broadly to our\r\n  legislature's policy favoring the payment of fees to appointed counsel:\r\n  &quot;Nothing herein contained is designed to limit the discretionary\r\n    authority of a judge to appoint counsel in any case and any such counsel\r\n      shall be entitled to remuneration and reimbursement as provided in Sections\r\n  17-3-50 and 17-3-80 hereof, so long as funds appropriated herein are available\r\n  therefor.&quot; (Emphasis added.)Â  What the legislature has recognized for statutorily\r\n  authorized appointments, we now find is additionally entitled to constitutional\r\n  protection.Â  We extend the constitutional protection to all court-ordered appointments.Â  \r\nThe Supreme Court of Kansas\r\n  spoke directly to this issue:\r\n\r\n  Attorneys\r\n    make their living through their services.Â  Their services are the means of\r\n    their livelihood.Â  We do not expect architects to design public buildings,\r\n    engineers to design highways, dikes, and bridges, or physicians to treat the\r\n    indigent without compensation.Â  When attorneys' services are conscripted for\r\n    the public good, such a taking is akin to the taking of food or clothing from a\r\n    merchant or the taking of services from any other professional for the public\r\n    good.Â  And certainly when attorneys are required to donate funds out-of-pocket\r\n    to subsidize a defense for an indigent defendant, the attorneys are deprived of\r\n    property in the form of money.Â  We conclude that attorneys' services are\r\n    property, and are thus subject to Fifth Amendment protection.\r\n\r\nState v. Smith, 747 P.2d 816, 842 (Kan. 1987); see also Armstrong\r\n  v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960) (noting that the Takings Clause\r\n  was &quot;designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear\r\n  public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the\r\n  public as a whole&quot;).Â  We agree with the Kansas Supreme Court, with one\r\n  significant caveat.Â  A lawyer is not a merchant; the law is a regulated public\r\n  service profession.Â  While the merchant and lawyer both seek gain, &quot;the\r\n  difference between a business and a profession is essentially that while the\r\n  chief end of a trade or business is personal gain, the chief end of a\r\n  profession is public service.&quot;Â  In Re Jacobson, 240 S.C. 436, 448,\r\n  126 S.E.2d 346, 353 (1962).Â  \r\nIn holding that the Takings\r\n  Clause is implicated in appointed cases, we revisit two cases in this state's\r\n  jurisprudence.Â  First, in Ex parte Dibble, 279 S.C. 592, 596, 310\r\n  S.E.2d 440, 443 (Ct. App. 1983), the court of appeals understood well the Bar's\r\n  concerns, acknowledging that &quot;it is unfair to cast on [lawyers], alone, the\r\n  burden of serving the needs of the whole society without compensation.&quot;Â Â \r\n  While Dibble suggested that &quot;[c]ourts may have the inherent power\r\n  to order that appointed lawyers be compensated from public funds, thus\r\n  transferring [the burden of appointed representation] to the state where it\r\n  properly belongs[,]&quot; id., the court ultimately dismissed the\r\n  lawyers' claim for compensation.\r\nThe lawyers in Dibble were appointed in a civil case to represent an indigent client who had no right\r\n  to counsel.Â  The court of appeals articulated well the role of the legal\r\n  profession in society and noted that courts &quot;have the inherent power . . .\r\n  to appoint lawyers to serve without compensation where it appears reasonably\r\n  necessary for the court to do justice.&quot; Â Id. at 595, 310 S.E.2d at\r\n  442.Â  Today, we hold that a court's inherent power to appoint a lawyer to serve\r\n  is subject to the lawyer's entitlement to just compensation.Â  In recognition of\r\n  the burden imposed in uncompensated and discretionary appointments, Dibble appropriately indicated that counsel should be appointed only in\r\n  &quot;extraordinary&quot; circumstances when &quot;necessary to render\r\n  justice.&quot;Â  Id. at 597, 310 S.E.2d at 443.Â  The appointment of\r\n  counsel only when &quot;necessary to render justice&quot; should serve to\r\n  protect the public fisc. Â \r\nNext, we addressed this\r\n  underlying tension in Bailey v. State, 309 S.C. 455, 424 S.E.2d\r\n  503 (1992).Â  Bailey dealt with adequate funding in the context of\r\n  capital litigation.Â  In Bailey, the Court echoed Dibble and spoke\r\n  to the legal profession's &quot;traditional and historic role&quot; in\r\n  society.Â  The Court then acknowledged the financial burden imposed on appointed\r\n  attorneys in capital cases: &quot;It is an understatement that the very\r\n  livelihood of many attorneys appointed to death penalty trials is threatened by\r\n  this burden, a result fundamentally unfair to those so impacted.&quot;Â  Id. at 457, 424 S.E.2d at 505.Â  This &quot;burden&quot; may well be greater in a\r\n  death penalty case, but the same burden (flowing from compelled representation)\r\n  exists in all appointed cases.Â  It is a matter of degree.Â  The Bailey Court avoided the takings issue by ordering compensation pursuant to statute.\r\nToday we address the\r\n  constitutional issue sidestepped in Bailey and hold that a\r\n  court-appointed attorney's service is property for purposes of the Takings\r\n  Clause.Â  \r\nB.\r\nThe Bar requests that we\r\n  establish formulaic guidelines for the trial courts and practicing Bar in\r\n  handling &quot;the challenges of complex appointed cases.&quot;Â  We decline to\r\n  set bright-line rules, as we believe the better approach is to defer to the\r\n  broad discretion of our able trial courts in addressing such claims on a\r\n  case-by-case basis.Â  The question of a taking is one of law.Â  The question of\r\n  what constitutes a fair attorney's fee under the circumstances would be one of\r\n  fact, subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.Â  Take the case\r\n  before usâ€”Appellant's takings argument would be resolved by the payment of some amount as attorney's fees; whether the amount awarded is constitutionally appropriate\r\n  or just under the circumstances is a question of fact, subject to an abuse of\r\n  discretion standard.\r\nWe believe the case-by-case\r\n  approach is in accord with the amicus curiae brief.Â  Consider the following\r\n  excerpt from the Bar's brief: &quot;This does not mean that a lawyer is\r\n  entitled to a fee which exceeds the statutory cap in all cases.Â  Since\r\n  takings analysis is a sliding scale, it is possible that an appointed case\r\n  might require so small an allocation of a lawyer's time that a lawyer is\r\n  entitled to no fee for his services.&quot;Â  (Br. for South Carolina Bar as\r\n  Amicus Curiae 4).[2]Â  \r\nThe Bar's position reflects\r\n  its recognition of the unique nature and role of the legal profession in\r\n  society, thus explaining its preference for a &quot;sliding scale&quot;\r\n  approach.Â  Bailey spoke to this in the statutory context, and we agree\r\n  with the Bar that it applies in the constitutional context: &quot;[an]\r\n  appointed attorney should not expect to be compensated at market rate,\r\n  rather, at a reasonable, but lesser rate, which reflects the unique difficulty\r\n  these cases present as balanced with the attorney's obligation to defend the\r\n  indigent.&quot; 309 S.C. at 464, 424 S.E.2d at 508.Â  \r\nC.\r\nWe thus recognize the\r\n  historic obligation of an attorney to honor court-ordered appointments for the\r\n  representation of indigents, while also recognizing that the attorney's service\r\n  constitutes property for Fifth Amendment purposes where there is a right to\r\n  counsel.Â  We do not view these principles as mutually exclusive.Â  In\r\n  harmonizing these positions, a trial court should be guided by Bailey's approach\r\n  to just compensation assessed in light of the public service foundation associated\r\n  with membership in the legal profession.\r\nThe Court's holding applies\r\n  to all court-appointed representations commenced on or after July 1, 2012.[3]\r\nIV.\r\nWe find no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the trial court's decision to deny Appellant's motion to exceed\r\n  the $3,500 statutory cap for attorney's fees.Â  Because of the significant public\r\n  interest involved, we accept the South Carolina Bar's amicus curiae brief and\r\n  hold that a court-appointed attorney's service on behalf of an indigent litigant\r\n  is property for purposes of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the trial\r\n  court abused its discretion in denying Appellant's request for an award of\r\n  attorney's fees in excess of the statutory limit.\r\n Section 17-3-50\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  (C)\r\n    Payment in excess of the hourly rates and limits in subsection (A) or (B) is\r\n    authorized only if the court certifies, in a written order with specific\r\n    findings of fact, that payment in excess of the rates is necessary to\r\n      provide compensation adequate to ensure effective assistance of counsel and\r\n      payment in excess of the limit is appropriate because the services provided\r\n      were reasonably and necessarily incurred.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nAs\r\n  noted by the majority, the sole basis for denying Appellant an award of fees in\r\n  excess of the statutory limit was his unprofessional conduct.Â  In my opinion,\r\n  the trial court abused its discretion in failing to consider, as required by\r\n  the statute, whether the requested payment in excess of the limit was necessary\r\n  to provide effective assistance of counsel or whether the services provided\r\n  were reasonably and necessarily incurred.Â  In my opinion, the trial court\r\n  should have allowed Appellant to submit evidence as to the reasonableness of\r\n  his fees, and reviewed it accordingly.Â  Even in light of Appellant's undeniably\r\n  petulant behavior, I would find the trial court abused its discretion and would\r\n  remand the matter with instructions to evaluate the necessity for and worth of\r\n  Appellant's services.\r\nAs\r\n  I would find the trial court abused its discretion, I would decline to address\r\n  the Takings Clause issue submitted by the South Carolina Bar.Â  See Morris\r\n    v. Anderson County, 349 S.C. 608, 564 S.E.2d 649 (2002) (Court will not\r\n  unnecessarily reach constitutional questions); see also Rule 213,\r\n  SCACR (an amicus brief is limited to the issues raised by the parties).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although not cited by the\r\n  Bar, the South Carolina Constitution has a Takings Clause. Â S.C. Const. art. I,\r\n  Â§ 13(A) (&quot;Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, private\r\n  property shall not be taken . . . for public use without just compensation\r\n  being first made for the property.&quot;).Â  Our analysis and holding comports with\r\n  the Takings Clause in our constitution.\r\n[2] One area of particular\r\n  concern to the Bar is the general practice in our trial courts of prohibiting\r\n  interim payments.Â  As advocated in the Bar's brief, appointed attorneys should\r\n  be able to request &quot;that lower courts take an early look at the question\r\n  of attorney's fees . . . as opposed to postponing the decision until the end of\r\n  trial.&quot;Â  We do not foreclose a partial award of fees and costs prior to\r\n  the conclusion of the appointed representation, but interim awards should be\r\n  granted sparingly and only under compelling circumstances.\r\n[3] The budgeting process for\r\n  the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, has been completed, and this opinion comes too late for legislative action this year.Â  As a result, we defer to the\r\n  2012 legislative session and the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012.\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26992","title":"Barber v.

Barber, , the criminal defendant, with a belated appeal pursuant to White\r\n    v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).[1]Â  The\r\n  direct appeal concerns the circuit court judge's jury charge on accomplice\r\n  liability.Â  Sammyeil B. Barber, the criminal defendant, argues the charge was\r\n  improper because it was unsupported by the evidence presented at trial.Â  We\r\n  agree with the State that the charge was properly supported by the evidence\r\npresented at trial.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe State alleged Barber and\r\n  three others (Blake Kimbrell, Kenneth Walker, and Marcus Kiser) conspired to\r\n  rob a minor drug dealer, Alan Heintz.Â  The men gathered together and discussed\r\n  the plans for the robbery, procured a semi-automatic handgun, and then drove to\r\n  Heintz's house.Â  Upon discovering more people than expected at the house, they\r\n  left to procure a second firearm, a rifle.Â  The men returned to Heintz's house\r\n  and Kimbrell waited in the car while Barber, Walker, and Kiser went in to rob\r\n  Heintz.Â  \r\nAfter entering the house and\r\n  waking the occupants, the men demanded money and drugs.Â  Heintz was dragged\r\n  from the bedroom and ultimately drew a shotgun on the robbers.Â  One of the\r\n  suspects armed with a semi-automatic handgun shot and killed Heintz, and shot\r\n  and wounded another man who was sleeping on the couch.Â  The three men fled the\r\n  premises, stealing only $30 and leaving their rifle behind.\r\nEventually, police located\r\n  the four men in connection with the crime.Â  Kimbrell, Walker, and Kiser all implicated\r\n  Barber in the planning and execution of the robbery, and said he was the gunman\r\n  who shot Heintz.Â  They pled guilty and testified against Barber, each receiving\r\n  15-30 years.Â  At Barber's trial, Kimbrell, Walker, and Kiser all testified\r\n  Barber was armed with the semi-automatic handgun and had shot both victims.Â \r\n  The State presented testimony that only two weapons were brought to the\r\n  robberyâ€”the semi-automatic handgun allegedly carried by Barber, who was\r\n  described as the robber of middle height, and a rifle, carried by Kiser, the\r\n  shortest.Â  Barber did not testify at trial, but his defense counsel elicited\r\n  testimony on cross-examination that Walker, the tallest of the three men and\r\n  the first to enter the house, was also in possession of a semi-automatic\r\n  handgun.Â  Barber primarily asserted in his defense that he did not participate\r\n  in the crime and that the other three men lied to the police, framing him for\r\n  the murder, to obtain lessened sentences.Â  Barber claimed Walker was the\r\n  gunman.\r\nThe circuit court judge instructed\r\n  the jury on accomplice liability over defense counsel's objection.Â  Defense\r\n  counsel argued the charge was improper because the evidence presented at trial\r\n  did not support the charge, the State did not base its prosecution on a theory\r\n  of accomplice liability, and the indictment alleged Barber was the gunman.Â  The\r\n  judge noted the objection and stated on the record: \r\n\r\n  . . . I\r\n    think that the charge is correct in this case.Â  Even if the intimation of the\r\n    defense that these persons are basically conspiring to make [Barber] the\r\n    shooter, if [the jury] believe[s] that, but they also believe he was present,\r\n    someone else did the shooting, but they're not sure who did the shooting, but\r\n    it was done when all four were present, there with that intended purpose of\r\n    robbery, he would still be liable under the theory of the hand of one is the\r\n    hand of all in the case or accomplice liability, whatever you want to call it.Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury deliberated for\r\n  nearly three hours, then asked for an explanation of &quot;the hand of one, the\r\n  hand of all&quot; charge and to what charges that rule applied.Â  After\r\n  receiving that instruction again, the jury deliberated further before returning\r\n  with guilty verdicts on all charges: criminal conspiracy, possession of a\r\n  pistol by a person under twenty-one, possession of a firearm during the\r\n  commission of a violent crime, attempted armed robbery, armed robbery, first\r\n  degree burglary, assault and battery with the intent to kill, and murder.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court judge\r\n  err in charging the jury on accomplice liability?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial court is required\r\n  to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. Â Sheppard v.\r\n    State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472 (2004). Â &quot;The law to be\r\n  charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.&quot; Â State\r\n    v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001). Â &quot;In\r\n  reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the court's jury charge as a\r\n  whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Mattison,&nbsp;388 S.C. 469, 478-79, 697 S.E.2d 578, 583&nbsp;(2010).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nBarber argues the evidence\r\n  presented at trial did not support a jury charge on accomplice liability as to\r\n  the murder charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State v. Funchess,\r\n  276 S.C. 427, 229 S.E.2d 331 (1976), and other cases, this Court has held that\r\n  a lesser-included offense may not be charged merely on the theory the jury may\r\n  believe some of the evidence and disbelieve other evidence.Â  Barber relies upon\r\n  this reasoning to support his argument that similar speculation is insufficient\r\n  to warrant a jury charge on an alternate theory of liability.Â  Barber's\r\n  proposition is correct.Â  Like a lesser-included offense, an alternate theory of\r\n  liability may only be charged when the evidence is equivocal on some integral\r\n  fact and the jury has been presented with evidence upon which it could rely to\r\n  find the existence or nonexistence of that fact.Â  We find the sum of the\r\n  evidence presented at trial, both by the State and defense, was equivocal as to\r\n  who was the shooter.Â  Thus, the charge on accomplice liability was warranted.\r\n&quot;Under the 'hand of one\r\n  is the hand of all' theory, one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal\r\n  purpose is liable criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental\r\n  to the execution of the common design and purpose.&quot;Â  Mattison, 388\r\n  S.C. at 479, 697 S.E.2d at 584.Â  To support an accomplice liability charge in\r\n  this case, the question is whether there is any evidence that another\r\n  co-conspirator was the shooter and Barber was acting with him when the robbery\r\n  took place.Â  See State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 295-96, 534 S.E.2d 286,\r\n  269 (2000).Â  \r\nWe find evidence to support\r\n  the conclusion that Barber was acting with the other men during the robbery.Â \r\n  Because all of the men clothed themselves all in black and wrapped shirts\r\n  around their heads so only their eyes were visible, the witnesses could only\r\n  describe and differentiate the men based on physical build, height, and the\r\n  weapon carried.Â  Kimbrell, Kiser, and Walker, however, all testified to\r\n  substantially the same version of the planning and execution of the\r\n  robberyâ€”that Barber was involved and was the shooter.Â Â  \r\nThe evidence presented at\r\n  trial could also support a finding that one of the other robbers was the\r\n  shooter.Â  The State presented evidence that Kiser was the shortest of the three\r\n  men and carried the rifle, Barber was of middle height and carried a\r\n  semi-automatic handgun, and Walker was the tallest and carried no weapon.Â \r\n  However, defense counsel elicited testimony that all three robbers were\r\n  armedâ€”one with a rifle and two with .380 handguns, the type weapon forensic\r\n  experts testified fired all the shots in Heintz's home that evening.Â  Defense\r\n  counsel's cross of Coleman Robinson, the witness who had been sleeping on the\r\n  couch when the robbery began, indicates all three men were armed:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  [quoting from Mr. Robinson's statement to the\r\n    police days after the incident] After the door was open, first they pushed it\r\n    wide and hit the wall.Â  As soon as that happened, that person turned the lights\r\n    on.\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  Without having to look for the switch.Â  I just\r\n    laid on the couch until this same person walked up to me and I noticed he was\r\n    holding a gun in his left hand.\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  And\r\n    that's the truth?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\n  . . .\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  And then later on you talk about\r\n    the second guy.Â  The second guy was a little shorter and looked younger.Â  He\r\n    was carrying a rifle.\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes,\r\n    sir.\r\n  . . .\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  Then you say the third guy was taller, about\r\n    six feet, 160.Â  He had a bunched up T-shirt around his head, too.Â  He looked to\r\n    be in his early twenties.Â  He was carrying a pistol also.\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\n\r\nKyle Robinson, Coleman's\r\n    brother who was asleep in a bedroom when the robbery began, also testified that\r\n    the tallest of the three, which would be Walker, was armed:\r\n\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  [On direct examination]Â  Well, as I went to\r\n    the [bedroom] door to see what was going on, my door was like halfway shut, so\r\n    I looked through the little space and that's when I saw the guy go back there\r\n    to Alan's room and he had a black pistol in his hand.[2]\r\n  . . . \r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  And then by that time I kind of opened the\r\n    door and I looked and I saw the gun at Coleman's head, my brother, and I saw\r\n    him give his wallet up . . . .Â  \r\n  . .\r\n    .\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  Were you able to tell anything about the other\r\n    two as far as size goes?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  I remember seeing the guy that went in the\r\n    back.Â  He seemed to be the biggest of all of them.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â \r\n    When you say bigâ€”\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  You\r\n    know, tall.Â  Just the tallest of all of them.\r\n  . .\r\n    . \r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  [On cross-examination]Â  And you saw a black\r\n    guy holding a small semi-automatic handgun to [your] brother's head; is that\r\n    right?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Right.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  He was a black guy about six feet tall,\r\n    weighing 150 to 160; is that right?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  That's what I said, but I was actually kind of\r\n    wrong about that.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  So when you made this statement on the 15th,\r\n    the day after it happened, you said he was six feet tall?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  That's what he appeared to be, but the other\r\n    guy was bigger.\r\n  . . . \r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  There was a shorter black guy pointing a rifle\r\n    at [you]?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.\r\n  Q:Â Â Â Â Â  And a third black guy went to the other\r\n    bedroom and pulled Alan out.Â  He was about six feet tall and weighed 180\r\n    pounds, and today you said he had a gun also?\r\n  A:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\n\r\nFurther, defense counsel\r\n  outright argued that Walker was armed with a .380, the type of gun that fired\r\n  the shots at Heintz's house, suggesting that Walker was the shooter. Thus, the\r\n  testimony offered at trial indicating there may have been two robbers armed with\r\n  handguns is sufficient to warrant the jury charge.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, the testimony is\r\n  equivocal as to whether or not Barber was the only person armed with the type\r\n  of gun the forensic experts say fired all the shots that night.Â  The circuit\r\n  court judge did not err in instructing the jury on &quot;the hand of one, the\r\n  hand of all&quot; theory of accomplice liability.Â  Accordingly, the convictions\r\n  and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We also granted the State's petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  Because we find\r\n  there is probative evidence to support the PCR judge's determination that\r\n  Barber was denied his right to a direct appeal, we dismiss that writ of\r\n  certiorari as improvidently granted.\r\n[2] All the witnesses at trial, through their testimony, corroborated that the\r\n  tallest of the three robbers went into the bedroom to retrieve Heintz.Â  Walker\r\n  is the tallest of the three men, and he and Kiser testified that Walker went to\r\n  get Heintz.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26993","title":"Doe v.

Lewis, of Gaffney, Lewis &amp; Edwards, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Appellant\r\n  brought an action against respondent Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\r\n  (&quot;Wal-Mart&quot;) alleging various theories of negligence.Â  The circuit\r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises\r\n  from the physical and sexual abuse of then three-year-old J. Doe (&quot;the\r\n  victim&quot;).Â  The facts, in the light most favorable to appellant, are as\r\n  follows.Â  Appellant, F. Doe, is the victim's guardian ad litem and great\r\n  uncle.Â  F. Doe and his wife (&quot;the aunt&quot;) often kept the victim for\r\n  months at a time.Â  According to the aunt, both of the victim's parents\r\n  physically abused him beginning when he was three months old.Â  She claimed she\r\n  had seen bruising on the victim's legs and buttocks, and had observed the\r\n  father &quot;thump&quot; the victim in the mouth and hit the child with a fly\r\n  swatter.Â  She did not, however, report the abuse to DSS or the police or seek\r\n  medical attention for the victim.Â  The aunt did not report the abuse because\r\n  she feared DSS would remove the victim from his parents' home and she would not\r\n  be allowed to see him.\r\nIn August 1997,\r\n  upon picking up the victim from his parents' house, the aunt was informed by\r\n  the victim's mother that the victim had bruises on his buttocks because he had\r\n  fallen down the steps.Â  After arriving at her house, the aunt examined the\r\n  victim and found two &quot;wide strips&quot; of bruising on his buttocks.Â \r\n  Again, she did not contact the police or DSS or seek medical treatment.Â \r\n  Instead, she took two photographs of the victim's buttocks.\r\nAfter the victim\r\n  had been in the aunt's custody for several hours, the victim's father called\r\n  her and told her to bring the victim home because DSS was there. Â The aunt took\r\n  the victim home as requested, but did not attempt to speak with the DSS worker who\r\n  was investigating the abuse allegations.Â  This investigation did not result in\r\n  the victim's removal from the home.\r\nSeveral days\r\n  later, the aunt took the roll of film, which included other unrelated\r\n  photographs, to Wal-Mart to be developed.Â  When the aunt retrieved the photos,\r\n  a photo technician informed her she had destroyed some of the photos because of\r\n  a store policy requiring the destruction of photos depicting nudity.Â  The aunt\r\n  explained to the employee she needed the photos to give to DSS and pleaded with\r\n  her to provide the photos.Â  The aunt claimed the employee refused and told her\r\n  she was required to &quot;destroy them,&quot; which the aunt believed meant the\r\n  employee had destroyed the photos and the negatives.Â  The employee did not,\r\n  however, destroy the negatives.Â  The aunt left the store with the remainder of\r\n  the photos and all of the negatives, but erroneously believed the negatives depicting\r\n  the victim's buttocks had been destroyed.\r\nAccording to the\r\n  aunt, the victim's father began sexually abusing him in September 1997,\r\n  approximately one month after the incident that had caused the aunt to take the\r\n  photos and DSS to investigate.Â  In December 1997, while giving the victim a\r\n  bath, the aunt noticed signs of sexual abuse.Â  The aunt took the victim to a\r\n  doctor who examined the victim and determined he had been sexually abused.Â  The\r\n  aunt and the doctor contacted DSS, and the victim was placed in the aunt's\r\n  custody.\r\nFather pled\r\n  guilty to first degree criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced to twenty-five\r\n  years' imprisonment.\r\nIn 2003,\r\n  appellant instituted this action, arguing the victim's injuries from the sexual\r\n  abuse were a result of (1) Wal-Mart's failure to report the suspected physical\r\n  abuse depicted in the photos as required by the Reporter's Statute;[1] and/or (2) Wal-Mart's negligent hiring and supervision of its employees and its\r\n  violations of approximately twenty internal company policies.Â  The circuit\r\n  court granted Wal-Mart's motion for summary judgment.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit\r\n  court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing an order\r\n  granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard as the\r\n  trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of material fact\r\n  exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may\r\n  be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of respondent, finding Wal-Mart incurred no\r\n  civil liability for failing to report the suspected child abuse as required by\r\n  the Reporter's Statute.Â  The circuit court also found Wal-Mart had no common\r\n  law duty to warn or protect the victim, and that Wal-Mart's internal policies\r\n  did not create such a duty.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil Liability\r\n  Under the Reporter's Statute\r\nAppellant first\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding Wal-Mart did not have any civil\r\n  liability for failing to report the suspected child abuse as required by the\r\n  South Carolina Reporter's Statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Reporter's\r\n  Statute provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    . . . [P]ersons responsible for processing\r\n    films . . . must report in accordance with this section when in the person's\r\n    professional capacity the person has received information which gives the\r\n    person reason to believe that a child has been or may be abused or neglected as\r\n    defined in Section 63-7-20.[2]\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C.\r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-310(A) (Supp. 2010).\r\n  In Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 645 S.E.2d 245 (2007), the Court found there could be no private right of\r\n    action for failing to report suspected or known child abuse in accordance with\r\n    Â§ 63-7-310.Â  In deciding whether Â§ 63-7-310 gives rise to a private cause of\r\n    action for negligence per se, the Court noted the main factor in\r\n    determining whether a statute creates a private cause of action is legislative\r\n    intent:\r\n  \r\n    The\r\n      legislative intent to grant or withhold a private right of action for violation\r\n      of a statute or the failure to perform a statutory duty, is determined\r\n      primarily from the language of the statute . . . .Â  In this respect, the\r\n      general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish a civil\r\n      liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the\r\n      public as an entity is not subject to a construction establishing civil\r\n      liability.\r\n  \r\nId. at 396, 645 S.E.2d at 248 (quoting Dorman v. Aiken\r\n  Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 67, 398 S.E.2d 687,689 (1990)).\r\n  The\r\n    Court first observed Â§ 63-7-310 is silent as to civil liability for failure to\r\n    report.Â  Noting other provisions in the Reporter's Statute do impose civil liability,[3] the Court\r\n    found the legislature's silence as to civil liability in Â§ 63-7-310 indicated\r\n    its intent not to create civil liability for failing to report as required.Â  Id. at 397, 645 S.E.2d at 249 (citing Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 433-34,\r\n    468 S.E.2d 861, 865 (1996) (finding when one provision does not include a right\r\n    that is included in a related provision, legislative intent is that a right\r\n    will not be implied where it does not exist)).\r\n  Further, the Court looked to\r\n    the purpose of the Children's Code and determined Â§ 63-7-310 is concerned with\r\n    the protection of the public and not with the protection of an individual's\r\n    private right.Â  Id. at 398, 645 S.E.2d at 249.Â  The Court also noted\r\n    other jurisdictions have interpreted similar statutes and reached the same\r\n    conclusion.Â  Id. n.4.\r\n  Because, consonant with Doe\r\n    v. Marion, there can be no private cause of action under Â§ 63-7-310, we\r\n    find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of respondent\r\n    as to this claim.\r\n  II.&nbsp; Other Causes of\r\n  Action\r\n  Appellant also\r\n    asserts the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n    Wal-Mart on various other theories of common law negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Respondent has an\r\n    internal policy against developing photos depicting nudity.Â  The policy\r\n    requires employees to bring to the attention of the store manager pornographic\r\n    pictures of children where child abuse is suspected.\r\n  It also prohibits\r\n    the printing of pictures depicting nudity and requires they be shredded if printed\r\n    in error.Â  There is an exception for cases of suspected child abuse, where the\r\n    developed photos must be kept as evidence.Â  However, the policy requires\r\n    processed negatives be returned to the customer.\r\n  In order to\r\n    establish a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must show:Â  (1) the defendant\r\n    owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant breached the duty by a\r\n    negligent act or omission; (3) defendant's breach was the actual or proximate\r\n    cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or\r\n    damages.Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. at 400, 645 S.E.2d at 250.Â  Whether a\r\n    defendant has acted negligently is a mixed question of law and fact.Â  Moore\r\n      v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 221, 644 S.E.2d 740, 746 (Ct.App.2007).Â  First,\r\n    the court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a\r\n    particular duty.Â  If there is no duty, the defendant is entitled to a judgment\r\n    as a matter of law.Â  Id. (internal citations omitted).\r\n  &quot;Under South\r\n    Carolina law, there is no general duty to control the conduct of another or to\r\n    warn a third person or potential victim of danger.&quot;Â  Faile v. S.C.\r\n      Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 546 (2002).Â \r\n    We recognize five exceptions to this rule: 1) where the defendant has a special\r\n    relationship to the victim; 2) where the defendant has a special relationship\r\n    to the injurer; 3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a duty; 4) where\r\n    the defendant negligently or intentionally creates the risk; and 5) where a\r\n    statute imposes a duty on the defendant.Â  Id.\r\n  The defendant may\r\n    have a common law duty to warn potential victims under the &quot;special\r\n    relationship&quot; exception when the defendant &quot;has the ability to\r\n    monitor, supervise, and control an individual's conduct&quot; and when\r\n    &quot;the individual has made a specific threat of harm directed at a specific\r\n    individual.&quot;Â  Doe v. Marion, supra (quoting Bishop v.\r\n      South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81\r\n    (1998)).\r\n  Â Once a duty has been established, it is\r\n    the further function of the court to determine and formulate the standard of\r\n    conduct to which the duty requires the defendant to conform.Â  57A Am. Jur. 2d Negligence Â§ 132.Â  &quot;The fact finder may consider relevant standards of care from\r\n    various sources in determining whether a defendant breached a duty owed to an\r\n    injured person in a negligence case.&quot;Â  Madison ex rel. Bryant v.\r\n      Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 140, 638 S.E.2d 650, 659 (2006).Â \r\n    &quot;The standard of care in a given case may be established and defined by\r\n    the common law, statutes, administrative regulations, industry standards, or a\r\n    defendant's own policies and guidelines.&quot;Â  Id. (citing Peterson\r\n      v. Natl. R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 397, 618 S.E.2d 903, 906\r\n    (2005).Â  It follows that, if no duty has been established, evidence as to the\r\n    standard of care is irrelevant.Â  Only when there is a duty would a standard of\r\n    care need to be established.\r\n  \r\nThe circuit court found\r\n    Wal-Mart neither owed any common law duty to the victim, nor did it create or\r\n    undertake any duty when its employees failed to follow Wal-Mart's internal\r\n    policies.\r\n  We find the circuit court\r\n    properly granted summary judgment as to these alternative causes of action\r\n    because Wal-Mart owed no duty to the victim.Â  It is clear Wal-Mart had no\r\n    general duty to control the conduct of the victim's father or warn the victim\r\n    of the danger of the sexual abuse.Â  Further, none of the exceptions enumerated in Faile apply here.Â  Wal-Mart\r\n    had no special relationship with either the victim or his father because it did\r\n    not have the ability to monitor, supervise, or control either.Â  Doe v. Marion, supra.Â  Wal-Mart did not\r\n    negligently or intentionally create the risk of the father's sexual abuse.Â \r\n    Lastly, as discussed above, Wal-Mart's duty to report under the Reporter's\r\n    Statute cannot give rise to civil liability.\r\n  We also hold Wal-Mart did not\r\n    voluntarily undertake a duty.Â  It is undisputed that Wal-Mart created an internal\r\n    policy that was subsequently violated when the photo technician destroyed the\r\n    photos and did not inform the store manager or keep them as evidence.Â  However,\r\n    this internal policy cannot be said to constitute the voluntary undertaking of\r\n    a duty.Â  Rather, it could simply serve as evidence of the standard of care,\r\n    once that duty was established by law.Â  See Madison, supra.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We find the circuit court's\r\n    grant of summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart was proper because there can be\r\n    no civil liability under the Reporter's Statute and Wal-Mart owed no duty to\r\n    the victim.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., BEATTY,\r\n    KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

State v. Fonseca, 383 S.C. 640, 681 S.E.2d 1 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  The Court of Appeals properly held that the circuit court erred in\r\n  permitting the State to introduce evidence of the 2001 incident, and properly\r\n  summarily disposed of the Stateâ€™s additional sustaining ground[1], and in so doing anticipated our\r\n  decision in State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 683 S.E.2d 275 (2009).Â \r\n  Finding no error in the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, we adopt it as our own and\r\n  therefore \r\nAFFIRM. Â \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would reverse the court\r\n  of appeals and affirm the circuit court's ruling allowing the victim's\r\n  testimony regarding the 2001 incident.\r\nAmaurys C. Fonseca\r\n  (Respondent) was married to the minor victim's older sister.Â  The minor victim\r\n  often went to Respondent's house after school to babysit for her sister.Â \r\n  Respondent was indicted for lewd act with a minor in an indictment covering the\r\n  dates of August 1, 2001 to October 31, 2003, and alleging two separate\r\n  incidents of abuse.Â  The State elected to proceed on the 2003 allegation.Â \r\n  During the trial, the victim testified about both the 2003 incident and the\r\n  2001 incident.Â  Over defense counsel's objections, the circuit court judge\r\n  allowed the victim to testify as to the 2001 incident, ruling her testimony was\r\n  admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE, and State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118\r\n  S.E. 803 (1923), as evidence of motive, intent, and lack of accident or mistake.Â \r\n  Respondent was found guilty for committing a lewd act upon a child under the\r\n  age of 16, and was sentenced to incarceration for a period of 15 years.\r\nThe court of appeals reversed\r\n  his conviction, reasoning the circuit court erred in allowing the victim's\r\n  testimony because under State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 501 S.E.2d 716\r\n  (1998), testimony to show motive or intent in a sex offense prosecution is only\r\n  admissible when the defendant denies touching the victim and the act alleged is\r\n  subject to varying interpretations.Â  State v. Fonseca, 383 S.C. 640,\r\n  647-49, 681 S.E.2d 1, 4-5 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Further, the court of appeals found\r\n  the error not to be harmless.Â  Id. at 650, 681 S.E.2d at 6. \r\nThe court of appeals also\r\n  rejected as an additional sustaining ground the State's contention that the\r\n  testimony was admissible as evidence of the existence of a common scheme or\r\n  plan.Â  Id. at 649-50, 681 S.E.2d at 5-6.Â  The court of appeals disposed\r\n  of this argument, stating, &quot;The State provides no compelling argument of\r\n  any similarities between the two occurrences, or any argument to overcome the\r\n  fact that the incidents are remote in time.&quot;Â  Id. at 649, 681\r\n  S.E.2d at 5.Â  I disagree and would hold the facts are sufficient to support the\r\n  introduction of the victim's testimony under the common scheme or plan\r\n  exception.\r\n&quot;Evidence of other\r\n  crime, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in\r\n  order to show action in conformity therewith.&quot;Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â \r\n  However, such evidence may be admissible to show: (1) motive, (2) identity, (3)\r\n  the existence of a common scheme or plan, (4) the absence of mistake or\r\n  accident, or (5) intent. Id.; Lyle, 125 S.C. at 415, 118 S.E. at\r\n  807.Â  &quot;When determining whether evidence is admissible as common scheme or\r\n  plan, the trial court must analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between\r\n  the crime charged and the bad act evidence to determine whether there is a\r\n  close degree of similarity.&quot;Â  State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 433,\r\n  683 S.E.2d 275, 277-78 (2009).Â  &quot;When the similarities outweigh the\r\n  dissimilarities, the bad act evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b).&quot;Â  Id. at 433, 683 S.E.2d at 278.Â  The following factors should be considered when\r\n  determining whether a close degree of similarity exists:Â  (1) the age of the\r\n  victims when the abuse occurred; (2) the relationship between the victims and\r\n  the perpetrator; (3) the location where the abuse occurred; (4) the use of\r\n  coercion or threats; and (5) the manner of the occurrence, for example, the\r\n  type of sexual battery.Â  Id. at 433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278.Â  The above\r\n  list is not exhaustive and other factors may be relevant in determining whether\r\n  the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe facts of this case, to my\r\n  mind, are a compelling example of the type of continuous illicit conduct the\r\n  common scheme or plan exception is intended to cover.Â  The two instances of\r\n  sexual battery in this case involved the same victim, occurred at Respondent's\r\n  home when the victim was helping her sister, occurred after Respondent followed\r\n  victim into another room where he could be alone with her, and involved similar\r\n  acts of touching the victim's genital area in a sexual manner. \r\nAlthough the 2001 incident\r\n  was arguably more severe than the 2003 incident, I do not find this dissimilarity\r\n  dispositive.Â  The fact that the victim interrupted and terminated the 2003\r\n  incident by threatening to scream for help should not prevent this Court from\r\n  recognizing the overwhelming similarities between these two incidents.Â  See\r\n    State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 435, 683 S.E.2d 275, 278 (2009)\r\n  (recognizing that an interruption of the abuse before it could escalate does\r\n  not diminish the similarities between the incidents).Â  Additionally, I am not\r\n  persuaded the &quot;remoteness in time&quot; of the two incidents operates in\r\n  any way to make the victim's testimony inadmissible.Â  The testimony at trial,\r\n  elicited by both the prosecution and the defense, established that Respondent\r\n  very seldom was alone around the victim and had very few opportunities to\r\n  assault her.Â  In fact, it is undisputed that Respondent's wife, the victim's\r\n  sister, was in another room of the house on each occasion and never left\r\n  Respondent and the minor victim completely alone in their house.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, I dissent\r\n  from the majority's opinion and would reverse the court of appeals.Â  Because\r\n  this Court can affirm for any ground appearing in the record, Rule 220(c),\r\n  SCACR, I would affirm the circuit court's ruling that the testimony was\r\n  admissible, but clarify the admissibility is proper under the common scheme or\r\n  plan exception rather than the motive or intent exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The dissent would rely upon Rule 220 (c), SCACR, which allows this Court to\r\n  affirm an appeal for any reason appearing in the record, to reverse the\r\n  decision which we are reviewing.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26995","title":"In the Matter of James Carl Miller","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26995","description":"This Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals in In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Miller, 385 S.C. 539, 685 S.E.2d 619 (Ct.

Blitch, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:&nbsp; James Carl Miller (Miller) appealed the circuit court's order committing him to the custody of the Department of Mental Health\r\nunder the Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA),[1] asserting the State failed to try the case within sixty days of\r\nthe probable cause hearing as mandated by the SVPA.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals affirmed Miller's civil commitment on the grounds the State properly moved for a\r\ncontinuance, the State established that there was good cause for the delay, and that Miller was not substantially prejudiced by the continuance.&nbsp; In re\r\nCare &amp; Treatment of Miller, 385 S.C. 539, 685 S.E.2d 619 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; This Court granted Miller's petition for a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, we use this case as an opportunity to clarify certain procedural aspects of the SVPA.\r\n&nbsp;Specifically, we consider the appropriate remedy when the State fails to timely conduct a civil commitment trial within the time provisions mandated by\r\nthe SVPA.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nOn September 6, 2001, Miller pled guilty to committing a lewd act on a child under the age of sixteen years and criminal domestic violence of a high and\r\naggravated nature (CDVHAN).[2]&nbsp; The circuit court sentenced Miller to fifteen years' imprisonment suspended upon\r\nthe service of ten years' imprisonment with five years' probation for the lewd act charge and to ten years' imprisonment for CDVHAN.&nbsp; The sentences were to\r\nbe served concurrently.&nbsp;\r\nIn May 2005, prior to his scheduled release date of December 1, 2005, the Department of Corrections referred Miller's case to the multidisciplinary team[3] to assess whether Miller constituted a &quot;Sexually Violent Predator&quot; (SVP) as defined by the SVPA.&nbsp;\r\nHaving determined that Miller satisfied the statutory definition of an SVP, the multidisciplinary team referred the case to the prosecutor's review committee\r\n(committee).[4]&nbsp; In turn, the committee found probable cause existed to believe that Miller was an SVP.[5] &nbsp;Based on the committee's finding, the State petitioned the circuit court to conduct a hearing and make a\r\njudicial determination of probable cause.[6] &nbsp;\r\nAlthough a probable cause hearing was initially scheduled for August 29, 2005, the circuit court did not conduct the hearing until November 3, 2005, due to a\r\nnumber of unforeseeable delays.[7]&nbsp; On that same day, the circuit court found probable cause and issued an Order\r\nfor Evaluation.[8]&nbsp;\r\nPursuant to section 44-48-90 of the SVPA, the circuit court had sixty days to conduct Miller's civil SVP trial.[9]&nbsp;\r\nDuring this time, Miller was to remain incarcerated.\r\nOn December 29, 2005, the State moved for a continuance past the sixty-day deadline pursuant to section 44-48-90.&nbsp; In its motion, the State noted that\r\nJanuary 2, 2006 was a holiday, and the last day for a trial of Miller's case would be December 30, 2005.&nbsp; Additionally, the State claimed the court-ordered\r\nevaluation of Miller would not be completed until January 31, 2006 due to problems in obtaining information regarding Miller's prior North Carolina convictions.[10]\r\nOn January 13, 2006, the circuit court held a hearing on the State's motion for a continuance.&nbsp; At the beginning of the hearing, the State informed the\r\ncourt that the mental health evaluation had been received that morning and the State was ready to proceed to trial.&nbsp; The circuit court set the case for\r\nJanuary 17, 2006.&nbsp; In response to this ruling, Miller's counsel referenced the sixty-day time limit of the SVPA and asked that the case be dismissed as the\r\nState had not established &quot;good cause&quot; for the motion and Miller had been substantially prejudiced by the delay.&nbsp; In support of this argument,\r\ncounsel relied on In re Care &amp; Treatment of Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001).[11] &nbsp;The\r\ncourt, however, did not rule on the request but stated that Miller needed to file a formal motion to dismiss.\r\nOn January 17, 2006, Miller filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.[12] &nbsp;In the motion, counsel argued that the State's petition &quot;should be dismissed with prejudice due to the State's failure to pursue the\r\nprosecution of this matter in a reasonably timely manner.&quot;&nbsp; Specifically, counsel claimed that the &quot;case should have been tried on or before\r\nJanuary 4, 2006 because [Miller's] continued incarceration beyond December 1, 2005 [was] certainly prejudicial.&quot;&nbsp; In opposition, the State claimed it\r\nhad &quot;good cause&quot; for a continuance as the forensic psychiatrist, who conducted all of the state's SVP evaluations, was unable to complete the\r\nevaluation within the sixty-day time period.&nbsp;\r\nCircuit Court Judge Larry R. Patterson conducted a hearing the same day the motion to dismiss was filed; however, the court did not rule on the motion but\r\ninstead took it under advisement.&nbsp; On July 24, 2006, the court issued an order denying Miller's motion to dismiss.&nbsp; Although the court expressed its\r\ndispleasure with the State's routine delay in initiating the SVP process, it found the State's interest in proceeding with the SVP trial outweighed the\r\nprejudice to Miller.&nbsp; Additionally, the court found there was no substantial prejudice to Miller.\r\nOn November 27, 2006, Circuit Court Judge James R. Barber, III conducted Miller's SVP jury trial.&nbsp; After the jury found Miller was an SVP, the court\r\nissued an Order of Commitment.[13]&nbsp;\r\nMiller appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss as the SVP trial was not held within the sixty-day\r\nstatutory limit and a continuance had not been granted.&nbsp; Additionally, Miller claimed he was substantially prejudiced by the delay as he was faced with the\r\nfollowing two choices:&nbsp; (1) he could have proceeded to trial on January 13, 2006 without having an independent psychiatric evaluation, thus, depriving him\r\nof an opportunity to prepare a defense; or (2) he could have requested a continuance in order to obtain the independent psychiatric evaluation, which would have\r\nresulted in his continued incarceration past his release date.&nbsp;\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed Miller's civil commitment.&nbsp; In re Care &amp; Treatment of Miller, 385 S.C. 539, 685 S.E.2d 619 (Ct. App.\r\n2009).&nbsp; Although the court recognized that the SVPA established a definite time-limit of sixty days, it found the State complied with Matthews by\r\nfiling a motion for a continuance prior to the expiration of the sixty-day time period and noting why the case could not be tried within sixty days.&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 547, 685 S.E.2d at 623. &nbsp;&nbsp;The court also found the State established &quot;good cause&quot; for delay based on the following factors:&nbsp; (1)\r\nMiller's change of counsel delayed the case over thirty days; (2) a thorough report by the Department of Mental Health served the best interest of Miller as the\r\nreport could have been in his favor; and (3) the grant of the State's motion for a continuance on January 13, 2006 was only ten days after the expiration of the\r\nsixty-day window set on November 3, 2005.&nbsp; Id. at 548, 685 S.E.2d at 624.&nbsp; Furthermore, the court concluded that Miller was not substantially\r\nprejudiced by the grant of a continuance as it allowed him the time to &quot;adequately prepare for his trial and develop a trial strategy.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 549, 685 S.E.2d at 624.\r\nAdditionally, while recognizing that Miller was incarcerated past his release date, the court stated that it was &quot;hesitant to set a bright line rule\r\nwhich would require reversal of an SVP's commitment when an individual is detained past his release date.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDespite its holding, the court expressed concern that Miller's civil commitment trial did not occur until well over a year after the probable cause hearing\r\nwas held.&nbsp; Although the court found the facts of the case did not warrant reversal, it emphasized that &quot;SVP trials should take priority when\r\nscheduling a court's docket, precisely because of the potential for the prolonged incarceration evidenced in this case.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 549, 685\r\nS.E.2d at 624-25.\r\nFollowing the denial of his petition for rehearing, Miller petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of\r\nAppeals.&nbsp; This Court granted Miller's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nMiller contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the circuit court's denial of his motion to dismiss as the SVP trial was not held within sixty days\r\nafter the probable cause determination and a continuance had not been granted.&nbsp; In support of this contention, Miller claims the Court of Appeals\r\nmisapprehended the significance of the issue in this case, &quot;which is that [he] was incarcerated in the county detention center for over a year with no\r\ncriminal charges pending because he had served the sentence he received for his criminal charge in 2001.&quot;&nbsp; Accordingly, Miller asserts that he\r\nsuffered substantial prejudice as a result of the State's motion for a continuance.\r\nMiller also challenges the Court of Appeals' finding that the State established &quot;good cause&quot; for the delay.&nbsp; Specifically, Miller avers the\r\nState had &quot;the information [it] claimed was the cause of the delay.&quot;&nbsp; Miller also contends the State acted in an &quot;unfair manner&quot; by\r\ninforming the circuit court that it was ready to proceed for trial on the day it received the psychiatric evaluation as this forced him to choose between\r\nproceeding to trial without an independent evaluation or moving for a continuance, which in turn resulted in an extended period of incarceration.\r\nB.\r\n&quot;The grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion\r\nappears from the record.&quot; &nbsp;Plyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007).\r\nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute pursuant to Rule 41(b), SCRCP, an appellate court may reverse the trial court's decision upon an\r\nabuse of discretion.&nbsp; McComas v. Ross, 368 S.C. 59, 62, 626 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2006).&nbsp; &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\nconclusions of the trial court are either controlled by an error of law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions.&quot;&nbsp; Kiriakides v. Sch. Dist.\r\nof Greenville County, 382 S.C. 8, 20, 675 S.E.2d 439, 445 (2009).\r\nC.\r\nCognizant of the applicable standard of review, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Miller's\r\nmotion to dismiss as the court properly applied the provisions of the SVPA with respect to the State's motion for a continuance.&nbsp;\r\nInitially, we note the State adhered to the SVPA's time limits until the civil commitment trial.&nbsp; As to the civil commitment trial, the State filed the\r\nmotion for a continuance prior to the expiration of the sixty-day time limit.&nbsp; Significantly, the statute does not require that a continuance be\r\nissued before the end of the sixty-day time period.&nbsp; See Matthews, 345 S.C. at 644, 550 S.E.2d at 314 (&quot;It is not a significant burden\r\non the State or the trial court to require the issuance of a continuance, or even a notation in the record, indicating:&nbsp; (1) the trial cannot be\r\nheld within sixty days; (2) good cause for the delay; and (3) the respondent will not suffer prejudice.&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\nIn ruling on the State's motion, the circuit court correctly took into consideration whether the State had established &quot;good cause&quot; for the delay\r\nand whether Miller would be &quot;substantially prejudiced&quot; by the delay.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2009). &nbsp;We find the court's ruling\r\nregarding these two factors is supported by the evidence.\r\nThe State presented evidence establishing the unforeseeable delays in scheduling the civil commitment trial.&nbsp; At the time of Miller's case, there was\r\nonly one court-appointed psychiatrist employed to handle all of the SVP evaluations.&nbsp; This, in and of itself, justified the State's delay and supported the\r\ncircuit court's finding of &quot;good cause.&quot;&nbsp; Moreover, as soon as the State received the psychiatric evaluation on January 13, 2006, approximately\r\ntwo weeks after the sixty-day time period, it informed the circuit court that it was ready to proceed to trial.&nbsp; Thus, we find that Miller was not\r\nsubstantially prejudiced by the State's delay as any delay was created by the circuit court's failure to expeditiously rule on Miller's motion to dismiss and\r\nschedule the civil commitment trial.\r\nFurthermore, we find our decision to affirm the Court of Appeals does not effectively change Miller's plight as his counsel conceded at oral argument that\r\nMiller suffers from pedophilia and needs continued treatment. &nbsp;Miller, however, is not without recourse as the SVPA provides that an SVP may petition, on\r\nan annual basis, to be released from incarceration.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-110 (Supp. 2009) (providing procedures for annual mental evaluation\r\nof SVP and for petitioning for release from the SVP program).[14]\r\nD.\r\nAlthough we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, we utilize this case as an opportunity to clarify certain procedural aspects of the SVPA.&nbsp; We\r\nfind this is an important issue as the SVPA's procedures were promulgated in order to avoid due process violations and to prevent inmates from being arbitrarily\r\nincarcerated beyond their release dates.&nbsp; See In re Care &amp; Treatment of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 146, 568 S.E.2d 338, 350 (2002) (noting\r\nthat the SVPA &quot;provides for constitutional safeguards such as probable cause hearings to ensure individuals are not arbitrarily held beyond their release\r\ndates&quot;).\r\nSpecifically, we consider the appropriate remedy for when the State fails to timely conduct a civil commitment trial within the time provisions mandated by\r\nthe SVPA.&nbsp; In making this determination, we must address the following questions:&nbsp; (1) whether a motion to dismiss should be granted with or without\r\nprejudice to the State; and (2) if the motion to dismiss is granted without prejudice, whether an inmate should be detained or released while the State re-files\r\nwith the circuit court the petition that precipitates a civil commitment trial?\r\nIn answering these questions, we have carefully balanced the interests of the State in pursuing SVPs and protecting the public versus the offender's rights\r\nnot to be indefinitely detained and to have a timely adjudication of his status as an SVP.[15]\r\nE.\r\nIn order to answer the first question regarding the ultimate resolution of an inmate's motion to dismiss, we must assess our decision in Matthews.\r\nIn Matthews, this Court held that where a civil commitment trial is not conducted within sixty days of the probable cause hearing and no continuance\r\nhas been granted, the proper procedure is for an inmate to file a motion to dismiss.&nbsp; Matthews, 345 S.C. at 645, 550 S.E.2d at 314.&nbsp; We,\r\nhowever, did not enunciate whether a dismissal would be with or without prejudice.&nbsp;\r\nTaking into consideration the language of Rule 41 governing a motion to dismiss and our state's jurisprudence regarding the SVPA, we now definitively rule\r\nthat a grant of an inmate's motion to dismiss should be without prejudice to the State.&nbsp;\r\nAs evidenced by the language of Rule 41(b), a court is authorized to specify in its order that a dismissal is without prejudice.&nbsp; See Rule 41(b),\r\nSCRCP (outlining rules governing an involuntary dismissal and stating that &quot;[u]nless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a\r\ndismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue or for\r\nfailure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits&quot; (emphasis added)).&nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, this Court has determined that a violation of the SVPA's time limits does not divest the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp; See\r\nMatthews, 345 S.C. at 645, 550 S.E.2d at 314 (interpreting section 44-48-90 and holding that &quot;the State's failure to comply with the time period set\r\nforth in the section, when a proper continuance has not been issued, does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nThus, we have expressly found that a court may still hear an SVP case despite procedural errors committed by the State.\r\nFinally, because a decision on a motion to dismiss does not necessarily constitute an adjudication of the merits of the case, permitting the State to re-file\r\nwould have no res judicata implications.&nbsp; Cf. Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 443-44, 175 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1970) (stating, in a pre-Rule\r\n41 case, &quot;[a]n order of dismissal for failure to proceed with the suit is in the nature of a discontinuance of the action and is not an adjudication of the\r\nmerits.&nbsp; Ordinarily, it does not put an end to the cause of action, but merely terminates the suit itself&quot;). &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the appropriate procedure in granting a motion to dismiss in the SVP context is to do so without prejudice to the\r\nState.&nbsp; To decide otherwise, we believe would be contrary to the purpose of the SVPA as it would represent an invalidation of the entire Act based on a\r\ntechnical time violation.&nbsp; See Osborne v. State, 907 So. 2d 505, 508 (Fla. 2005) (concluding State's petition for SVP civil commitment, which\r\nwas not brought within the requisite time period, is without prejudice absent a demonstration of prejudice; stating that &quot;[a] dismissal of a petition with\r\nprejudice would terminate the case on procedural grounds, essentially divesting the circuit court of jurisdiction&quot;).\r\nWhile we find that a dismissal without prejudice is the proper resolution, we are concerned that there is no real &quot;consequence&quot; if the State delays\r\nthe SVP proceedings.&nbsp; Arguably, the State could continue its delay tactics in perpetuity without any deleterious effects on its case against an alleged SVP.&nbsp;\r\nCf. In re the Detention of Fowler, 784 N.W.2d 184, 190 (Iowa 2010) (concluding that inmate's case should be dismissed and inmate released from\r\ncustody where State did not file a motion to continue for good cause until after the ninety-day period as &quot;[a]ny remedy other than dismissal would render a\r\ntime limitation for trial meaningless&quot;).\r\nThus, the question becomes whether an inmate, who is granted a dismissal, should be detained or released from custody pending the State's re-filing of its\r\npetition for the circuit court to conduct a hearing and make a judicial determination of probable cause.\r\nAt least one decision of our Court of Appeals would implicitly support the release of an inmate as the court concluded that a person may be civilly committed\r\nas an SVP even though he is not currently serving a sentence for a sexually violent offense.&nbsp; See In re Care &amp; Treatment of Manigo, 389\r\nS.C. 96, 697 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2010) (concluding civil commitment of an SVP does not require the person to be currently serving a sentence for a sexually\r\nviolent offense, but recognizing that the process is &quot;triggered&quot; once a person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense); see also S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 44-48-40(B) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;If the person is determined to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to this chapter, the person is subject to\r\nthe provisions of this chapter even though the person has been released on parole or conditional release.&quot;).\r\nBecause our appellate courts have not explicitly ruled on this issue, we are guided by the decisions from other jurisdictions holding that an inmate should\r\nbe released during the pendency of the re-filed SVP proceedings.&nbsp; See Osborne, 907 So. 2d at 509 (concluding that &quot;where a respondent\r\nhas completed his criminal sentence and is being detained awaiting a [SVP civil commitment] trial and the trial period has exceeded [the requisite time period]\r\nwithout a continuance for good cause, the respondent's remedy is release from detention and a dismissal without prejudice of the pending proceedings&quot;).\r\nBased on the above-outlined authority, we believe the release of an inmate is a proper remedy in that it ensures individuals are not arbitrarily held beyond\r\ntheir release dates and serves as an incentive to the State to comply with statutorily-mandated time provisions of the SVPA.&nbsp; Thus, we hold that once a\r\nmotion to dismiss is granted an inmate may be released from custody provided that he has completed his sentence as determined by the Department of\r\nCorrections.&nbsp; In the event an inmate is released, it is incumbent upon the State to expeditiously re-file its petition with the circuit court for a\r\nprobable cause determination.[16]\r\nIn initiating this process, we do not believe the State needs to begin the SVP proceedings anew as both the multidisciplinary team and the prosecutor's\r\nreview committee will have made the requisite probable cause determinations necessary to support the State's petition to the circuit court for a probable cause\r\nhearing. &nbsp;See In re Care &amp; Treatment of Valentine, 377 S.C. 244, 254-55, 659 S.E.2d 227, 233 (Ct. App. 2008) (reversing and remanding\r\ncircuit court's finding that State failed to meet its burden for ordering civil commitment of inmate under SVPA; recognizing that three separate probable cause\r\ndeterminations precede a civil commitment trial under the SVPA).\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Miller's motion to dismiss.&nbsp;\r\nAs to future cases arising after the issuance of this opinion, we hold that if an inmate is granted a dismissal the proceedings should be dismissed without\r\nprejudice to the State. &nbsp;If the motion to dismiss is granted, the inmate may be released from custody while the State re-files its petition to the circuit\r\ncourt provided that the inmate has completed his sentence as determined by the Department of Corrections.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justice Dorothy M. Jones, concur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I agree with the Court of Appeals' ruling that the hearing judge did not abuse his discretion in denying petitioner's\r\nmotion to dismiss, and thus concur in the result reached by the majority in that regard.&nbsp; Having answered the question upon which review was granted, I\r\nwould not seek to provide a procedure to govern the disposition of such motions in future cases.\r\nHowever, as a prospective procedure has been set forth, I address that portion of the opinion.&nbsp; I agree with the majority that Rule 41(b), SCRCP,\r\nauthorizes a court to specify its dismissal is without prejudice.&nbsp; I note, however, that the default standard is that the grant of a motion to dismiss\r\noperates as adjudication on the merits, i.e., a dismissal with prejudice.&nbsp; In other words, a trial judge is invested with the authority to exercise his\r\ndiscretion in such matters, and I would not deprive the judge of that authority by mandating the dismissal be without prejudice.\r\nFurthermore, I would not mandate a standard procedure for dealing with the disposition of the case in the event the trial judge exercises his discretion to\r\ngrant a motion without prejudice.&nbsp; In short, I would not require a specific result where the exercise of discretion is allowed.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I concur only in the result reached in this case.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to -170 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2009); see In re Care &amp; Treatment\r\nof Chandler, 382 S.C. 250, 254, 676 S.E.2d 676, 678 (2009) (&quot;The Act provides for the involuntary civil commitment of an individual deemed to be a\r\nsexually violent predator, which is defined under the Act as a person who (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense, and (b) suffers from a mental\r\nabnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if the person is not confined in a secure facility for\r\nlong-term control, care, and treatment.&quot;).\r\nWe have cited to the 2009 supplement as several of the provisions of the SVPA were amended effective May 12, 2010.&nbsp; These amendments are not applicable\r\nto the instant case.\r\n[2]&nbsp; These charges arose out of a 1998 incident where the mother of a ten-month-old girl walked into a room\r\nand found Miller leaning over her child with his pants pulled down while the baby's diaper was off.&nbsp; When confronted, Miller punched the mother as he\r\nattempted to escape from the room.\r\n[3]&nbsp; S.C.

Â§ 44-48-70.\r\n[7] During the three-month time period, the following delays occurred:&nbsp; (1) Miller's original,\r\ncourt-appointed counsel was relieved and a new attorney appointed; and (2) there were several scheduling changes due to the untimely death of Circuit Court\r\nJudge Marc Westbrook.&nbsp;\r\n[8] &nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(A) (Supp. 2009).\r\n[9]&nbsp; Section 44-48-90 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  Within sixty days after the completion of a hearing held pursuant to Section 44-48-80, the court must conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a\r\n  sexually violent predator. . . . The trial may be continued upon the request of either party and a showing of good cause, or by the court on its own motion in\r\n  the due administration of justice, and only if the respondent will not be substantially prejudiced.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2009).\r\n[10]&nbsp; Miller pled guilty to taking indecent liberties with children arising from an offense involving a\r\nfour-year-old girl that occurred on June 5, 1995 in North Carolina.&nbsp; As a result of the plea, Miller was sentenced to probation and ordered to participate\r\nin outpatient, sex offender treatment.&nbsp; After he violated the terms of his probation, Miller was incarcerated for two and a half months in 1996.&nbsp; In\r\n1998, Miller fled North Carolina while still on probation and was considered a fugitive at the time of the South Carolina offense.\r\n[11]&nbsp; In Matthews, this Court held the time period set forth in section 44-48-90 is not a\r\njurisdictional requirement.&nbsp; Id. at 644, 550 S.E.2d at 314.&nbsp; Additionally, this Court stated that &quot;[w]hen the sixty day period has passed,\r\nand no continuance has been granted,&quot; the proper procedure is to file a motion to dismiss.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n[12]&nbsp; Rule 41 provides in relevant part, &quot;For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with\r\nthese rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.&quot;&nbsp; Rule 41(b), SCRCP.\r\n[13]&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100(A) (Supp. 2009).\r\n[14] &nbsp;We note that delays similar to the instant case may not be as prolific in the future given the\r\nLegislature amended the SVPA in 2010 to impose time limits for the completion of a court-appointed examiner's evaluation and to expand the length of time in\r\nwhich a circuit court must conduct a civil commitment trial following the issuance of the evaluation.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90(B) (Supp.\r\n2010) (&quot;If a request is made, the court must schedule a trial before a jury in the county where the offense was committed within ninety days of the\r\ndate the court appointed expert issues the evaluation as to whether the person is a sexually violent predator, pursuant to Section 44-48-80(D), or, if there is\r\nno term of court, the next available date thereafter.&nbsp; The trial may be continued upon the request of either party and a showing of good cause, or by the\r\ncourt on its own motion in the due administration of justice, and only if the respondent will not be substantially prejudiced.&quot; (emphasis added)); id.\r\nÂ§ 44-48-80(D) (&quot;The expert must complete the evaluation within sixty days after the completion of the probable cause hearing.&nbsp; The court may grant\r\none extension upon request of the expert and a showing of good cause.&nbsp; Any further extensions only may be granted for extraordinary circumstances.&quot;).\r\n[15]&nbsp; Notably, the court-appointed psychiatrist in this case testified that she deems only one-third of the\r\ninmates that she evaluates as SVPs. Thus, approximately two-thirds of the alleged SVPs are subjected to unjustified, prolonged terms of incarceration.\r\n[16] See S.C. Code Ann.
