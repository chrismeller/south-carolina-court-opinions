Clare, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  The post-conviction relief \r\n  (PCR) judge granted James A. Sellers (Respondent) a new trial after finding \r\n  that counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to move for a directed verdict \r\n  on the charge of accessory before the fact of murder, (2) failing to request \r\n  a jury charge for a lesser-included offense on the trafficking in crystal methamphetamines \r\n  and accessory before the fact of murder charges, and (3) failing to move for \r\n  a ruling upon the competency of a witness.Â  We reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nRespondent was arrested for accessory before the fact of murder and trafficking \r\n  in crystal methamphetamine.Â  Respondent was indicted and convicted on both charges.\r\nAt trial, the State alleged that Respondent and William Perry (Perry) arranged \r\n  a drug deal, in which they planned to set up the supplier so that they could \r\n  keep the drugs for themselves.Â  During the drug deal, which Respondent did not \r\n  attend, Perry shot the supplier because he believed the supplier was about to \r\n  pull a gun on him.Â  Perry pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter.Â  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  counsel moved for a directed verdict, arguing that Respondent could not have \r\n  been an accessory before the fact to murder because he was unaware of Perryâ€™s \r\n  intention to shoot the supplier.Â  The motion was denied.Â  \r\nThe State alleged that Respondent gave Perry the gun in case he needed it during \r\n  the deal. But Respondentâ€™s mother testified that Perry took the gun without \r\n  Respondent knowing what Perry was going to do with it.Â  Perry testified that \r\n  Respondent did not tell him to shoot the supplier, but that Respondent gave \r\n  him the gun prior to the meeting with the supplier.Â  Respondent did not testify \r\n  at trial.\r\nNone of the drugs in question were ever recovered.Â  During trial, Bruce Lewey \r\n  (Lewey) was the sole witness to testify as to the amount of drugs in question.Â  \r\n  Lewey was another partner in the scheme with Respondent and Perry.Â  Lewey testified \r\n  that he weighed the drugs on a digital scale, and the drugs weighed six ounces.Â  \r\n  Lewey testified that he has been diagnosed with and was prescribed a psychotic \r\n  medication for schizophrenia.Â  He further testified that he stopped taking the \r\n  medication and had been a methamphetamine addict for over fifteen years.\r\nThe jury found Respondent guilty of trafficking crystal methamphetamine and \r\n  accessory before the fact of murder.Â  Respondent was sentenced to concurrent \r\n  terms of twenty-five years imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of $50,000.Â  \r\n  This Court affirmed his convictions and sentences on direct appeal.Â  State \r\n  v. Sellers, Op. No. 99-MO-79 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 15, 1999).Â  \r\nRespondent filed an application for PCR and was granted relief based on three \r\n  of the eleven grounds asserted.Â  The PCR judge granted a new trial.Â  This Court \r\n  granted certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.\r\nThe State raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.\r\n         \r\n  Did the PCR court err in ruling that counsel was ineffective for failing to \r\n  request a directed verdict for the accessory before the fact of murder charge \r\n  on the basis that the State failed to prove the principalâ€™s guilt?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the PCR court err in ruling that counsel was ineffective for failing to \r\n  request jury charges on lesser-included offenses on the murder and trafficking \r\n  offenses?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the PCR court err in ruling that counsel was ineffective for failing to \r\n  move for the trial court to rule upon the competency of a witness?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  \r\n  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of \r\n  probative value to support them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, \r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â  If no probative evidence exists to support the \r\n  findings, this Court will reverse.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\nTo establish a claim that counsel was ineffective, a PCR applicant must show \r\n  that (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, \r\n  and (2) but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the \r\n  outcome of the trial would have been different.Â  Strickland v. Washington, \r\n  466 U.S. 688 (1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  733, 735 (1997).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine \r\n  confidence in the outcomeâ€ of the trial.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.Â  \r\n  Thus, an applicant must show both error and prejudice to win relief in a PCR \r\n  proceeding.Â  Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999).\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Directed Verdict\r\nThe State argues the PCR \r\n  court erred in ruling that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for failing \r\n  to request a directed verdict on the basis that the State failed to prove that \r\n  Perry, the principal, was guilty of murder.Â  We agree.\r\nMurder is the killing of \r\n  any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-3-10 (2003).Â  In a murder prosecution, malice may be implied if the defendant \r\n  uses a deadly weapon.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 63, 502 S.E.2d 63, \r\n  69 (1998).\r\nTo support a conviction \r\n  of accessory before the fact of a felony, the prosecution must show that the \r\n  accused advised, agreed, urged, or in some way aided some other person to commit \r\n  the offense; the accused was not present when the offense was committed; and \r\n  some principal committed the crime.Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. \r\n  53, 56, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993) (emphasis added).Â  The State is not barred \r\n  from prosecuting and convicting an accessory before the fact even though the \r\n  principal has been acquitted.Â  State v. Massey, 267 S.C. 432, 446-447, \r\n  229 S.E.2d 332, 339 (1976).Â  At the accessoryâ€™s trial, however, the State must \r\n  prove that the principal is guilty or the accessory may not be convicted.Â  Id. \r\n\r\nWhen ruling on a criminal \r\n  defendantâ€™s motion for directed verdict, a trial court is concerned with the \r\n  existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, \r\n  545, 500 S.E.2d 489, 493 (1998).Â  If there is any direct or substantial evidence \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which guilt may be fairly \r\n  and logically deduced, the case should be submitted to the jury.Â  State v. \r\n  Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 84, 512 S.E.2d 795, 798 (1999).\r\nA motion for directed verdict, \r\n  when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, would not have been granted \r\n  because evidence was presented that a principal shot and killed a victim with \r\n  a gun provided by Respondent.Â  In the present case, the principal used a deadly \r\n  weapon to murder the victim.Â  As a result, malice may be inferred.Â  The State \r\n  provided evidence that the weapon was provided by Respondent.Â  We find enough \r\n  evidence to warrant the submission of the case to the jury.Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe hold the PCR court erred \r\n  in granting a new trial on this issue.Â  A motion for directed verdict would \r\n  not have changed the outcome of the trial.Â  Had counsel made a motion for a \r\n  directed verdict, the trial court would have been wrong to grant it.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJury Charge \r\n   \r\nThe State argues \r\n  the PCR court erred in ruling that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective \r\n  for failing to request jury charges for lesser-included offenses on the murder \r\n  and trafficking offenses. [1] Â  We agree.\r\nA judge is only \r\n  required to charge a jury on a lesser-included offense if evidence exists that \r\n  suggests that the lesser, rather than the greater, crime was committed.Â  State \r\n  v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 242 (1996).Â  There must \r\n  be evidence that the defendant committed the lesser-included offense to entitle \r\n  him to a jury charge on the offense. Â State v. Mathis, 287 S.C. 589, \r\n  594, 340 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1986).Â  The lesser-included offense of accessory before \r\n  the fact of manslaughter does not exist.Â  State v. Jennings, 160 S.C. \r\n  348, 349, 158 S.E.2d 687, 688 (1931) (holding there can be no charge for accessory \r\n  before the fact to manslaughter).\r\nA defendant is \r\n  not entitled to a lesser-included charge of possession with intent to distribute \r\n  when there is evidence that the amount involved exceeded minimum for trafficking.Â  \r\n  State v. Grandy, 306 S.C. 224, 226, 411 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1991). \r\nIn the present \r\n  case, there is no evidence in the record that would entitle Respondent to a \r\n  charge on lesser-included offenses.Â  First, accessory before the fact of manslaughter \r\n  does not exist.Â  Second, as to the trafficking charge, Respondent did not present \r\n  evidence that he possessed less than the minimum required for trafficking.Â  \r\n  In fact, the only evidence before the jury was that the amount of methamphetamines \r\n  in question would constitute trafficking.Â  In addition, the State presented \r\n  the only evidence as to the amount of drugs at issue, which included testimony \r\n  that Respondent possessed enough methamphetamines to warrant a trafficking charge.Â  \r\n  As a result, Respondent was not entitled to a lesser-included charge, such as \r\n  possession with intent to distribute, for the trafficking charge.\r\nWe hold the PCR court erred \r\n  in granting a new trial for counselâ€™s failure to request jury charges on lesser-included \r\n  offenses.Â  Respondent was not entitled to jury charges on lesser-included offenses.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCompetency of Witness \r\n   \r\nThe State \r\n  argues the PCR court erred in ruling that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective \r\n  for failing to ask the trial court to rule upon the competency of a witness.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nAll witnesses are presumed \r\n  competent to testify.Â  Rule 601(a), SCRE.Â  A witness will be disqualified if \r\n  he cannot express himselfÂ  â€œconcerning the matter as to be understood by the \r\n  judge and jury . . . or is incapable of understanding the duty of a witness \r\n  to tell the truth.â€ Â Rule 601(b), SCRE.Â  Mere speculation on the applicantâ€™s \r\n  part as to impeachment evidence is insufficient to show prejudice.Â  Jackson \r\n  v. State, 329 S.C. 345, 350-351, 495 S.E.2d 768, 770-771 (1998).\r\nA witnessâ€™s mental illness \r\n  is not enough to rebut the presumption set forth in Rule 601, SCRE.Â  A witnessâ€™s \r\n  mental capacity could, however, affect the credibility of that witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  At trial, counsel attacked the credibility of the witness on several grounds, \r\n  including mental illness.Â  Trial counsel cross-examined witness Lewey at length \r\n  about his mental illness.Â  The jury was fully aware of the fact that Lewey was \r\n  schizophrenic, and therefore the jury could have decided to believe all or none \r\n  of his testimony.\r\nWe hold the PCR court erred \r\n  in ruling that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move \r\n  for the trial court to rule upon the competency of a witness.Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nBecause \r\n  there is no probative evidence supporting the PCR judgeâ€™s decision, we REVERSE \r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s decision to grant a new trial.Â  \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Respondent does not identify the lesser-included offenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25918","title":"Hagood v.

Sommerville, S.C. Ct. App. \r\n  Order dated May 22, 2003 (unpublished order).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nErnest Hagood (Petitioner) sued Brenda S. Sommerville (Respondent) \r\n  after Petitioner allegedly was injured in 1997 when he was struck by Respondentâ€™s \r\n  vehicle while riding a bicycle.Â  Petitioner was represented by James H. Moss \r\n  (Petitionerâ€™s Attorney).Â  Respondent moved to disqualify Barton J. Adams (Adams) \r\n  from testifying as an expert witness for Petitioner because Adams is employed \r\n  full-time by Petitionerâ€™s Attorney as a professional investigator and accident \r\n  reconstruction expert. [1] \r\nThe trial court gave Petitioner two options:Â  (1) do not \r\n  use Adams as a witness, but find another expert witness and proceed to trial \r\n  with Petitionerâ€™s Attorney; or (2) Petitionerâ€™s Attorney may withdraw due to \r\n  the disqualification, Petitioner may retain new counsel, and use Adams as an \r\n  expert witness at trial.Â  Petitionerâ€™s Attorney withdrew.\r\nFollowing the Court of Appealsâ€™ dismissal of Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  case, we granted the petition for a writ of certiorari to consider an issue \r\n  of first impression in South Carolina:Â  Is an order which grants a motion to \r\n  disqualify a partyâ€™s attorney immediately appealable?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a case raising a novel question of law, the appellate \r\n  court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower \r\n  court.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. \r\n  2003)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 \r\n  S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nThe right of appeal arises from and is controlled by statutory \r\n  law.Â  North Carolina Federal Sav. and Loan Assâ€™n v. Twin States Dev. Corp., \r\n  289 S.C. 480, 347 S.E.2d 97 (1986).Â  An appeal ordinarily may be pursued only \r\n  after a party has obtained a final judgment.Â  Mid-State Distributors, Inc. \r\n  v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 335, 426 S.E.2d 777, 781 (1993); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(1) (1976); Rule 72, SCRCP; Rule 201(a), SCACR.\r\nThe determination of whether a party may immediately appeal \r\n  an order issued before or during trial is governed primarily by S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  An order generally must fall into one of \r\n  several categories set forth in that statute in order to be immediately appealable.Â  \r\n  Baldwin Constr. Co. v. Graham, 357 S.C. 227, 593 S.E.2d 146 (2004); Woodard \r\n  v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 242, 460 S.E.2d 392, 393 (1995), overruled \r\n  on other grounds, Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d \r\n  231 (2002); Mid-State Distributors, 310 S.C. at 333 n.3, 426 S.E.2d at \r\n  780 n.3. \r\nPetitioner argues the order in his case is immediately appealable \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976) because it affects a substantial right, \r\n  namely, the right to proceed with a lawyer of his choosing.Â  Petitioner relies \r\n  on foreign authority to argue the right would likely be lost if not immediately \r\n  appealed.Â  If a new trial were ordered after an appeal in the distant future, \r\n  the preferred attorney may not be available or a litigant may not be able to \r\n  afford the attorney for a second trial.Â  Further, a litigant would find it difficult \r\n  or impossible to show prejudice resulting from the disqualification order in \r\n  a later appeal.\r\nRespondent argues the order does not affect a substantial \r\n  right as the term is defined in Section 14-3-330(2).Â  If the trial court erred \r\n  in disqualifying Petitionerâ€™s attorney, Petitioner may protect his rights by \r\n  challenging the errors in an appeal following a final judgment.Â  \r\nAn order affects a substantial right and is immediately \r\n  appealable when it â€œ(a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment \r\n  from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or \r\n  refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any \r\n  pleading in any action[.]â€Â  Section 14-3-330(2).Â  Â Â An order which does not \r\n  finally end a case or prevent a final judgment from which a party may seek appellate \r\n  review usually is considered an interlocutory order from which no immediate \r\n  appeal is allowed.Â  Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C. 135, 138, 564 S.E.2d \r\n  377, 379 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nThe provisions of Section 14-3-330, including subsection \r\n  (2), have been narrowly construed and immediate appeal of various orders issued \r\n  before or during trial generally has not been allowed.Â  Piecemeal appeals should \r\n  be avoided and most errors can be corrected by the remedy of a new trial.Â  See \r\n  e.g. Breland v. Love Chevrolet Olds, Inc., 339 S.C. 89, 93, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  11, 13 (2000) (order denying motion for change of venue is not immediately appealable \r\n  because any error in the order can be corrected by new trial); Senter v. \r\n  Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 341 S.C. 74, 77-78, 533 S.E.2d 575, 577 (2000) \r\n  (order denying bifurcation of trial on issues of liability and damages in personal \r\n  injury case is not immediately appealable as affecting a substantial right); \r\n  Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 312, 474 S.E.2d 424, 427 (1996) (denial \r\n  of motions for disqualification of a judge and for a continuance are interlocutory \r\n  orders not affecting the merits, and thus are reviewable only on appeal from \r\n  a final order); Collins v. Sigmon, 299 S.C. 464, 466, 385 S.E.2d 835, \r\n  836 (1989) (order allowing amendment of a pleading generally is not immediately \r\n  appealable); Ex parte Whetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 347 S.E.2d 881 (1986) \r\n  (order directing a party or a non-party to submit to discovery is not immediately \r\n  appealable; instead, the party or non-party must be held in contempt before \r\n  an appeal may be taken challenging the validity of the discovery order); Tatnall, \r\n  350 S.C. at 138, 564 S.E.2d at 379 (order denying motion to amend pleadings \r\n  to assert third party claims was not immediately appealable because the order \r\n  did not affect a substantial right).\r\nIn a well-established exception to the general rule, we \r\n  repeatedly have held that the denial of a partyâ€™s right to a particular mode \r\n  of trial is immediately appealable as a substantial right under Section 14-3-330(2).Â  \r\n  See Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 72, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d 331, 333 (2000) (â€œPursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(2), this Court has held on numerous \r\n  occasions that when a trial courtâ€™s order deprives a party of a mode of trial \r\n  to which it is entitled as a matter of right, such order is immediately appealable.â€) \r\n  (listing cases); Creed v. Stokes, 285 S.C. 542, 331 S.E.2d 351 (1985) \r\n  (order referring case to master in equity affects the mode of trial, a substantial \r\n  right, and party waived his objection to the reference and his right to jury \r\n  trial by failing to immediately appeal the order); Bateman v. Rouse, \r\n  358 S.C. 667, 675, 596 S.E.2d 386, 390 (Ct. App. 2004) (purpose of immediate \r\n  appeal on right to particular mode of trial is to preserve partyâ€™s constitutional \r\n  right to trial by jury which would otherwise be lost.)\r\nThere does not appear to be a clear majority view on the \r\n  appealability of an order granting a motion to disqualify a partyâ€™s attorney \r\n  in a civil case.Â  See David B. Harrison, Appealability of State Courtâ€™s \r\n  Order Granting or Denying Motion to Disqualify Attorney, 5 A.L.R. 4th 1251 \r\n  (1981) (discussing cases on both sides of issue). \r\nThe reasons most often cited by state courts which have \r\n  concluded such an order may be immediately appealed include (1) the importance \r\n  of the partyâ€™s right to counsel of his choice in an adversarial system; (2) \r\n  the importance of the attorney-client relationship, which demands a confidential, \r\n  trusting relationship that often develops over time; (3) the unfairness in requiring \r\n  a party to pay another attorney to become familiar with a case and repeat preparatory \r\n  actions already completed by the preferred attorney; and (4) an appeal after \r\n  final judgment would not adequately protect a partyâ€™s interests because it would \r\n  be difficult or impossible for a litigant or an appellate court to ascertain \r\n  whether prejudice resulted from the lack of a preferred attorney.Â  See \r\n  Goldston v. American Motors Corp., 392 S.E.2d 735, 737-38 (N.C. 1990); \r\n  Russell v. Mercy Hosp., 472 N.E.2d 695, 697-98 (Ohio 1984); Richardson \r\n  v. Griffiths, 560 N.W.2d 430, 434-35 (Neb. 1997); Casco Northern Bank \r\n  v. JBI Associates, Ltd., 667 A.2d 856, 859 n.3 (Me. 1995); Parker v. \r\n  Volkswagenwerk, 781 P.2d 1099, 1104-05 (Kan. 1989); In re Estate of French, \r\n  651 N.E.2d 1125, 1130-31 (Heiple and Freeman, JJ., dissenting).\r\nWe find persuasive the arguments of Petitioner and the reasoning \r\n  expressed by other jurisdictions which allow immediate appeal of such orders.Â  \r\n  We conclude an order granting a motion to disqualify a partyâ€™s attorney in a \r\n  civil case affects a substantial right and may be immediately appealed under \r\n  Section 14-3-330(2).Â  Such an order implicitly falls within the statutory definition \r\n  of a substantial right under Section 14-3-330(2)(a).Â  The right to be represented \r\n  by an attorney of oneâ€™s choosing is one of those rare orders which, in effect, \r\n  could determine the action and prevent a judgment from which an appeal might \r\n  be taken, or could discontinue an action due to the potential impact on both \r\n  the attorney-client relationship and the overall litigation and trial of the \r\n  case.Â  Moreover, the right to be represented by oneâ€™s preferred attorney is \r\n  closely related to the right to a particular mode of trial, a well-established \r\n  substantial right.Â  \r\nDeprivation of the right to oneâ€™s preferred attorney would \r\n  affect the attorney-client relationship, which is extremely important in our \r\n  adversarial system.Â  Furthermore, an appeal after final judgment and a new trial, \r\n  if granted, would not adequately protect a partyâ€™s interests because it would \r\n  be difficult or impossible for the affected party or the appellate court to \r\n  ascertain by any objective standard whether prejudice resulted from the disqualification.\r\nWe further conclude, as we have with regard to the right \r\n  to a particular mode of trial, an order granting a motion to disqualify a partyâ€™s \r\n  preferred attorney must be immediately appealed or any later objection \r\n  in a subsequent appeal will be waived.Â  Cf. Flagstar Corp., 341 \r\n  S.C. at 72, 533 S.E.2d at 333 (party is required to immediately appeal if denied \r\n  a mode of trial to which he is entitled as a matter of right, and failure to \r\n  do so forever bars appellate review of the issue).Â  \r\nThe circuit court concluded it would be improper under the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct for an investigator or accident reconstruction \r\n  expert who works as a full-time employee for Petitionerâ€™s Attorney to testify \r\n  on Petitionerâ€™s behalf at trial.Â  \r\nThe circuit court relied on Rule 3.7 of Rule 407, SCACR, which generally \r\n  prohibits a lawyer from acting as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer \r\n  will be a necessary witness. [2] Â  \r\n  Respondent contends Rule 3.7 prohibits not only the attorney, but also the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  employee, from testifying at trial.Â  Respondent has not cited and we have not \r\n  found any authority supporting this proposition.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nNothing in Rule 3.7 or the accompanying comments indicates \r\n  it is intended to prohibit an employee of an attorney from testifying in a case \r\n  handled by the attorney in which there exists no conflict of interest between \r\n  the attorney and client, or between the attorneyâ€™s employee and client.Â  Jurors \r\n  are not likely to be confused by a lawyerâ€™s employee testifying as a witness \r\n  for a client while the lawyer serves as the clientâ€™s advocate.Â  Jurors should \r\n  readily perceive the distinction, particularly since the opposing party may \r\n  emphasize the fact of the witnessâ€™s employment.\r\nMoreover, Rule 3.7(b) addresses situations in which a lawyer \r\n  may testify as a witness in a case handled by a lawyer from the same firm, provided \r\n  there are no conflicts of interest with clients or former clients.Â  If this \r\n  is permissible, it naturally follows that a non-lawyer employee of the firm \r\n  may testify, subject, of course, to the rules of cross-examination.Â  See \r\n  e.g. Rules 607-609, SCRE (addressing admissibility of impeachment evidence \r\n  relating to witnessâ€™s bias or credibility).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAn order granting a motion to disqualify a partyâ€™s attorney \r\n  in a civil case affects a substantial right and may be immediately appealed \r\n  under Section 14-3-330(2).Â  Further, such an order must be immediately appealed \r\n  or any later objection in a subsequent appeal will be waived.Â  We find it unnecessary \r\n  to address Petitionerâ€™s remaining issues and arguments.Â  See Whiteside \r\n  v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) \r\n  (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior \r\n  issue is dispositive).&nbsp; \r\n REVERSED.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, \r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent. Â I agree with the majority \r\n  that this attorney disqualification was unwarranted, but I would not reach that \r\n  issue because, in my opinion, a disqualification order is not immediately\r\nappealable.\r\nAs the majority notes, the right of appeal is controlled by statute.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 and Supp. 2003); N.C. Fed. Sav. and Loan \r\n  Assâ€™n v. Twin States Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 480, 481, 347 S.E.2d 97, 97 (1986).Â  \r\n  Attorney disqualification does not fall within the ambit of section 14-3-330(2)(a).Â  \r\n  Representation by a particular attorney does not in effect determine or discontinue \r\n  the action, or prevent a judgment from which an appeal might be taken.Â  Compare \r\n  Breland v. Love Chevrolet Olds, Inc., 339 S.C. 89, 93-95, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  11, 13-14 (2000) (holding that an order denying a motion to change venue is \r\n  not immediately appealable under section 14-3-330(2)); Senter v.

Norton of the United States District Court, District of South Carolina, certified \r\n  questions to this Court asking whether an insurer made a meaningful offer of \r\n  under insured motorist coverage (â€œUIMâ€).\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nIn \r\n  April 2001, Louis Leachman (â€œLeachmanâ€) purchased an automobile insurance policy \r\n  from Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (â€œProgressiveâ€).Â  Leachman purchased \r\n  a $300,000 combined single limits liability policy.Â  Leachman selected UIM coverage \r\n  by marking a line designated $100,000 / $300,000 / $50,000 on the offer form.Â  \r\n  He also signed the form at the bottom, noting that the UIM coverage was lower \r\n  than his liability coverage ($300,000).Â  After Leachman signed an acknowledgement \r\n  of his selection, Progressive issued Leachman the policy.\r\nAvailable \r\n  amounts of UIM coverage were described on the first page of Progressiveâ€™s form.\r\n\r\nAvailable limits \r\n  of UM and/or UIM are (for â€œeach personâ€ / â€œeach accidentâ€ / â€œproperty damage \r\n  each accidentâ€):\r\n  $15,000/$30,000/$10,000\r\n  $15,000/$30,000/$15,000\r\n  $25,000/$50,000/$10,000\r\n  $25,000/$50,000/$15,000\r\n  $25,000/$50,000/$25,000\r\n  $50,000/$100,000/$25,000\r\n  $50,000/$100,000/$50,000\r\n  $100,000/$300,000/$50,000\r\n  $250,000/$500,000/$100,000\r\n  $100,000 Combined \r\n  Single Limit (each accident)\r\n  $300,000 Combined \r\n  Single Limit (each accident)\r\n  $500,000 Combined \r\n  Single Limit (each accident) \r\n\r\n\r\nThe form also \r\n  explained that increased coverage was available:\r\n\r\nFor a modest \r\n  increase in premium, the higher limits of UM and/or UIM are available up to \r\n  the limits of your bodily injury Liability Coverage.Â  Our representative can \r\n  quote premium prices for you.\r\n\r\nThe form also \r\n  had a page for insureds to select the amount of coverage they desired.Â  Leachman \r\n  selected the following:\r\n\r\n__$15,000/$30,000/$10,000- \r\n  premium = $8.00Â \r\n__$15,000/$30,000/$15,000- \r\n  premium = $8.00Â \r\n__$25,000/$50,000/$10,000- \r\n  premium = $9.00Â \r\n__$25,000/$50,000/$15,000- \r\n  premium = $9.00Â \r\n__$25,000/$50,000/$25,000- \r\n  premium = $9.00Â \r\n__$50,000/$100,000/$25,000 \r\n  - premium = $11.00Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n__$50,000/$100,000/$50,000 \r\n  - premium = $11.00\r\nÂ x $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 \r\n  - premium = $13.00 [1]\r\n__$250,000/$500,000/$100,000\r\n__$100,000 \r\n  Combined Single Limit (each accident) - premium = $12.00\r\n__$300,000 \r\n  Combined Single Limit (each accident) - premium = $15.00\r\n__$500,000 \r\n  Combined Single Limit (each accident) \r\n\r\nFinally, the \r\n  form allowed the insureds to acknowledge that they had selected or rejected \r\n  UIM coverage.Â  Leachman marked the following:\r\n\r\nx I \r\n  have been offered and I have rejected the option to purchase Underinsured Motorist \r\n  Coverage in the amount equal to my limits of Liability Coverage.Â  Instead, as \r\n  shown above, I either: (1) elect lower limits of Underinsured Motorist Coverage \r\n  or (2) reject the option to purchase any Undersinsured Motorist Coverage.\r\n\r\nIn June 2002, while taking a walk, Leachman was hit by a car and was seriously \r\n  injured.Â  Leachman claimed that the damages from the accident exceeded the driverâ€™s \r\n  automobile liability coverage limit, which was $15,000.Â  Leachman made a claim \r\n  for UIM coverage, and Progressive tendered $100,000.Â  Leachman also sought additional \r\n  coverage up to the amount of his liability coverage ($300,000).\r\nProgressive filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District \r\n  Court, District of South Carolina asking the Court, to determine the amount \r\n  of UIM coverage provided under the policy.Â  The Honorable David C. Norton of \r\n  the United States District Court, District of South Carolina, has certified \r\n  the following questions to this Court:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In attempting to make an insured a â€œmeaningful offerâ€ of UIM coverage, is it \r\n  sufficient for an insurer to offer all of the options of UIM coverage that the \r\n  insurer is authorized to sell, up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability policy, \r\n  or must an insurer provide a blank line, or some equivalent, that allows the \r\n  insured to select any increment of UIM coverage up to the insuredâ€™s liability \r\n  limits?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the form used in this case constitute a meaningful offer?\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nWe will address the second certified question \r\n  first.\r\nLeachman argues Progressive failed to make a meaningful \r\n  offer of UIM coverage, and the policy should be reformed to include UIM coverage \r\n  equal to the amount of liability coverage of $300,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe insurer bears the burden of establishing that \r\n  it made a meaningful offer.Â  Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, \r\n  405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 759 (1996).Â  A noncomplying offer has the legal effect \r\n  of no offer at all.Â  Hanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. \r\n  55, 57, 389 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1990).Â  â€œIf the insurer fails to comply with its \r\n  statutory duty to make a meaningful offer to the insured, the policy will be \r\n  reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM coverage up to the limits of liability \r\n  insurance carried by the insured.â€Â  Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475 S.E.2d \r\n  at 760.\r\nIn general, for an insurer to make a meaningful \r\n  offer of UIM coverage, (1) the insurerâ€™s notification process must be commercially \r\n  reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the insurer must specify the limits \r\n  of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms; \r\n  (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional \r\n  coverage; and (4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are available \r\n  for an additional premium.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987).Â  \r\nIn response to Wannamaker, the \r\n  legislature passed a statute establishing the requirements for forms used in \r\n  making offers of optional insurance coverage such as UIM.Â  The statute directs \r\n  the insurer to include the following in its offer:Â  \r\n\r\n(1) a brief, concise explanation of the coverage;\r\n(2) a list of available limits and the range of premiums \r\n  for the limits;\r\n(3) space for the insured to mark whether the insured chooses \r\n  to accept or reject the coverage, and a space to select the limits of coverage \r\n  desired;\r\n(4) a space for the insured to sign the form, acknowledging \r\n  that the optional coverage has been offered; and\r\n(5) the mailing address and telephone number of the Department, \r\n  so that the insured may contact it with any questions that the insurance agent \r\n  is unable to answer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (2002).\r\nAn insurer enjoys a presumption that it made a \r\n  meaningful offer if it executes a form that complies with this statute.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (2003); Antley v. Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 621, \r\n  632, 567 S.E.2d 872, 878 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If the form does not comply with \r\n  the statute, the insurer may not benefit from the protections of the statute.Â  \r\n  Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 486, 462 S.E.2d 291, 295 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Furthermore, a form does not necessarily constitute a meaningful \r\n  offer simply because it was approved by the Department of Insurance.Â  Butler, \r\n  323 S.C. at 408-409, 475 S.E.2d at 761.\r\n This Court recently addressed the issue \r\n  of whether an insurer made a meaningful offer of UIM to an insured.Â  Bower \r\n  v. Natâ€™l Gen. Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 112, 569 S.E.2d 313 (2002).Â  In Bower, \r\n  this Court held that when the insurer failed to inform the insured that UIM \r\n  coverage was available in any amount up to the insuredâ€™s liability coverage, \r\n  a meaningful offer was not made.Â  Id. at 119, 569 S.E.2d at 316 (citing \r\n  Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 311 S.E.2d 723 (1984)) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The form at issue in Bower listed four choices for UIM coverage \r\n  amounts.Â  Three of the choices included coverage up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s \r\n  liability coverage. [2] Â  Other amounts of coverage were \r\n  not available on the form.Â  The form did, however, provide a blank line, which \r\n  allowed the insured to write in any amount of coverage the insured desired.Â  \r\n  Bower rejected UIM coverage altogether.Â  This Court held the form did not constitute \r\n  a meaningful offer, and therefore had the legal effect of being no offer at \r\n  all.Â  Id.Â  As a result, the insurance policy was reformed to include \r\n  UIM up to the liability limits.Â  Id. \r\n In another case, the court of appeals \r\n  held that no meaningful offer was made when the insurer listed only three choices \r\n  for UIM coverage.Â  Wilkes v. Freeman, 334 S.C. 206, 512 S.E.2d 530 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  Wilkes also involved an insured who rejected UIM coverage \r\n  altogether.Â  After suffering injuries, the insured wanted UIM coverage up to \r\n  the amount of his policy limits, arguing he did not receive a meaningful offer.Â  \r\n  The court held that no meaningful offer was made, and the policy was reformed \r\n  to include coverage for the insured in the amount of liability coverage.Â  Id.\r\nThe facts in the present case are distinguishable \r\n  from Bower and Wilkes.Â  Unlike the insureds in Bower and \r\n  Wilkes, the insured in the present case purchased UIM coverage.Â  Moreover, \r\n  Progressiveâ€™s form, titled â€œUIM selection form,â€ allowed Leachman to choose \r\n  from eleven different amounts of UIM coverage up to the amount of liability \r\n  coverage, including $300,000. [3] \r\n  Â  Because this offer gave the insured the opportunity to make an intelligent \r\n  and informed decision on whether to purchase UIM coverage, we hold that Progressive \r\n  made a meaningful offer.\r\nThere are also policy reasons for finding that \r\n  Progressive made a meaningful offer.Â  The goal, as set forth in Wannamaker, \r\n  is to provide an insured with adequate information to make an intelligent decision \r\n  on whether to accept or reject UIM coverage.Â  291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at \r\n  556.Â  In addition, a meaningful offer allows an applicant to purchase UIM insurance \r\n  in any amount up to the limits of liability at an additional premium.Â  Bower, \r\n  351 S.C. at 117, 569 S.E.2d at 315.Â  To conclude that Progressive did not make \r\n  a meaningful offer in this case would lead to an absurd result.Â  If this Court \r\n  applies the rationale of Bower and Wilkes, Progressive would be \r\n  required to pay an amount that Leachman specifically rejected.Â  To compel coverage \r\n  would overstep the purpose behind mandating a meaningful offer.Â  \r\nIn addition, these public policies behind mandating \r\n  a meaningful offer would be undermined if the insurer were forced to provide \r\n  full coverage when it failed to offer every conceivable combination of \r\n  coverage up to an insuredâ€™s liability limits.Â Â  See Wilkes, 334 \r\n  S.C. at 211-212, 512 S.E.2d at 533 (insurer is not required to offer every possible \r\n  coverage limit combination and merely listing several available options without \r\n  providing a clear description that the applicant may request other limits is \r\n  not a meaningful offer).Â  In other words, the policy behind requiring a meaningful \r\n  offer is promoted without creating a rule that places such an unfair burden \r\n  on insurers. \r\nAs to the first certified question, we hold that \r\n  it is sufficient for an insurer to offer all of the coverage amounts the insurer \r\n  is authorized to sell by the Department of Insurance, \r\n  [4]  without providing a blank line for insureds to write in any amount \r\n  of coverage up to the policy limit.Â  \r\nThe controlling statute does not require insurers \r\n  to provide a blank line.Â Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (requiring \r\n  insurers to provide a list of available limits, a space for the insured to mark \r\n  whether the insured chooses to accept or reject the coverage, and a space to \r\n  select the limits of coverage desired).Â  Moreover, a blank line maybe helpful \r\n  but it is not necessary.Â  Bower, 351 S.C. at 121-122, 569 S.E.2d at 317-318 \r\n  (Toal, C.J., dissenting).Â  Further, an offer is not necessarily meaningful when \r\n  a blank space is provided for the insured to write in the desired amount of \r\n  coverage.Â  Id. at 119, 569 S.E.2d at 316.Â Â  If the legislature had intended \r\n  for insurers to provide a blank line allowing insureds to choose any amount \r\n  of coverage, the blank-line mandate would have been included in the statute. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we hold that when an insurer offers \r\n  all amounts of coverage authorized by the Department of Insurance, insurers \r\n  have provided insureds with the opportunity to make an intelligent decision \r\n  as to whether to accept or reject UIM coverage. \r\nConclusion\r\nThe holding in Bower should not \r\n  be extended to require the insurer to offer every possible numerical combination \r\n  of coverage for UIM.Â  Instead, the goal is for insureds to know their options \r\n  and to make an informed decision as to which amount of coverage will best suit \r\n  their needs.Â  Accordingly, the Court finds that Progressive made a meaningful \r\n  offer, and therefore the second question is answered in the affirmative.Â  As \r\n  to the first question, it is sufficient, in making a meaningful offer, for an \r\n  insurer to offer an insured all of the coverage amounts that the insurer is \r\n  authorized to sell by the Department of Insurance. \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The â€œxâ€ indicates the amount of coverage selected \r\n    by Leachman.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The fourth choice exceeded Bowerâ€™s liability limits, and therefore \r\n    he was not permitted to select it.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The form also had two other options: a twelfth level of coverage, \r\n    which was above the insureds liability limits, and an option to select no \r\n    UIM whatsoever.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  South Carolina statutory law provides that â€œno insurer may make or \r\n    issue a policy except in accordance with its filings with the Department as \r\n    to approved premium amounts.â€Â  S.C.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In \r\n  November 2002, Appellant Jonathan Kyle Binney (Binney) was convicted of murder \r\n  and first-degree burglary and sentenced to death by a Cherokee County jury.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn early June 2000, Cherokee County police \r\n  received a call that a local resident, upon returning home from work, was surprised \r\n  and shot by a man who was hiding inside her house.Â  When police went to the \r\n  victimâ€™s residence to investigate, they found a suicide note Binney wrote and \r\n  signed.Â  Binney was later found in the crawl space of his Spartanburg County \r\n  residence.\r\nBefore Binney was arrested \r\n  and was read his Miranda rights, Binney turned to Cherokee County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Deputy Steve Reynolds and said, â€œsheâ€™s dead isnâ€™t she?â€Â  Reynolds replied, â€œwho?â€ \r\n  And Binney responded, â€œthe woman I shot.â€ \r\nDuring Binneyâ€™s detainment and eventual arrest, \r\n  Binneyâ€™s wife was talking on a cordless phone to Bill Bannister (Bannister), \r\n  Binneyâ€™s attorney in another matter. \r\n  [1] Â  Captain Mike Fowlkes (Fowlkes) with the Cherokee County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department testified that while Binneyâ€™s wife was on the phone, she repeatedly \r\n  told Binney not to say anything to the officers.Â  Eventually, while still at \r\n  the residence, SLED agent DeWitt â€œSpikeâ€ McCraw (McCraw) spoke with Bannister \r\n  and assumed that Bannister would continue to represent Binney in the present \r\n  matter. [2]   \r\nAfter hearing of Binneyâ€™s arrest, Don Thompson \r\n  (Thompson), Public Defender for Cherokee County, went to the jail to talk to \r\n  Binney.Â  Binney told Thompson that he wanted the death penalty, and Thompson \r\n  told Binney not to talk to the police.Â  Thompson met with Binney again a few \r\n  days later, and Binney was still determined to get the death penalty. \r\n  [3] \r\nAt trial, Thompson testified \r\n  that almost everyday during the first week of Binneyâ€™s incarceration, either \r\n  agent McCraw or the solicitorâ€™s office asked for permission to interrogate Binney.Â  \r\n  Thompson testified that he repeatedly refused their requests and told them that \r\n  they could not talk to Binney. \r\nOn Friday, June 14, 2000, \r\n  approximately a week after Binneyâ€™s arrest, Thompson visited Binney and later \r\n  testified that â€œit was hard to talk to him about anything,â€ and that Binney \r\n  mostly wanted to talk about the death penalty.Â  On that same day, McCraw called \r\n  Thompson and asked if he could send Binney a message asking Binney to submit \r\n  to an interrogation without the presence of an attorney.Â  Thompson told McCraw \r\n  that he could not.Â  \r\nAlso on June 14, McCraw contacted Travis Alexander \r\n  (Alexander), a jailer who worked at the prison where Binney was incarcerated.Â  \r\n  McCraw told Alexander to find Binney and let him know that if he wanted to talk \r\n  then he had to make a written request to talk with a detective without the presence \r\n  of an attorney. [4] Â  Within hours \r\n  of contacting Alexander, McCraw received a handwritten note from Binney, which \r\n  included a request to see a detective, without the presence of an attorney.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn that same day, McCraw and Fowlkes picked Binney \r\n  up and brought him to the Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  Before questioning began, Binney \r\n  was advised of his rights, and he signed a pre-interrogation waiver form.Â  In \r\n  addition, at trial, he testified that he did not have any trouble understanding \r\n  what the officers told him about his right to an attorney.Â  McCraw and Fowlkes \r\n  testified that during the interrogation, Binney appeared coherent, indicated \r\n  that he understood the nature of the interrogation, and was never promised anything \r\n  or coerced in anyway.Â  Eventually, Binney wrote and signed a five-page statement \r\n  confessing to the murder. [5] Â  At no time during Binneyâ€™s arrest, incarceration, or questioning \r\n  did Binney ask to have his attorney present.Â  \r\nDuring his confession, \r\n  Binney told police what took place during the commission of the murder.Â  He \r\n  explained that before he was tried for the CSC charge, Bannister, Binneyâ€™s lawyer \r\n  at the time, told him that, if convicted, he would be sentenced to ten years, \r\n  at the very least.Â  The potential for substantial, future jail time made Binney \r\n  very anxious.Â  He went to a local shopping center and found a friend who sold \r\n  him a handgun.Â  He then went to the victimâ€™s house and hid just off the property \r\n  line and watched the house and looked for activity.Â  Binney never met the victim \r\n  before the day of the murder.Â  He stayed in the surrounding woods overnight \r\n  thinking about whether he should just go into the house â€œto commit suicide or \r\n  rape someone, or to just shoot all of them and kill [himself].â€Â  \r\nThe next morning, he waited \r\n  until the victim and her husband left the house and then entered the house through \r\n  an unlocked window.Â  He cut all the phone lines in the house and put kitchen \r\n  knives and other possible weapons out of reach.Â  Late that afternoon, the victim \r\n  came home and found Binney in her bathroom.Â  The victim startled Binney because \r\n  he did not hear her enter the house.Â  Binney fired the gun in her direction \r\n  and then chased her out of the house.Â  Once outside, he shot in her direction \r\n  again to â€œkeep her scared and runningâ€ and then ran in the opposite direction \r\n  into the woods.Â  He ran home and hid under his house, where he was later found \r\n  by police. \r\nIn his June 14 statement, \r\n  Binney requested that he be given the death penalty:Â  â€œthe crime I committed \r\n  definitely warrants it.â€Â  In addition, he stated that he was not promised anything \r\n  or coerced in any way.Â  In addition, Binney wrote â€œI waive my right to an attorney.â€Â  \r\n  After Binney wrote and signed his June 14 statement, he took McCraw and Fowlkes \r\n  to the woods next to the victimâ€™s house where he hid his moped and the murder \r\n  weapon.Â  \r\nOn Monday, June 17, three \r\n  days after Binney sent his first written request, Binney sent McCraw another \r\n  request to meet.Â  Again, McCraw read Binney his rights and had him sign another \r\n  waiver.Â  Mike Prodan (Prodan), head of the Behavioral Science Unit at SLED, \r\n  also attended the June 17 interrogation, because McCraw requested the assistance \r\n  of someone with experience in investigating crimes involving sexual motives.Â  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on that same \r\n  day, Thompson received a message that Binney met with police and signed a statement \r\n  the previous Friday, June 14.Â  Thompson eventually found Binney at the Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Office.Â  McCraw and Prodan testified that Thompson â€œburst inâ€ to the interrogation \r\n  room and told Binney to quit talking.Â  When Binney turned to McCraw and asked \r\n  him what to do, McCraw responded, â€œhe works for you.â€ (Emphasis \r\n  added.)Â  Binney told Thompson to leave so that he could continue talking to \r\n  the officers. \r\nAt the suppression hearing, \r\n  McCraw testified that Thompson never told him not to talk to Binney.Â  The judge \r\n  found that Binney never invoked his Fifth Amendment right to an attorney.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the judge found that Binney knowingly and intelligently waived his Fifth Amendment \r\n  right to an attorney and that McCrawâ€™s communication to Binney inviting him \r\n  to request a meeting was not an â€œinterrogation.â€ \r\nBinney raises the following issue on appeal:\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err \r\n  in admitting into evidence Binneyâ€™s June 14 statement because it was taken in \r\n  violation of Binneyâ€™s Fifth Amendment right to have an attorney present during \r\n  a custodial interrogation?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nBinney argues that the trial judge \r\n  erred in admitting the June 14 statement in which he confessed to murder because \r\n  the statement was procured in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to have \r\n  an attorney present during a custodial interrogation.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe State has the burden to show by the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence that a defendant has voluntarily waived his right to counsel.Â  \r\n  State v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 137, 382 S.E.2d 911, 913 (1989).Â  Police \r\n  must inform criminal suspects of their right to have an attorney present during \r\n  a custodial interrogation before the interrogation commences. Miranda v. \r\n  Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 473-474 (1966).Â  The Court went on to say that â€œ[o]nce \r\n  warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clearâ€¦[i]f the individual \r\n  states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney \r\n  is present.â€ Id.Â  In addition, police are restricted from initiating \r\n  contact with a suspect when that contact is the â€œfunctional equivalentâ€ of an \r\n  interrogation.Â  Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980).Â  The \r\n  â€œfunctional equivalentâ€ of an interrogation is \r\n\r\nany words or actions on the part \r\n  of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that \r\n  the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response \r\n  from a suspect.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nIn Edwards v. Arizona, the United States Supreme Court elaborated on \r\n  oneâ€™s right to have an attorney present during a custodial police interrogation. \r\n  451 U.S. 477 (1981).Â Â Â  In that case, the police reinitiated an interrogation \r\n  and eventually elicited a confession sometime after the defendant requested \r\n  an attorney and interrogation had ceased.Â  The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld \r\n  the conviction, holding that the defendantâ€™s confession was voluntarily given.Â  \r\n  The United States Supreme Court reversed, holdingÂ  â€œwaivers of counsel must \r\n  not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment \r\n  or abandonment of a known right or privilege.â€ Id. at 483. \r\nTo invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give â€œsome statement \r\n  that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance \r\n  of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.â€Â  McNeil \r\n  v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178 (1991); see also State v. Kennedy, \r\n  333 S.C. 426, 430, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998) (holding that an unequivocal invocation \r\n  of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel must be presented in a manner that a \r\n  reasonable police officer, under similar circumstances, would understand the \r\n  statement to be a request for the presence of an attorney).Â Â  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, this Court has held that\r\n[a] valid waiver of the right \r\n  to counsel will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after \r\n  Miranda warnings are given.Â  The record must show an accused was offered \r\n  counsel but intelligently and knowingly rejected the offer.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. McCray, 332 S.C. \r\n  536, 546, 506 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1998).Â  \r\nIn addition, a criminal suspectâ€™s rights are not violated when the suspect, \r\n  not the police, â€œinitiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations \r\n  with the police.â€ State v. Howard, 296 S.C. 481, 489, 374 S.E.2d 284, \r\n  288 (1988) (citing Edwards, 451 U.S. at 485).Â  Finally, this Court has \r\n  held that, after it has been determined that the waiver was valid, the analysis \r\n  is over:\r\n\r\n[o]nce it is determined that \r\n  a suspectâ€™s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all \r\n  times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of \r\n  the stateâ€™s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis \r\n  is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Drayton, 293 \r\n  S.C. 417, 426, 361 S.E.2d 329, 334-335 (1987) (citing Moran v. Burbine, \r\n  475 U.S. 412 (1986)).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn the present case, we find that the following facts support the conclusion \r\n  that Binneyâ€™s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated and that his June 14 \r\n  statement was admissible:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  There is no evidence that Binney ever asked for an attorney at any point during \r\n  his arrest, incarceration, or questioning.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Binney has an adequate level of intelligence, and he has been arrested and read \r\n  his rights before.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (3)&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  In his written request, Binney stated that he did not want an attorney present \r\n  during the meeting with detectives.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (4)\r\n         \r\n  Before Binney provided police with a statement, he was again read his rights \r\n  and he signed a waiver of rights.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n In addition, McCrawâ€™s message to Binney instructing him to write a written request \r\n  to meet was not the initiation of an â€œinterrogation,â€ because it would not reasonably \r\n  elicit an incriminating response.Â  Instead, McCrawâ€™s message was simply an invitation \r\n  for Binney to initiate contact.Â  Moreover, Binneyâ€™s request to meet with a detective \r\n  and his later confession both were made out of his own free will, without coercion \r\n  or deception.Â  In fact, the record indicates that Binney was motivated to talk \r\n  with police to get off of suicide watch.Â  Finally, nothing in the record suggests \r\n  that Binney was not fully informed of his rights, did not understand his rights, \r\n  or that the confession was not the product of his own free will.\r\nSentence Review\r\nThe Court must \r\n  conduct a proportionality review of Binneyâ€™s death sentence based on the record.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(A) (2003).Â  In conducting the review, the Court considers \r\n  similar cases in which the death penalty has been upheld.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe find Binneyâ€™s death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or \r\n  any other arbitrary factor, and the evidence supports the trial judgeâ€™s findings \r\n  of aggravation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  In addition, \r\n  Binneyâ€™s sentence, in relation to the sentences this Court has upheld in similar \r\n  cases, was not excessive or disproportionate to his crime.Â  See State v. \r\n  Tench, 353 S.C. 531, 59 S.E.2d 314 (2003); State v. Weik, 356 S.C. \r\n  76, 507 S.E.2d 683 (2002), cert denied, 539 U.S. 930 (2003); State \r\n  v.

Holt, \r\n  Op. No. 2003-UP-277 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 16, 2003) reversing the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s award of punitive damages against Dr. Arthur Elbert Jordan, Jr. and \r\n  his son, Brian Jordan (Respondents).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1995, Dr. Jordan approached Dr. Holt and proposed \r\n  they invest in a racing theme restaurant in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  On\r\nSeptember 11, 1995, the parties \r\n  entered into a written agreement (Agreement) to form a limited liability company \r\n  (LLC) known as Winnerâ€™s Circle South.Â  The initial members of the LLC were Dr. \r\n  Jordan, Brian Jordan, Wayne Livingston, and Dr. Holt.Â  The parties also executed \r\n  an â€œAgreement to Leaseâ€ and a â€œMemorandumâ€ setting forth the estimated construction \r\n  cost for the project.Â  Although the parties filed Articles of Organization on \r\n  September 29, 1995, they never executed an operating agreement. The parties \r\n  later agreed to operate in accordance with applicable South Carolina statutory \r\n  law.Â  Pursuant to the Agreement, Dr. Jordan held a 55 percent ownership interest, \r\n  Brian Jordan a 10 percent interest, Dr. Holt a 25 percent interest, and Wayne \r\n  Livingston a 10 percent interest.Â  \r\nWinnerâ€™s Circle restaurant opened in November 1995 with \r\n  Brian Jordan acting as general manager.Â  In January 1996, Wayne Livingston transferred \r\n  one-half of his interest to his son, David Livingston.Â  Wayne Livingstonâ€™s transfer \r\n  of interest to his son created a voting majority among Wayne Livingston, David \r\n  Livingston, and Dr. Holt.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-404(a) (Supp. 2003).\r\nDissension \r\n  among the members developed when it became clear the venture was undercapitalized \r\n  and constantly in need of additional operating capital.Â  In June 1996, the relationship \r\n  between the parties was irreparably damaged when Holt, Wayne Livingston, and \r\n  David Livingston entered the restaurant to speak with Dr. Jordan.Â  A verbal \r\n  confrontation ensued between Brian Jordanâ€™s mother, who was helping with food \r\n  preparation, and Wayne Livingston. The Jordans continued to operate the restaurant \r\n  after the incident using personal and LLC funds.Â  In 1997, the Jordans added \r\n  15 poker machines to the restaurant and began operating a business known as \r\n  Competitive Marketing, which leased the additional machines from a third-party \r\n  company.Â  \r\nThe restaurant closed in July 1997.Â  Dr. Jordan brought \r\n  this action seeking dissolution of the LLC and an accounting.Â  He also alleged \r\n  causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, breach of written \r\n  and oral contracts, and slander per se.Â  Holt and Wayne Livingston filed \r\n  counterclaims and a third party complaint against Brian Jordan.Â  In addition \r\n  to seeking dissolution of the LLC, they alleged causes of action for breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of assets, breach of contract, breach of \r\n  the duties of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  and gross negligence.Â  \r\nFollowing a bench trial, the circuit court dissolved the \r\n  LLC and awarded it a judgment of about $763,000 against Dr. Jordan and a judgment \r\n  of $19,945 against Brian Jordan.Â  Petitioners were awarded the difference between \r\n  the amount of their initial contributions to the LLC and the amount each receives \r\n  upon dissolution of the LLC.Â  In addition, the circuit court awarded Petitioners \r\n  punitive damages on their breach of fiduciary duty claim. \r\nRespondents appealed only the punitive damages award.Â  The \r\n  Court of Appeals reversed the award, holding the facts and circumstances of \r\n  the case did not warrant an award of punitive damages.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s punitiveÂ Â  damages \r\n  award on Petitionerâ€™s breach of fiduciary duty claim by applying the wrong standard \r\n  of appellate review?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners argue the Court of Appeals erred in using \r\n  an equitable standard of review in determining punitive damages were not warranted \r\n  and that, using the legal standard of review, the evidence supported an award \r\n  of punitive damages.Â  We agree.\r\nIn its opinion, the Court of Appeals noted the case presented \r\n  two separate and distinct questions: (1) whether an action for dissolution of \r\n  an LLC is equitable or legal; and (2) whether an action for breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty, made in conjunction with an action for dissolution, is a legal claim for \r\n  purposes of determining the remedies available.Â  However, the court concluded \r\n  it was unnecessary to address these questions because the facts and circumstances \r\n  of the case did not warrant punitive damages.Â  Jordan v. Holt, supra.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals improperly found facts in accordance \r\n  with its own view of the evidence.Â  The Court of Appeals improperly blended \r\n  Petitionersâ€™ breach of fiduciary duty and dissolution actions and reviewed the \r\n  case under an equitable standard of review, despite its contention it need not \r\n  determine the appropriate standard of review.Â  The proper analysis is to view \r\n  the actions separately for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard \r\n  of review.Â  See Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97, \r\n  99 (1997) (legal and equitable actions, when maintained in one suit, each retain \r\n  their own identity for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal); \r\n  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996).Â  \r\n  A corporate dissolution is an action in equity.Â  Ward v. Ward Farms, Inc.. \r\n  283 S.C. 568, 324 S.E.2d 63 (1984).Â  In an action in equity tried without a \r\n  reference, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).Â  On the other hand, a claim of breach of \r\n  fiduciary duty is an action at law and the trial judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld \r\n  unless without evidentiary support.Â  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, \r\n  324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996).Â  The trial court based its punitive damages \r\n  award on Petitionersâ€™ cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, not on the \r\n  dissolution claim.Â  Therefore, the case is one at law and the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings will be upheld on appeal unless the findings are without evidentiary \r\n  support.\r\nThe Court of Appeals improperly assessed the facts of this \r\n  case based on its own view of the evidence instead of determining whether the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s findings lacked evidentiary support.Â  The Court of Appeals determined, \r\n  after its review of the evidence, Respondentsâ€™ actions were not willful or wanton, \r\n  but resulted from sloppy business practices which rendered neither party more \r\n  culpable than the other.Â Â  In concluding neither party was more culpable than \r\n  the other, the Court of Appeals injected its own view of the facts thereby exceeding \r\n  its scope of review.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe conclude the trial judgeâ€™s award of punitive \r\n  damages is supported by evidence in the record.Â  The trial judge found the egregious \r\n  conduct on the part of Dr. Jordan and Brian Jordan, including ignoring requests \r\n  for financial information and meetings, using LLC monies for payment of personal \r\n  debts and obligations, self-dealing, especially regarding the video poker machines, \r\n  and selling or transferring LLC property without the knowledge and consent of \r\n  the LLC and then pocketing the monies.Â  The judge ruled the wrongdoing on the \r\n  part of Dr. Jordan and Brian Jordan justified the award of punitive damages \r\n  against each of them.\r\nTestimony \r\n  in the record supports the view of the evidence taken by the trial judge.Â  Respondent \r\n  failed to provide LLC members financial information regarding the operating \r\n  expenditures of Winnerâ€™s Circle.Â  The record indicates Petitioners requested \r\n  complete financial disclosure from Respondents.Â  Wayne Livingston testified \r\n  that after May 1996, Respondent refused to provide any information about the \r\n  LLC to him.Â  Dr. Holt testified that by June 1996, Respondent had excluded Petitioners \r\n  from participating in the operations of the LLC and that on June 25, 1996, Brian \r\n  Jordan demanded Petitioners leave the restaurant.Â  \r\nThere is also \r\n  evidence in the record Respondents used LLC monies for their own benefit.Â  Dr. \r\n  Jordan opened a Wachovia operating account for the LLC and deposited monies \r\n  belonging to the LLC.Â  Even though the funds belonged to the LLC, Respondent \r\n  used the account to pay his personal interest obligations to Wachovia and BB&amp;T.\r\nPetitioners \r\n  testified that after Dr. Jordan excluded them from management of the restaurant, \r\n  Respondents installed additional video poker machines in the restaurant.Â  The \r\n  increase in machines occurred at the same time Respondents decided to operate \r\n  a business know as Competition Marketing.Â  The business operated video machines \r\n  at the restaurant, but never paid rent to the LLC, nor did the LLC receive any \r\n  share of profits from Competition Marketing.Â  Petitioners also testified that \r\n  Respondents misappropriated assets.Â  When the restaurant closed in July 1997, \r\n  Respondents failed to prepare a detailed inventory of the LLC property and disposed \r\n  of the racing memorabilia, the satellite system, and approximately 25 to 30 \r\n  televisions.Â  Items in the gift shop were sold and the funds generated kept \r\n  by Brian Jordan as partial payment for back wages. \r\nBased on this \r\n  evidence, the Court of Appeals ignored the directive that it must affirm the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding of punitive damages if any evidence reasonably supports \r\n  the judgeâ€™s factual findings.Â  An award of punitive damages is left almost entirely \r\n  to the discretion of the jury and trial judge.Â  Charles v. Texas Co., \r\n  199 S.C. 156, 18 S.E.2d 719 (1942).Â  The rationale for vesting discretion in \r\n  the trial court was expressed in Lucht v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, 138, \r\n  221 S.E.2d 854, 860 (1976):Â  \r\n\r\nThe fact [the \r\n  trial judge] heard the evidence and was more familiar than \r\n  we with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial gives [the trial judge], we think, a \r\n  better informed view than we have.Â  This is particularly true when the elements \r\n  of damage are intangibles and the appraisal depends somewhat on the observation \r\n  of the [witnesses] and evaluation of their testimony. \r\n\r\nFinally, we \r\n  conclude the trial court also conducted a post-trial review of the punitive \r\n  damages award using the factors outlined by this Court in Gamble v. Stevenson, \r\n  305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991) and properly set forth its findings on the \r\n  record.Â  In Gamble, the Court explained the trial court should consider:Â  \r\n  (1) the defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) \r\n  defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; \r\n  (5) likelihood that the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; \r\n  (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from \r\n  such conduct; (7) the defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and (8) other factors deemed \r\n  appropriate.Â  Id.Â  The trial court found particularly reprehensible Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  ouster of Petitioners from the management of the business and Respondentsâ€™ constant \r\n  failure to respond to Petitionersâ€™ requests for meetings and financial information.Â  \r\n  The trial court again noted Respondentsâ€™ misappropriation of the LLCâ€™s assets \r\n  and use of money for their own personal benefit. The trial courtâ€™s findings \r\n  are supported by evidence in the record.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in reversing the punitive damages award.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision and reinstate the trial judgeâ€™s ruling.\r\n REVERSED.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25922","title":"Henry McMaster v.

Nichols, of Bluestein &amp; Nichols, LLC, of \r\n  Columbia, for respondent Klein.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  We consolidated these three appeals to consider \r\n  the retroactive application of a lien on retirement benefits pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 8-1-115 (Supp. 2003) which applies to public officials convicted \r\n  of embezzling public funds.Â  The trial court found the amount of the lien was \r\n  limited to the amount of restitution previously ordered at criminal sentencing.Â  \r\n  The Attorney General appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondents Klein, Lewis, and Martin were each indicted by the state grand \r\n  jury on charges stemming from the embezzlement of funds from Sumter County School \r\n  District #17 over a ten-year period.Â  Each respondent pled guilty or was convicted \r\n  between 1999 and 2000, and each was ordered to pay restitution. \r\n  [1]   \r\nSubsequently, on April 10, 2001, the legislature enacted \r\n  Â§ 8-1-115 which â€œcreated a general lien upon any public retirement or pension \r\n  plan not governed by ERISA of any public officer, public employee, or any other \r\n  person who is convicted of an offense involving embezzlement or misappropriation \r\n  of public funds. . . .â€Â  In addition, the legislature provided that this lien \r\n  was to apply retroactively as well as prospectively.Â  2001 S.C. Act No. 16, \r\n  Â§ 6.Â  \r\nThe Attorney General then commenced these actions against respondents seeking \r\n  to enforce liens pursuant to Â§ 8-1-115.Â  In each case, the Attorney General \r\n  sought a lien in an amount exceeding the amount of restitution previously ordered.Â  \r\n  The trial court held the lien created by Â§ 8-1-115 is a criminal sanction intended \r\n  to secure the payment of restitution; the amount of the lien is limited to the \r\n  outstanding amount of restitution ordered as a part of sentencing; and the lien \r\n  cannot be foreclosed until the defendant has defaulted on his restitution payments.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs the amount of the lien limited to the amount of restitution ordered as part \r\n  of criminal sentencing?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Statutory construction\r\nSection 8-1-115 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A) There is hereby created a general lien upon any public retirement or pension \r\n  plan not governed by ERISA of any public officer, public employee, or any other \r\n  person who is convicted of an offense involving embezzlement or misappropriation \r\n  of public funds or public property to the private use of himself or any other \r\n  person, to the extent of the total loss, damage, and expense to the State, \r\n  or to a county or municipality, or to any agency or political subdivision of \r\n  the State, or to any state, county or municipal agency, any college or university, \r\n  or to any school, special or public service district within the State, that \r\n  is authorized by law to perform a governmental function or provide a governmental \r\n  service.\r\n(B)(1) The presiding judge before whom any public officer, employee, \r\n  or any other person is convicted of an offense described in subsection (A) must \r\n  send to the Attorney General and the appropriate retirement or pension plan \r\n  system a notice of the lien showing the name of the person convicted \r\n  whose retirement or pension plan is subject to the lien created by subsection \r\n  (A) and the date of the conviction, which is the date upon which the lien attaches. \r\n  The presiding judge must set the lien at the time of conviction and the presiding \r\n  judgeâ€™s notice of lien must state the amount of the lien.\r\n(2)(a) Within ten days of the date of conviction, the convicted personâ€™s \r\n  spouse or representative of the convicted personâ€™s minor children may file a \r\n  petition with the presiding judge requesting the judge to dissolve the lien, \r\n  in whole or in part, in favor of the spouse or minor children because the spouse \r\n  or minor children would suffer extreme financial hardship if the lien were to \r\n  attach. . . . .\r\n(C) In addition to any other sentence imposed upon a person \r\n  convicted of an offense described in subsection (A) and taking into account \r\n  the petition process set forth in subsection (B), the presiding judge may \r\n  require full restitution of all public funds embezzled or misappropriated \r\n  and full payment for the conversion, use, and value of public property appropriated \r\n  to private use and may provide for an indeterminate sentence of incarceration \r\n  or probation, or both, until restitution in full has been made.\r\n(D) The Attorney General is charged with an affirmative duty \r\n  to recover public funds and property embezzled or converted to private use, \r\n  or the value thereof, and he or his designee may bring an action to enforce \r\n  the lien created by this section at any time up to the death of a person \r\n  whose retirement or pension plan is subject to the lien created by subsection \r\n  (A).\r\n(E) The Attorney General or his designee shall file a satisfaction \r\n  and discharge of the lien created by this section after restitution has \r\n  been made by payment of the amount of the lien in full or after the death \r\n  of the person whose retirement or pension plan is subject to the lien created \r\n  by subsection (A).Â  If the beneficiary of the person whose retirement or pension \r\n  plan is subject to the lien created by subsection (A) was, himself, convicted \r\n  of the same offense involving the embezzlement or misappropriation of public \r\n  funds or public property for which the lien was created, the lien must continue \r\n  until restitution has been made or until the death of the beneficiary.\r\n(F) The lien created by this section and the action to enforce the \r\n  lien are cumulative and in addition to all other remedies provided by \r\n  law.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The legislation enacting this section \r\n  further provides:\r\n\r\nThis act is intended to create remedies to more efficiently recover restitution \r\n  due to state and local governmental entities in cases involving embezzlement \r\n  or misappropriation of public funds or public property to the private use of \r\n  a public officer or employee, or any other person. As such, it is remedial \r\n  legislation intended to be retroactive as well as prospective in its application, \r\n  so as to attach the general lien created by Section 8-1-115(A) to any public \r\n  retirement or pension plan not governed by ERISA of any public officer, public \r\n  employee, or any other person who has been convicted of an offense described \r\n  in Section 8-1-115(A). In cases where a living person was convicted of an offense \r\n  described in Section 8-1-115(A) before the effective date of this act, the lien \r\n  attaches to their public retirement or pension plan not governed by ERISA immediately \r\n  upon approval of this act by the Governor. In cases concluded before the effective \r\n  date of this act the Attorney General or his designee may send the \r\n  notice of lien required by Section 8-1-115(B) to the appropriate retirement \r\n  or pension plan system instead of the presiding judge. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  2001 S.C. Act No. 16, Â§ 6.\r\nUnder a plain reading of the statute, subsection (A) creates a lien \r\n  for the total amount of the loss to the government entity.Â  In cases concluded \r\n  after the statuteâ€™s effective date, the lien attaches under subsection (B) at \r\n  the time of conviction and the presiding judge must send a notice of lien to \r\n  the Attorney General and the retirement system stating the amount.Â  If the case \r\n  was concluded before the statuteâ€™s enactment and the defendant is still \r\n  living, the lien is deemed to have attached April 10, 2001, the effective date \r\n  of the statute.Â  The Attorney General, instead of the presiding judge, then \r\n  sends the notice of lien to the retirement system.Â  \r\nUnder subsection (C), the trial judge may order, in addition to any \r\n  other sentence, â€œfull restitution . . . and full payment . . . and \r\n  . . . an indeterminate sentence of incarceration or probation, or both, until \r\n  restitution in full has been made.â€Â  \r\nSubsection (D) authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action \r\n  to enforce the lien at any time before the defendantâ€™s death.Â  The lien is discharged \r\n  â€œafter restitution has been made by payment of the amount of the lien in full.â€ [2] Â  \r\nAct No. 16 expressly \r\n  provides that the statute is â€œintended to create remedies to more efficiently \r\n  recover restitution due to state and local governmental entities.â€Â  It is â€œremedial \r\n  legislationâ€ that applies retroactively â€œso as to attach the general lien created \r\n  by Section 8-1-115(A).â€Â  Notably, subsection (C), which provides for restitution \r\n  enforceable by incarceration, is not retroactive.\r\nThe legislature clearly expressed its intent that the statute, at \r\n  least the provisions regarding a lien, be construed as â€œremedial.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  Subsection (D) charges the Attorney General with â€œan affirmative dutyâ€ \r\n  to recover funds, including â€œbringing an action to enforce the lien created \r\n  by subsection (A).â€Â  A lien is a well-established civil remedy -- it attaches \r\n  to property and imposes no personal liability.Â  See W.M. Kirkland, \r\n  Inc. v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., 264 S.C. 573, 216 S.E. 2d 518 (1975); \r\n  Williams v. Pennsylvania Natâ€™l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 246 S.C. 396, 143 \r\n  S.E.2d 797 (1965); Sexton v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., 242 S.C. 182, \r\n  130 S.E.2d 475 (1963) (distinguishing imposition of lien and personal liability); \r\n  see also Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) (defining a \r\n  lien as a legal right or interest that a creditor has in anotherâ€™s property).Â  \r\n  The trial courtâ€™s conclusion that the language of subsection (A) on its face \r\n  creates a lien as â€œpart of the defendantâ€™s criminal sentenceâ€ is therefore incorrect.\r\nFurther, a reading \r\n  of the statute as a whole does not support the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  the legislature intended the lien simply to secure the criminal sanction of \r\n  restitution.Â  Contrary to the trial courtâ€™s analysis, there is nothing in the \r\n  statute limiting the lien to the amount of restitution ordered.Â  Subsection \r\n  (A) expressly states that the lien is for the total amount of loss to the government \r\n  entity.Â  The only provision limiting the amount of the lien is subsection (B)(2) \r\n  which allows a reduction for familial hardship.\r\nSubsection (E) expressly \r\n  provides for satisfaction of the lien â€œafter restitution has been made by \r\n  payment of the amount of the lien in full.â€Â  The trial court incorrectly \r\n  read subsection (E) to impose a limit on the amount of the lien. \r\n  [4] \r\nIn sum, a plain reading \r\n  of the statute indicates the legislatureâ€™s intent that the lien imposed under \r\n  subsection (A) is a civil sanction and not a criminal penalty, and the amount \r\n  of the lien is not limited to the amount of restitution.\r\n2.Â  \r\n  Double jeopardy and ex post facto\r\nThe trial court concluded that \r\n  to allow a lien in an amount greater than the amount of restitution subsequent \r\n  to the criminal conviction would violate double jeopardy and ex post facto provisions \r\n  of the federal constitution.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent criminal punishment \r\n  for the same offense.Â  This provision does not apply to a subsequent civil sanction.Â  \r\n  United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 273 (1996); In re:Â  Matthews, \r\n  345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001).Â  Whether a particular punishment is criminal \r\n  or civil is initially a matter of statutory construction.Â  Hudson v. United \r\n  States, 522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997); State v. Price, 333 S.C. 267, 510 \r\n  S.E.2d 215 (1998).Â  The court must first ascertain whether the legislature intended \r\n  to establish a civil sanction.Â  Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001).Â  \r\n  The legislatureâ€™s manifest intent will be rejected only where the challenging \r\n  party provides the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in \r\n  either purpose or effect as to negate the Stateâ€™s intention.Â  Id. \r\nThe same analysis applies to determine if a subsequent punishment violates \r\n  the Ex Post Facto Clause.Â  If the subsequent punishment is civil only, it does \r\n  not violate either constitutional protection.Â  Id.; see also In re: \r\n  Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002) (statute \r\n  must be criminal or penal in purpose or nature to offend ex post facto laws); \r\n  Callahan v. Callahan, 36 S.C. 454, 15 S.E. 727 (1892) (ex post facto \r\n  laws relate to criminal and penal proceedings, which impose punishment and forfeiture, \r\n  and not to civil proceedings which affect private rights retrospectively).\r\nAs discussed above, the language of the statute indicates the lien is a civil \r\n  sanction.Â  We will not reject the legislatureâ€™s manifest intent to impose a \r\n  civil sanction unless there is the â€œclearest proofâ€ that the statutory scheme \r\n  is so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the Stateâ€™s intention.Â  \r\n  Seling v. Young, supra.Â  Under this second prong, if the sanction \r\n  is actually a criminal punishment, double jeopardy and ex post facto provisions \r\n  apply. \r\nThe United States Supreme Court addressed \r\n  the issue of a subsequent sanction in Ursery v. United States, 518 U.S. \r\n  267 (1996), and adhered to precedent holding that civil forfeitures are not \r\n  punitive for double jeopardy purposes.Â  See United States v. One Assortment \r\n  of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354 (1984); One Lot Emerald Cut Stones \r\n  v. United States, 409 U.S. 232 (1972); Various Items of Personal Property \r\n  v. United States, 282 U.S. 577 (1931).Â  The Court reiterated in Ursery \r\n  several points pertinent to this prong of the double jeopardy analysis:Â  civil \r\n  forfeitures are in rem proceedings and, as such, are distinguishable \r\n  from fines which are in personam; actions in rem have traditionally \r\n  been viewed as civil proceedings; and civil forfeitures serve important nonpunitive \r\n  goals.Â  These same factors apply to the case at hand and support the conclusion \r\n  that the lien created by Â§ 8-1-115(A) is a civil sanction not subject to double \r\n  jeopardy or ex post facto prohibitions.\r\nFirst, it is well-settled that a proceeding to enforce a statutory \r\n  lien is in rem and not in personam.Â  See Beatty v. Wittemkamp, \r\n  171 S.C. 326, 172 S.E. 122 (1933); Tolbert v. Buick Car, 142 S.C. \r\n  362, 140 S.E. 693 (1927). [5] Â  \r\n  Liens, like civil forfeitures, are traditionally civil remedies.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 5-7-300 (tax lien); 5-27-340 (assessment lien); 6-21-330 (bondholders \r\n  lien); 12-49-10 (tax lien); 15-19-240 (attachment lien); 15-35-810 (judgment \r\n  lien).Â  The fact that the lien is tied to criminal activity does not render \r\n  the statute punitive.Â  Ursery, 518 U.S. at 267.Â  Finally, as with civil \r\n  forfeitures, the lien here serves an important nonpunitive goal:Â  the recovery \r\n  of public funds.\r\nWe find the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Ursery \r\n  dispositive here and conclude there is not the â€œclearest proofâ€ that the legislature \r\n  intended to impose a criminal sanction contrary to the statuteâ€™s expressed intent.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, neither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor the Ex Post Facto Clause \r\n  prohibits the subsequent imposition of a lien for the total amount of the loss. \r\n\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s holding that the amount of the lien created by S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â­Â§ 8-1-115 is limited to the amount of restitution ordered at the defendantâ€™s \r\n  prior criminal sentencing.\r\nThe General Assembly created this new remedy as an additional means \r\n  to collect restitution in a criminal matter involving embezzlement or misappropriation \r\n  of public funds or public property.Â  2001 Act No. 16, Â§ 6.Â  In situations where \r\n  the criminal case is already concluded, the Legislature provided only for the \r\n  giving notice of the lien by the Attorney General or his designee.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The Act contains no provisions for relitigating the amount of restitution in \r\n  such a case, and I would not imply one.\r\nIn my opinion, nothing \r\n  in the text of the statute itself supports the conclusion that the amount of \r\n  restitution can be increased.Â  I read subsection (A) to limit the amount of \r\n  the lien to that part of the restitution award attributable to the governmental \r\n  entityâ€™s loss, thus providing for situations where the restitution award includes \r\n  repayment attributable to other losses.Â  Since a restitution award may be only \r\n  partially subject to the lien, subsection (B) requires the judge to specify \r\n  the amount subject to this remedy.Â  Further, subsection (C) simply gives the \r\n  trial judge discretion to set the restitution at less than the full amount due.Â  \r\n  Finally, section (F) merely makes explicit the judicial systemâ€™s authority to \r\n  enforce restitution through traditional means, such as a probation revocation \r\n  proceeding, and provides that such a revocation proceeding does not preclude \r\n  an action to enforce the lien.\r\nI do not believe the lien statute permits the Attorney General to \r\n  seek an increase in the restitution awarded in a case where, as in these cases, \r\n  the criminal proceedings were concluded prior to the statuteâ€™s effective date.Â  \r\n  I would affirm.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Respondent \r\n    Klein pled guilty on June 1, 1999, to conspiracy to commit embezzlement and \r\n    ten counts of embezzlement.Â  As part of his sentence, he was ordered to pay \r\n    restitution in the amount of $180,000.Â  Respondent Lewis pled guilty on May \r\n    15, 2000, to criminal conspiracy, misconduct in office, and receiving stolen \r\n    goods.Â  As part ofÂ  his sentence, he was ordered to pay restitution in the \r\n    amount of $45,000.Â  Respondent Martin was convicted on July 20, 2000, of criminal \r\n    conspiracy, misconduct in office, and receiving stolen goods.Â  As part of \r\n    his sentence, he was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $50,000. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] If \r\n    the defendant dies before the lien is enforced, the lien is discharged unless \r\n    the beneficiary was himself convicted of the same offense. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] A \r\n    statute may be in part remedial and in part penal.Â  Francis v. Mauldin, \r\n    215 S.C. 374, 55 S.E.2d 337 (1949).Â  Subsection (C), which imposes restitution \r\n    enforceable by incarceration, is penal and is not retroactive. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The \r\n    word â€œrestitutionâ€ is used in two different contexts in this statute. In subsection \r\n    (C), â€œrestitutionâ€ is a criminal penalty enforceable by incarceration; however, \r\n    the word is also used in the more general sense of â€œrestorationâ€ or â€œcompensationâ€ \r\n    as in subsection (E). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Although \r\n    the trial judge who sentences the defendant sends the notice of lien, the \r\n    lien is enforced by an action brought by the Attorney General.Â  Â§ 8-1-115(D).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25923","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of \r\n  Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: Â Appellant was convicted of criminal domestic violence \r\n  of a high and aggravate nature (CDVHAN) and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.Â  \r\n  We certified the case for review under Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was indicted for CDVHAN.Â  The aggravating circumstances alleged were \r\n  infliction of serious bodily injury, difference in gender, great disparity in \r\n  the ages or physical conditions of the parties, and purposeful infliction of \r\n  shame and disgrace.\r\nPrior to voir dire, Appellant moved the circuit court \r\n  to strike â€œpurposeful infliction of shame and disgrace,â€ claiming the phrase \r\n  was unconstitutionally vague in that it failed to provide notice of the particular \r\n  conduct to be avoided in order to stay within the bounds of the law.Â  The court \r\n  denied the motion.Â  \r\nThe case went to trial, and Appellant was convicted.Â  Before sentencing, \r\n  Appellant moved for a new trial, again claiming vagueness.Â  The court denied \r\n  this motion as well.Â Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, Appellant claims he is entitled to a new trial because \r\n  there is a reasonable doubt that he would have been convicted of CDVHAN [1]  had the jury not been charged as to â€œpurposeful \r\n  infliction of shame and disgrace.â€Â  In support of his vagueness claim, Appellant \r\n  asserts â€œshameâ€ and â€œdisgraceâ€ lack clear meaning.Â  In addition, Appellant asserts \r\n  there is no standard by which to determine the existence of a purposeful infliction.Â  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether â€œpurposeful infliction of shame and disgraceâ€ is unconstitutionally \r\n  vague.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA person is guilty of CDVHAN if he or she commits criminal domestic \r\n  violence [2]  and â€œthe elements \r\n  of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature [ABHAN] are present.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-65 (2003). [3] Â  ABHAN is â€œan unlawful act of violent injuryâ€ accompanied by \r\n  a circumstance of aggravation.Â  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 580, 564 \r\n  S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002).Â  Circumstances of aggravation include: use of a deadly \r\n  weapon; intent to commit a felony; infliction of serious bodily injury; great \r\n  disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties; difference in gender; \r\n  purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace; taking indecent liberties or familiarities \r\n  with a female; and resistance to lawful authority.Â  Primus, 349 S.C. \r\n  at 580-81, 564 S.E.2d at 105-06.\r\nRegarding vagueness, the due-process [4]  standard is whether the statute \r\n  â€œeither forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of \r\n  common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its \r\n  application.â€Â  Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. \r\n  126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322, 328 (1926); see also State v. Michau, \r\n  355 S.C. 73, 75-78, 583 S.E.2d 756, 758-59 (2003) (applying the principle). \r\n\r\nWe disagree with Appellant that the CDVHAN statute violates due process.Â  \r\n  â€œShameâ€ and â€œdisgraceâ€ are common terms, so a person of common intelligence \r\n  need not guess at the meanings.Â  Likewise, a person of common intelligence understands \r\n  what â€œpurposeful inflictionâ€ means.Â  Consequently, â€œpurposeful infliction of \r\n  shame and disgraceâ€ does not offend due process.Â  Appellantâ€™s conviction is \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  On appeal Appellant does not deny that criminal \r\n    domestic violence occurred.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Criminal domestic violence is â€œcaus[ing] physical \r\n    harm or injury to a personâ€™s own household memberâ€ or â€œoffer[ing] or attempt[ing] \r\n    to cause physical harm or injury to a personâ€™s own household member with apparent \r\n    present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.â€Â  \r\n    S.C.

Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and \r\n  promptness in representing client); Rule 1.5 (when lawyer has not regularly \r\n  represented client, fee shall be communicated to client, preferably in writing); \r\n  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold client property in her possession separate from \r\n  lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite \r\n  litigation consistent with interests of the client); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects \r\n  adversely on lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other \r\n  respects); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent \r\n  acknowledges that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the \r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule \r\n  7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the \r\n  courts or legal profession into disrepute), and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground \r\n  for discipline for lawyer to violate oath of office).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly \r\n  reprimand respondent for her misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

This result was consistent with our rule at the time that left it up to each court to determine if a pro hac vice admission would be allowed. \r\n \r\n Since that time, this Court has amended Rule 404, SCACR, to place limits on pro hac vice admissions and to establish a uniform procedure for seeking pro hac vice admissions to include a standardized application form.

[2] Â  The Lifetime Agreement also provided that if the property \r\n  were ever sold, the proceeds from the sale would be divided equally between \r\n  Son and his half-sister, Nicki.\r\nMother testified that she has not always had a good relationship with Son.Â  \r\n  Nevertheless, Mother testified that because she felt he â€œhad a change of personality,â€ \r\n  she decided to give him a limited power of attorney prior to the execution of \r\n  the deed, in case she had to be hospitalized.Â  Mother and Son also opened a \r\n  joint checking account with a balance in excess of $14,000 to be used in the \r\n  event Mother was incapable of paying her bills.Â  Son testified that he never \r\n  withdrew funds from the account.Â  \r\nAt \r\n  some point, however, Mother decided that â€œthe situation was not working outâ€ \r\n  and revoked Sonâ€™s limited power of attorney. [3] Â  Apparently Mother believed Son \r\n  was not helping her as he promised.Â  Mother testified that (1) Son only paid \r\n  1/3 of the property taxes on the property and that she had to pay the remaining \r\n  2/3 of the amount owed; (2) she had to hire someone to take care of the yard; \r\n  (3) she paid for the insurance on the property, not Son; and (4) she had to \r\n  pay someone to cut down two dead trees in the yard after Son refused to cut \r\n  them down.Â  Son disputes this testimony.Â  \r\nSon \r\n  testified that in addition to paying the insurance and taxes on the house, he \r\n  performed various tasks in the home, such as finding someone to fix the toilet.Â  \r\n  He also testified that he drove Mother to the grocery store and to the doctorâ€™s \r\n  office.Â  Mother claimed that she had to rely on Son for transportation because \r\n  Son never returned her car after he took it to have the brakes checked.Â  On \r\n  the contrary, Son testified that Mother thought there was a problem with the \r\n  brakes, so he drove it to his house in order to test them but did not find anything \r\n  wrong with them.Â  Son also testified that he does not believe that Mother is \r\n  capable of driving safely.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDespite their rocky relationship, Mother decided to convey her home to Son.Â  \r\n  She later claimed that the only reason why she did so is because he convinced \r\n  her that if she did not take the property out of her name, Medicaid would seize \r\n  it if she failed to pay her medical expenses.Â  Son claims that his half-sister \r\n  gave Mother this idea and that he had nothing to do with the decision to take \r\n  the property out of Motherâ€™s name.Â  Â Son testified that he gave Mother the option \r\n  to convey the property to him or to his half-sister, but he did not care who \r\n  received title.Â  Ultimately, Mother chose to give the property to Son.\r\nAfter preparing the deed, [4]  \r\n  Son drove Mother to a pawnshop, where Mother signed the deed and the Lifetime \r\n  Agreement.Â  Mother remembered executing the deed and the Lifetime Agreement \r\n  and testified that she knew what she was doing when she signed the deed.Â  \r\nApproximately a year-and-a-half later, Son executed and delivered a document \r\n  to Mother purporting to leave the home to her when he died. Son drafted this \r\n  document after Mother expressed concerns about Sonâ€™s wife, rather than Motherâ€™s \r\n  daughter, inheriting an interest in the property.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter a confrontation in 2001, Mother asked Son to leave her home.Â  Later, \r\n  Mother changed the locks to the house, preventing Son from entering the home.Â  \r\n  Mother also requested that Son re-convey the title to the property to her.Â  \r\n  Son refused and Mother filed this action.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe master-in-equity declared Son the owner of the property in fee simple absolute.Â  \r\n  The master found there was â€œno evidence that the deed was the result of duress \r\n  or coercion, or that [Son] exerted undue influence over [Mother] in the execution \r\n  or procurement of the deed.â€Â  Further, the master found that Mother â€œfully appreciated \r\n  the nature of the conveyance and its legal effect,â€ and she â€œrecalled the location \r\n  and circumstances of its execution, as well as the names of the witnesses.â€Â  \r\n  Therefore, the master determined that Mother failed to establish that the deed \r\n  should be set aside.Â  Mother appealed the masterâ€™s decision, and pursuant to \r\n  Rule 204(b), SCACR, this Court certified the case from the court of appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nMother raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in refusing to set aside the deed for undue influence or \r\n  failure of consideration?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in refusing to construe the transactions involved as to creating \r\n  a life estate in Mother or imposing a trust for the benefit of Mother?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Son raised the following issue for review:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.Â Â Â Â \r\n         Did the master err in not barring Motherâ€™s claims under the statute \r\n  of limitations?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of ReviewÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nâ€œAn action to rescind a contract lies in equity.â€Â  Gibbs v. G.K.H., Inc., \r\n  311 S.C. 103, 105, 427 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  When reviewing an equitable \r\n  action, this Court may determine the facts in accordance with its own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, \r\n  111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997); Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\nI.Â  Setting Aside the DeedÂ Â Â Â  \r\nA.Â  Failure of ConsiderationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nMother argues that the deed conveying the house to Son should be set aside \r\n  because Son failed to take care of her according to the Lifetime Agreement, \r\n  which was incorporated into the deed to provide additional consideration.Â  We \r\n  hold that even if the Lifetime Agreement was properly incorporated into the \r\n  deed, the deed should not be set aside for failure of consideration. \r\nWe first determine whether the Lifetime Agreement was properly incorporated \r\n  into the deed.Â  As a general rule, when a deed is unambiguous on its face, we \r\n  look only to the four corners of the document.Â  See Klutts Resort Realty \r\n  Inc. v. Downâ€™round Dev. Corp., 268 S.C. 80, 89, 23 S.E.2d 20, 25 (1977) \r\n  (holding that a court will not examine extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract \r\n  absent an ambiguity).Â  If the vital terms of a contract are ambiguous, then, \r\n  in an effort to determine the intent of the parties, the court may consider \r\n  probative, extrinsic evidence.Â  South Carolina Dept. of Nat. Resources v. \r\n  Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 303 (2001).Â  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the stated consideration is â€œfive dollars and other \r\n  love and consideration,â€ which we find to be ambiguous.Â  In addition, the \r\n  Lifetime Agreement is probative of the partiesâ€™ intent because the Lifetime \r\n  Agreement and the deed were executed at the same time.Â  This Court has held \r\n  that when multiple documents are executed contemporaneously in the course of \r\n  and as a part of the same transaction, the Court may consider and construe the \r\n  instruments together in order to ascertain the intention of the parties and \r\n  the terms of the agreement.Â  CafÃ© Associates, Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 \r\n  S.C. 6, 10, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991); Klutts, 268 S.C. at \r\n  89, 232 S.E.2d at 25.Â  Because the Lifetime Agreement and the deed were executed \r\n  contemporaneously, and the Lifetime Agreement helps to explain the ambiguous \r\n  phrase in the deed which recites consideration as:Â  â€œfive dollars and other \r\n  love and consideration,â€ we find that the Lifetime Agreement was incorporated \r\n  into the deed as consideration for conveyance.\r\nHaving determined that the Lifetime Agreement provides additional â€œother considerationâ€ \r\n  under the deed, we next decide whether the consideration of the agreement failed \r\n  warranting this Court setting the deed aside.Â  When deciding whether there has \r\n  been a failure of consideration, this Court has held that â€œthe slightest consideration \r\n  is sufficient to support the most onerous obligationâ€¦.â€ First National Bank \r\n  of South Carolina v. Wade, 245 S.C. 426, 431, 141 S.E.2d 102, 104 (1965) \r\n  (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  Moreover, absent fraud and deception, \r\n  the Court will not â€œdeprive [the contract] of validity.â€Â  Id.Â  See \r\n  also All v. Prillaman, 200 S.C. 279, 292, 20 S.E.2d 741, 747 (1942) \r\n  (holding that setting aside a deed is not the proper remedy for failure of consideration \r\n  absent fraud or deceit). [5] \r\nWe find that the consideration did not fail, and that even if it had, the proper \r\n  remedy would not be to set the deed aside.Â  The agreement provided that Son \r\n  would â€œmaintain and care forâ€ Motherâ€™s property, as well as, â€œat a time determined \r\n  by [Mother] â€¦ care for [Motherâ€™s] needs as necessary.â€Â  We find that Son cared \r\n  for Mother and her property.Â  Although Mother was not satisfied with the amount \r\n  of care Son provided, we do not find that he failed to act in accordance with \r\n  the terms of the Lifetime Agreement.Â  Mother does not deny that Son was her \r\n  main source of transportation.Â  In addition, some time after the parties signed \r\n  the Lifetime Agreement, Mother changed the locks to her home, preventing Son \r\n  from caring for her in her home.Â  We have held that a party who prevents a condition \r\n  of a contract cannot seek relief by relying on the other partyâ€™s resulting nonperformance.Â  \r\n  Champion v. Whaley, 280 S.C. 116, 311 S.E.2d 404 (1984).\r\nTherefore, we hold that Motherâ€™s cause of action for failure of consideration \r\n  is without merit and we affirm the masterâ€™s decision on that issue.\r\n &nbsp;B.Â  Undue Influence\r\nIn \r\n  the alternative, Mother argues that because she and Son were in a confidential \r\n  relationship, Son had the burden of proving that he did not unduly influence \r\n  her, and that he failed to meet that burden.Â  We agree that Mother and Son shared \r\n  a confidential relationship, but we do not find that Son failed to meet his \r\n  burden.Â  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Confidential Relationship\r\nTo show a â€œconfidential relationshipâ€ existed between the grantor and grantee, \r\n  the grantor must present adequate evidence that she has placed her â€œtrust and \r\n  confidence in the grantee, and the grantee has exerted dominion over the grantor.â€Â  \r\n  Brooks v. Kay, 339 S.C. 479, 489, 530 S.E.2d 120, 125 (2000); Middleton \r\n  v. Middleton, 300 S.C. 402, 404, 388 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1990); Hudson v. \r\n  Leopold, 288 S.C. 194, 196, 341 S.E.2d 137, 138 (1986).Â  Once a contestant \r\n  has proven a confidential relationship existed at the time of conveyance, the \r\n  burden shifts to the grantee to prove that the contestantâ€™s conveyance was not \r\n  the product of undue influence.Â  Brooks, 339 S.C. at 489, 530 S.E.2d \r\n  at 125.\r\nTo begin, we find that \r\n  Mother and Son were in a confidential relationship at the time of conveyance.Â  \r\n  First, the parties are related.Â  Although this Court has declined to hold that \r\n  a familial relationship, alone, is sufficient evidence of a confidential relationship, [6]  a familial relationship certainly supports \r\n  an argument that a confidential relationship exists.Â  Second, Mother gave Son \r\n  a limited power of attorney, suggesting that she placed some trust and confidence \r\n  in him to make decisions for her in case she had to be hospitalized.Â  Third, \r\n  after the deed was recorded, Mother and Son opened a joint bank account consisting \r\n  entirely of Motherâ€™s money.Â  This account was created by Mother for Son to use \r\n  for her benefit upon her inability to access that money on her own.Â  Fourth, \r\n  Son prepared all of the documents in question, including the deed and the Lifetime \r\n  Agreement.Â  Moreover, Mother signed those documents without first consulting \r\n  an attorney, trusting that Son had drafted them according to her wishes.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we hold that Mother and Son were in a confidential relationship.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Undue InfluenceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe now turn to whether Son satisfied his burden to prove that he did not unduly \r\n  influence Mother to convey him the property.Â  We recently described the nature \r\n  of undue influence:\r\n\r\nthe influence must be the kind of mental coercion which destroys the free agency \r\n  of the creator and constrains him to do things which are against his free will, \r\n  and that he would not have done if he had been left to his own judgment and \r\n  volition. [7] \r\n\r\nRussell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 333 \r\n  (2003).Â  The influence must be of such a degree that it prevents the grantorâ€™s \r\n  exercise of judgment and free choice. Id.Â  Moreover, a showing of general \r\n  influence is not tantamount to undue influence.Â  Calhoun v. Calhoun, \r\n  277 S.C. 527, 531, 290 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1982).Â  For this Court to void a conveyance \r\n  of land, a contestant must show that the undue influence was brought directly \r\n  to bear upon the conveyance.Â  Russell, 353 S.C. at 219, 578 S.E.2d at \r\n  335.Â  \r\nWe find that Motherâ€™s free will was never overcome.Â  \r\n  At trial, the master found that Mother was â€œvery clear about what she was doing,â€ \r\n  â€œfully appreciated the nature of the conveyance and its legal effect,â€ and â€œrecalled \r\n  the location and circumstances of its execution, as well as the names of the \r\n  witnesses.â€Â  In addition, the record indicates that Mother is a strong-willed \r\n  woman who, by her own motivation, decided to convey the property to Son in an \r\n  attempt to prevent a potential creditor from seizing her property.Â  \r\nAlthough it is questionable whether \r\n  Mother made a good decision when she conveyed her property to Son, we find the \r\n  decision was one of her own free will.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Son proved \r\n  that he did not unduly influence Mother.\r\nII.Â  Life Estate/Trust\r\nMother argues that if this Court \r\n  does not set aside the deed, it should hold that Mother is the beneficiary of \r\n  a trust or that she holds a life estate in the property in question, with a \r\n  remainder to her two children.Â  We disagree.\r\nMother raised this issue for the \r\n  first time in a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion.Â  We hold that this issue is not preserved \r\n  for review.Â  See, e.g., Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 44, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d 830, 833 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding that an issue first raised in a post-trial \r\n  motion is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nIII.Â  Statute of Limitations\r\nSon argues Motherâ€™s claims of \r\n  undue influence and failure of consideration are barred by the statute of limitations \r\n  set forth in South Carolina Code Ann. 15-3-530(1) and (7) (Supp. 2003).Â  We \r\n  hold that section 15-3-530 does not bar these claims. \r\nWe first turn to Motherâ€™s undue \r\n  influence cause of action.Â  Son argues that section 15-3-530(7), which applies \r\n  to actions for fraud and those actions considered fraud by a court of chancery \r\n  before 1870, serves to bar Motherâ€™s undue influence claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, Mother did not plead or \r\n  prove the existence of fraud in this case; therefore, we hold section 15-3-530(7) \r\n  does not apply.Â  Second, a claim alleging undue influence is an equitable action.Â  \r\n  Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 284, 363 S.E.2d 897, 902 (1987).Â  Further, \r\n  â€œ[a]n action to rescind a contract lies in equity.â€Â  Gibbs v. G.K.H., Inc., \r\n  311 S.C. 103, 105, 427 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  This Court has held \r\n  that the statute of limitations does not apply to actions in equity.Â  See \r\n  Anderson v. Purvis, 211 S.C. 255, 44 S.E.2d 611 (1947); Anderson v. Purvis, \r\n  220 S.C. 259, 67 S.E.2d 80 (1951) (holding that the Courtâ€™s power to do equity \r\n  transcends the limitations of the statute of limitations).Â  Because Motherâ€™s \r\n  undue influence claim is an action in equity, we hold that the statute of limitations \r\n  is inapplicable.\r\nWe next turn to Motherâ€™s failure \r\n  of consideration cause of action. \r\n  [8]  Section 15-3-530(1) places a three-year statute of limitation on contract \r\n  actions; however, the discovery rule applies to that section.Â  Santee Portland \r\n  Cement Co. v. Daniel Intâ€™l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 271, 384 S.E.2d 693, 694 \r\n  (1989), overruled on other grounds Atlas Food Sys. and Servs. v. Crane \r\n  Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995).Â  \r\n  The discovery rule provides that the statute of limitations does not begin to \r\n  run until a person using reasonable diligence knew or should have known the \r\n  existence of the claim. Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 \r\n  S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996); Snell v.

Clark, Sr. (Clark) brought this \r\n  wrongful death action as the personal representative of the estate of his daughter, \r\n  Amy Danielle Clark (decedent).Â Â  Clarkâ€™s action against the Department and Charles \r\n  Johnson [1]  arises from a fatal \r\n  automobile accident, which occurred on April 5, 1997.Â Â  The decedent was killed \r\n  when her vehicle was struck by Johnsonâ€™s vehicle as he was being pursued by \r\n  Trooper J.N. Bradley of the South Carolina Highway Patrol.Â Â  The jury returned \r\n  a $3.75 million verdict for Clark against both the Department and Johnson.Â  \r\n  The jury concluded Johnson was eighty percent at fault and the Department twenty \r\n  percent at fault.Â  The trial court reduced the Departmentâ€™s liability to $250,000, \r\n  the allowable amount under the Tort Claims Act at the time of the verdict. The \r\n  Department raises several issues on appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in concluding the trial court properly charged the jury on the standard of care owed by law enforcement \r\n  officers during police pursuits?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding there was sufficient evidence showing Trooper Bradley acted with gross negligence in \r\n  initiating and failing to terminate the pursuit?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the duty of the trooper to drive with \r\n  due regard for the safety of all persons is independent of the duty of the Department \r\n  to monitor the pursuit?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.\r\n         Did \r\n  the Court of Appeals err in holding the trial court properly denied the Departmentâ€™s \r\n  motions for judgment as a matter of law on the ground of discretionary immunity?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;V.\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in refusing to grant \r\n  a new trial absolute based on the amount of the juryâ€™s \r\n  verdict?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nI.\r\nThe Department contends the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in determining the trial court properly instructed the jury on the legal duty \r\n  owed by law enforcement officers with respect to police pursuits.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\nWe find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s instructions.Â  The \r\n  parties agreed the applicable standard of care is gross negligence. [2] Â  The trial court defined gross negligence as â€œthe failure to \r\n  exercise a slight degree of careâ€ and stated gross negligence could also â€œmean \r\n  when a person is so indifferent to the consequences of his conduct as not to \r\n  give slight care as to what he is doing.â€Â  The definition provided by the trial \r\n  court is consistent with South Carolina law.Â  See Faile v. South Carolina \r\n  Dept. of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 331-32, 566 S.E.2d 536, 544 (2002); \r\n  Hicks v. McCandlish, 221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1952).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe Department contends the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in concluding the trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict and \r\n  grant the Departmentâ€™s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) \r\n  on Clarkâ€™s claims that Trooper Bradley was grossly negligent in his decision-making.Â  \r\n  The Department argues there was no evidence to support a verdict that Trooper \r\n  Bradley was grossly negligent.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict and JNOV, a court \r\n  must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party.Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, \r\n  334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999).Â  The trial court should deny \r\n  the motion where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference \r\n  is in doubt.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d \r\n  281, 283 (2003).Â  This Court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed \r\n  verdict motion only where there is no evidence to support the ruling or where \r\n  the ruling is controlled by error of law.Â  Hinkle v. National Cas. Ins. Co., \r\n  354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court properly submitted the case to the jury to consider \r\n  whether Trooper Bradley was grossly negligent in initiating and failing to terminate \r\n  the pursuit.Â  Gross negligence is the â€œintentional conscious failure to do something \r\n  which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that \r\n  one ought not to do.â€Â  Jinks, 355 S.C. at 345, 585 S.E.2d at 283.Â  Gross \r\n  negligence is also the â€œfailure to exercise slight careâ€ and is â€œa relative \r\n  term and means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nThe evidence in this case could yield a finding of gross \r\n  negligence on the part of Trooper Bradley.Â Â  On April 5, 1997, at approximately \r\n  1:30 a.m., Trooper Bradley observed Johnson driving a van erratically and at \r\n  a speed of 57 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone.Â  In addition to driving erratically, \r\n  Johnson failed to use his turn signals.Â  Bradley testified he activated his \r\n  blue lights and siren and attempted to stop the van, but Johnson did not stop.Â  \r\n  Bradley called in the vanâ€™s license plate number and reported to dispatchers \r\n  he was pursuing the van.Â  \r\nDuring the pursuit, Johnson stopped the van in a gravel \r\n  parking lot.Â  Bradley exited his vehicle and approached the van.Â  As Bradley \r\n  neared the van, Johnson suddenly put the van in reverse and attempted to run \r\n  over Bradley.Â  Johnson sped off and the pursuit resumed.Â  Bradley observed Johnson \r\n  run off the left side of the road and spin around.Â  Bradley testified he radioed \r\n  in his belief Johnson was going to wreck.Â  \r\nTrooper Thomas Justice joined the pursuit and attempted \r\n  to slow the van by pulling in front of it.Â  Johnson drove around Justice and \r\n  Justice fell into position behind Bradley.Â  Justice, as the secondary officer \r\n  in the pursuit, took over most of the radio communications so Bradley could \r\n  focus on the pursuit. \r\nBradley continued the pursuit and dispatchers notified the \r\n  troopers the van had been reported stolen.Â  Bradley testified he observed light \r\n  traffic as they drove through a straight portion of the road.Â  Bradley attempted \r\n  to pass Johnson on the left in an attempt to get in front of the van in order \r\n  to slow its speed, but was unsuccessful when Johnson tried to run Bradley off \r\n  the road.Â  Johnson ran a red light at an intersection, narrowly avoiding colliding \r\n  with another car.Â  The troopers slowed and proceeded through the intersection.Â  \r\n\r\nJohnson encountered a pickup truck in his lane of \r\n  traffic approximately five or six miles before reaching the North Carolina border. \r\n  Johnson tried to pass the truck on the right using the emergency lane, but the \r\n  truck also pulled to the right.Â  Johnson immediately jerked the van to the left, \r\n  crossed the centerline, and collided head-on with Amy Clarkâ€™s vehicle.Â  The \r\n  van became airborne before crashing into the woods and catching fire.Â  \r\nSergeant John Vaughn testified he was the district supervisor \r\n  on call that night.Â  Vaughn inquired whether a supervisor was needed when he \r\n  heard Bradley advise dispatchers he was initiating a pursuit.Â  Vaughn could \r\n  not recall whether he had actually monitored any portion of the pursuit.Â  The \r\n  second-shift supervisor, Lonnie Plyler, did not monitor the pursuit because \r\n  he was handling the administration of a breathalyzer examination.Â  Plyler did \r\n  not know who supervised the third shift.Â  Plyler went to the scene of the accident \r\n  after Justice radioed for a supervisor.Â  \r\nSamuel Killman, Clarkâ€™s expert on high-speed pursuits, testified \r\n  the standard of care for an officer pursuing a suspect requires the officer \r\n  continuously evaluate the danger of the chase and weigh the danger of apprehending \r\n  the suspect against the danger the chase is creating.Â  Clarkâ€™s counsel asked \r\n  Killman if there was any point during the chase where he felt Bradley deviated \r\n  from the standard of care.Â  Killman testified he believed Bradley should have \r\n  terminated the pursuit because the longer the chase went on, the clearer it \r\n  became that Johnson was not going to stop.Â  Killman further testified that supervisors \r\n  are required to continually monitor pursuits.Â  \r\nGregory Smith, the Departmentâ€™s expert in police training \r\n  and pursuits testified, â€œthere is no national standard for standard of care.â€Â Â  \r\n  Smith testified the chase initiated by Bradley was warranted and should not \r\n  have been terminated by either Bradley or his supervisors.Â  Smith based his \r\n  testimony on the factors outlined in the Departmentâ€™s Vehicle and Foot Pursuit \r\n  Policy.\r\nThe Court of Appeals, construing the evidence in a light \r\n  most favorable to Clark, concluded the pursuit should have been called off after \r\n  it was (1) obvious Johnson was willing to do whatever it took to get away; and \r\n  (2) after Johnson attempted to run Bradley off the road and then narrowly missed \r\n  colliding with another vehicle at the intersection.Â Â  The Court of Appeals also \r\n  noted Johnson was within five or six miles of the North Carolina border at which \r\n  point South Carolina authorities would have been required to terminate the pursuit.Â  \r\n  Finally, the Court of Appeals concluded the â€œheightened dangerousness of the \r\n  pursuitâ€ was evidenced by evidence Bradley notified the dispatcher he believed \r\n  a crash was imminent.Â  Clark, 353 S.C. at 302, 578 S.E.2d at 22.\r\nFrom this testimony, \r\n  the Court of Appeals concluded there was some evidence from which a jury could \r\n  conclude Bradley was grossly negligent in failing to end the pursuit.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  Killman, an experienced law enforcement officer, testified the officer \r\n  should have discontinued the pursuit.Â  In addition, Bradley testified he did \r\n  not feel the van was going to stop and he realized the van was probably going \r\n  to make it to North Carolina where Bradley would be required to terminate the \r\n  pursuit.Â  Accordingly, the issue was properly submitted to the jury.\r\nIII. \r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  Department argues the Court of Appeals, in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of the Departmentâ€™s motion for JNOV, erred in finding the duty to monitor or \r\n  supervise the pursuit to be an independent duty.Â  The Department contends Clarkâ€™s \r\n  negligent supervision claim is entirely derivative of the claim Trooper Bradley \r\n  was grossly negligent in commencing the pursuit and failing to terminate the \r\n  pursuit before the accident occurred.Â  The Department contends because the jury \r\n  did not indicate Bradley breached his duty of care, the Department should not \r\n  be held liable for the derivative claim of failure to supervise. \r\nUnder the facts \r\n  of this case and given the evidence presented at trial, we conclude the Department \r\n  was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the failure to supervise \r\n  claim.Â  Jinks, 355 S.C. at 345, 585 S.E.2d at 283 (trial court should \r\n  deny the motion where either the evidence yields more than one inference or \r\n  its inference is in doubt).Â  The jury could have found the Department breached \r\n  a separate duty to monitor the pursuit and to provide its independent assessment \r\n  of its continued viability.Â  Based on the evidence presented, the jury could \r\n  have found the Department failed to exercise slight care or show any care in \r\n  monitoring the pursuit and the Departmentâ€™s gross negligence was a proximate \r\n  cause of the accident. \r\nIV.\r\nThe \r\n  Department contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding Trooper Bradleyâ€™s \r\n  conduct was not protected by discretionary immunity.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(5) (Supp. 2003) provides governmental entities are not \r\n  liable for losses resulting from â€œthe exercise of discretion or judgment by \r\n  the governmental entity or employee for the performance or failure to perform \r\n  any act or service which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental \r\n  entity or employee.â€Â  The burden of establishing an exception to the waiver \r\n  of immunity is on the governmental entity asserting the defense.Â  Niver v. \r\n  South Carolina Dept. of Hwy. &amp; Pub. Transp., 302 S.C. 461, 395 S.E.2d \r\n  728 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  To establish discretionary immunity, the governmental \r\n  entity must prove its employees, faced with alternatives, actually weighed competing \r\n  considerations and made a conscious choice.Â  Pike v. Dept. of Transp., \r\n  343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000).Â  The governmental entity must show that \r\n  in weighing the competing considerations and alternatives, it utilized accepted \r\n  professional standards appropriate to resolve the issue before them.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Mere room for discretion on the part of the entity is not sufficient to invoke \r\n  the discretionary immunity provision.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. \r\n  36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).Â  \r\nPolice officers \r\n  have a duty to apprehend those who violate the law and the decision to commence \r\n  or continue pursuit of a fleeing suspect is, by necessity, made rapidly.Â  However, \r\n  a police officerâ€™s paramount duty is to protect the public.Â  We acknowledge \r\n  circumstances exist when it is reasonable for a police officer to adopt a course \r\n  of conduct which causes a high risk of harm to the public.Â  Nevertheless, such \r\n  conduct is not justified if the public is subjected to unreasonable risks of \r\n  injury as the police carry out their duties.Â  We conclude that a law enforcement \r\n  officer is not immune from liability under Section 15-78-60(5) for the decision \r\n  on whether to begin or continue the immediate pursuit of a suspect. \r\n  [3]&nbsp;\r\n  \r\nV.\r\nThe \r\n  Department contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding a new trial absolute \r\n  was not warranted based on the $3.75 million verdict in favor of Clark.Â  \r\nThe Department \r\n  argues the verdict is grossly excessive and shockingly disproportionate to the \r\n  injuries therefore indicating the jury acted out of passion, caprice, prejudice, \r\n  or other considerations not founded in the evidence.Â  Specifically, the Department \r\n  argues the decedent had reached the age of majority and no longer resided with \r\n  her parents for whom she did not provide financial support.Â  The Department \r\n  argues the only damages recoverable would be for the loss of companionship, \r\n  grief, wounded feelings, and funeral expenses.\r\nIn Knoke \r\n  v. South Carolina Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, 478 S.E.2d \r\n  256 (1996), we concluded a wrongful death verdict of $3 million for the death \r\n  of a twelve-year-old child was not excessive and was necessary to compensate \r\n  the childâ€™s parents for intangible damages which, cannot be determined by any \r\n  fixed measure. See also Lucht v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, \r\n  221 S.E.2d 854 (1976) (losses to parents for the untimely death of a child are \r\n  intangibles, the values of which cannot be determined by any fixed yardstick).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, pecuniary loss is only one of six elements to be considered in \r\n  awarding damages in a wrongful death action.Â  See Self v. Goodrich, \r\n  300 S.C. 349, 387 S.E.2d 713, 714 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ decision upholding the juryâ€™s award of damages.\r\nFor \r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE \r\n  and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority, \r\n  but would adopt the decision of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.Â  See, \r\n  supra, n. 3; see also Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, \r\n  353 S.C. 291, 305-06, 578 S.E.2d 16, 23 &amp; nn. 26-28 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  I \r\n  believe the Court of Appeals properly recognized the dichotomy between planning \r\n  and operational acts in determining the application of discretionary immunity.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] Â Johnson is not a party to this \r\n    appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [2]  The Court of Appeals noted that \r\n    no issue was raised on appeal regarding the standard for culpability and therefore \r\n    becomes the law of the case.Â  Citing ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. \r\n    v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior \r\n  Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for The Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel. \r\nComing B. Gibbs, Jr., of Charleston, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  This attorney disciplinary matter is before \r\n  the Court on an Agreement for Discipline by Consent entered into by respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR, and on a Petition for Rule to Show Cause pursuant to Rule 5(b)(6), \r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nAGREEMENT FOR DISCIPLINE BY CONSENT\r\nIn the Agreement for Discipline by Consent, respondent admits misconduct \r\n  and consents to a public reprimand, definite suspension of no more than two \r\n  years, or an indefinite suspension as provided by Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the \r\n  practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are \r\n  as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 25, 2004, respondent was convicted of assault \r\n  and battery of a high an aggravated nature and sentenced to four years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended upon service of three years probation and submission to anger management \r\n  and additional counseling as needed.Â  The assault and battery occurred when \r\n  respondent struck his teenage son with his truck.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nIn the Agreement for Discipline by Consent, respondent \r\n  admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer \r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction \r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(4) (it is ground for discipline \r\n  for lawyer to be convicted of crime of moral turpitude or serious crime), Rule \r\n  7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending \r\n  to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal \r\n  profession into disrepute or to engage in conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer \r\n  to violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).Â  \r\n  Respondent further admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following \r\n  provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 8.4(b) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that \r\n  reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness \r\n  as a lawyer in other respects).\r\nPETITION FOR RULE TO SHOW CAUSE\r\nOn October, 27, 2004, respondent was placed on interim suspension \r\n  for the same conduct which is the basis of the Agreement for Discipline by Consent.Â  \r\n  See Rule 17, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  ODC has filed a Petition for Rule \r\n  to Show Cause alleging that, by attempting to obtain the release of a client \r\n  from jail, respondent practiced law while suspended from the practice of law.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  Respondent shall not seek to be \r\n  reinstated to the practice of law until he has completed his probation.Â  Although \r\n  we decline to issue a Rule to Show Cause, we remind respondent that he is prohibited \r\n  from participating in any activity which constitutes the practice of law while \r\n  he is suspended.Â Â Â Â  \r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent \r\n  shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to \r\n  the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing \r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25928","title":"State v.

Crisp (Appellant) \r\n    pled guilty in a capital murder case and was sentenced to death. Â We reverse.Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL \r\n    BACKGROUND\r\n  Appellant, then age 20, pled guilty in \r\n    April 2001 to murder, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK), and \r\n    two counts of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a \r\n    violent crime.Â  The murder victim was Jealoni Blackwell; the assault victim \r\n    was Thomas Gambrell.Â  Appellant was sentenced by Judge James W. Johnson, Jr., \r\n    to life in prison for murder, twenty years consecutive for ABWIK, and five \r\n    years concurrent on each weapon charge.\r\n  Following the plea hearing, the State \r\n    officially served notice of the intent to seek the death penalty in connection \r\n    with the murder of Clarence Watson.Â  The State asserted the prior conviction \r\n    of murder and physical torture as statutory grounds for the death penalty.Â  \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(h) and (C)(a)(2) (2003).\r\n  Appellant pled guilty in June 2001 to \r\n    murdering Watson and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission \r\n    of a violent crime.Â  Following a three-day, non-jury sentencing hearing before \r\n    Judge John W. Kittredge in October 2001, Appellant was sentenced to death.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  In criminal cases, we sit to review errors \r\n    of law only and we are bound by factual findings of the trial court unless \r\n    an abuse of discretion is shown.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 \r\n    S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d \r\n    61, 65 (1973).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the \r\n    trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error \r\n    of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 \r\n    (2000); State v. Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 7, 495 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1997).Â  \r\n  \r\n  ISSUES\r\n  \r\n  I.Â  Did the trial judge err during the \r\n    plea colloquy by informing Appellant his best hope for a life sentence at \r\n    a jury trial might ultimately depend on lying jurors â€œwho will testify under \r\n    oath that they are for the death penalty when theyâ€™re not, simply because \r\n    they can serve on a jury to let someone goâ€?\r\n  II.Â  In light of the United States Supreme \r\n    Courtâ€™s decision in Ring v. Arizona, is the statutory provision allowing \r\n    a judge, sitting alone, to sentence to death a defendant who pleads guilty \r\n    a violation of a defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial?\r\n   III.Â  Did the trial judge lack subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction to sentence Appellant to death because the murder indictment \r\n    did not identify any statutory circumstances of aggravation necessary to expose \r\n    Appellant to a punishment greater than life in prison?\r\n  \r\n  I.Â  JUDGEâ€™S COMMENTS REGARDING DECEPTIVE JURORS\r\n  The following exchange occurred as the trial judgeÂ  \r\n    questioned Appellant about the waiver of his right to a jury trial during \r\n    the June 2001 hearing in which Appellant pled guilty to Watsonâ€™s murder:\r\n  \r\n  THE COURT:Â  Let me tell you something else for \r\n    you to be aware of as a practical matter in waiving your right to a jury trial.Â  \r\n    There are jurors who will be brought in who will testify under oath that they \r\n    are for the death penalty when theyâ€™re not simply because they can serve on \r\n    a jury to let someone go.Â  Do you understand that?\r\n  [APPELLANT]:Â  I donâ€™t understand that, Your Honor.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  Do you understand what Iâ€™m telling \r\n    you?\r\n  [APPELLANT]:Â  I understand what youâ€™re saying.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  Iâ€™m telling you itâ€™s a fact of life.Â  \r\n    Iâ€™ve had it happen.Â  Jurors will come in and lie and tell me that theyâ€™re \r\n    open-minded and would, if the circumstances warrant, vote to impose the death \r\n    penalty and not be willing to do so simply as an area to express their agenda \r\n    of being against the death penalty.Â  Do you understand that?\r\n  [APPELLANT]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  And you could get such a juror.Â  And \r\n    we may not be able to detect on the front end whoâ€™s telling the truth and \r\n    whoâ€™s not.Â  And it only takes one juror for you to receive life in prison.Â  \r\n    Now, having explained that to you and the reality of that situation and that \r\n    potential, do you still want to plead guilty in front of me?\r\n  [APPELLANT]:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  \r\n  Appellant contends the judge, through \r\n    his extraneous comments, injected his personal opinion about the potential \r\n    exercise of a constitutional right into the proceeding.Â  Such comments exceed \r\n    the scope of the judgeâ€™s authority, regardless of whether his opinion is based \r\n    on his experience and best judgment.Â  Appellant argues the â€œultimate decision \r\n    to waive a jury trial was [made] subject to the judgeâ€™s assertion that his \r\n    best hope at trial might come down to lying jurors who would deliberately \r\n    subvert his trial for their own purposes.â€ \r\n  Appellant argues the comments prevented \r\n    him from making a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial, \r\n    and the comments constitute prejudicial error.Â  Appellant relies on State \r\n    v. Gunter, 286 S.C. 556, 335 S.E.2d 542 (1985); State v. Pierce, \r\n    289 S.C. 430, 346 S.E.2d 707 (1986), overruled on other grounds by \r\n    State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991); State v. \r\n    Cooper, 291 S.C. 332, 353 S.E.2d 441 (1986), overruled on other grounds \r\n    by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991); and Butler \r\n    v. State, 302 S.C. 466, 397 S.E.2d 87 (1990).\r\n  We recently addressed this same issue \r\n    on virtually identical facts in State v. Owens, Op. No. 25916 (S.C. \r\n    Sup. Ct. filed December 20, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 49 at 51).Â  In that \r\n    case, the trial judge sentenced Owens to death after making essentially the \r\n    same comments describing potentially deceptive jurors during a resentencing \r\n    proceeding as those made by the judge in this case.Â  We concluded the â€œcomments \r\n    were improper and contrary to South Carolina law.Â  Although the trial court \r\n    must strive to ensure that a criminal defendantâ€™s waiver of the right of a \r\n    jury trial is knowing and voluntary, the court should never inject its personal \r\n    opinion into that decision.Â  The comments here impermissibly did so.â€Â  We \r\n    reversed and granted the defendant a new sentencing proceeding.Â  Owens \r\n    at 54; see also Gunter, supra (reversing jury verdict \r\n    of guilty where defendant testified after trial judge repeatedly told him \r\n    the jury would hold it against him if he exercised his Fifth Amendment right \r\n    not to testify, although judge also advised defendant he would instruct the \r\n    jury it could not hold against him his decision not to testify); Pierce, \r\n    289 S.C. at 434, 346 S.E.2d at 710 (reversing jury verdict of guilty where \r\n    trial judge made same comments regarding defendantâ€™s constitutional right \r\n    not to testify as in Gunter, although defendant nonetheless declined \r\n    to testify); Cooper, 291 S.C. at 336, 353 S.E.2d at 443 (reversing \r\n    jury verdict of guilty where trial judge made same comments regarding defendantâ€™s \r\n    constitutional right not to testify as in Gunter, although defendant \r\n    nonetheless declined to testify); Butler v. State, 302 S.C. 466, 397 \r\n    S.E.2d 87 (1990) (granting writ of habeas corpus based on identical comments; \r\n    Court stated it had rejected in Pierce and Cooper the suggestion \r\n    these types of comments could ever constitute harmless error and concluded \r\n    the comments by the judge were erroneous, improper and contrary to South Carolina \r\n    law).\r\n  The defendant in Owens expressed \r\n    his belief at the sentencing proceeding that the opposite of the situation \r\n    described by the judge also could happen, i.e., a death-prone juror might \r\n    lie to get on the jury in order to sentence him to death.Â  Appellant expressed \r\n    no such concerns during his guilty plea.Â  Nevertheless, we adhere to our precedent \r\n    and conclude such comments by a trial judge during a guilty plea proceeding \r\n    are fundamentally erroneous and constitute prejudicial error.Â  We reverse \r\n    Appellantâ€™s guilty plea.\r\n  II.Â  SENTENCING BY JUDGE ONLY AFTER RING V. ARIZONA\r\n  Appellant argues the provision of S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) (2003), which eliminates the possibility of sentencing \r\n    by a jury when a defendant pleads guilty in a capital case, is unconstitutional \r\n    in light of Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d \r\n    556 (2002).Â  In Appellantâ€™s view, Ring interprets the Sixth Amendment \r\n    to require a jury - not a judge acting alone - determine the aggravating factors \r\n    in a capital proceeding even when the defendant pleads guilty.\r\n  At the June 2001 plea hearing, the trial \r\n    judge questioned Appellant at length about the various constitutional rights \r\n    he would waive by pleading guilty.Â  The trial judge specifically and repeatedly \r\n    informed Appellant that he would waive the right to a jury trial in not only \r\n    the guilt phase, but also in the sentencing phase; that the juryâ€™s verdict \r\n    recommending death would have to be unanimous, and the refusal of one juror \r\n    to agree to the death penalty would result in a sentence of life imprisonment.Â  \r\n    The trial judge told Appellant that admittedly guilty defendants in capital \r\n    cases often stand trial simply to obtain a jury trial in the sentencing phase.Â  \r\n    In addition, Appellantâ€™s attorneys stated they had explained the same concepts \r\n    to Appellant.\r\n  We recently addressed this issue in State \r\n    v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004).Â  In that case, we stated \r\n    that\r\n  \r\n  Appellant asserts Ring v. Arizona \r\n    renders unconstitutional the requirement in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) (2003) \r\n    that the sentencing proceeding be held before the judge when a defendant pleads \r\n    guilty to murder.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The capital-sentencing procedure invalidated in Ring \r\n    does not exist in South Carolina.Â  Arizonaâ€™s statute required the judge to \r\n    factually determine whether there existed an aggravating circumstance supporting \r\n    the death penalty regardless whether the judge or a jury had determined guilt. \r\n    . . .Â  In South Carolina, conversely, a defendant convicted by a jury can \r\n    be sentenced to death only if the jury also finds an aggravating circumstance \r\n    and recommends the death penalty. . . .\r\n  In any event, Ring did not involve jury-trial waivers \r\n    and is not implicated when a defendant pleads guilty. Other courts have also \r\n    reached this conclusion. . . . \r\n  Appellant was informed that by pleading guilty he waived \r\n    his right to a jury trial on both guilt and sentencing. He does not argue \r\n    his waiver was made involuntarily, unknowingly, or unintelligently. . . . \r\n    Appellant was not deprived of his right to a jury trial.\r\n  \r\n  Downs, 361 S.C. at ___, 604 S.E.2d at 380 (citations \r\n    omitted).Â  We also rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of Section \r\n    16-3-20(B) for the same reasons in State v. Wood, Op. No. 25907 (S.C. \r\n    Sup. Ct. filed December 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 47 at 39, 46-47) \r\n    (citing Downs, supra).\r\n   We granted Appellantâ€™s motion to argue \r\n    against the precedent of Downs.Â  At oral argument, Appellant contended \r\n    his case is factually distinguishable from Downs because, unlike the \r\n    defendant in that case, Appellant sought a life sentence; he exhibited remorse \r\n    for his crimes; and he offered a reason for his actions based on his statements \r\n    to police that he murdered Blackwell and Watson, and tried to murder Gambrell, \r\n    because he believed they were drug dealers who intended to harm his family.\r\n  We do not find persuasive Appellantâ€™s \r\n    effort to distinguish his case from Downs.Â  The constitutionality of \r\n    Section 16-3-20(B) does not rest on a defendantâ€™s desire for a particular \r\n    outcome, his sense of remorse, or his rationale for committing a particular \r\n    crime.Â  Instead, it rests, inter alia, on whether the statute comports \r\n    with the right to a jury trial as established by this Court and the United \r\n    States Supreme Court in interpreting the state and federal constitutions.Â  \r\n    See U.S. Const. amend VI; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n    adhere to our opinion in Downs and reject Appellantâ€™s arguments for \r\n    the reasons expressed in that case.Â  Section 16-3-20(B) is not unconstitutional \r\n    in light of Ring, supra, and a capital defendant may be sentenced \r\n    only by a judge pursuant to that statute after knowingly and voluntarily waiving \r\n    his right to a jury trial.\r\n  III.Â  Â Â SUFFICIENCY OF INDICTMENT AFTER RING V. ARIZONA\r\n  Appellant contends the circuit court lacked \r\n    subject matter jurisdiction in his case because the indictment did not identify \r\n    any aggravating factor which exposed him to the death penalty.Â  Appellant \r\n    relies primarily on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. \r\n    2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); Jones v. U.S., 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. \r\n    1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999); and Ring, supra.Â  Under those \r\n    cases, Appellant argues, aggravating circumstances necessary to impose the \r\n    death penalty are considered elements of the crime of murder in a capital \r\n    case.Â  A jury must find the presence of aggravating circumstances beyond a \r\n    reasonable doubt before the death penalty may be imposed.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n    Appellant contends, the defendant is entitled to an indictment which gives \r\n    him pretrial notice of which aggravating circumstances the State intends to \r\n    rely on at sentencing.\r\n  We recently addressed this issue in Downs, \r\n    361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377.Â  In that case, we stated that \r\n  \r\n  [t]he [United States Supreme] Court expressly \r\n    noted in both Apprendi and Ring that the cases did not involve \r\n    challenges to state indictments.Â  More important, the Fourteenth Amendment \r\n    has not been construed to incorporate the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s Presentment or \r\n    Indictment Clause.Â  State law governs indictments for state-law crimes.\r\n  Under South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances need \r\n    not be alleged in an indictment for murder.Â  The aggravating circumstances \r\n    listed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a) (2003) are sentencing factors, not \r\n    elements of murder.Â  The circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n    sentence Appellant to death.\r\n  \r\n  Downs, 361 S.C. at ___, 604 \r\n    S.E.2d at 380-81 (citations omitted).\r\n  Appellant argues his case is factually \r\n    distinguishable from Downs, as previously explained.Â  We do not find \r\n    persuasive Appellantâ€™s effort to distinguish his case from Downs.Â  \r\n    We also note the State, as required by statute, timely notified Appellant \r\n    of its intention to seek the death penalty and identified the aggravating \r\n    circumstances and related evidence the State intended to use at trial.Â  See \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(B) and 16-3-26 (2003).Â  Accordingly, we adhere to \r\n    our opinion in Downs and reject Appellantâ€™s arguments for the reasons \r\n    expressed in that case.Â  The circuit court had jurisdiction in Appellantâ€™s \r\n    case.\r\n  In light of our disposition of this case, \r\n    it is not necessary to address Appellantâ€™s argument that the circuit court \r\n    erred by neglecting to obtain an explicit waiver of Appellantâ€™s right to testify \r\n    at the sentencing hearing.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School \r\n    Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need \r\n    not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive); \r\n    State v. Hill, 360 S.C. 13, 18 n.2, 598 S.E.2d 732, 734 n.2 (Ct. App. \r\n    2004) (stating same principle).Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We reverse Appellantâ€™s guilty plea \r\n    for the reasons expressed in Issue I and remand this case to the circuit court \r\n    for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n  REVERSED.\r\n   TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, \r\n    JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25929","title":"Shell v.

Lear, all of Duff Turner White \r\n  &amp; Boykin, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  Respondent terminated petitionerâ€™s \r\n  (Shellâ€™s) teaching contract, finding him unfit to teach. \r\n  [1] Â  The circuit court reversed this decision, holding it was not supported \r\n  by substantial evidence.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit \r\n  court and reinstated the termination.Â  Shell v. Richland County School Dist. \r\n  One, Op. No. 2003-UP-503 (S.C. Ct. App. filed August 27, 2003).Â  We granted \r\n  Shellâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari, and now reverse the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1988, Shell was arrested \r\n  for possession of crack cocaine.Â  The crack was found in a car in which Shell \r\n  was a passenger; the drugs were wrapped in one of Shellâ€™s personal checks.Â  \r\n  The 1988 charge was subsequently dismissed by the solicitor.\r\nIn 2000, Shell was again \r\n  arrested, this time for attempted possession of crack cocaine.Â  In this incident, \r\n  Shell remained in his car in a well-known drug area while his passenger â€œwent \r\n  to visit a friend.â€Â  After the passenger purchased crack, but before he returned \r\n  to Shellâ€™s car, he and Shell were arrested as part of a sting operation.Â  The \r\n  2000 charge was dropped after the passenger pled guilty.\r\nFollowing Shellâ€™s second \r\n  arrest, respondent placed him on administrative leave to further investigate \r\n  â€œthe allegations of attempting to possess crack cocaineâ€ and â€œto consider if \r\n  sufficient grounds exist for termination.â€Â  Several months later, respondentâ€™s \r\n  superintendent sent Shell a letter stating that Shellâ€™s teaching contract was \r\n  being terminated pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-25-430.Â  This letter referenced \r\n  the earlier letter that suspended Shell, which had stated the suspension would \r\n  continue â€œpending the conclusion of the districtâ€™s investigation into your arrest \r\n  for possession of crack cocaine.Â  This type of behavior along with similar behavior \r\n  in the pastâ€¦brings into question your fitness for teaching.â€ \r\nShell requested a hearing before respondentâ€™s Board of Commissioners \r\n  to contest the superintendentâ€™s termination decision.Â  At the hearing, the superintendent \r\n  testified that the decision to terminate Shellâ€™s teaching contract was based \r\n  solely on Shellâ€™s unfitness, that is, his arrests under suspicious circumstances.Â  \r\n  The superintendent testified he did not consider the negative publicity attendant \r\n  to Shellâ€™s 2000 arrest in making his decision.Â  Further, respondentâ€™s attorney \r\n  stipulated at the hearing that Shellâ€™s performance in the classroom was not \r\n  an issue. [2] Â Â  Following an \r\n  evidentiary hearing, respondentâ€™s Board of Commissioners upheld the superintendentâ€™s \r\n  firing decision, finding:\r\n\r\nâ€¦[S]ubstantial and compelling \r\n  evidence that justifies the immediate termination of Mr. Shellâ€™s employment \r\n  with Richland County School District One based on Mr. Shellâ€™s evident unfitness \r\n  as manifested by his conduct.Â  Conduct which, after a reasonable time for improvement, \r\n  12 years, shows an evident failure to improve.Â  The Board determined that the \r\n  evidence established sufficient and just cause for this action.\r\n\r\nShell appealed to the circuit \r\n  court.Â  Respondentâ€™s attorney conceded that it had no evidence that Shell was \r\n  involved in the illegal use, possession or sale of drugs.Â  The circuit court \r\n  held that being arrested but not convicted for two criminal charges, twelve \r\n  years apart, did not constitute substantial evidence that Shell was unfit to \r\n  teach and reversed the termination decision.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals \r\n  reviewed the entire record, and found substantial evidence of Shellâ€™s unfitness.Â  \r\n  In addition to Shellâ€™s conduct in being twice arrested on drug charges, the \r\n  Court of Appeals cited to evidence in the record of what it characterized as \r\n  Shellâ€™s dishonesty, and to testimony that the publicity surrounding Shellâ€™s \r\n  2000 arrest and the negative response it engendered among the schoolâ€™s teachers, \r\n  parents, and children led Shellâ€™s principal to conclude it was not in the studentsâ€™ \r\n  best interests to be taught by Shell.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded the record \r\n  contained substantial evidence that Shell was unfit to teach, and reinstated \r\n  the termination.Â  Shell v. Rich. Cty. School Dist. One, supra.Â  \r\n  We granted Shellâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review this decision.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in \r\n  finding substantial evidence in the record to support Shellâ€™s termination?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nShell contends, and we agree, that appellate review of a teacherâ€™s \r\n  termination must be confined to the ground(s) stated in the order terminating \r\n  his employment.Â  See e.g., Laws v. Richland County School Dist. No. \r\n  1, 270 S.C. 492, 243 S.E.2d 192 (1978) (scope of review of cases brought \r\n  pursuant to Teacher Employment and Dismissal Act limited to whether grounds \r\n  given for termination are supported by  substantial\r\nevidence).Â  The Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in scouring the record and making its own independent evidentiary findings \r\n  to support the termination. \r\nWe agree with the circuit court that the mere fact \r\n  of two drug arrests, twelve years apart, neither of which resulted in formal \r\n  charges, is insufficient to support a finding of unfitness to teach, especially \r\n  when the school district does not contend Shell ever used, possessed, or sold \r\n  illegal drugs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals.Â  Shell is entitled to return to his employment, to \r\n  an award of back pay, and to reinstatement of benefits from the date of his \r\n  suspension without pay.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  See S.C.

Suggs, of Suggs &amp; Kelly Lawyers, P.A., of \r\n  Columbia, and Larry Dale Dove, of L. Dale Dove, L.L.C.,&nbsp;of Rock Hill, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:&nbsp; This is a negligence case in which \r\n  the trial court granted partial summary judgment to the respondent on the appellantâ€™s \r\n  claim of a set-off in the amount of workersâ€™ compensation benefits which the \r\n  respondent received from his employer.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe respondent Theodore Gordon (Gordon) was injured while \r\n  working for Seven Star Construction Company (Seven Star). Gordon and his crew \r\n  were preparing to tie into an underground water line that had been previously \r\n  installed and inspected by appellant Phillips Utilities, Inc. (Phillips). A \r\n  steel cap weighing over fifty pounds exploded striking Gordonâ€™s leg and shattering \r\n  his knee. Gordon received workersâ€™ compensation benefits from Seven Star.Â  Gordon \r\n  then filed this negligence action against Phillips.Â  Phillips sought a set-off \r\n  in the amount of the workersâ€™ compensation benefits which Gordon had received \r\n  from Seven Star.\r\nBefore trial, the trial judge granted Gordon partial \r\n  summary judgment on Phillipsâ€™ claim of a set-off. The case proceeded to trial \r\n  and the jury found Gordon was 25% negligent and Phillips was 75% negligent.Â Â Â  \r\n  The jury also found Gordon had actual damages of $149,670.13 and $30,000 in \r\n  punitive damages.Â  The trial judge reduced the actual damages by 25% to $112,252.59, \r\n  but he did not reduce the punitive damages of $30,000.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err in granting Gordon partial summary \r\n  judgment precluding Phillips from asserting a right to a set-off pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-580 (Supp. 2003)?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPhillips sought a set-off pursuant to Â§ 42-1-580 \r\n  which provides:Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the facts are such at the time of the injury that a \r\n  third person would have the right, upon payment of any recovery against him, \r\n  to enforce contribution or indemnity from the employer, any recovery by the \r\n  employee against the third person shall be reduced by the amount of such contribution \r\n  of indemnity and the third person's right to enforce such contribution against \r\n  the employer shall thereupon be satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge in a written order found that this section \r\n  was inapplicable and granted Gordon partial summary judgment on Phillipsâ€™ claim \r\n  for set-off in the amount of workersâ€™ compensation benefits paid to Gordon by \r\n  his employer, which was approximately $87,000.Â  The trial judge reasoned that \r\n  Gordonâ€™s employer, Seven Star, could not be liable to Gordon in tort because \r\n  the workersâ€™ compensation laws exclude all other rights and remedies and thus \r\n  Phillips did not have any right of contribution from Seven Star.Â  Phillips contends \r\n  the trial court erred.\r\nThere have only been a few published cases discussing \r\n  Â§ 42-1-580 and none resolve the issue currently before the Court.Â  The primary \r\n  purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.Â  Hodges \r\n  v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  &quot;If a statute's \r\n  language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, \r\n  there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation and the \r\n  court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.&quot; Paschal v. \r\n  State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995). Furthermore, \r\n  the legislature intends to accomplish something by its choice of words, and \r\n  would not do a futile thing. Â State ex rel. McLeod v. Montgomery, 244 \r\n  S.C. 308, 314, 136 S.E.2d 778, 782 (1964).Â  \r\nIn arguing that this section allows a set-off at trial, \r\n  Phillips contends that after the 1988 enactment of the Contribution Among Joint \r\n  Tortfeasers Act, Â§ 15-38-20, et al. (Act), a third party would have a right \r\n  of contribution from a negligent employer.Â  It contends the Act gives teeth \r\n  to Â§ 42-1-580.Â  \r\nThe Act, however, does not help Phillips because there is no right to contribution \r\n  available to it under the Act.Â  Pursuant to the Act, when two or more persons \r\n  are jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person, there \r\n  is a right of contribution among them.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(A) (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  As Seven Star, pursuant to the Workersâ€™ Compensation laws, could not \r\n  be liable to Gordon in tort, there can be no right of contribution under the \r\n  Act for Phillips. \r\nFurther, Phillips contends by enacting Â§ 42-1-580, the General \r\n  Assembly intended to provide a remedy for a third party when an employer was \r\n  negligent and contributed to the injury.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nApplying this section to the current situation creates numerous \r\n  problems and concerns and requires the Court to read language into the statute \r\n  to effectuate such an intent. Citing a law review article, Phillips contends \r\n  a third party is to allege the right of set-off as an affirmative defense and \r\n  then offer proof at trial of the employerâ€™s negligence. See Kelly M. \r\n  Braithwaite &amp; John A. Massalon, Right Without a Remedy: Setoff Under \r\n  the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, 7 S.C. Law Rev. 40 (1995).Â Â  \r\n  The article states that because the employer is not a party, the plaintiff is \r\n  to defend the claim of employer negligence.Â  However, if the third party does \r\n  not prove the employer was negligent, a successful plaintiff will have to satisfy \r\n  the subrogation lien for the amount of the workersâ€™ compensation benefits paid \r\n  to him.Â  On the other hand, if the third party proves the employer was negligent, \r\n  a successful plaintiffâ€™s award will be reduced by a set-off equal to the amount \r\n  of the workersâ€™ compensation lien. Either way, the plaintiffâ€™s award will be \r\n  reduced by the amount of workersâ€™ compensation he has received from the employer.Â  \r\n  The plaintiff has nothing to lose or gain by defending the third partyâ€™s claim \r\n  against the employer.Â  The employer, on the other hand, stands to lose its claim \r\n  of subrogation without being givenÂ  the opportunity to defend the third partyâ€™s \r\n  claims of negligence.Â  This cannot be what the legislature intended.\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, we find this section \r\n  inapplicable in a trial brought by the employee against a third party.Â  The \r\n  third-party defendant and the employer are not joint tortfeasers.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  as stated above, it is unfair to the absent employer and would only add confusion \r\n  during a trial.Â  Lastly, this section does not address how the employerâ€™s negligence \r\n  is to be determined.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial judge did not err in finding \r\n  Â§ 42-1-580 inapplicable and granting Gordon summary judgment on Phillipsâ€™ claim \r\n  of a set-off pursuant to Â§ 42-1-580.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT, J., and Acting Justices \r\n  R.

Phillips.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed.Â  \r\n  Nelson v. QHG of South Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 580 S.E.2d 171 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, Latonia Nelson (Mother), as guardian ad \r\n  litem for Tyâ€™Quain S. Nelson, brought a medical malpractice action against \r\n  Carolina Womenâ€™s Center and Thomas W. Phillips, M.D. for injuries allegedly \r\n  caused during the delivery of Tyâ€™Quain.&nbsp; When Mother failed to identify any \r\n  experts who would testify to a breach of the standard of care, the circuit court \r\n  granted Dr. Phillipsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  However, the circuit court \r\n  granted Mother thirty days to file a motion to reconsider along with an affidavit \r\n  from an expert establishing a breach of the standard of care.Â  No motion to \r\n  reconsider was filed.\r\nJames Nelson, Jr. (Grandfather) brought this medical malpractice \r\n  action in 2001 against Dr. Phillips, his medical group (the Doctors), Carolina \r\n  Hospital System, and Quorum Health Group, Inc. [1]  alleging negligence on the part \r\n  of Dr. Phillips and the Doctors in the delivery of Tyâ€™Quain.&nbsp; Grandfather consented \r\n  to the dismissal of Dr. Phillips after being advised of the prior lawsuit.Â  \r\n  The Doctors then filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the circuit \r\n  court.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err by finding the medical malpractice claim is barred \r\n  and by finding the negligent record-keeping claim is not barred by the doctrines \r\n  of collateral estoppel and res judicata?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err by failing to hold the collateral estoppel doctrine \r\n  inapplicable because the first court order was a consent order, prior counsel \r\n  was inadequate, the Doctors could have joined in the prior case, and due to \r\n  policy considerations?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nThe Court of Appeals held Grandfatherâ€™s action was properly dismissed against \r\n  Dr. Phillips based on res judicata and collateral estoppel.Â  However, \r\n  the court held that Grandfather could maintain his claim against the Doctors \r\n  for negligent medical record-keeping since that was an independent basis of \r\n  liability separate from Dr. Phillipsâ€™ liability.Â  The Doctors contend this was \r\n  error.\r\nWe find Grandfather is barred from bringing a negligent record-keeping \r\n  claim against the Doctors because Dr. Phillipsâ€™ negligence has previously been \r\n  litigated and determined in the first action of Mother versus Dr. Phillips.Â  \r\n  See Richburg v. Baughman, 290 S.C. 431, 351 S.E.2d 164 (1986) \r\n  (under doctrine of collateral estoppel, once final judgment on the merits has \r\n  been reached in prior claim, relitigation of those issues actually and necessarily \r\n  litigated and determined in the first suit are precluded in any subsequent action \r\n  based upon a different claim). \r\nGrandfatherâ€™s claims against the Doctors are collaterally estopped because \r\n  there was a fair and full opportunity to litigate those claims in the earlier \r\n  suit.Â  Previously, the 1996 circuit court found that Mother had not produced \r\n  an expert witness stating the standard of care and stating that Dr. Phillips \r\n  had breached the standard of care and, therefore, Motherâ€™s action did not present \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact as to whether medical malpractice had occurred.Â  \r\n  See Pederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 341 S.E.2d 633 (1986) (in \r\n  medical malpractice actions, plaintiff must use expert testimony to establish \r\n  both required standard of care and doctorâ€™s failure to conform to that standard).Â  \r\n  As a result, the 1996 circuit court granted summary judgment to Dr. Phillips \r\n  and dismissed the action with prejudice.Â  Accordingly, the ability to subsequently \r\n  raise any claim regarding Dr. Phillipsâ€™ negligence was extinguished when summary \r\n  judgment was granted to Dr. Phillips.Â  See Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999) (summary judgment is adjudication on the \r\n  merits).Â  Grandfather does not allege that any employee of the Doctors, other \r\n  than Dr. Phillips, was negligent for failing to maintain medical records.Â  Grandfather \r\n  is attempting to try the previously decided medical malpractice claim through \r\n  a claim of negligent record-keeping.Â  However, negligent record-keeping is not \r\n  a separate claim under these facts.\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by finding Grandfather could \r\n  proceed against the Doctors via a negligent record-keeping claim.\r\nII\r\nGrandfather argues the Court of Appeals erred by: (1) failing to hold the order \r\n  in the prior case was a consent order which bars the application of collateral \r\n  estoppel; (2) failing to hold collateral estoppel should not bar the action \r\n  because prior counsel was inadequate; (3) failing to hold collateral estoppel \r\n  should not be applied because the Doctors could have joined in the prior case; \r\n  and (4) failing to hold policy considerations should bar the application of \r\n  collateral estoppel.\r\nConsent Order\r\nGrandfather argues that when counsel in the 1996 action consented \r\n  to the summary judgment order, the consent barred the use of collateral estoppel.Â  \r\n  The Court of Appeals found the consent order exception contained in Restatement \r\n  (Second) of Judgments Â§ 51 (1982) did not apply.\r\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments Â§ 51 (1982) provides, in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\n\r\nIf two persons have a relationship such that one of them is vicariously responsible \r\n  for the conduct of the other, and an action is brought by the injured person \r\n  against one of them, the judgment in the action has the following preclusive \r\n  effects against the injured person in a subsequent action against the other.\r\n. . .\r\n(4) A judgment by consent for or against the injured person does not extinguish \r\n  his claim against the person not sued in the first action . . .\r\n\r\nIn the 1996 summary judgment order, the trial court noted that, â€œAt \r\n  the conclusion of the hearing, [Motherâ€™s counsel] agreed the relief granted \r\n  herein was appropriate and he consented thereto.â€Â  This language does not convert \r\n  the summary judgment order into a consent order.\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals did not err by failing to adopt \r\n  the restatement as requested by Grandfather and by failing to find the consent \r\n  order exception to be applicable. \r\nInadequate Representation\r\nGrandfather argues counselâ€™s representation in the 1996 suit was \r\n  so inadequate that collateral estoppel should not be applied.Â  We find the Court \r\n  of Appeals properly concluded the argument was without merit.Â  See Dennis \r\n  v. First State Bank of Texas, 989 S.W.2d 22 (Tex. App. 1998) (to allow appellants \r\n  another chance to relitigate issues that should have been brought in previous \r\n  suit would allow losing party to relitigate cause of action based solely on \r\n  an assertion of inadequate representation).Â  The remedy for inadequate representation \r\n  is a malpractice action against the childâ€™s former counsel, not a second action \r\n  attempting to bring the same suit.\r\nJoinder\r\nGrandfather argues the Court of Appeals erred by failing to hold \r\n  there should be an exception to collateral estoppel in this case because the \r\n  Doctors could have easily joined in the first case.Â  However, Grandfatherâ€™s \r\n  argument is not preserved for review because the argument was not raised as \r\n  a separate issue until Grandfather filed a petition for rehearing with the Court \r\n  of Appeals.Â  See Rule 226(d)(2), SCACR (issue must have been raised in \r\n  initial arguments to Court of Appeals).\r\nPolicy Considerations\r\nGrandfather argues the Court of Appeals erred by failing to find \r\n  that policy considerations should bar the application of collateral estoppel.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n Grandfather asserts that if collateral estoppel is applied in this \r\n  case to preclude an innocent minorâ€™s action against the Doctors, this would \r\n  violate the principles of fundamental fairness, the judicial preference for \r\n  disputes to be resolved after full litigation and determination of the substantive \r\n  issues, and the overriding need for the interests of minors to be protected \r\n  by the law.\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, Grandfatherâ€™s policy considerations \r\n  do not override the interest of bringing an end to litigation and the interest \r\n  of ensuring a defendant is not being forced to defend the same action repeatedly.Â  \r\n  See First Natâ€™l Bank v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 207 S.C. \r\n  15, 35 S.E.2d 47 (1945) (public interest requires end to litigation and no one \r\n  should be twice sued for same cause of action).Â  As noted above, the remedy \r\n  is a malpractice action against the former counsel, not a second attempt to \r\n  bring the same suit.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals did not err by failing \r\n  to find policy considerations bar the application of collateral estoppel.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring \r\n  in result only.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    claims against QHG of South Carolina, Inc., d/b/a Carolina Hospital System, \r\n    and Quorum Health Group, Inc. are not at issue in this appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Dennis C.

State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d 647, 649-650 (1999).Â  However, â€œthe rule [of standing] is not an inflexible one.â€Â  Thompson v. South Carolina Comm'n on Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463, 467, 229 S.E.2d 718, 719 (1976).Â  Standing may be conferred upon a party â€œwhen an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.â€Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).Â  Recently, both this Court and the Court of Appeals have granted standing in cases of important public interest.Â  See Sloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 593 S.E.2d 470 (2004) (standing to challenge governorâ€™s commission as an officer in the Air Force reserve); Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 548, 590 S.E.2d 338, 347 (Ct. App. 2003) (standing to bring declaratory judgment action alleging county failed to comply with ordinances governing procurement of construction services on design-build public works Aprojects).\r\nIn light of the great public importance of this matter, we find Sloan has standing to maintain this action.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ONE SUBJECT/ SEVERABILITY\r\nSloan asserts Act 187 violates the one subject requirement of Article III, section 17.Â  We agree. \r\nAct No. 187 contains the following provisions:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n    The Life Sciences Act (&sect;&sect; 1-4) (&sect; 1 setting forth definitions, etc.; &sect; 2 regarding Depreciation Allowances; &sect; 3 providing for Economic Development Projects and Bonds;[5] and &sect; 4 reporting requirements)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    The Venture Capital Investment Act (&sect;&sect; 5-7)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Public Institutions of Higher Learning relating to bonuses for employees, fee waivers for students, grant positions and health insurance and, in particular, vesting public institutions of higher learning with the power of eminent domain (&sect; 8)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    The South Carolina Research University Infrastructure Act (&sect; 9)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5.\r\n    An Act defining Permanent Improvement Project (&sect; 10)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    6.\r\n    Use of funds by research universities (&sect; 11)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    7.\r\n    Creation of a Four-Year Culinary Curriculum Program at Trident Technical College (&sect; 12)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    8.&nbsp;\r\n    Authorization of a Four-year degree program at University of South Carolina-Sumter (&sect; 13)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    9.\r\n    A requirement of prior authorization for campus closing for USC (&sect; 14)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    10.\r\n    A requirement of annual reports of the number of out-of-state undergraduate students at any public institution of higher learning (&sect; 15)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    11.\r\n    Eligibility requirements for Life Scholarship recipients (&sect; 16)&nbsp; (and &sect;&sect; 17-18 defining eligible institutions and grade point averages)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    12.\r\n    A Law School Feasibility Study for South Carolina State University (&sect; 19)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    13.\r\n    Section 20 (provisions not to be construed as an appropriation of funds)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    14.\r\n    Severability Clause (&sect; 21)\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Constitution, Art. III, Â§ 17 provides that â€œevery Act or resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.â€Â  The purpose of Article III, Â§ 17 is to apprise the members of the General Assembly of the contents of an act by reading the title, (2) prevent legislative log-rolling and (3) inform the people of the state of the matters with which the General Assembly concerns itself.Â  South Carolina Public Svc. Commâ€™n v. Citizens and Southern Natâ€™l Bank, 300 S.C. 142, 386 S.E.2d 775 (1989).Â  See also Keyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C 83, 470 S.E.2d 100 (1996).Â  Article III, Â§ 17 is to be liberally construed so as to uphold an Act if practicable.Â  McCollum v. Snipes, 213 S.C. 254, 49 S.E.2d 12 (1948).Â  Doubtful or close cases are to be resolved in favor of upholding an Actâ€™s validity.Â  Alley v. Daniel, 153 S.C. 217, 150 S.E. 691 (1929).Â  Article III, Â§ 17 does not preclude the legislature from dealing with several branches of one general subject in a single act.Â  It is complied with if the title of an act expresses a general subject and the body provides the means to facilitate accomplishment of the general purpose.Â  Keyserling, supra.Â Â  However, Article III, section 17 requires â€œthe topics in the body of the act [be] kindred in nature and hav[e] a legitimate and natural association with the subject of the title,â€ and that the title conveys â€œreasonable notice of the subject matter to the legislature and the public.â€Â  Hercules, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137, 141, 262 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1980).\r\nIt is patent that the myriad provisions comprising Act 187 simply do not comprise one subject.[6]Â  On the contrary, the Act is teeming with subjects, from life sciences provisions to the establishment of a culinary arts institute.Â  In our view, Act 187 is obviously violative of Article III, Â§ 17.Â  However, notwithstanding this violation, we must address whether portions of the Act may be read to express one subject and, if so, whether the offending provisions may be severed.Â  We find that they may.\r\nAs noted previously, Section 21 of Act 187 contains a very detailed severability clause, as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this act is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not affect the constitutionality or validity of the remaining portions of this act, the General Assembly hereby declaring that it would have passed this act, and each and every section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise ineffective. \r\n\r\nWe recently addressed severability in Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 649, 528 S.E.2d 647, 654 (1999), stating:\r\n\r\n  The test for severability is whether the constitutional portion of the statute remains complete in itself, wholly independentÂ  of that which is rejected, and is of such a character that it may fairly be presumed that the legislature would have passed it independent of that which conflicts with the constitution.Â  â€œWhen the residue of an Act, sans that portion found to be unconstitutional, is capable of being executed in accordance with the Legislative intent, independent of the rejected portion, the Act as a whole should not be stricken as being in violation of a Constitutional Provision.â€Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the offending portions of Act 187 are severable.Â  From a reading of the entire Act, it is evident that its underlying purpose was to foster economic growth in this state through development of the life sciences industry.Â  Accordingly, we find the â€œone subjectâ€ of the Act is that of life sciences.Â  Further, we find several provisions of the Act are so intertwined with the provision and growth of the life sciences field that they can reasonably be deemed to fall within that subject.Â  \r\nThe Life Sciences Act, section 1 of the Act, has the purpose of fostering economic development and encouraging the creation of high-paying jobs in the life sciences industry.[7]Â  Section 2 captioned â€œDepreciation Allowances,â€ sets forth a 20% depreciation allowance for machinery and equipment used directly in the manufacturing processes of a life science facility.Â  Section 3 of Act 187 provides for Economic Development Projects and Bonds, and increases the limits on general obligation debt in order to â€œfoster economic development and to encourage the creation of high&#8209;paying jobs in the life sciences industry.â€ Section 4 provides for annual reports of the cost and benefit of the act.Â  We find each of these sections is intrinsically related to the underlying purpose of the Life Sciences Act so as to fall within its one subject. [8]\r\nSections 5 through 7 of the Act, the â€œVenture Capital Investment Act,â€ Â were enacted to increase the availability of equity, near&#8209;equity, or seed capital in amounts of one hundred million dollars or more for emerging, expanding, relocating, and restructuring enterprises in the State, so as to help strengthen the stateâ€™s economic base, and to support the economic development goals of this State.Â  We find these provisions sufficiently related to the General Assemblyâ€™s goal of fostering economic development in the life sciences industry to withstand a challenge under Article III, Â§ 17.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSection 8 of the Act is entitled â€œPublic Institutions of Higher Learning.â€Â  It provides for bonuses for employees, fee waivers for students, establishes grant positions, and providing graduate students with health insurance.Â  This section of the Act also vests the board of trustees of such institutions with the power of eminent domain.Â  We simply cannot find that these provisions inhere with the underlying purposes of the Life Sciences Act.Â  Accordingly, they are stricken as violative of Article III, Â§ 17.\r\nSection 9 of the Act, the South Carolina Research University Infrastructure Act,[9] increases the limitation on general obligation bond debt to six percent.Â  This section is similar in nature to Section 3 of the Act (Economic Development Projects and Bonds), and aids with funding for research universities.Â  Given the direct correlation between research universities and the life sciences field, we find this section sufficiently related to the purposes of the Life Sciences Act to comply with Article III, Â§ 17.Â Â  \r\nSection 10 of the Act requires the State Budget and Control Board to formally establish each permanent improvement project before any actions may be taken to implement such a project.Â  This section of the Act, although conceivably related to the Life Sciences Act, is simply too remote to be deemed part of the one subject expressed in that Act.Â  Accordingly, it is stricken.Â Â Â  \r\nSection 11 of the Act, entitled â€œUse of Funds,â€ governs funding sources which may be utilized by senior research universities to provide for endowed professorships.Â  Notably, this section states that matching funds from private or federal sources may only be used for â€œEngineering, Nanotechnology, Biomedical Sciences, Energy Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Information and Management Sciences, and for other sciences and research that create well&#8209;paying jobs and enhanced economic opportunities for the people of South Carolina.â€Â  Clearly, these provisions directly relate to the underlying purposes of the Life Sciences Act.Â  \r\nWe have reviewed the remaining sections of Act 187, and we simply cannot find them to be within the purview of the Life Sciences Act.Â  Accordingly, they are, with the exception of the severability clause set forth in section 21, stricken as violative of Article III, Â§ 17.Â  The stricken sections are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Section 12 - authorizing Trident Technical College to establish a four-year culinary curriculum program.\r\n  Section 13- authorizing the University of South Carolina Sumter campus to offer four-year degree programs.Â  \r\n  Section 14- requiring prior authorization for any campus of the University of South Carolina to close any of its campuses.Â  \r\n  Section 15- requiring public institutions of higher learning to annually report the number of out&#8209;of&#8209;state undergraduate students in attendance at the university for each semester.Â  \r\n  Section 16- setting forth certain eligibility requirements for LIFE scholarship recipients.Â  Sections 17 and 18 defining institutions at which students are eligible to receive a LIFE Scholarship and establishing the requisite grade point averages for recipients.\r\n  Section 19- establishing a committee to study the feasibility and need for a School of Law at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg.\r\n  Section 20 sets forth the General Assemblyâ€™s intent that the provisions set forth in the Act not be construed to appropriate funds.\r\n\r\nWe simply do not see any manner in which the above provisions relate to the one subject of the Life Sciences Act.Â  Any relation which they may have is clearly too tangential to fit within the purpose and meaning of Article III, Â§ 17.Â  Accordingly, the above provisions are stricken.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Act No. 187 violates the one subject requirement of Article III, Â§ 17 of the constitution.Â  However, we find those provisions which are germane to the Life Sciences Act, as set forth above, are within the one subject requirements of Article III and are, accordingly, upheld.Â  The offending provisions of Act 187 are stricken.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.Â  In my opinion, Act 187 is constitutional in its entirety.\r\nâ€œThe three objectives of the constitutional provision requiring that each act relate to one subject are to (1) apprise the members of the General Assembly of the contents of an act by reading the title, (2) prevent legislative log-rolling and (3) inform the people of the State of the matters with which the General Assembly concerns itself.â€Â  S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Citizens and S. Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 300 S.C. 142, 162, 386 S.E.2d 775, 786-87 (1989) (citations omitted); Carll v. S.C. Jobs-Economic Dev. Auth., 284 S.C. 438, 442, 327 S.E.2d 331, 334 (1985) (citations omitted). \r\nThe title of an act â€œneed not be an index to every provision of the actâ€ in order to â€œapprise members of the General Assemblyâ€ and â€œinform the people of the State.â€Â  Carll, 284 S.C. at 442, 327 S.E.2d at 334 (citing Hercules, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 137, 262 S.E.2d 45 (1980)).Â  In this case, the title is an index to every provision of Act 187, so neither the legislators nor the people lacked notice of the actâ€™s contents.Â  Accordingly, Act 187 does not violate the first or third objectives of Article III, section 17.\r\nThat leaves log rolling as the only possible basis for invalidating the act.Â  â€œLog rollingâ€ is a â€œlegislative practice of embracing in one bill several distinct matters, none of which, perhaps, could singly obtain the assent of the legislature, and then procuring its passage by a combination of the minorities in favor of each of the measures into a majority that will adopt them all.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 849 (5th ed.1979).Â  In the language of the constitution, â€œevery Act or resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject â€¦.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. III, Â§ 17.\r\nThe issue is, therefore, whether the provisions of Act 187 are germane to one subject.Â  The majority finds that â€œthe Act is teeming with subjects, ranging from life sciences to the establishment of a culinary arts institute.â€Â  I disagree.Â  The majorityâ€™s view of what constitutes a subject is too narrow. Article III, section 17 is to â€œbe liberally construed, and construed so as to uphold [an act] if practicable.â€Â  Keyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.E.2d 100, 102 (1996); McCollum v. Snipes, 213 S.C. 254, 261, 49 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1948).Â  Here, all of Act 187â€™s provisions reasonably relate to the subject of economic development.\r\nThat â€œeconomic developmentâ€ is a general subject does not render it an invalid subject.Â  Article III, section 17 â€œdoes not preclude the legislature from dealing with several branches of one general subject in a single act.â€Â  Keyserling, 322 S.C. at 86, 470 S.E.2d at 102 (citing De Loach v. Scheper, 188 S.C. 21, 198 S.E. 409 (1938)).Â  Further, the Court should read the provisions of Act 187 together, not in isolation.Â  Keyserling, 322 S.C. at 88, 470 S.E.2d at 103.Â  Act 187 addresses various aspects of economic development, including a knowledge-based workforce, the life-sciences industry, research, education, venture capital, permanent improvements, and tourism.[10]Â  I would uphold Act 187 in its entirety.Â Â Â  \r\nI do not agree with the majority that Act 187 is â€œteeming with subjects.â€ Â As I have stated, I believe the act relates to several branches of one subject.Â  If Act 187 were indeed an indulgence in log rolling, then it should be declared unconstitutional in its entirety.Â  Log rolling undermines the legislative process and the democratic principle of majority rule.Â  Severing certain provisions of an act neither prevents nor corrects log rolling, but rather â€œcreates uncertainty and promotes arbitrary and uneven enforcementâ€ of the one-subject rule.Â  State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich, 69 Ohio St. 3d 225, 249-50, 631 N.E.2d 582, 599-600 (Ohio 1994) (William Sweeney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also State ex rel. Hinkle v. Franklin County Bd. of Elections, 62 Ohio St. 3d 145, 153, 580 N.E.2d 767, 773 (Ohio 1991) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (asking, â€œ[H]ow does the majority know which part of the Act is defective?Â  The Act is a promulgation of the General Assembly in package form.Â  Can we break into the package and excise what we perceive (or want to be) the offending part?â€); Heggs v. State, 759 So.2d 620, 630 (Fla. 2000) (stating it is â€œmanifestly unsound to employ severabilityâ€).Â  Employing the severability clause in Act 187 turns the Court into a super-legislature.Â  \r\nBecause I find all of Act 187â€™s provisions germane to the one subject of economic development, I would hold the act constitutional in its entirety.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œEvery Act or resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.â€Â  S.C. CONST. Art. III, Â§ 17.\r\n[2]Â Â  The veto was based upon the Governorâ€™s â€œfundamental objection to receiving legislation that has numerous tack-ons, each containing their own complex policy considerations, many of which did not receive appropriate public debate.â€Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  We also granted intervenor status to Senator Glenn McConnell as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, and granted requests to file amicus briefs to ChangeSCNow and to the University of South Carolina Development Foundation, Medical University of South Carolina Foundation for Research Development, and Clemson University Foundation, Inc.\r\n[4]Â  By â€œRespondents,â€ we are speaking of the General Assembly.Â  Although the Attorney General is also technically a respondent, his brief is more in line with that of Petitioners.\r\n[5]Â Â  Section 3(C) of the Act also includes the provisions for issuance of bonds for a tourism training infrastructure project or a national and international convention and trade show center.Â  \r\n[6]Â  We simply cannot accept the dissentâ€™s assertion that the General Assembly may enact myriad measures, ranging from establishment of life sciences facilities to creation of a culinary arts institute, under the general guise of â€œeconomic development,â€ and thereby comport with the one subject requirement of Article III, Â§ 17.Â  For this Court to accept such a premise would give tacit approval to legislative logrolling.\r\n[7]Â  A â€œlife sciences facilityâ€ is defined as a â€œbusiness engaged in pharmaceutical, medicine, and related laboratory instrument manufacturing, processing, or research and development. . .â€Â  Section 1(B).Â  \r\n[8]Â Â  However, section 3(C) of the Act includes the provisions for issuance of bonds for a tourism training infrastructure project or a national and international convention and trade show center.Â  We simply do not see that these provisions are kindred in nature to the underlying spirit of the Life Sciences bill; accordingly, this provision is stricken as violative of the Article III, Â§ 17.Â Â  \r\n[9]Â  The purpose of this increase is â€œto advance economic development and create a knowledge based economy, thereby increasing job opportunities, and to facilitate and increase research within the State at the research universities.â€Â  \r\n[10] Some examples of topics beyond the scope of economic development are elections, judicial procedure, criminal law, and domestic-relations law.Â  The only provision invalidated by the majority that is arguably not germane to economic development is section 20, which â€œsets forth the General Assemblyâ€™s intent that the provisions set forth in the Act not be construed to appropriate funds.â€Â  The majority strikes section 20 because it is unrelated to life sciences.Â  It is unrelated, however, because it is an interpretation section.Â  Under the majorityâ€™s rationale, the section containing the severability clause should also be stricken, for it does not relate to life sciences, either.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25932","title":"Cole v.

(1991), and assumption of the risk.[1]Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioners/respondents (hereinafter collectively referred to as â€œColeâ€) brought this wrongful death action for the death of their son George Cole.Â  George drowned on August 6, 1997, at the age of fourteen while swimming at a Lake Murray recreation site owned by respondent/petitioner South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas (SCE&amp;G).Â  Cole alleged SCE&amp;G was negligent and grossly negligent for failing to provide lifeguards, life-saving equipment, and the proper warnings at the site.Â  On SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion for summary judgment, the trial court found SCE&amp;G was entitled to immunity from liability for simple negligence under the Recreational Use Statute and the trial proceeded only on the issue of SCE&amp;Gâ€™s gross negligence.\r\nAt trial, Cole produced evidence that George was at Lake Murray Site #1 with his friend Vincent, Vincentâ€™s mother, and her boyfriend.Â  By all accounts, George was a good swimmer.Â  The boys were told not to go into the water without telling the adults but they did not follow this directive.Â  Vincent testified that he and George swam out to the safety line, or buoy line.Â  They did not know the water at the buoy line was over their heads.Â  The two boys were racing back to shore when Vincent turned around and saw George floundering.Â  Vincent ran for a security guard who called 911.Â  \r\nAnother witness saw George crying for help and bobbing up and down.Â  Several bystanders attempted a rescue but could not find George under the water.Â  After about fifteen to twenty minutes, his body was found in seven or eight feet of water at the bottom of the lake.Â  He could not be revived.\r\nAt trial, Coleâ€™s aquatic safety expert, Stanly Shulman, testified that George would have lived had there been a lifeguard on duty because lifeguards are trained to search under water.Â  Further, bystanders could have saved him had there been safety equipment available.Â  Shulman also testified that the buoy line should have been placed at a depth of three-and-a-half to five feet, rather than seven to eight feet, and that depth markers should have been placed.Â  The signs warning simply â€œno lifeguard on dutyâ€ were inadequate in his opinion to warn of the dangers inherent in swimming in a lake.Â  Shulman also testified that SCE&amp;G failed to develop an effective risk management plan even after two previous drownings at the site.Â  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict for SCE&amp;G and Cole appealed.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment on the issue of immunity under the Recreational Use Statute but reversed and remanded for a new trial on the gross negligence cause of action because the trial judge failed to charge SCE&amp;Gâ€™s burden to prove its affirmative defense of assumption of the risk.Â  Both parties petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nColeâ€™s Appeal\r\nApplication of the Recreational Use Statute\r\nIn 1968, our legislature enacted a Recreational Use Statute (RUS), codified at Â§Â§ 27-3-10 through -70, which limits the liability of a landowner under certain conditions.Â  In pertinent part, these sections provide as follows.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 27-3-10. Declaration of purpose.\r\nThe purpose of this chapter is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability toward persons entering thereon for such purposes.\r\nÂ§ 27-3-20. Definitions.\r\n(c) &quot;Recreational purpose&quot; includes, but is not limited to, any of the following, or any combination thereof:Â  hunting, fishing, swimming, boating, camping, picnicking, hiking, pleasure driving, nature study, water skiing, summer and winter sports and viewing or enjoying historical, archaeological, scenic, or scientific sites.\r\n (d) &quot;Charge&quot; means the admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land.\r\nÂ§ 27-3-40. Effect of permission to use property for recreational purposes.\r\nExcept as specifically recognized by or provided in Â§ 27-3-60, an owner of land who permits without charge any person having sought such permission to use such property for recreational purposes does not thereby:\r\n(a) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any purpose.\r\n(b) Confer upon such person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed.\r\n(c) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to person or property caused by an act of omission of such persons.\r\nÂ§ 27-3-60. Certain liability not limited.\r\nNothing in this chapter limits in any way any liability which otherwise exists:\r\n(a) For grossly negligent, willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.\r\n(b) For injury suffered in any case where the owner of land charges persons who enter or go on the land for the recreational use thereof. . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nIt is undisputed that on the day George drowned, the driver of the car in which George was a passenger paid a three-dollar parking fee at SCE&amp;Gâ€™s recreational site on Lake Murray.Â  The fee is a per-vehicle charge and is not related to the number of visitors in the vehicle.Â  People who enter on foot or by bicycle are charged no fee.Â  The trial court ruled that the parking fee was not a â€œchargeâ€ within the meaning of the RUS and therefore SCE&amp;G was entitled to the protection of the RUS.Â  \r\nCole contends the parking fee is a â€œchargeâ€ that fits within the exception to landowner immunity stated in Â§ 27-3-60(b).Â  However, subsection (d) specifically defines â€œchargeâ€ as â€œthe admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land.â€Â  (emphasis added.)Â  This definition limits a â€œchargeâ€ to a general charge for admission to the property.Â  Courts interpreting this phrase have consistently held that a parking fee does not qualify as a â€œchargeâ€ because not everyone must pay it for admission to the property.Â  See Stone Mountain Mem. Assoc. v. Herrington, 171 S.E.2d 521 (Ga. 1969); City of Louisville v. Silcox, 977 S.W.2d 254 (Ky. App. 1998); Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707 (R.I. 2003); see generally Moss v. Depâ€™t of Nat. Resources, 404 N.E.2d 742 (Ohio 1980) (admission fee is a charge necessary to utilize the overall benefits of a recreational area).Â  We concur in this view and conclude a parking fee does not fit within the statutory definition of â€œcharge.â€Â  The trial court therefore properly held SCE&amp;G is entitled to immunity for simple negligence under the RUS.\r\nSCE&amp;Gâ€™s Appeal\r\n1.Â  Burden of proof on assumption of risk[2]\r\nThe trial judge declined to charge that SCE&amp;G had the burden of proving its affirmative defense of assumption of the risk and instead charged generally that SCE&amp;G had the burden of proving the plaintiffâ€™s â€œfaultâ€ for purposes of comparative negligence and that the jury should â€œconsider the defensesâ€ set forth by SCE&amp;G.Â  The only charge specifically regarding assumption of the risk was to define it as a defense and then instruct:Â  â€œIf you find that . . .the plaintiff assumed the risk associated with this activity, then you would find for the defendant.â€Â  The Court of Appeals found this charge was inadequate to properly instruct the jury regarding SCE&amp;Gâ€™s burden of proof and reversed on this issue.Â  SCE&amp;G contends this was error on the following grounds.\r\na.Â  The charge as a whole was sufficient.\r\nIt is well-settled that assumption of the risk is an affirmative defense which the defendant bears the burden of proving.Â  Baldwin v. Piedmont Mfg. Co., 102 S.C. 402, 86 S.E. 379 (1915); see also Englert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 433 S.E.2d 871 (1993) (defendant has burden of proving affirmative defenses listed in Rule 8(c), SCRCP); Rule 8(c), SCRCP (assumption of risk is affirmative defense).\r\nThe question here is whether the charge as a whole conveyed this burden to the jury.Â  We agree with the Court of Appeals that it did not, especially in light of the instructions defining the plaintiffâ€™s burden of proof:\r\n\r\nAs the trial begins, the scales are even, but throughout the course of the trial as the testimony and the evidence comes in, the scales may tip back and forth.Â  If after all of the evidence has been presented, the scales remain even or they tip ever so slightly in favor of the defendant, then the plaintiffs would not have satisfied their burden of proof in this particular matter.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the charge regarding SCE&amp;Gâ€™s affirmative defense indicated only that the jury should â€œconsiderâ€ SCE&amp;Gâ€™s defenses and if the jury found the plaintiff assumed the risk, it should find for SCE&amp;G.Â  This charge gave the jury no standard by which to determine if SCE&amp;G had established its defense.Â  The Court of Appeals properly found the charge inadequate.\r\nb.Â  Primary implied assumption of the risk.\r\nSCE&amp;G contends there was no need to charge assumption of the risk under the doctrine of â€œprimary implied assumption of the risk.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nPrimary implied assumption of the risk arises when the plaintiff impliedly assumes risks inherent in a particular activity.Â  Davenport, 333 S.C. at 81, 508 S.E.2d at 570.Â  It is not a true affirmative defense but is another way of stating there is no duty to the plaintiff.Â  Id.Â  We disagree SCE&amp;G owed no duty here.Â  A landowner has a duty to warn a licensee of concealed dangerous conditions or activities known to the landowner.Â  Vogt v. Murraywood Swim &amp; Racquet Club, 357 S.C. 506, 593 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Despite immunity under the RUS, SCE&amp;G may still be liable for gross negligence which is the failure to exercise even slight care.Â  Clyburn v. Sumter County Sch. Dist. No. 17, 317 S.C. 50, 451 S.E.2d 885 (1994).Â  Whether SCE&amp;G met this standard of care in warning only that there was no lifeguard is a question of fact for the jury. \r\nc.Â  Harmless error\r\nSCE&amp;G contends any error in the failure to charge the burden of proof is harmless because the jury must have concluded Cole failed to prove gross negligence.Â  SCE&amp;G bases this assertion on the fact that the only question put to the trial court by the jurors was regarding the distinction between negligence and gross negligence.Â  This question, however, does not indicate the jury failed to consider assumption of the risk, especially since SCE&amp;Gâ€™s case basically turned on proving that George assumed the risk of swimming in Lake Murray.Â  \r\nd.Â  Assumption of risk as a matter of law\r\nSCE&amp;G contends George assumed the risk inherent in swimming in a natural body of water and since his fault was greater than 50%, the case should not be remanded for a new trial.\r\nThere are four requirements to establishing the defense of assumption of risk: (1) the plaintiff must have knowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition; (2) the plaintiff must know the condition is dangerous; (3) the plaintiff must appreciate the nature and extent of the danger; and (4) the plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself to the danger.Â  Davenport, 333 S.C. 79, 508 S.E.2d 569.Â  According to Coleâ€™s expert witness, the warning simply stating there was no lifeguard was insufficient notice of the danger involved.Â  There remains a factual issue whether George was sufficiently warned of the danger to have legally assumed the risk of swimming in Lake Murray. Â SCE&amp;G has not established assumption of the risk as a matter of law.\r\n2.Â  Effect of Regulation 61-50\r\nAt trial, Cole introduced evidence that at the time of Georgeâ€™s drowning, DHEC Regulation 61-50 required the use of lifeguards and lifesaving equipment.[3] Â SCE&amp;G responded with evidence of a 1978 administrative ruling exempting it from this requirement.Â  In 1980, the regulation was amended.Â  The issue at trial was whether SCE&amp;Gâ€™s exemption remained valid under the amended regulation.\r\nRather than decide this issue, the trial judge ruled it would be submitted to the jury as a factual issue.Â  In charging the jury, however, the trial judge charged only that evidence of a violation of a regulation is evidence of negligence.Â  Cole appealed, contending the trial judge should have decided whether the regulation applies as a matter of law.Â  SCE&amp;G argued in response that the regulation conflicts with the RUS and therefore as a matter of law it does not apply regardless of whether the 1978 exemption remained valid.Â  Rather than resolve this issue, the Court of Appeals concluded any error was harmless because the trial judgeâ€™s charge instructed the jury to determine whether the regulation was violated, an instruction that was favorable to Cole who therefore could not show prejudice on appeal.\r\nSCE&amp;G contends the Court of Appeals should have addressed whether the regulation applies as a matter of law to resolve whether on remand a violation should be charged as evidence of negligence.Â  We agree and find as a matter of law the regulation does not apply.\r\nThe purpose of the RUS as stated in the statute is â€œto encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes.â€Â  Â§ 27-3-10.Â  Under the RUS a landownerâ€™s liability is limited to gross negligence, which is defined as the failure to exercise slight care.Â  Clyburn, supra.Â  By contrast, Regulation 61-50, as it read at the time this cause of action arose,[4] imposed â€œowner responsibilityâ€ for lifeguards and lifesaving equipment and subjected the violator to fines and imprisonment.Â  This regulation, as applied, conflicts with the RUS since a qualifying landowner under the RUS has a duty to exercise only slight care.Â  A duty to provide recreational safety features such as lifeguards and lifesaving equipment exceeds this â€œslight careâ€ standard.Â  Since a regulation cannot alter or add to a statute, Regulation 61-50 does not apply.Â  SeeÂ  McNickelâ€™s, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Rev., 331 S.C. 629, 503 S.E.2d 723 (1998).\r\nIn sum, on remand a violation of Regulation 61-50â€™s safety provisions should not be charged as evidence of negligence since SCE&amp;G has no duty under the RUS to exercise more than slight care.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Cole v. South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas, Inc., 355 S.C. 183, 584 S.E.2d 405 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\n[2]Assumption of the risk is abolished for causes of action accruing after November 9, 1998.Â  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998).Â  This cause of action arose before that date. \r\n[3]This regulation was subsequently amended in 1999 as discussed at footnote 4, infra. \r\n[4] Regulation 61-50 was amended in 1999 and now applies only to a natural swimming area if there is â€œa fee or membership required to gain access to a natural freshwater location.â€Â  Further, the regulation no longer requires safety measures such as lifeguards and life-saving equipment but applies solely to monitoring water quality. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25934","title":"Angus v.

Sidney Connor, IV, of Kelaher, Connell &amp; Connor, P.C., and Natale Fata, both of Surfside Beach, for appellant/respondent.\r\nJames B. Van Osdell and Charles B. Jordan, Jr., both of Van Osdell, Lester, Howe &amp; Jordan, of Myrtle Beach, for respondent/appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  This action was brought by appellant/respondent Angus, a municipal taxpayer, challenging the property tax rollback millage rate adopted by respondent/appellant City of Myrtle Beach (Myrtle Beach) for the 1999-2000 fiscal year.Â  Angus appeals a final order holding that Myrtle Beach did not violate S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-320 (2004) or Â§ 12-37-251(E) (2000).Â  Myrtle Beach cross-appeals an order certifying a class of municipal taxpayers, and an order refusing to join the South Carolina Department of Revenue as a party.Â  We affirm the rulings appealed by Myrtle Beach.Â  We agree with Angus that the millage rate was improperly calculated, reverse on this issue, and remand for the trial court to determine the appropriate relief.\r\nFACTS\r\nAs provided by Â§ 6-1-320(A),[1] in most years, a municipality may raise its general operating (GO) millage rate above that of the year before only by the amount the consumer price index rose the preceding year.Â  In a year when a reassessment program[2] is implemented, however, the â€œrollback millage,â€ rather than the previous yearâ€™s millage, is the base GO millage rate.Â  Rollback\r\n&nbsp;millage is calculated under Â§ 12-37-251(E).[3]\r\nFollowing a countywide reassessment in 1998, Myrtle Beach was required to use rollback millage calculated under Â§ 12-37-251(E) in setting its 1999-2000 GO millage rate.Â  Section 12-37-351(E) requires that the total assessed value of property, which is the divisor used in calculating the rollback millage, be adjusted by deducting the amount of the increase attributable to (1) new construction, (2) renovations to existing structures, and (3) property and improvements not previously taxed.Â  In calculating its rollback millage for 1999-2000, Myrtle Beach applied an additional variable to further reduce property values; it denominated this variable the â€œappeals allowance.â€Â  This variable took into account the fact that some owners would successfully appeal the new valuations placed on their properties.Â  Myrtle Beach used an appeals allowance of 7.5%.\r\nIn addition, Myrtle Beach adjusted the dividend used in calculating the rollback millage.Â  This dividend is the prior yearâ€™s property tax revenues.Â  Although Â§ 12-37-251(E) does not provide for any adjustment of this figure, Myrtle Beach applied an estimated collection rate of 86% to account for the fact that not all taxes billed would be collected.Â  It is undisputed that in making these adjustments to the rollback millage calculation specified by\r\nÂ§ 12-37-251(E), Myrtle Beach did not utilize the provisions of Â§ 6-1-320(C)[4] which allows the millage rate limitation to be overridden and the millage rate increased by a positive majority vote of the governing body at a special public meeting.Â \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in determining that Myrtle Beachâ€™s method of calculating rollback millage was proper?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAngus contends that the circuit court erred in holding Myrtle Beach did not violate Â§ 12-37-251(E) by adding two variables to the statutory formula for calculating rollback millage without holding a public hearing as required by Â§ 6-1-320(C).Â  We agree that Â§ 12-37-251(E) and Â§ 6-1-320(A) do not permit Myrtle Beach to make these adjustments unless it utilizes the provisions of Â§ 6-1-320(C).\r\nAs noted above, Â§ 12-37-251(E) permits the use of three adjustments in calculating the rollback millage.Â  Angus argues, and we agree, that application of the statutory maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius mandates that these variables and no others be used in calculating the rollback millage.Â  The circuit court found this maxim inapplicable, reasoning that the variables used by Myrtle Beach â€œappear to be sensible and necessary devicesâ€ and that denying their use â€œwould lead to a result that is unworkable, inefficient, inaccurate, and problematic.â€Â  The variables permitted by the statute are clear and unambiguous; regardless of the merit of Myrtle Beachâ€™s formula, it is not what the statute allows.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000) (where statutory language is clear and unambiguous, enumeration of certain exceptions excludes others).Â  \r\nThe fixing of a tax rate is a legislative function that must be given the greatest respect by the courts unless that function is exercised in an illegal manner.Â  Simkins v. City of Spartanburg, 269 S.C. 243, 237 S.E.2d 69 (1977).[5]Â  It is basic hornbook law that when a government entity levies a tax, â€œthe method outlined in the applicable law must be followed, at least in substance and especially concerning all mandatory provisions.â€Â  16 McQuillin Mun. Corp. Â§ 44.97 (3d ed. 1998).Â  We conclude Myrtle Beachâ€™s use of non-statutory variables violates Â§ 12-37-251(E).Â  Further, Myrtle Beach failed to hold a public meeting as provided under Â§ 6-1-320(C) which would have allowed it to legally override the mandatory requirements of subsection (A).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court erred in upholding Myrtle Beachâ€™s use of non-statutory variables to calculate rollback millage without the override vote required under Â§ 6-1-320(C) and we remand for the trial court to determine the appropriate relief.Â  We affirm Myrtle Beachâ€™s appeal pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR.Â  See Waller v. Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n, 300 S.C. 465, 388 S.E.2d 799 (1990) (decision to certify a class rests in trial judgeâ€™s discretion); Charleston County Parents for Public Schools, Inc. v. Moseley, 343 S.C. 509, 541 S.E.2d 543 (2001) (party that is not indispensable need not be joined under Rule 19, SCRCP).\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice Deadra L. Jefferson, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I agree that Myrtle Beach erred in relying upon non-statutory factors in computing the GO rollback millage.Â  I would find, however, that Angus has shown no prejudice and would therefore affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order denying her relief. \r\nAt the time Myrtle Beach was calculating its 1999-2000 GO millage rate in June 1999, it was required to estimate the prior yearâ€™s property tax revenues since final figures are not provided to it by the county auditor until August.Â  The city estimated its prior yearâ€™s revenue by applying an 86% â€œcollection rateâ€ to the overall amount billed.Â  Further, while Myrtle Beach had available the new assessment values, the appeals process whereby property owners may seek a reduction in valuation was not yet complete.\r\nThe use of non-statutory variables violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-31-251(E) (2000).Â  The reality of municipal budgeting is that it is an inexact science, relying as it must upon estimates and â€œbest guesses.â€Â  As this Court recognized in Simkins v. City of Spartanburg, 269 S.C. 243, 237 S.E.2d 69 (1977), municipalities must rely upon imperfect and incomplete calendar year figures to meet their obligation to enact a fiscal year budget.Â  Simkins held that a city â€œcan proceed on the basis of past experience and the best available estimate of revenueâ€¦.â€Â  Id. at 249, 237 S.E.2d at 72; see also County of Lee v. Stevens, 277 S.C. 421, 289 S.E.2d 155 (1982) (â€œIt is a fact of life not all property taxes are ever collectedâ€). \r\nAlthough Myrtle Beach erred in relying on the nonstatutory variables, Angus has not shown prejudice.Â  First, she does not challenge the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Myrtle Beach could lawfully have levied a total of 65 mills in 1999-2000, but levied only 61.Â  Further, Angus does not challenge the circuit courtâ€™s calculation showing that Myrtle Beachâ€™s GO millage for 1999-2000 exceeded that permitted by Â§ 12-37-251(E) by approximately 4.44 mills.Â  When the city learned it had overcollected taxes for 1999-2000, it reduced the following yearâ€™s millage by 2.3 mills.Â  As the Court said in Lee County, â€œIf in the last analysis during some particular year there is a modest surplus or a modest deficit, no serious harm will come.Â  Adjustments can be made the ensuing year.â€Â  Id. at 427, 289 S.E.2d at 158.Â  Myrtle Beach made such an adjustment.\r\nI would hold that while Myrtle Beach erred in calculating the GO rollback millage, this error was within the latitude afforded taxing entities that must rely on incomplete figures when calculating millage rates. [6]Â  Simkins, supra; Lee County, supra.Â  Further, I recognize that in calculating this rollback millage, Myrtle Beach relied upon the advice provided by the Department of Revenue to all municipalities located in counties that had undergone a reassessment.[7]Â  The effect of the majorityâ€™s decision today is to subject these municipalities to refund litigation over relatively nominal sums.Â  Such a result is not required by our precedents, and imposes an unnecessary fiscal burden on our cities and their current taxpayers.Â  I would affirm the order of the circuit court. \r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Section 6-1-320(A) provides:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Section 12-37-251(E), a local governing body may increase the millage rate imposed for general operating purposes above the rate imposed for such purposes for the preceding tax year only to the extent of the increase in the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year.Â  However, in the year in which a reassessment program is implemented, the rollback millage, as calculated pursuant to Section 12-37-251(E), must be used in lieu of the previous yearâ€™s millage rate. \r\n\r\n[2]Countywide reassessments and equalizations of real property are conducted every fifth year.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§12-43-217 (2000).Â  Municipalities and other taxing entities within a county use the countyâ€™s property valuations.\r\n[3]Section 12-37-251(E) provides:\r\n\r\nRollback millage is calculated by dividing the prior year property tax revenues by the adjusted total assessed value applicable in the year the values derived from a countywide equalization and reassessment program are implemented.Â  This amount of assessed value must be adjusted by deducting assessments added for property or improvements not previously taxed, for new construction, and for renovation of existing structures. \r\n\r\n[4]Section 6-1-320(C) provides:\r\n\r\nThe millage rate limitation provided for in subsection (A) of this section may be overridden and the millage rate may be further increased by a positive majority vote of the appropriate governing body.Â  The vote must be taken at a specially-called meeting held solely for the purpose of taking a vote to increase the millage rate.Â  The governing body must provide public notice of the meeting notifying the public that the governing body is meeting to vote to override the limitation and increase the millage rate.Â  Public comment must be received by the governing body prior to the override vote.\r\n\r\n[5] Despite our recognition of this basis principle in Simkins, we excused an illegal tax rate in County of Lee v. Stevens, 277 S.C. 421, 289 S.E.2d 155 (1982).Â  In that case, a county auditor challenged the countyâ€™s authority to set the tax rate before current property values were known.Â  We held the modest deficit caused by the countyâ€™s error could be excused, but we prospectively ordered the tax rate to be based upon current property valuations.Â  We found a prospective ruling necessary as a matter of â€œpracticability and reasonablenessâ€ because of the various methods in use at the time by local governments statewide.\r\nWe view County of Lee v. Stevens as a narrow exception and decline to follow it here.Â  The critical factor in that case was that there was no standard procedure in place to accomplish the statutory requirement at the local level; to strictly enforce that requirement would have caused havoc for local governments statewide.Â  Here, there is no such special circumstance.Â  We cannot condone a taxing entityâ€™s illegal acts in fixing the tax rate simply because the resulting impact may be characterized as modest.Â  \r\n[6] A taxpayer, whose property tax bill was too high because a city or county made a minor error in calculating the millage rate in reliance upon advice from the Department of Revenue, is in a different position from a taxpayer who has been required to pay a disproportionate share of property taxes as the result of the taxing entityâ€™s adoption of a patently unlawful ordinance.Â  Thus, Angus and others affected by Myrtle Beachâ€™s good faith efforts to set the appropriate millage are not in the same position as Charleston County taxpayers who were unlawfully taxed pursuant to an ordinance capping valuation increases for owner-occupied residences at 15% while placing no cap on non-owner occupied property.Â  These taxpayers were entitled to a refund.Â  See Riverwoods, LLC v. County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651 (2002).Â  The difference between the taxing decision made by Myrtle Beach and that made by Charleston County is more than a matter of degree: Charleston created two classes of taxpayers, in order to lighten the tax burden on one group by shifting it to the other.Â  Further, the impact of the Charleston Ordinance on owners of non-capped property could not be characterized as â€œmodest.â€\r\n[7]  Countywide reassessments and equalizations of real property are conducted every fifth year.Â  S.C.
