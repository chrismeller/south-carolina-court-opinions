Claire, South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: The post-conviction relief (PCR) court granted Johnell Porter (Porter) a new trial after finding that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a Brady motion, failing to investigate the validity of a photographic identification, and failing to interview a witness.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition to review the PCR courtâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nPorter was indicted in 1980 for the armed robbery of Morris Jewelers.Â  Porter pled guilty and was sentenced to twelve years confinement, consecutive to any sentence imposed by other jurisdictions.[1]Â  Porter did not appeal his guilty plea or sentence.Â  \r\nPorter applied for PCR in 1984.Â  The PCR petition was dismissed without prejudice, with leave to re-file when Porter returned to South Carolina to serve his sentence.Â  Porter refiled his petition for PCR in 1997, after being returned to South Carolina.Â  This petition was also dismissed.Â  Porter subsequently moved for a new PCR hearing, which was granted.Â  At the hearing, Porter argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a Brady motion, failing to investigate the validity of a photographic identification, and failing to interview a witness.Â  The PCR judge agreed with Porter and granted Porter a new trial.Â  \r\nThe State appealed, raising the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the PCR court err in finding Porterâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to file a Brady motion?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the PCR court err in finding Porterâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to investigate the validity of the photographic identification?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the PCR court err in finding Porterâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to interview a witness?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Â Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).&nbsp; On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.&nbsp; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).&nbsp; Â If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (citing Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)).\r\nLaw / analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBrady Motion \r\nThe State contends that the PCR court erred in finding that Porterâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a Brady motion.Â Â  We agree.\r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove: (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the applicant's case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). Â Â An applicant may attack the voluntary and intelligent character of a guilty plea entered on the advice of counsel only by demonstrating that counselâ€™s representation was below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â Â  Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. 16, 20, 546 S.E.2d 417, 419 (2001). Â Further, the applicant must show that there is a reasonable probability that he would have insisted on proceeding to trial on the matter instead of pleading guilty.Â  Id.Â \r\nAdditionally, the applicant has the burden of proving the allegations of the PCR petition.Â  Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 302, 509 S.E.2d 807, 809 (1998).Â  \r\nThe Brady disclosure rule requires the prosecution to provide to the defendant any evidence in the prosecutionâ€™s possession that may be favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment.Â  State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 452, 503 S.E.2d 214, 220 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963)).Â  Favorable evidence includes both exculpatory evidence and evidence which may be used for impeachment.Â  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, (1985).Â  Materiality of evidence is determined based on the reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense.Â  Kennerly, 331 S.C. at 453, 503 S.E.2d at 220.Â  â€œA â€˜reasonable probabilityâ€™ of a different result is accordingly shown when the government's evidentiary suppression â€˜undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€™â€ Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. at 3381.Â Â  Furthermore, the prosecution has the duty to disclose such evidence even in the absence of a request by the accused.Â  United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392, (1976).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the prosecution did not possess any material evidence which was not disclosed to Porterâ€™s trial counsel.Â  The evidence Porter claims his trial counsel failed to obtain through a Brady motion consists of the fact that the witness did not identify Porter at the crime scene.Â  This information was immaterial in light of the subsequent identification of Porter in a photographic line-up.Â  Further, Porter has failed to provide any evidence of probative value that would indicate the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Stated otherwise, the confidence of the proceeding has not been undermined.Â  Regardless of the witnessâ€™ inability to identify Porter at the scene of the crime, the fact remains that Porter was positively identified by the witness in a photographic line-up.Â Â  Moreover, Porterâ€™s co-defendant also indicated a willingness to identify Porter as one of the perpetrators.Â  In addition, Porterâ€™s trial counsel testified that he informed Porter that the solicitor would request a life sentence if Porter went to trial and was found guilty. Â Accordingly, we find that the alleged nondisclosure was not material exculpatory evidence.Â  \r\nÂ While the materiality of the evidence is important, the dispositive issue in this case is whether trial counsel rendered reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms.Â  The United States Supreme Court has held that, although not required to do so by law, if a prosecutor adopts an\r\nâ€œopen file policyâ€ where the defense is allowed to review the prosecution file in satisfaction of the prosecutionâ€™s discovery obligations and the duty to disclose material exculpatory evidence as a matter of the due process clause, defense counsel may reasonably rely on that file to contain all materials the state is obligated to disclose.[2]  Â Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 283 n.23, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1949 n.23 (1999).Â  \r\nPorterâ€™s trial counsel testified at the PCR hearing that he did not file a formal Brady motion because the solicitor had an open file policy.Â  Porterâ€™s trial counsel was allowed to review all the evidence in the solicitorâ€™s file. Â Under Strickler, Porterâ€™s trial counselâ€™s failure to file the Brady motion was reasonable in light of the open file policy.Â  \r\n For these reasons, we find that Porterâ€™s trial counselâ€™s failure to file a Brady motion did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPhotographic Line-up \r\nThe State contends that the PCR court erred in finding that Porterâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the validity of the photographic identification.Â  We agree.\r\nFailure to conduct an independent investigation does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel when the allegation is supported only by mere speculation as to result.Â  Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 334, 496 S.E.2d 415, 417 (1998).\r\nPorterâ€™s trial counsel testified that he had the opportunity to examine the photographic line-up from which Porter was identified.Â  Counsel further testified that the line-up was reasonable.Â  The photographic line-up formed the basis upon which the arrest warrant for Porter was issued.Â  No probative evidence was presented at the PCR hearing to show that the statement in the arrest warrant was false, [3] or that the witnessâ€™s identification of Porter from the photographic line-up was false or unreasonable.Â  Additionally, no evidence was presented at the PCR hearing showing that further investigation would have lead to a different result.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Porterâ€™s trial counselâ€™s failure to further investigate the identification was not deficient, and thus did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWitness Interview \r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in finding that Porterâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview a witness.Â  We agree.\r\nMere speculation of what a witnessâ€™ testimony may be is insufficient to satisfy the burden of showing prejudice in a petition for PCR.Â  Bannister, 333 S.C. at 303, 509 S.E.2d at 809.\r\nPorterâ€™s trial counsel testified that he did not interview the witness because he believed the information that was given to him by the solicitor and the chief of police was true.Â  Despite the improvidence of counselâ€™s reliance on these statements alone, Porter has not presented any evidence showing that an interview of the witness would have yielded a result different from that which Porterâ€™s trial counsel believed at the time of the plea. Â Porter pled guilty in light of the complete information that was available at that time.Â  Therefore, we hold that Porterâ€™s trial counselâ€™s failure to interview a witness did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nBecause we find that trial counselâ€™s performance was not deficient, Porter has not satisfied the first prong of Strickland.Â  Accordingly, a finding of prejudice is not required.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s ruling and reinstate Porterâ€™s conviction and sentence. \r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the post-conviction relief (PCR) judgeâ€™s order because I find there is some evidence of probative value in the record to support his findings.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\n The PCR judge found trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a Brady motion.Â  Had such a motion been made, the State presumably would have revealed the fact that the witness who identified Porter in a photo line-up had been unable to identify him at the scene, a fact which would have had impeachment value had the witness testified at trial.\r\nThe first question is not whether the PCR court erred in finding counselâ€™s performance deficient in failing to make a Brady request, but rather there is any evidentiary support in the record for the finding.[4]Â  Cherry, supra.Â  While I may not have reached the same conclusion as the PCR judge regarding counselâ€™s performance, I cannot say it lacks evidentiary support especially in light of trial counselâ€™s testimony that he did no independent investigation but instead relied solely on information supplied by law enforcement and by the solicitorâ€™s office.\r\n The second question is whether the record contains any evidence of probative value to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Porter establishedÂ  prejudice as the result of this deficient performance, that is, evidence that but for counselâ€™s deficient performance Porter would not have pled guilty but would have insisted on going to trial.Â  In my opinion, Porterâ€™s testimony that he would not have pled had he had all relevant information is sufficient to uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s prejudice finding. E.g., Solomon v. State, 313 S.C. 526, 443 S.E.2d 540 (1994) (great appellate deference to PCR judgeâ€™s credibility findings required Court to uphold judgeâ€™s determination even where testimony at PCR hearing flatly contradicted by trial record).\r\n While I may not have made the same findings as did the PCR judge on the failure to file a Brady motion claim, under our limited scope of review these findings should be upheld.Â  Cherry, supra.Â  I therefore respectfully dissent, and would affirm the grant of PCR to Porter.\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of the plea, Porter was incarcerated in North Carolina.\r\n[2] It is important to note that we do not find that the prosecution is presumed to comply with Brady simply by instituting an open file policy.Â  The duty to disclose under Brady applies to the prosecution regardless of the manner in which the prosecution chooses to do so.\r\n[3] The Chief of Police made the sworn statement in the arrest warrant that the â€œ[d]efendant was identified as one of the suspects involved in the armed robbery of Morris Jewelers in Great Falls, SC.Â  [A witness] identified the defendant in a photo-line up [sic].â€\r\n[4]  Certainly had the PCR found counselâ€™s performance not deficient because he reasonably relied upon the solicitorâ€™s open file policy, that finding would be upheld under Cherry.Â  Nothing in Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999), however, precludes a finding that such reliance was not reasonable.Â  This is especially so where, as here, the undisclosed evidence is not a document or other physical item, but rather something intangible, a witnessâ€™s non-identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26142","title":"Baxter v.

Van Riper, of Collins &amp; Lacy, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is a workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  A single commissioner of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission awarded attorney fees to Appellant Willie Baxter (Appellant) in connection with Appellantâ€™s motion to compel Respondents Martin Brothers, Inc. and Capital City Insurance (Respondents) to comply with a consent order.Â  The commissionâ€™s appellate panel reversed the award of attorney fees, holding that under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act,[1] the commissioner lacked authority to grant such an award.Â  On further review, the circuit court affirmed the appellate panelâ€™s decision.Â  We certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we now affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter Respondents failed to satisfy most of the obligations imposed on them by the consent order, Appellant moved the commission to order Respondents to comply with the order and to hold Respondents in contempt.Â  Agreeing with Appellant that Respondents had failed to comply with the consent order, the single commissioner ordered Respondents to â€œimmediately complyâ€ with the order and to â€œprovide proof of compliance to [Appellantâ€™s] counsel within twenty days of the hearing.â€Â  The commissioner further ordered Respondents to â€œpay $250.00 to [Appellantâ€™s] counsel for attorneyâ€™s fees due as a result of bringing this Motion.â€Â  The commissioner then held that if Respondents were to fail to provide the proof of compliance within twenty days, then Respondents would â€œbe held in contemptâ€ and â€œa further hearing [would] be held to determine appropriate penalties and sanctions for contempt.â€Â  \r\nRespondents appealed to the appellate panel, challenging only the award of attorney fees.Â  Respondents argued that the commissioner lacked authority to award attorney fees in connection with the motion, because neither the consent order nor the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act provided such authority.Â  See Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993) (citing â€œ[t]he general rule ... that attorney's fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statuteâ€).Â  In response, Appellant argued that the rule that attorney fees can be awarded as a litigation expense only if permitted by statute or contract was inapplicable.Â  Appellant asserted that the commissioner had awarded attorney fees not as an expense of bringing the motion to compel, but rather as a sanction for contempt pursuant to South Carolina Code sections 42-1-540[2] and 42-3-150.[3] Â \r\nThe appellate panel reversed the award.Â  The panel found that the single commissioner had awarded attorney fees as a litigation expense, not as a sanction for contempt.Â  The panel then held that the commissioner lacked authority to award attorney fees as a litigation expense.\r\nAppellant appealed to the circuit court, again arguing that the commissioner had properly awarded attorney fees as a sanction for contempt.Â  The court agreed with Appellant as to the nature of the award, but nevertheless held that the decision of the appellate panel was correct.Â  The court found that under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, the commissioner lacked a general power of contempt and therefore lacked authority to award attorney fees as a sanction for contempt.Â  Thus, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate panel to reverse the award of attorney fees.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the single commissioner awarded attorney fees as a litigation expense or as a sanction for contempt.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n        Whether the single\r\n          commissioner had authority to award attorney fees.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 1-23-380(A)(6)[4] governs our review of workersâ€™ compensation decisions.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  We must determine whether the circuit court properly determined whether the appellate panelâ€™s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.Â  See id. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442 (holding that the full commission is â€œthe ultimate fact finderâ€). \r\nI.Â  Nature of the Award\r\nIt is clear from the single commissionerâ€™s order that he awarded attorney fees as an expense of bringing the motion to compel, not as a sanction for contempt.Â  The commissioner did not even hold Respondents in contempt.Â  Rather, the commissioner warned that Respondents would be held in contempt if they failed to provide proof of compliance with the consent order within twenty days of the hearing.Â  Not only did this warning not constitute a holding of contempt, but also it related to the requirement that Respondents provide proof of compliance, not to their obligation to pay attorney fees.[5]Â  \r\nThe circuit court therefore erred in reversing the appellate panelâ€™s finding that the single commissioner awarded attorney fees as a litigation expense. Â Â \r\nII.Â  Authority to Award Attorney Fees\r\nAs the appellate panel held, the single commissioner lacked authority to award attorney fees as a litigation expense.Â  â€œThe general rule is that attorney's fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993).Â  Neither the consent order nor any statute provides for an award of attorney fees.Â  Although the circuit court failed to address the proper issue, the court reached the correct result in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s decision.Â  We therefore affirm as modified.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice Roger L.

2005 of the State Retirement System Preservation and Investment Reform Act[2] (Act 153).Â  Act 153 amends several statutes relating to the operation of the South Carolina Retirement System.Â  Specifically, Act 153 brought about significant changes for employees who participate in TERI.[3]Â  In addition, Act 153 affected employees who are not TERI participants but have retired and returned to work for the State in positions covered by the retirement system (working retiree program).[4]\r\nIn January of 2001, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted the Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program (TERI).Â  Hereinafter, we will refer to this statute as â€œold TERI.â€Â  In addition, we will refer to those who elected to participate in the old TERI program before July 1, 2005 as â€œold TERI participants.â€Â  Further, those eligible to retire but not participating in TERI could participate in the working retiree program.Â  We will refer to this program as the â€œold working retiree programâ€ and its participants as â€œold working retirees.â€\r\nPursuant to the old TERI program, old TERI participants could retire, but continue to work for the State for up to five years following their retirement.Â  During these five years, the State withheld the normal pension benefits due to old TERI participants.Â  Under the old TERI program the State paid these accrued benefits either as a lump sum at the end of five years or the old TERI participant could roll the accrued benefits over into a qualifying retirement fund.Â  Under the old TERI statute, an old TERI participant made no further employee contributions to the retirement system.Â  In return, the State was able to utilize experienced, well-trained employees for up to five years after they retired.Â  In addition, the old TERI participants did not accrue further service credit during their participation in the old TERI program and were not eligible for group life insurance or disability retirement benefits.\r\nIn contrast, under the old working retiree statute, the statute considered a working retiree to be retired and did not require the old working retiree to make further employee contributions to the system.Â  However, the old working retiree statute limited the old working retiree to making no more than $50,000 per year in salary.\r\nPetitioners (old TERI program participants and old working retiree participants) who retired before July 1, 2005 under the old TERI program or pursuant to the old working retiree statute brought this action against the State of South Carolina and South Carolina Retirement System (Respondents or the State), alleging breach of contract.Â  In addition, the old TERI program participants and old working retiree participants argue the State should be estopped from retroactively applying new legislation to Petitioners.Â  Finally, the old TERI program participants and old working retiree participants claim violations of the Takings and Due Process Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.Â  This Court granted Petitionersâ€™ request for the case to be heard in the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.Â  We hold that the State unlawfully breached its contract with those Petitioners participating in the old TERI program.Â  In addition, we remand the old working retiree participantsâ€™ breach of contract claim to the trial court for action consistent with this opinion.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe portion of Act 153 at the center of this controversy pertains to a financial contribution that old TERI and old working retiree participants are now required to submit to the retirement system.Â  The changes wrought by Act 153 dramatically alter the former versions of the TERI and working retiree statutes.Â  Under the prior enactment of the TERI and working retiree programs, neither the old TERI participants nor the old working retiree participants were required to contribute to the retirement system.Â  Under the terms of the prior programs, for all intents and purposes, both the old TERI participants and the old working retiree participants were considered to be retired.Â  \r\nPetitioners claim that the requirement that they now contribute 6.25% of their annual salary to the retirement program constitutes a breach of contract.[5]Â  In the alternative, if no contract is found, Petitioners assert that the State should be estopped from requiring further contributions due to Petitionersâ€™ reliance on the terms of the former TERI and working retiree programs.Â  Further, Petitioners claim that the enactment of Act 153 constitutes an unconstitutional taking and a deprivation of their property without due process of law.\r\nPreviously, Petitioners sought a temporary restraining order seeking to enjoin the State from collecting Petitionersâ€™ contributions to the retirement system.Â  The circuit court granted the motion, preventing the State from collecting contributions from the four named Petitioners in this case.Â  Respondents appealed and petitioned for a writ of supersedeas.Â  However, while the motions were pending in the circuit court, the case was certified to the Supreme Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  As a result, Petitioners filed a petition for original jurisdiction. \r\nThis Court denied the Stateâ€™s petition for supersedeas, but granted the petition for original jurisdiction.Â  In addition, Petitioners filed a motion for class certification, which the Court granted.Â  The class was deemed to consist of all participants who had retired under the old TERI program under the former version of Â§ 9-1-2210, and all those participants considered old working retirees under the previous version of Â§ 9-1-1790; all of whom elected to participate in the programs before July 1, 2005.Â  Further, the Court ordered all contributions withdrawn from the class members be transferred into an interest bearing account and escrowed pending the outcome of this litigation.Â Â  As a result, the following issues are before the Court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Do the statutory provisions of the former versions of the TERI and the working retiree programs create contracts?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Is the State estopped from requiring Petitioners to make contributions to the retirement system?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Does the enactment of Act 153 constitute an unconstitutional taking under either the State or Federal Constitution?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;\r\n         Does Act 153 violate the Due Process Clause of the State or Federal Constitution?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  TERI Program\r\nOld TERI program participants argue that the statutory provisions governing old TERI participants created contracts which the State breached by requiring previously enrolled TERI participants to contribute to the retirement system.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, statutes do not create contractual rights.Â  Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 470 U.S. 451, 465-66 (1985).Â Â Â  However, if the statute indicates that the legislature intended to bind itself contractually, a contract may be found to exist.Â  Id.Â  In South Carolina, contractual rights are created by statute only when they are expressly found in the language of the legislation.Â  See S.C. Public Serv. Auth. v. Summers, 282 S.C. 148, 318 S.E.2d 113 (1984).\r\nWith the above guidelines in mind, we turn to the prior version of the TERI statute, enacted in 2001, to determine if a contract existed.Â  In the present case, the relevant portions of the prior statute provide that a member of the State Retirement Systerm eligible to retire may:\r\n\r\n[e]lect to participate in the Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program (program). A member electing to participate in the program retires for purposes of the system, and the memberâ€™s normal retirement benefit is calculated on the basis of the memberâ€™s average final compensation and service credit at the time the program period begins. The program participant shall agree to continue employment with an employer participating in the system for a program period, not to exceed five years.\r\n. . . . \r\n\r\n(B) During the specified program period, receipt of the memberâ€™s normal retirement benefit is deferred. The memberâ€™s deferred monthly benefit must be placed in the system's trust fund on behalf of the member. No interest is paid on the memberâ€™s deferred monthly benefit placed in the systemâ€™s trust fund during the specified program period.\r\n. . . . \r\n(D) A program participant is retired from the retirement system as of the\r\nbeginning of the program period. A program participant makes no further employee contributions to the system, accrues no service credit during the program period, and is not eligible to receive group life insurance benefits or disability retirement benefits. Accrued annual leave and sick leave used in any manner in the calculation of the program participantâ€™s retirement benefit is deducted from the amount of such leave accrued by the participant.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-2210 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn sum, the above former statutory authority (old TERI) provided a means for eligible employees to retire, but continue to work subject to several limitations.Â  Under the old TERI program, an employee could retire, but continue to work for an additional five years after retirement.Â  Instead of receiving their retirement check, the old TERI program participantsâ€™ retirement money was placed in a non-interest bearing account to be paid out at the end of the five-year program period.Â  During the five year period, under the prior statute, the employees were deemed retired and made no further contributions to the retirement system out of their paycheck.Â  In addition, old TERI program participants gave up the opportunity to accrue further service credit, thus, any increase in salary would not result in an increase in retirement benefits.Â  In return, the State was able to retain a large number of experienced and well-trained employees for a period not to exceed five years.\r\nAs a result of the enactment of Act 153, old TERI participants are now required â€œto pay to the system the employee contribution as if a program participant were an active contributing member,â€ while gaining no additional service credit.Â  Act No. 153, 2005 S.C. Acts 1697.\r\nWe hold that the language in the old TERI statute demonstrates, in unambiguous terms, the intent of the legislature to bind itself to the terms in the statute.Â  We find it telling that the legislature used terms that are indicative of a contract: â€œA . . . member who is eligible [to retire under TERI]. . . and complies with the requirements of this article . . . . shall agree . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-2210 (A) (emphasis added).Â  Far from simply describing the terms of old TERI participantsâ€™ employment, the former TERI statute outlined an employment program in which those employees eligible for retirement could enroll for a fixed period of time up to five years.[6]Â  The old TERI statute fixed obligations, required affirmative actions by both the State and old TERI program participants, and contained contractually significant language. \r\nWe next consider whether there was a breach of the agreement.Â  When the State, through Act 153, sought to collect retirement contributions from the old TERI participants, it was in clear breach of the contract it created by the relevant statutes.Â  Once the bargain is formed, and the obligations set, a contract may only be altered by mutual agreement and for further consideration.Â  We find that, as applied to old TERI participants, the enactment of Act 153 constitutes a breach of contract.Â  Therefore, we hold the State may not unilaterally alter its agreement with old TERI program participants by forcing the old TERI participants to contribute to the retirement system.[7]Â  \r\nThe State argues that the statutes did not create a binding contract and that this case is â€œon all foursâ€ with Alston v. City of Camden.Â  322 S.C. 38, 46, 471 S.E.2d 174, 178 (1996).Â  In Alston, this Court held that employees generally have no contractual rights in their employment merely by virtue of a city ordinance describing the terms of their employment.Â  Id. at 45, 471 S.E.2d at 177.Â  We find that Alston is distinguishable in several respects.Â  First, the Court held that the benefits affected in Alston were â€œfringe benefits,â€ and that the employee had a reasonable expectation that those benefits might be subject to change.Â  Id. at 48, 471 S.E.2d 179.Â  In addition, the agreement in Alston was the type of unilateral contract that is subject to modification at any time.Â  Id. at 48-49, 471 S.E.2d at 179.\r\nOur holding in the present case rests not on general principles of contract law, but rather, on the plain meaning of the language used by the legislature in the old TERI statute.Â  Unlike the city ordinance in Alston, Act 153 sought to materially alter terms which formed a substantial part of the basis for the bargain struck between the State and old TERI participants.Â  In these limited circumstances, we read the old TERI statute to go beyond terms of employment to create a defined employment program.Â  While our rule has been, and continues to be, that statutes do not create contracts that bind the State, the State may not utilize such significant contractual language and disregard its plain meaning and practical effect.\r\nFurther, our holding today does not hamper the legislatureâ€™s ability to govern.Â  The new TERI program will continue in its current form and all participants in the new TERI program, enacted via Act 153, will be subject to the terms of that statute.Â  Further, and contrary to the Stateâ€™s suggestion, our holding will not place the actuarial soundness of the retirement system in ruins.Â  The Stateâ€™s contention that the unfunded accounting liability amortization period will be close to reaching its thirty year limits is based on an assumption that 100 percent of eligible retirees will participate in the old TERI program.Â  This is inaccurate in two respects.Â  First, old TERI participants do not contend that the program cannot be changed with respect to future participants enrolled after July 1, 2005.Â  As a result, the study fails to recognize that under the new TERI program, new TERI participants enrolled after July 1, 2005 will contribute to the retirement system as set forth in Act No. 153.Â  In fact, the study relied upon by the State is based upon an incorrect assumption.Â  This inaccuracy is outlined in the record before this Court in an affidavit relied upon heavily by the State in the claim that the retirement system will reach near crisis.Â  The affidavit of a consulting actuary from Milliman, Inc. stated: â€œif current and future TERI retirees and reemployed retirees do not pay the member contribution . . . .â€ (emphasis added).Â  The opinion of this Court does not affect the decision of the State to require new or future TERI participants, those enrolled after July 1, 2005, to make retirement contributions.Â  \r\nSecond, the contention that the number of old TERI participants is growing at a rapid pace is a complete misrepresentation.Â  The numbers of participants in the old TERI program is diminishing with each passing day and by June 30, 2010, the number of old TERI program participants will be zero.Â  Any new TERI participants (those enrolled after July 1, 2005) are covered by Act 153 and will make contributions to the system as directed by the new requirements of Act 153. \r\nBased on the above, we find that the provision of the old TERI statute created a binding contract and hold that the State breached that contract by applying the requirements of Act 153 to old TERI participants enrolled prior to July 1, 2005.[8]\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Working Retirees\r\nPetitioners argue that the statutory provisions governing old working retirees created contracts which the State breached by requiring previously enrolled working retirees to contribute to the retirement system.Â  We disagree.\r\nA person eligible for retirement could have elected to become a working retiree.Â  A working retiree is outlined under the former statute as:\r\n\r\n[A] retired member of the system who has been retired for at least sixty days may return to employment covered by the system and earn up to fifty thousand dollars a fiscal year without affecting the monthly retirement allowance he is receiving from the system.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1790 (A) (Supp. 2004).Â  As an old working retiree, a person would be paid their retirement check.Â  Instead of having the retirement check placed in an escrow account like the old TERI program, the old working retiree received the monthly check and could invest the money as he or she saw fit.Â  An old working retiree was also considered to be retired, and as a result, did not make further contributions to the retirement system.Â  However, in order to retain both his retirement check and normal pay, an old working retiree was limited to earning $50,000 in salary.\r\nAs outlined above in this opinion, absent clear statutory language indicating an intent by the legislature to bind itself contractually, a statute does not create a contract.Â  Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 470 U.S. 451, 465-66 (1985).\r\nIn the present case, the old working retiree statute does not use the same contractually significant language as utilized in the old TERI statute.Â  As a result, we hold that the old working retiree statute does not create a binding contract between the State and the old working retirees prohibiting the State from altering the statute exempting old working retirees from further contributions to the retirement system.Â  Stated differently, the old working retiree statute does not evidence an intent by the legislature to be bound to any terms related to the old working retiree program.\r\nHowever, the record contains evidence indicating that some of the old working retirees may have written contracts detailing the terms of the old working retiree program, including the promise that the old working retirees would not have to make further contributions to the retirement system.Â  These documents, if signed by both parties upon enrollment in the old working retiree program, might reflect what agreement, if any, was made.Â  In addition, some of the old working retirees who do not have signed documents may have relied upon statements made by the State in making a decision to retire and become a working retiree under the prior statute.\r\nAs a result, we remand the issue of breach of contract as to the old working retirees to the trial court for a case by case factual determination of whether any actions of the State with regard to individual old working retirees constituted a breach of contract.\r\nIssues II, III, and IV\r\nBecause we find that the old TERI statute created a binding contract, we do not address the remaining issues.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we hold that the State breached its contract with Petitioners who were enrolled as old TERI participants by forcing those old TERI participants to make retirement system contributions.Â  Accordingly, all retirement system contributions withheld from old TERI participants enrolled prior to July 1, 2005 shall be returned with interest to such TERI participants and no further contributions from TERI participants enrolled prior to July 1, 2005 shall be required.Â  \r\nIt should be noted that our decision today is a very narrow one which affects only those TERI participants who joined the old TERI program, originally enacted in 2001, prior to July 1, 2005.Â  This Court has previously ordered that all disputed contributions be escrowed in an interest bearing account during this litigation and as a result this money is available to be returned to the TERI participants.Â  Both the State and the old TERI participants were protected by this Court in its order requiring the disputed funds be escrowed in an interest bearing account.Â  Thus, under this Courtâ€™s previous order, the disputed retirement system contributions have been segregated in a separate account during the course of this litigation, and now the State has the funds readily available to accomplish the refund ordered herein.\r\nThe new TERI program as adopted by the legislature in Act 153 continues to be valid and all those participants joining after July 1, 2005 are subject to the entirety of the requirements outlining the new TERI program in Act 153.Â  It is fully within the power of the legislature to make changes to laws that impact future participants, but as outlined in this opinion, the State breached its contract with the old TERI participants by changing the terms of the existing statutory agreement after participants agreed to those terms by electing to retire.Â  \r\nFinally, we remand the issue of breach of contract as related to the old working retirees to the trial court.Â  The record before this Court does not allow us to make the factual or legal inquiry necessary to determine if a binding contract existed between the State and the old working retirees regarding the making of further retirement system contributions. Â \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justices Perry M. Buckner and D. L. Jefferson, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioners consist of a class defined as:\r\n\r\nAll persons currently employed by an employer participating in the South Carolina Retirement System who elected prior to July 1, 2005, the effective date of Act 153, to participate in the Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program (TERI) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-2210, et seq, as well as all retired members of the System who have returned to employment covered by the System prior to July 1, 2005, and are not currently TERI participants.\r\n\r\n[2] Act No. 153, 2005 S.C. Acts 1697.\r\n[3] The TERI program is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-2210 (Supp. 2004).\r\n[4] Terms of employment for Retiree participants are codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1790 (Supp. 2004).\r\n[5] The contribution will increase to 6.5% in 2006.\r\n[6] Most of the TERI participants are continuing contract teachers and each year the employment contracts of the participants in TERI are subject to renewal, unless the teacher is fired for cause.Â  But the TERI program was available for those employees eligible to participate for up to five years.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-26-40 (Supp. 2004) (explaining the various contract levels for teachers).\r\n[7] The State should have treated the retirement contributions by old TERI participants in the same manner in which the State treated the old TERI participants with regard to the grievance system.Â  In Act 153, Section 3, the State exempted old TERI participants from the change in Act 153 related to the grievance procedure for employees.Â  The State should have exempted old TERI participants from all portions of Act 153 related to the new TERI program, instead of applying new legislation to old TERI participants.\r\n[8] This holding has almost the same effect on the old TERI participants as envisioned under H. 4544, introduced to the House of Representatives in January of 2006.Â  See S.C. H. 4544, 116th Gen. Assembly, 2nd Reg. Sess. (Jan. 31, 2006)Â  (stating that persons who began participation in the Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program (TERI) before July 1, 2005, or who were reemployed retirees who returned to employment of employers covered under the South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS) or the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System (SCPORS) before July 1, 2005, are exempt from the payment of employee contributions otherwise due SCRS or SCPORS with respect to employment after June 30, 2005.Â  The exemption continues for these employees through the termination of TERI participation and while a reemployed retiree remains employed in the position held before July 1, 2005.Â  SCRS and SCPORS shall refund without interest the employee contributions made by the TERI program participants and reemployed retirees receiving the exemption allowed pursuant to this joint resolution).Â  However, this Court ordered the withheld contributions be placed in an interest bearing account during this litigation.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26143","title":"In the Matter of Spartanburg County Magistrate Johnny Lee Cash","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26143","description":"This is a judicial disciplinary opinion in which the Court removed a magistrate from office.","date":"2006-05-08","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Spartanburg County Magistrate Johnny Lee Cash, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26143\r\nSubmitted April 18, 2006 - Filed May 8, 2006\r\n\r\nREMOVED FROM OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert E. Bogan, Assistant Deputy Attorney General, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Robert M. Holland, of Spartanburg, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn November 2, 1991, respondent was married.Â  He worked as a magistrateâ€™s constable for several years, became a part-time magistrate in the late 1990s and, eventually, a full-time magistrate in 2001.Â  \r\nRespondent met Female 1 when he was working as a magistrateâ€™s constable.Â  They were co-workers on friendly terms until sometime in the summer of 2003 when she began to confide in respondent about certain employment-related concerns and her fear that her job was in jeopardy due to circumstances involving another magistrate.Â  \r\nFemale 1 became aware that respondent frequently worked on a boat at a friendâ€™s house during the evening.Â  Respondent told Female 1 they could talk at the friendâ€™s house.\r\nFemale 1 met respondent at the friendâ€™sâ€™ house on a few occasions and, on at least one of those occasions, engaged in sexual activity.Â  The sexual activity constituted adultery.Â  \r\nRespondent and Female 1 acknowledge engaging in sexual activity on a second occasion. \r\nFemale 1 reported to ODC that, although she did have a close relationship with respondent, she viewed respondentâ€™s flirting as horseplay and never took it seriously.Â  Female 1 later informed ODC that she engaged in sexual activity with respondent only because his first initiation of sex surprised her and, due to her fragile emotional state caused by other employment-related concerns, including fear of losing her job, she believed she could not refuse his advances.Â  \r\nRespondent represents he believed the sexual activity with Female 1 was mutually desired.Â  Respondent also represents that Female 1 neither appeared emotionally fragile nor did she say or do anything to suggest to him that her involvement was other than completely free and voluntary.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nFemale 2 has worked for the Magistrate Court for more than twenty years.Â  Respondent met her while he was a constable.Â  When he became Chief Magistrate in early 2004, respondentâ€™s supervisory responsibilities caused him to interact more frequently with Female 2.Â  \r\nAccording to respondent, he and Female 2 realized they were both in failed relationships with their spouses and eventually fell in love.Â  Respondent acknowledges engaging in extra-marital sexual activity with Female 2 on several occasions while she was employed by the Spartanburg Magistrate Court, including on two occasions while attending court-related seminars out of town. \r\nOn March 18, 2005, respondentâ€™s wife filed a complaint seeking a divorce from respondent on the ground of adultery.Â  The divorce was granted by order filed August 5, 2005.Â  Female 2 was also divorced from her husband and, subsequently, married respondent.Â  Both continue to be employed in the Spartanburg Central Magistrate Court.\r\nBefore respondentâ€™s romantic relationship with Female 2, but while he was the Chief Magistrate, respondent made administrative changes in the Spartanburg Central Magistrate Court that included a promotion for Female 2.Â  Respondent contends the promotion was based exclusively on merit, experience, and longevity, but acknowledged that, in hindsight, it may have had the appearance of being based on favoritism.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary);

Cain, both of The Welch Law Firm, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  The trial court revoked Respondentâ€™s probation after he committed several probation violations.Â  The court of appeals reversed in part, holding that Rule 5, SCRCrimP (titled â€œDisclosure in Criminal Casesâ€) and the disclosure rule announced in Brady v. Maryland[1] applied to probation revocation proceedings.Â  The State appealed and we now reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRespondent received a twenty year prison sentence for convictions of second degree arson, second degree burglary, malicious injury to personal property, driving under the influence - fourth offense, and criminal domestic violence - third offense.Â  The trial court suspended the sentence to ten years imprisonment and five years probation.Â  Respondent began his probation in 1997.Â  \r\nApproximately five months before Respondentâ€™s probation was scheduled to end, Respondentâ€™s probation agent received a call from the Department of Social Services alleging that Respondent was in possession of a firearm and had been pointing the weapon at his son.Â  The probation agent contacted Respondent and ordered him to report to the probation office.Â  \r\nWhile meeting with his probation agent at the probation office, Respondent admitted a .22 caliber rifle was in his home.Â  Respondent alleged the rifle was his sonâ€™s and that the son sometimes kept the gun in the house.Â  At the time, Respondentâ€™s son was 11 or 12 years old.Â  The probation agent informed Respondent that he and Respondent would be accompanying some additional probation agents to Respondentâ€™s house, that the agents were going to search the house, and that Respondent would be arrested for violating his probation if the agents discovered any weapons.Â  At that point, Respondent asked to go into the hallway and get a drink of water.Â  The probation agent granted Respondentâ€™s request, and after reaching the water fountain, Respondent ran down the hallway and out of the building.Â  Seeing Respondentâ€™s attempt to escape, the probation agent ordered Respondent to stop.\r\nAs the probation agent pursued Respondent, three other agents joined in the pursuit.Â  After exiting the building, Respondent locked himself in his vehicle and attempted to leave the probation office parking lot.Â  The four agents surrounded Respondentâ€™s vehicle, drew their firearms, and ordered Respondent to get out of his vehicle.Â  Respondent, however, started his vehicle and attempted to drive away from the premises.Â  Although at least one agent attempted to prevent Respondent from leaving by standing in front of his vehicle, Respondent continued to drive forward.Â  The agent obstructing Respondentâ€™s exit was able to avoid being struck by Respondentâ€™s vehicle, and at this point, one of the agents began firing his weapon into Respondentâ€™s car.Â  Although Respondent received three gunshot wounds, he managed to drive out of the parking lot and escape.Â  Respondent was arrested later at the emergency room.\r\nThe State charged Respondent with violating his probation by possessing a firearm, failing to obey his probation agentâ€™s commands, and failing to avoid injurious habits by attempting to run over a probation agent with his car.Â  Prior to Respondentâ€™s revocation proceeding, Respondent served his probation agent with a request for disclosure of information pursuant to Rule 5 and Brady.[2] Â Â At some point, Respondent filed a motion to continue the revocation proceeding because his probation agent refused to comply with the disclosure requests.\r\nAt the hearing on Respondentâ€™s motion for a continuance, the court addressed Respondentâ€™s Brady and Rule 5 requests.Â  In a reference to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-290 (Supp. 2005)[3] (titled â€œInformation received by probation agents privilegedâ€), the court advised that a statute provided for the confidentiality of the department of probationâ€™s records unless they are ordered disclosed by the court.Â  The court instructed Respondent to bring a motion under Â§ 24-21-290 if he was indeed seeking the probation agentâ€™s file.Â  Respondent, however, filed no additional motions or requests. Â The trial court held Respondentâ€™s probation revocation proceeding approximately one month later, and at the conclusion of the proceeding, the court revoked Respondentâ€™s probation and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment.\r\nRespondent moved for reconsideration, arguing that the police report covering his escape from the probation office was unfinished at the time of his probation revocation proceeding and that the final police report contained mitigating evidence.[4]Â  During the hearing on Respondentâ€™s motion for reconsideration, Respondent alleged he did not intend to harm any of the probation agents and that the probation agents were not in any danger of sustaining serious injury during his escape attempt.[5]Â  After hearing Respondentâ€™s offered evidence, including testimony from Respondent himself, the court denied Respondentâ€™s motion.Â  Respondent appealed.\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision on two issues not related to this appeal,[6] but the court reversed the revocation of Respondentâ€™s probation.Â  The court of appeals held that Brady and Rule 5 applied to probation revocation proceedings because South Carolina courts had extended these rules â€œbeyond criminal trial proceedingsâ€ and because a probation revocation proceeding involves a determination of guilt.Â  Hill, 359 S.C. at 312-3, 597 S.E.2d at 828-29.\r\nThe State argued that even if Brady and Rule 5 applied, Respondentâ€™s due process rights were not violated because Respondent eventually received the requested information, presented the information at his motion for a new trial, and the trial court affirmed its decision.Â  Disagreeing, the court of appeals stated â€œ[h]aving already found [Respondent] violated his probation . . . we believe it would have been difficult for the court to be completely objective during the subsequent proceeding.Â  Thus we find the information was material and the failure to disclose it deprived [Respondent] of a fair hearing.â€Â  Id. at 314-15, 597 S.E.2d at 829-30.Â  The State appealed.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision and the State raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the court of appeals err in extending Brady and Rule 5 to probation revocation proceedings?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         If Brady and Rule 5 apply to probation revocation proceedings, did the State violate either rule?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Brady and Rule 5â€™s Applicability to Probation Revocation\r\nThe issues of whether the specific requirements of Brady and Rule 5 apply to probation revocation proceedings are novel questions in South Carolina.Â  The State argues that the court of appeals erred in applying both rules to these proceedings, and we agree.\r\nA. Brady\r\n Brady provides that a criminal defendant is denied due process when the prosecution suppresses evidence that is favorable to him.Â  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).Â  In Brady, an appeal from a state court murder conviction, the prosecution failed to disclose that a co-defendant previously admitted to the killing.Â  Id. at 84.Â  The Maryland court of appeals held that the failure to disclose this evidence constituted a denial of due process, and the United States Supreme Court agreed.Â  Id. at 86.Â  Though the court addressed the due process violation in dicta, see id. at 92 (White, J., concurring), the rule requiring the disclosure of evidence favorable to the accused is commonly known as the Brady rule.\r\nAlthough Brady provides a bright-line rule for the disclosure requirements necessary to guarantee that a criminal defendant receives due process, it is equally fundamental that due process requirements are not rigid and inflexible.Â  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976).Â  Instead, due process only calls for such protections as the particular situation demands.Â  Id.Â  In the specific areas of probation and parole revocation, both this Court and the United States Supreme Court have provided guidance as to what due process requires.\r\nIn Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 474 (1972), a parolee alleged that minimal due process required that he be given a pre-revocation hearing.Â  The court recognized that although both criminal trials and parole revocations involve potential deprivations of liberty, revocation â€œdeprives an individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.â€Â  Id. at 480.Â  Similarly, the court recognized the stateâ€™s â€œoverwhelming interestâ€ in being able to return the parolee to prison without the burden of a new criminal trial.Â  Id. at 483.Â  The court qualified this statement, however, by noting that the state had â€œno interest in revoking parole without some informal procedural guarantees.â€Â  Id. at 483-84.Â  Ultimately, the court held that fundamental justice required a parolee be given a reasonable opportunity to explain an alleged violation.Â  Id.\r\nImportantly, the court in Morrissey left the states with the responsibility of determining the exact procedures to be followed.Â  Id. at 488-89.Â  Instead of detailing specific procedures, the court limited its declaration to describing the minimum requirements of due process.Â  Id.Â  The court listed these requirements as (a) written notice of the alleged violations, (b) disclosure to the parolee of the evidence against him, (c) an opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and evidence, (d) the right to confront and cross-examine, (e) a neutral and detached hearing body, and (f) a written decision from the hearing body.Â  Id.\r\nIn Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), the United States Supreme Court dealt with whether due process required that a probation violator be given a hearing before his probation was revoked.Â  In Gagnon, the court drew almost exclusively from its opinion in Morrissey; relying heavily on the â€œlimited libertyâ€ interest subject to deprivation in the probation and parole setting.Â  Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 781.Â  Adhering closely to Morrisseyâ€™s reasoning, the court quickly determined that due process required that a probationer be given a hearing before his probation was revoked.Â  Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 782.\r\nAdditionally, the court further elaborated on the differences between criminal trials and probation revocation proceedings.Â  For example, the court advised that a probation agentâ€™s function is not to compel conformance to a strict code of behavior, but rather, to supervise a course of rehabilitation.Â  Id. at 784.Â  For this reason, the court noted that probation agents are often armed with the power to unilaterally recommend or declare revocation.Â  Id.Â  While the court recognized the importance of the liberty interests at stake in probation revocation proceedings, the court ultimately reversed the lower courtâ€™s decision requiring the states to provide counsel for probationers in revocation proceedings.Â  Id. at 787.Â  The court stated, â€œthere are critical differences between criminal trials and probation or parole revocation hearings, and both society and the probationer have stakes in preserving these differences.â€Â  Id. at 788-89.Â  The court resolved the issue of a probationerâ€™s right to counsel in a revocation proceeding by recommending a case by case approach; an approach dependent on the complexity of the alleged violations and whether the probationerâ€™s ability to meaningfully contest the alleged violations required the services of a trained advocate.[7]Â  Id. at 788.\r\nThis broad framework, supplied by the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s interpretation of federal due process guarantees, is somewhat amorphous.Â  Morrissey and Gagnon establish that a probationer charged with a violation must be afforded minimal due process.Â  This allows us to re-phrase the question presented to read: â€œdoes minimal due process require that Brady be extended to probation revocation proceedings?â€Â  We conclude that the court of appeals erred in answering â€œyes.â€ Â Both reasons provided by the court of appeals for applying Brady are fundamentally incorrect.\r\nFirst, the court of appeals reasoned that the differences between a criminal trial and a revocation proceeding were irrelevant to the issue because South Carolina courts had extended Brady to sentencing proceedings and guilty pleas.Â  Hill, 359 S.C. at 312, 597 S.E.2d at 828.Â  Although the court of appeals correctly noted that guilty pleas and sentencing proceedings are not criminal trials in the literal sense, the court of appeals overlooked the fact that, like a trial, both of these actions occur before the court imposes a criminal sentence.Â  Probation revocation, by comparison, occurs after a criminal sentence is imposed.Â  In this analysis, the intervening criminal sentence is the crucial point at which the due process guarantees dramatically change.Â  Because he is already covered with a criminal sentence, a probationer is subject only to a deprivation of â€œlimited libertyâ€ in a revocation proceeding.\r\nSecond, the court of appeals erred in reasoning that â€œ[s]imilar to a sentencing or guilty plea proceeding, a probation revocation proceeding involves a determination of guilt.â€Â  Id. at 312-13, 597 S.E.2d at 828.Â Â  In elaborating on the framework established by the United States Supreme Court, we have stated that while the underlying probation violations â€œmay themselves be criminal offenses, the probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial of those charges, but a more informal proceeding with respect to notice and proof of the alleged violations.â€Â  State v. Franks, 276 S.C. 636, 638, 281 S.E.2d 227, 228 (1981) (holding that the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s requirement that a neutral magistrate issue an arrest warrant is not applicable to a probationer charged with a violation).Â  Thus, our Court has recognized â€œthat the rights of an offender in a probation revocation hearing are not the same as those extended him . . . upon the trial of the original offense.â€Â  Id. at 639, 281 S.E.2d at 228; see also Duckson v. State, 355 S.C. 596, 586 S.E.2d 576 (2003) (recognizing the differences between parole and probation revocation proceedings and criminal trials). \r\nWe hold that Bradyâ€™s rule should not, and indeed, cannot be applied to probation revocation proceedings.Â  Bradyâ€™s requirement that evidence favorable to the accused be disclosed is necessary in criminal trials because a criminal conviction is a determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Brady is based on the premise that the suppression of evidence that is material to guilt or punishment casts the reliability of the verdict into doubt; therefore, the guilt standard cannot have been met.Â  In contrast, probation revocation proceedings have a much lower evidentiary threshold.Â  Instead of requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt, probation is properly revoked upon an evidentiary showing of facts tending to establish a violation.Â  State v. White, 318 S.C.130, 136, 61 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1950).Â  In our view, a disclosure standard that governs when nearly concrete proof is required is unworkable and impractical in a proceeding where a party need only tend to look guilty.\r\nOur opinion in Franks provides the guiding principle for this case:Â  while the underlying probation violations may be criminal offenses, the probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial of those charges.Â  276 S.C. at 638, 281 S.E.2d at 228.Â  In South Carolina, a probationer must avoid injurious or vicious habits, avoid persons or places of disreputable character, permit the probation agent to visit at his home or elsewhere, work faithfully at suitable employment, obey a curfew, support his dependents, and follow his probation agentâ€™s instructions and advice.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-430 (Supp. 2005).Â  The subjective natures of these factors further support the distinctions between probation revocation proceedings and criminal trials, as well as the conclusion that Bradyâ€™s disclosure rule is ill-suited for applicability to probation revocation.\r\nBecause they are fundamentally different from a criminal trial and other pre-sentencing proceedings, we decline to extend the Brady rule to probation revocation proceedings.[8]Â  The relevant precedent, particularly Gagnon, Morrissey, and Franks, already require that a probationer be afforded reasonable discovery.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nB. Rule 5, SCRCrimP\r\nRule 5, SCRCrimP, provides for the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases.Â  We hold that Rule 5 does not apply to probation revocation proceedings because these proceedings are not criminal trials.Â  \r\nMorrissey and Gagnon outline the boundaries beyond which the scope of discovery in these â€œlimited libertyâ€ cases may not be restricted.Â  Specifically, these cases indicate that minimal due process requires that a probationer be given notice of the alleged violations and disclosure of the evidence against him.Â  Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 782; Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 488-89.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, Â§Â§ 24-21-290 and 24-21-450 set forth rules concerning discovery in probation revocation proceedings.Â  In line with Morrissey and Gagnonâ€™s notice and disclosure requirements, Â§ 24-21-450 requires a probation agent to prepare and submit a pre-hearing report showing how the probationer has allegedly violated his probation.[9]Â  Blindly adding Rule 5 to this framework is unnecessary.\r\nAdditionally, Â§ 24-21-290 further supports the position that Rule 5 should not apply to probation revocation proceedings.Â  If the probation agent was, as a matter of rule, required to disclose his file, the confidentiality statute would be meaningless.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, we hold that Rule 5 is irrelevant in this context and does not apply to probation revocation proceedings.[10]Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Reversible Error\r\nThe State argues the court of appeals erred in finding Brady and Rule 5 violations because the court based its harmless error analysis entirely on speculation.Â  We agree.Â  Though we need not address this issue because we have held that Brady and Rule 5 do not apply to probation revocation proceedings, we take this opportunity to both clarify what constitutes reversible error under Brady and correct an egregious error in the lower courtâ€™s opinion.\r\nDetermining whether evidence withheld by the state is â€œmaterialâ€ under Brady turns on whether the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence results in a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433 (1995).Â  Stated differently, the question is whether the defendant received a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.Â  Id. at 434.Â  \r\nIn reversing the revocation of Respondentâ€™s probation, the court of appeals, under the guise of a harmless error analysis, stated â€œ[h]aving already found [Respondent] violated his probation . . . we believe it would have been difficult for the court to be completely objective during the subsequent proceeding.Â  Thus we find the information was material and the failure to disclose it deprived [Respondent] of a fair hearing.â€Â  Id. at 314-15, 597 S.E.2d at 829-30.Â  We are utterly perplexed by this analysis.Â  If this statement provided the correct standard for harmless error (notwithstanding the fact that Kyles provides the standard for determining a Brady violation), there would be no purpose in ever filing for reconsideration, rehearing, or a new trial based on after discovered evidence.\r\nAdditionally, this analysis ignores the fact that the trial court heard Respondentâ€™s after acquired evidence and affirmed its original decision.Â  Because the trial court affirmed its decision after hearing this evidence, by the very definition, any error in failing to disclose the evidence was harmless error.Â  See State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1993) (stating that error is harmless if it could not reasonably have affected the result of trial). \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision holding that Rule 5 and Brady apply to probation revocation proceedings and finding violations of both.\r\n MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring separately.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  I write separately, however, because in my opinion neither the Rule 5 issue nor the Brady issue was preserved for appeal.Â  The circuit court did not rule on either claim, instead directing Respondent to file a motion under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-290 (Supp. 2005).[11]Â  Respondent neither objected to this ruling nor filed a motion pursuant to the statute.Â  Accordingly, no issue involving Respondentâ€™s discovery request was preserved for appellate review, and the Court of Appeals erred in addressing the merits of Respondentâ€™s appeal.Â  E.g., State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 589 S.E.2d 6 (2003).Â  I would therefore reverse the Court of Appeals, but would not reach the substantive issues.\r\n\r\n[1] Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n[2] After the court revoked his probation, Respondent served the Tenth Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office with Brady and Rule 5 requests.Â  These requests, however, are not the subject of this appeal.\r\n[3] The version of the statute appearing in the 2005 code supplement is identical to the version in effect at all times relevant to this case.\r\n[4] Respondent obtained the police report in response to subpoenas he served on the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and the Tenth Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office.Â  \r\n[5] At the beginning of the hearing, the trial court asked Respondent whether he was introducing mitigating evidence or offering evidence disputing facts that were already determined.Â  Because Respondent indicated he sought to dispute the fact that he intended to harm any of the probation agents during his escape, Respondent specified that his motion was a motion for a new trial.Â  \r\n[6] These issues involved 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 and Rules 28 and 29, SCRCrimP. Â The court of appeals found these issues were not preserved for review.Â  State v. Hill, 359 S.C. 301, 315-16, 597 S.E.2d 822, 830 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n[7] In South Carolina, Rule 602(A), SCACR, provides indigent probationers with counsel at a revocation hearing. Â \r\nAdditionally, at first glance, Gagnonâ€™s resolution of the right to counsel issue appears to be at odds with Mempa v. Wash. Bd. of Prison Terms and Paroles, 389 U.S. 128 (1967).Â  However, Mempa dealt with probation revocation in a rather unique context. Â In Mempa, two defendants received probation as a result of guilty pleas.Â  Id. at 130, 132.Â  When the defendants were later charged with probation violations, the revocation court conducted full sentencing hearings on the original criminal charges.Â  Id. at 135. Â The Supreme Court held that due process required that the probationers have counsel at these proceedings because they amounted to â€œdeferred sentencing hearings.â€Â  Id. at 137.Â  In our view, Mempa and Gagnon are not in conflict.\r\n[8] In other circumstances, Â§ 24-21-290 (providing that a probation agentâ€™s file is privileged) could prove critical to a due process analysis.Â  For example, during oral argument, Respondent constructed a hypothetical case in which, while charging a probationer with violating his probation by using illegal drugs, the probation office possessed a negative drug test for the probationer.Â  Respondent alleged that failing to extend Brady to revocation proceedings would operate to suppress the exculpatory drug test.Â  This hypothetical is not instructive.Â  The hypothetical improperly presumes (1) that the probation office would seek revocation in the face of a negative drug test, and (2) that the trial court would deny a Â§ 24-21-290 disclosure request.Â  Additionally, since Â§Â§ 24-21-290 and 24-21-450 operate to govern discovery in probation revocation cases, any due process challenge to discovery in these cases would necessarily be a challenge to these statutes.Â  Such is not this case.\r\n[9] Notably, Â§ 24-21-450 only requires the probation agent to submit the violation report to the court.Â  However, the State alleges that this report is given to the probationer before his hearing and Respondent has not contested the Stateâ€™s assertion in this regard.Â  \r\n[10] Although we hold that Brady and Rule 5 do not apply to probation revocation proceedings, we question whether holding to the contrary would have any effect on Respondentâ€™s case.Â  Though it is likely that the probation agentâ€™s file eventually contained the SLED and Anderson City Police reports, it is questionable whether these reports were in the agentâ€™s file prior to the probation revocation proceeding.Â  Additionally, we are unsure as to why Respondent chose to seek these reports from his probation agent and not directly from these law enforcement agencies.Â  In most cases, we believe the confidential status of the probation agentâ€™s file works to the probationerâ€™s advantage.Â  See State v. Hook, 356 S.C.421, 425, 590 S.E.2d 25, 27 (2003) (stating that the statute effectively operates to keep the probationerâ€™s confession to his probation agent out of court).Â  \r\n[11] Like the trial judge, I believe that discovery in probation revocation proceedings is governed, at least in the first instance, by the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26147","title":"Capital U-Drive-It v.

Beaver and Rhett A. Beaver was sealed with the consent of the parties.Â  A month later, Rhett Beaver (Beaver) pled guilty to an indictment charging him with mail fraud and agreed to forfeit certain personal property and cooperate with government officials investigating the matter.Â  The indictment stemmed from Beaverâ€™s participation in an embezzlement scheme which defrauded Capital-U-Drive-It, Inc. (Capital), his employer, of some $551,864.\r\nCapital brought a civil action in Lexington County Court of Common Pleas in 2002 against Beaver and his parents, Sylvia Beaver and the Estate of George Beaver, in an effort to recover embezzled funds.Â  Capital moved before the family court to unseal the record of Beaverâ€™s divorce proceeding, asking for permission to review and copy all information in the file pertaining to Beaverâ€™s financial affairs.Â  Another family court judge granted Capitalâ€™s motion and unsealed the record.Â  The judge granted permission for Capital to inspect and copy all documents â€œwherein representations are made regarding money and assets earned, received or obtained by Rhett Beaver during the marriage, including but not limited to, representations regarding the amount and sources of income and what funds were obtained from Capital that were made in the divorce proceeding by Rhett Beaver, George Beaver, Sylvia Beaver or any other party making such declarations.â€\r\nBeaver appealed.Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.\r\n         Is the order unsealing the record of a family court proceeding immediately appealable in this case?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.Â \r\n         Did the family court judge err in unsealing the record of a divorce proceeding in a limited manner at the request of a litigant in an unrelated civil action who is seeking information about the financial affairs of one of the divorce litigants?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court order pertaining to the sealing or unsealing of the record of a court proceeding is reviewed for abuse of discretion.Â  See Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 599, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 1312-13, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978); Virginia Dept. of State Police v. Washington Post, 386 F.3d 567, 575 (4th Cir. 2004); Siedle v. Putnam Investments, Inc., 147 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1998); Providence Journal Co. v. Clerk of the Family Court, 643 A.2d 210, 211 (R.I. 1994); A.P. v. M.E.E., 821 N.E.2d 1238, 1245 (Ill. App. 1 Dist. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the judgeâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based upon factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when the judge is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised; or when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible decisions applicable in a particular case.Â  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 539, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987); S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 229 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001). \r\nIn a case raising a novel question of law, the appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2005)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  APPEALABILITY OF ORDER UNSEALING FAMILY COURT RECORD\r\nBeaver argues the order to unseal the record of a divorce proceeding is immediately appealable because, under the facts of this case, it is a final order issued by the family court which stands separate and apart from the civil lawsuit pending in circuit court between Capital and Beaver.Â  Beaver relies on S.C. Code Â§ 14-3-330(1) (1976).Â  We agree. \r\nThe right of appeal arises from and is controlled by statutory law.Â  N.C. Fed. Sav. and Loan Assn. v. Twin States Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 480, 347 S.E.2d 97 (1986).Â  An appeal ordinarily may be pursued only after a party has obtained a final judgment.Â  Mid-State Distributors, Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 335, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780-81 (1993); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(1) (1976); Rule 72, SCRCP; Rule 201(a),\r\nSCACR.\r\nThe determination of whether a party may immediately appeal an order issued before or during trial is governed primarily by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Absent a specialized statute, an order must fall into one of several categories set forth in Section 14-3-330 in order to be immediately appealable.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 195, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005); Baldwin Constr. Co. v. Graham, 357 S.C. 227, 593 S.E.2d 146 (2004); Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 242, 460 S.E.2d 392, 393 (1995), overruled on other grounds, Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002); Mid-State Distributors, 310 S.C. at 333 n.3, 426 S.E.2d at 780 n.3.\r\nAn order â€œinvolves the merits,â€ as that term is used in Section 14-3-330(1)[1] and is immediately appealable when it finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense.Â  Peterkin v. Brigman, 319 S.C. 367, 461 S.E.2d 809 (1995); Mid-State Distributors, 310 S.C. at 334, 426 S.E.2d at 780; Knowles v. Standard Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 274 S.C. 58, 261 S.E.2d 49 (1979).Â  The phrase â€œinvolving the meritsâ€ is narrowly construed in modern precedent.Â  An order usually will be deemed interlocutory and not immediately appealable when there is some further act that must be done by the trial court prior to a determination of the partiesâ€™ rights.Â  Mid-State Distributors, 310 S.C. at 334-335, 426 S.E.2d at 780 (order denying motion to dismiss case based on lack of personal jurisdiction was not immediately appealable, as the litigant had â€œnot arrived at the end of the roadâ€); Peterkin, 319 S.C. 367, 461 S.E.2d 809 (order denying motion to enforce alleged settlement agreement was not immediately appealable); Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C. 135, 138, 564 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 2002) (order denying motion to amend pleadings to assert third party claims was not immediately appealable because the order did not determine a substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action).\r\nIn the present case, the order issued by the family court unsealing the record determined a substantial matter forming the whole or part of the family court proceeding in which Capital sought access to the record of the Beaversâ€™ divorce.Â  No further action is required in the family court to determine the partiesâ€™ rights; therefore, the order is immediately appealable under Section 14-3-330(1).\r\nMoreover, we agree with courts which have been inclined to find such an order immediately appealable because, after a court file is unsealed and the information released, no appellate remedy is likely to repair any damage done by an improper disclosure.Â  â€œCompelling a party that disputes an unsealing order to forgo an appeal until the conclusion of the underlying litigation would let the cat out of the bag, without any effective way of recapturing it if the district courtâ€™s directive was ultimately found to be erroneous.â€Â  Siedle v. Putnam Investments, Inc., 147 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Irons v. FBI, 811 F.2d 681, 683 (1st Cir. 1987)).Â  These courts also explain that the usual method of reaching an appellate court - being held in contempt for refusal to comply - is not available to a litigant when the court chooses to unseal its own records.Â  See Virginia Dept. of State Police v. Washington Post, 386 F.3d 567, 574 n.4 (4th Cir. 2004) (order unsealing district court documents may be immediately appealed under collateral order doctrine applicable in federal courts); S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 228 (2d Cir. 2001) (same); Siedle, 147 F.3d at 9 (same).[2]\r\nBeaver also argues that, if the family court order is viewed as a discovery-related order issued in connection with the civil action in circuit court, then it is immediately appealable because it affects a substantial right pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976).Â  It is unnecessary to address this argument under the facts of this case.\r\nWe conclude the order to unseal the record of the family court proceeding, under the facts of this case, is immediately appealable pursuant to Section 14-3-330(1).\r\nII.Â  UNSEALING RECORD OF DIVORCE PROCEEDING\r\nAppellant argues the family court judge erred in unsealing the record of his divorce proceeding at the request of Capital, which seeks financial information about Appellant for potential use in an unrelated civil action Capital has filed against him.Â  Appellant argues the family court judge who initially sealed the record acted properly and his decision should remain in effect.Â  Although Appellant concedes court records usually are open and public, he contends the privacy rights of family court litigants outweigh the presumption of access to their files.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this case does not directly raise the broader issue of unfettered public access to an entire family court file previously sealed by a judge.Â  The order unsealed the file only to allow Capital to review it and Capital will be allowed to copy and retain only specified information related to Appellantâ€™s financial affairs.\r\nPublic access to judicial proceedings and court records, in both criminal and civil trials, was commonplace and proper when the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791, and was a right long enjoyed in England in preceding centuries.Â  Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 564-80, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 2821-29, 65 L.Ed.2d 973, 981-92 (1980); Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 386 n. 15, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 2908 n.15, 61 L.Ed.2d 608, 625 n.15 (1979); In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 266-72, 68 S.Ct. 499, 504-07, 92 L.Ed. 682, 690-94 (1948); Publicker Indus., Inc. v. Cohen, 733 F.2d 1059, 1066-71 (3d Cir. 1984).Â  The Supreme Court stated in Nixon v. Warner Commun., Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978) that, under the common law,\r\n\r\n[i]t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents. . . .Â  American decisions generally do not condition enforcement of this right on a proprietary interest in the document or upon a need for it as evidence in a lawsuit.Â  The interest necessary to support the issuance of a writ compelling access has been found, for example, in the citizenâ€™s desire to keep a watchful eye on the workings of public agencies . . . and in a newspaper publisherâ€™s intention to publish information concerning the operation of government.\r\nIt is uncontested, however, that the right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute.Â  Every court has supervisory power over its own records and files, and access has been denied where court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes.â€ \r\n\r\nId. at 597-98, 98 S.Ct. at 1312, 55 L.Ed.2d at 579-80 (citations omitted); Davis v. Jennings, 304 S.C. 502, 505, 405 S.E.2d 601, 603 (1991).\r\nJudicial proceedings and court records are presumptively open to the public under the common law, the First Amendment of the federal constitution, and the state constitution.Â  S.C. Const. art. I Â§ 9 (â€œ[a]ll courts shall be publicâ€); Davis, 304 S.C. at 505, 405 S.E.2d at 603; Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597-98, 98 S.Ct. at 1312, 55 L.Ed.2d at 579-80; Virginia Dept. of State Police v. Washington Post, 386 F.3d 567, 575 (4th Cir. 2004); Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\nPublic access to court records may be restricted in certain situations, such as matters involving juveniles, legitimate trade secrets, or information covered by a recognized privilege.Â  Restrictions may be based on a statute or the courtâ€™s inherent power to control its own records and supervise the functioning of the judicial system.Â  See e.g. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-755 (Supp. 2005) (excluding general public from hearings which involve neglected, abused, or delinquent children); Ex parte Greenville News, 326 S.C. 1, 482 S.E.2d 556 (1997) (post-trial allegations of juror misconduct during murder trial may be publicly disclosed, but jurorsâ€™ names and identifying information would be redacted to preserve juror privacy, thus satisfying requirement that closure be narrowly tailored to preserver higher values); Jessup v. Luther, 277 F.3d 926, 928 (7th Cir. 2002) (when there is a compelling interest in secrecy, as in case of trade secrets, identity of confidential informants, and privacy of children, portions, and in extreme cases the entirety, of trial record may be sealed); Doe v. Ashcroft, 317 F. Supp. 2d 488 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (ordering limited sealing of documents filed with court in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute authorizing the government to obtain certain intelligence-related information in possession of communications service providers due to national security concerns, but establishing procedure by which public would have timely access to all non-sensitive information in the lawsuit). \r\nPublic access to courts and their records serves several fundamental interests which are crucial to the proper functioning of judicial and government systems.Â  Public access discourages perjury and encourages bringing the truth to light because participants are less likely to testify falsely in a sunlit courtroom before their neighbors than in a private room before court officials.Â  Public access promotes free discussion of governmental affairs by imparting a more complete understanding to the public of the judicial system and issues resolved by that system.Â  Public access serves as a check on inappropriate or corrupt practices by exposing the judicial process to public scrutiny.Â  Lawyers, witnesses, and judges may perform their duties in a more conscientious manner, knowing their conduct will be subject to public scrutiny either at the time of the proceeding or later through disclosure of court records.Â  See e.g. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 505-10, 104 S.Ct. 819, 821-24, 78 L.Ed.2d 629, 635-38 (1984); Richmond, 448 U.S. at 564-80, 100 S.Ct. at 2821-29, 65 L.Ed.2d at 981-92; Jessup, 277 F.3d at 927-28; Columbus-America Discovery Group v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 291, 303 (4th Cir. 2000).\r\nLitigants who carry disputes to a publicly funded forum for resolution must necessarily expect to surrender a good measure of their right to privacy.Â  â€œA claim that a court file contains extremely personal, private, and confidential matters is generally insufficient to constitute a privacy interest warranting the sealing of the file. Â Likewise, prospective injury to reputation, an inherent risk in almost every civil lawsuit, is generally insufficient to overcome the strong presumption in favor of public access to court records.â€Â  Doe v. Heitler, 26 P.3d 539, 544 (Colo. App. 2001); accord Siedle, 147 F.3d at 10 (â€œmere fact that judicial records may reveal potentially embarrassing information is not in itself a sufficient reason to block public accessâ€); In re Fibermark, Inc., 330 B.R. 480, 508 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2005) (Bankruptcy Codeâ€™s exclusion to public disclosure of bankruptcy court records was never intended to save debtors or creditors from embarrassment, or to protect their privacy in light of countervailing statutory, constitutional, and policy concerns); Doe v. New York Univ., 786 N.Y.S.2d 892, 902 (N.Y. Sup. 2004) (embarrassment, damage to reputation, and general desire for privacy do not constitute good cause to seal court records).\r\nIn deciding whether to seal or unseal a court record, the court must make specific factual findings, on the record, which weigh the need for secrecy against the right of access.Â  The burden is on the party who seeks to overcome the presumption of access to show that the interest in secrecy outweighs the presumption.Â  Davis, 304 S.C. at 506, 405 S.E.2d at 603.\r\nThe court must consider the following factors, pursuant to recently enacted Rule 41.1, SCRCP:Â  (1) ensuring the partiesâ€™ right to a fair trial or hearing; (2) the need for witness cooperation; (3) the reliance of the parties upon expectations of confidentiality of the proceeding; (4) the public or professional significance of the proceeding; (5) the perceived harm to the parties from disclosure; (6) why alternatives other than sealing the documents are not available to protect legitimate private interests; and (7) why the public interest, including, but not limited to, the public health and safety, is best served by sealing the documents.Â  \r\nIn addition, the court may consider (8) public interest in the proceeding; (9) the private or public status of the litigants and case generally; (10) whether release would enhance the publicâ€™s understanding of an important historical event; (11) whether the public already has access to information contained in the records; (12) whether a particular decision will sustain or offend the fundamental interests of public access, and any other relevant factors.Â  See Davis, 304 S.C. at 505-06, 405 S.E.2d at 603-04 (requiring court to make specific factual findings, on the record, when deciding whether to seal court records); Â Ex parte Columbia Newspapers, Inc., 286 S.C. 116, 333 S.E.2d 337 (1985) (vacating order closing transfer hearing because family court judge erred in failing to make specific findings that closure was necessary to protect rights of juveniles charged with murder); Steinle v.

Rptr. 2d 395, 400 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1998).Â  However, in family court matters, Rule 41.1(c), SCRCP, requires the judge to â€œalso consider whether the settlement: Â 1) contains material which may expose private financial matters which could adversely affect the parties; and/or 2) relates to sensitive custody issues, and shall specifically balance the special interests of the child or children involved in the family court matter.â€\r\nWe conclude the family court judge properly unsealed the record to allow Capital access to information it may contain about Beaverâ€™s financial affairs.Â  Applying the above factors, several weigh in favor of unsealing the record as ordered by the family court judge.Â  The record contains no evidence pertaining to the partiesâ€™ reliance upon expectations of confidentiality of the proceeding.Â  Beaver has not shown a perceived harm from disclosure, other than asserting a general right to privacy.Â  Capital seeks access to the records for a legitimate purpose in connection with its unrelated civil action against Beaver.Â  Unsealing the record will serve the fundamental interests of public access, especially the goal of bringing the truth to light.\r\nWeighing in favor of keeping the record sealed are the fact that the Beaversâ€™ divorce proceeding, as is usually the case, has little public or professional significance to anyone except the parties involved in the divorce proceeding and Capitalâ€™s lawsuit.Â  Similarly, disclosure is not likely to enhance the publicâ€™s understanding of an important historical event and there is little or no public interest in the Beaversâ€™ case.Â  The litigants are private parties, not celebrities or public officials.Â  The Beaversâ€™ file contains material which may expose private financial matters which could adversely affect the parties, but this is of no concern because access to the file is limited only to Capital.[3]\r\nIn sum, Beaver has not overcome the presumption of access to family court records by demonstrating that his interest in secrecy or privacy outweighs the presumption of access.Â  We conclude the family court judge did not abuse his discretion in unsealing the record of Beaverâ€™s divorce proceeding to allow Capital to review and copy information about Beaverâ€™s financial affairs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court order to unseal the record of the family court proceeding, under the facts of this case, is immediately appealable pursuant to Section 14-3-330(1).Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion in unsealing the record of Beaverâ€™s divorce proceeding to allow Capital to review and copy information about Beaverâ€™s financial affairs.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justice Donald W. Beatty, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s conclusion that the order of the family court unsealing the divorce record is immediately appealable, but only because this is a final judgment of the family court.Â  As the majority observes, â€œNo further action is required in the family court to determine the partiesâ€™ rights ....â€Â  In my opinion, no further discussion is necessary.\r\nI respectfully dissent from the majorityâ€™s holding that the family court properly ordered the unsealing of the record in this case.Â  I agree with the test formulated in the majority opinion for determining whether a record should be unsealed.Â  I differ with the majority opinionâ€™s placement of the burden of persuasion on Appellant, the opponent of the motion to unseal the record.Â  In my opinion, the proponent of the motion, Capital, is the party that should bear the burden of persuasion.Â  The burden of persuasion for sealing the record was met in the first instance before the family court.Â  Imposing on Appellant a perpetual burden of keeping the record sealed is inappropriate.Â  See, e.g., Welch v. Welch, 828 A.2d 707 (Conn. Super. Ct. 2003) (holding that â€œif the court determines that the papers and records should be kept confidential, the burden to show good cause would be upon the party requesting to unseal or open the documentsâ€); but see, e.g., Ark. Best. Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Capital Corp., 878 S.W.2d 708 (Ark. 1994) (holding that â€œ[a]lthough the decision we review is that of declining to unseal the records, the issue is whether therecords should have been sealed in the first place,â€ and the â€œ[o]ne who seeks to overcome the expectation of access bears the burden of\r\nestablishing the requisite important state interestâ€) (internal quotation omitted).\r\nBecause the family court placed the burden of persuasion on Appellant, I would reverse the decision and remand the case to the family court for a new hearing, with Capital bearing the burden of persuasion.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section 14-3-330(1) provides:\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n(1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from[.]Â  (Emphasis in original.)\r\n\r\n[2]Â  Although the federal collateral order doctrine is not applied in our state courts, we believe the reasoning of these cases is sound.\r\n[3]Â  Two factors, the right to a fair hearing and need for witness cooperation, are not relevant because the divorce proceeding has ended.Â  Another factor, the impact on sensitive child custody issues, is not implicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to Rule 34, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-05-03-01","description":"","date":"2006-05-08","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\nIn re: Amendments to Rule 34, Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, Â§ 4, of the South Carolina Constitution,Â Â  Rule 34 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, is amended as provided on the attachment herein.Â  This amendment shall be effective immediately.Â  \r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

Any party in a civil action, except a domestic relations action, may file, no later than twenty days before the trial date, a written offer of judgment signed by the offeror or his attorney, directed to the opposing party, offering to take judgment in the offeror&rsquo;s favor, or to allow judgment to be taken against the offeror for a sum stated therein, or to the effect specified in the offer. Service of the offer of judgment shall be made as provided in these rules. Within twenty days after service of the offer of judgment or at least ten days prior to the trial date, whichever date is earlier, the offeree or his attorney may file a written acceptance of the offer of judgment. Upon the filing, the court shall immediately issue the judgment and the clerk shall enter the judgment as provided in the offer of judgment. If the offer of judgment is not accepted within twenty days after notification, or prior to or on the tenth day before the actual trial date, whichever date occurs first, the offer shall be considered rejected and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding after trial to fix costs, interest, attorney&rsquo;s fees, and other recoverable monies. Any offeror may withdraw an offer of judgment prior to its acceptance or prior to the date on which it would be considered rejected by giving notice to the offeree or his attorney as provided in these rules. Any offeror may file a subsequent offer of judgment in any amount which supersedes any earlier offer that was rejected by the offeree or withdrawn by the offeror, and, on filing and service, terminates any rights to interest or costs under the superseded offer. An offer is not considered rejected by a counter offer and shall remain effective until accepted, rejected, or withdrawn as provided in this subsection. All offers of judgment and any acceptance of offers of judgment must be included by the clerk in the record of the case.\r\n(b) Consequences of Non-Acceptance. If an offer of judgment is not accepted and the offeror obtains a verdict or determination at least as favorable as the rejected offer, the offeror shall recover from the offeree: (1) any administrative, filing, or other court costs from the date of the offer until the entry of the judgment; (2) if the offeror is a plaintiff, eight percent interest computed on the amount of the verdict or award from the date of the offer to the entry of judgment; or (3) if the offeror is a defendant, reduction from the judgment or award of eight percent interest computed on the amount of the verdict or award from the date of the offer to the entry of the judgment.\r\n \r\n(c) This rule shall not abrogate the contractual rights of any party concerning the recovery of attorney&rsquo;s fee&not;s or other monies in accordance with the provision of any written contract between the parties to the action.\r\n \r\nNote to 2006 Amendment:  \r\nThis amendment makes this provision consistent with S.C.

Persons alleging that a neutral has engaged in misconduct may file a complaint with the Board of Arbitrator and Mediator Certification. Misconduct includes any conduct or other circumstances that would warrant decertification or discipline under Rule 17(c) or (d). The Board shall review each complaint, may require the neutral to file a response to the complaint, may conduct such investigation as it deems appropriate, and may dismiss complaints it finds to be without merit. The Board may petition the Supreme Court to temporarily suspend a neutral pending further action on the complaint. If the Board finds that there is probable cause to believe that misconduct has occurred that would warrant decertification or other disciplinary action under these rules, the Board shall conduct a hearing into the matter after giving the neutral at least ten (10) days notice of the hearing. The Board may issue subpoenas compelling persons to attend the hearing or to produce records. A person violating such a subpoena shall be in contempt of the Supreme Court. The rules of evidence applicable to the circuit court shall generally be observed in the conduct of the hearing, and all testimony shall be under oath or affirmation. The proceedings shall be transcribed. If, after conducting the hearing, the Board determines that decertification or other disciplinary action is not warranted, it shall dismiss the matter. If the Board determines that decertification or other disciplinary action is appropriate, it shall make a written recommendation to the Supreme Court and provide a copy to the neutral. A copy of the transcript of the hearing and any exhibits shall be filed with the Supreme Court. The neutral may, within fifteen (15) days after the Board submits its recommendation to the Supreme Court, file a response to the Board&rsquo;s recommendation. The Supreme Court shall then take such action as it deems appropriate. The Supreme Court shall not be bound by any specific sanction recommended by the Board. No hearing shall be held before the Supreme Court unless it determines that a hearing is appropriate.\r\nPART IV: IMPLEMENTATION\r\nRule 18\r\n  Clerks of Court\r\nAll circuit and family court Clerks of Court in each county shall perform whatever duties are required pursuant to these rules relating to record keeping, notification to the court, parties, or attorneys, docket control, maintenance of rosters, and service of orders.\r\nRule 19\r\n  Local Rule-Making\r\nThese rules shall be uniform for all counties in which they are applicable.

Sullivan, all of Nicholson, Davis, Frawley, Anderson &amp; Ayer, LLC, of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant WRB Limited Partnership (Landowner) commenced this inverse condemnation action against respondent Lexington County (County) alleging that methane gas from Countyâ€™s adjacent landfill contaminated Landownerâ€™s property.[1]Â  The trial judge granted Countyâ€™s motion for summary judgment and Landowner appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties submitted affidavits indicating the following.Â  Methane gas is produced as buried waste materials decay.Â  It is a combustible and explosive gas that is hazardous in significant concentrations.Â  To prevent the natural underground migration of methane to Landownerâ€™s adjacent property, County took several actions required by the South Carolina Department of Environmental Control and the Environmental Protection Agency including capping the landfill, installing venting pipes, and digging a trench near the property line where a methane gas recovery system was installed.Â  \r\nLandownerâ€™s expert opined that the migration of methane to Landownerâ€™s property resulted from â€œthe geo-synthetic capping of [the landfill] in 2001 and the clay cap installed in 1990.â€Â  This capping diverted the vertical migration of methane and caused it to vent laterally onto Landownerâ€™s property.Â  Countyâ€™s expert summarily stated a contrary opinion that the capping â€œwas not the cause of the methane gas migrating to [Landownerâ€™s] property.â€Â  \r\nThe trial judge found that although there was a factual dispute regarding whether capping caused the migration of methane to Landownerâ€™s property, the capping in any event was not â€œan affirmative, positive, aggressive actâ€ and therefore did not support an action for inverse condemnation. Â \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs the capping of the landfill an affirmative, aggressive, and positive act to support an action for inverse condemnation?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn an action for inverse condemnation, the property owner is the moving party claiming an act of the sovereign has damaged his property to the extent of an actual taking, entitling him to compensation.Â  Cobb v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 365 S.C. 360, 618 S.E.2d 299 (2005).Â  Whether the plaintiff has established a claim for inverse condemnation is a matter for the court to determine.Â  Id.\r\nÂ To prevail in such an action, a plaintiff must prove â€œan affirmative, aggressive, and positive actâ€ by the government entity that caused the alleged damage to the plaintiffâ€™s property.Â  Berryâ€™s On Main, Inc. v. City of Columbia, 277 S.C. 14, 16, 281 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1981); Kline v. City of Columbia, 249 S.C. 532, 535, 155 S.E.2d 597, 599 (1967).Â  \r\nWe find our decisions in Kline, supra, and Berryâ€™s On Main, supra, controlling on this issue.Â  As in the case before us, these cases involved public improvements that allegedly damaged private property.Â  In Kline, the City of Columbia was widening and improving a public street when a gas line was breached causing an explosion and fire on the neighboring property.Â  In Berryâ€™s On Main, the City of Columbia undertook an urban redevelopment project that involved excavating a public street.Â  The excavations flooded during heavy rain damaging the property ownerâ€™s store.Â  In both these cases we found an affirmative, aggressive, and positive act by the local government that supported a cause of action for inverse condemnation.Â  Cf. Collins v. City of Greenville, 233 S.C. 506, 105 S.E.2d 704 (1958) (no positive act where the city, in attempting to unclog a sewer line, caused sewage to overflow from the plaintiffâ€™s commodes damaging his property).Â  \r\nHere, County undertook a permanent public project in capping the landfill.Â  Whether this action resulted in a taking is not before us.Â  We simply find on the single element of an affirmative, aggressive, positive act that Countyâ€™s action meets this requirement and summary judgment should not have been granted.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Knox McMahon, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The landfill closed in 1988.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26150","title":"Kurtz v.

Â He concluded trial counsel was ineffective and granted Kurtz a new trial.Â  The State filed a motion to alter or amend the order on the ground the evidence did not support the conclusion that trial counsel misadvised Kurtz.Â  The PCR judge denied the Stateâ€™s motion.Â  Kurtz then hired new counsel and filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, alleging the PCR judge erred in finding him ineligible for parole.[2]Â  He asked the PCR judge to vacate the prior order granting him relief, reinstate his convictions, and find that he is parole eligible. The PCR judge granted the motion.Â  The State appeals.Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the PCR judge err in ruling on whether Kurtz was eligible for parole?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Did the PCR judge err in finding Kurtz was eligible for parole?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  DISCUSSIONÂ  \r\n1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review by PCR judge \r\nThe State contends the PCR judge should not have ruled on the merits of the Kurtzâ€™s claim regarding parole eligibility. The State argues such claims are to be addressed through the Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (â€œDPPPSâ€) pursuant to Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000).\r\nIn deciding a similar claim, the Court held that â€œ[t]he PCR court incorrectly concluded that petitioner's claim was an Al-Shabazz claim that can only be resolved in the Department of Corrections' internal grievance system.â€ Coats v. State, 352 S.C. 500, 503, 575 S.E.2d 557, 558 (2003).Â  The Court held this type of claim â€œis appropriate for PCR because [the defendant] alleges that counsel was ineffective for improperly advising him that he would be parole eligible.â€ Â Id.Â  Accordingly, pursuant to Coats, the PCR judge correctly ruled on Kurtzâ€™s claim.Â  \r\n2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Parole EligibilityÂ Â  Â \r\nThe State also contends the PCR judge erred in finding that Kurtz was eligible for parole.Â  We agree.\r\nIn 1999, Kurtz pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident where death results which is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-1210(A)(3)(2006). Â In 1996, the General Assembly amended Â§ 56-5-1210(A)(3) to provide that this offense is a felony with a sentence of not less than one year and not more than twenty-five (25) years and a fine between $10,000 and $25,000.Â  \r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-90 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2005), all criminal offenses are classified according to the maximum sentence which can be imposed for the offense. The offenses are divided into felonies and misdemeanors and the felonies are further classified as A, B, or C.Â  A Class B felony carries a maximum sentence of twenty-five (25) years.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-100 (Supp. 2004), all Class A, B, and C felonies are classified as no parole offenses.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-13-66 (2005), the Code Commissioner is â€œto place crimes and offenses in the appropriate category as established by the General Assemblyâ€ in Â§ 16-1-90. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-13-66 (emphasis added).Â  â€œThe Code Commissioner is specifically prohibited from changing the designation by the General Assembly of any crime or offense from felony to misdemeanor or from misdemeanor to felony and is like wise prohibited from changing the number of years of any sentence set by the General Assembly.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn 1999, when Kurtz pled guilty, the offense of leaving the scene of an accident where death results had not yet been listed by the Commissioner as a Class B felony in Â§ 16-1-90.[3]Â  The offense did not appear in Â§ 16-1-90 until the 2000 Supplement was published. Â The PCR judge found that since it was not classified as a Class B felony in Â§ 16-1-90, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-100 was inapplicable and the offense was not a no parole offense when Kurtz pled guilty. He concluded Kurtz is eligible for parole and his trial counsel correctly advised him.Â  \r\nThe State contends that Kurtzâ€™s parole eligibility does not hinge on the Code Commissionerâ€™s listing of the classification. Â We agree.Â  As the State argues, once the General Assembly has enacted legislation providing that an offense is a felony with a maximum sentence of twenty-five (25) years, the offense is a Class B felony. Â Contrary to Kurtzâ€™s argument that attorneys would have to be clairvoyant regarding an offenseâ€™s classification, the Code Commissioner has no discretion and his classification of the offenses is merely a ministerial duty.[4]Â  To hold as Kurtz argues would mean that the effective date of any new legislation would not be until it is published in the Code.Â  However, acts become effective upon the approval of the governor.[5]\r\nAccordingly, we hold the offense of leaving the scene of an accident was a Class B felony and was a no parole offense when Kurtz pled guilty. Therefore, the PCR judgeâ€™s grant of Kurtzâ€™s Rule 60 motion is reversed.

Sloan Jr. (Sloan) brought an action against Friends of the Hunley, Inc. (Friends) and its chairman, Warren F. Lasch (Lasch), seeking injunctive and declaratory relief for a violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).Â  After the commencement of the litigation, Friends provided Sloan with the requested information.Â  Friends subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that the action was moot and that Sloan lacked standing.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Friends on all causes of action.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nFriends is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to the recovery and conservation of the Confederate submarine, the H.L. Hunley. Sloan requested documents from Friends pursuant to FOIA in July of 2001.Â  Friends refused to provide the requested documents contending that the corporation was not subject to FOIA.Â  Sloan filed a Complaint alleging that Friends has received more than $13,000,000 in public funds, is a public body as defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-20(a) (1991), and has violated FOIA by refusing to provide certain documents to Sloan after a FOIA request.Â  Sloan also alleged that Friends is merely the alter ego of the Hunley Commission (the Commission) and is, therefore, subject to all laws applicable to the Commission including\r\nFOIA.&nbsp; \r\nFriends sought summary judgment arguing that Sloanâ€™s cause of action for a declaratory judgment finding Friends a public body subject to FOIA was moot because they had fully complied with Sloanâ€™s FOIA request.Â  The trial court granted Friendsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  Friends subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment with a second trial court contending that Sloanâ€™s alter ego cause of action improperly called on the Court to render an advisory opinion and also that Sloan did not have standing to maintain an action to establish Friends as the alter ego of the Commission.Â  Judge John C. Hayes, III granted Friendsâ€™ motion, finding that the action essentially required an advisory opinion and that Sloan lacked sufficient standing.Â  Sloan appealed and raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in declining to consider whether Friends was a â€œpublic bodyâ€ under\r\n          FOIA?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in finding that Sloan lacks standing?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.\r\n         Did the trial court err in granting Friendsâ€™ motion for summary judgment as to the alter ego claim?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLasch raises the following issue for review as an additional sustaining ground:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Is Lasch entitled to summary judgment because he is being sued only in his capacity as the chairman of Friends?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this Court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Town of Awenda, 359 S.C. 29, 34, 596 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2004) (quoting Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001)).Â  On appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDeclaratory Judgment \r\nA.Â  Mootness\r\nSloan argues that the trial court erred in declining to consider whether Friends was a â€œpublic bodyâ€ under FOIA. [1]Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, this Court only considers cases presenting a justiciable controversy.Â  Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 430, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996).Â  A justiciable controversy exists when there is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a dispute that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract.Â  Id at 431, 468 S.E.2d at 864.Â  A moot case exists where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court.Â  Mathis v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973).Â  Â If there is no actual controversy, this Court will not decide moot or academic questions.Â  Id. (citing Â Jones v. Dillon-Marion Human Res. Dev. Commâ€™n., 277 S.C. 533, 535, 291 S.E.2d 195, 196 (1982)); see also Wallace v. City of York, 276 S.C. 693, 694, 281 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1981).Â Â  Although this Court has not addressed the issue of mootness as it pertains to FOIA, other courts have held that once the requested documents are produced, a justiciable controversy no longer exists.Â  Trueblood v. U.S. Dept. of Treasury, I.R.S., 943 F.Supp. 64, 67 (D.D.C. 1996); Misegades &amp; Douglas v. Schuyler, 456 F.2d 255, 255 (4th Cir. \r\n1972); Kaye v. Burns, 411 F.Supp. 897, 901 (S.D.N.Y. 1976).Â Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Sloan concedes that Friends has provided all documents requested pursuant to FOIA.Â  Additionally, since the filing of this appeal, Friends has conceded that it is presently a public body as related to this litigation.Â  The purpose of FOIA is to protect the public by providing a mechanism for the disclosure of information by public bodies.Â  Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C 291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991).Â  Because the information Sloan sought has been disclosed, there is no continuing violation of FOIA upon which the trial court could have issued a declaratory judgment.Â  Additionally, Sloan has further conceded that his interest in this matter is purely academic.Â  Therefore, we find that the question is moot, and any judgment by this Court would constitute an advisory opinion.Â Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting Friendsâ€™ motion for summary judgment as to Sloanâ€™s request for a declaratory judgment.\r\nB.Â  Exceptions to Mootness\r\nSloan further contends that the trial court erred in finding that none of the general exceptions to mootness applied in this case.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTwo exceptions in which the court may address an issue despite mootness are 1) when the issue raised is capable of repetition, yet evading review, and 2) when the question considers matters of important public interest.Â  Curtis v. State of South Carolina, 345 S.C. 557, 568, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001).Â Â  Neither exception applies in this case.\r\nIn evaluating whether a moot issue is capable of repetition, yet evading review the Court does not require that the complaining party be subject to the action again.Â  Byrd, 321 S.C. at 431, 468 S.E.2d at 864.Â  However, the action must be one which will truly evade review.Â  Id at 432, 468 S.E.2d at 864 (finding short term student suspensions will evade review because they are, â€œby their very nature, completed long before an appellate court can review the issues they implicateâ€); but see Seabrook v. City of Folly Beach, 337 S.C. 304, 307, 523 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1999) (holding that an action that is capable of repetition does not necessarily evade review).Â  \r\nIn Seabrook, the plaintiffs brought an action against the city alleging that the city imposed conditions on a residential development for which it had no authority.Â  337 S.C. at 304, 523 S.E.2d at 462.Â  After the trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs, the city removed the conditions and approved the plat.Â  In reviewing the appeal this Court found that the issue was moot, and that although the scenario was capable of repetition, it did not evade review.Â  \r\nThe instant case is analogous to Seabrook.Â  Although Friends admits that the current situation is capable of repetition, it does not evade review.Â  Should another person bring an action against Friends for a violation of FOIA and Friends fails to produce the requested documents, the Court will have the opportunity to review the issue.\r\nIn determining whether a moot issue should be reviewed under the public importance exception, the issue must present a question of imperative and manifest urgency requiring the establishment of a rule for future guidance in â€œmatters of important public interest.â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 361 S.C. 568, 570, 606 S.E.2d 464, 465-66 (2004) (citing Curtis, 345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596).Â  This evaluation must be made based on the facts of each individual situation.Â  Id at 571, 606 S.E.2d at 466.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSloanâ€™s contention that his declaratory judgment action meets the public importance exception despite mootness is unsupported.Â  Â Sloan does not present a â€œquestion of imperative and manifest urgency.â€Â  Because Friends produced the requested documents, Sloan has been afforded the intended benefit of FOIA.Â  Even assuming that this issue presents a matter of public importance, no imperative or manifest urgency exists in light of Friendsâ€™ producing the requested documents and conceding that it is presently a public body under FOIA.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that neither exception applies in this case.Â  Therefore, we affirm the ruling of the trial court. \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nStanding \r\nSloan contends that the trial court erred in ruling that he did not have standing to bring this action.Â Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, a party must be a real party in interest to the litigation to have standing.Â  Evins v. Richland County Historic Pres. Commâ€™n, 341 S.C. 15, 21, 532 S.E.2d 876, 879 (2000) (citing Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 478 S.E.2d 841 (1996)). Â A real party in interest is a party with a real, material, or substantial interest in the outcome of the litigation.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 530, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).Â  Â However, the South Carolina General Assembly addressed the issue of standing in FOIA cases in a specific statutory provision.Â  The statute provides: \r\n\r\n[a]ny citizen of the State may apply to the circuit court for either or both a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this chapter in appropriate cases as long as such application is made no later than one year following the date on which the alleged violation occurs or one year after a public vote in public session, whichever comes later. The court may order equitable relief as it considers appropriate, and a violation of this chapter must be considered to be an irreparable injury for which no adequate remedy at law exists.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-100(a) (1991).Â  Additionally, this Court has held that standing under FOIA does not require the information seeker to have a â€œpersonal stake in the outcome.â€Â  Fowler v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 463, 466, 472 S.E.2d 630, 632 (1996).\r\nAccordingly, we find that the trial court erred in finding that Sloan lacked standing to bring this action. \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlter Ego Theory \r\nSloan argues that the trial court erred in granting Friendsâ€™ motion for summary judgment as to the alter ego claim. We find no necessity to address this issue.\r\nThe alter ego cause of action is directly related to Sloanâ€™s cause of action for a declaratory judgment that Friends is a public body.Â  This second cause of action has no independent significance apart from the averments pertaining to the first cause of action.Â  Therefore, because we find the first cause of action moot, there is no necessity to address the issue of whether Friends is the alter ego of the Commission. \r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLaschâ€™s Entitlement to Summary Judgment \r\nLasch argues as an additional sustaining ground that he is entitled to summary judgment because he is being sued only in his capacity as chairman of Friends.Â  We agree.\r\nBecause we find Sloanâ€™s causes of action against Friends moot, and neither the complaint nor issues on appeal contains any averments regarding Lasch beyond his capacity as chairman of Friends, we hold that Lasch is also entitled to summary judgment as to all issues on appeal. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, we affirm the ruling of the trial court granting summary judgment to Friends.Â  Additionally, we affirm the granting of summary judgment to Lasch.Â  However, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that Sloan lacked standing to bring this action.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Friends contends that this issue is not properly before the Court. Friends argues that Sloan has only appealed the second trial courtâ€™s order, and that because the first trial court issued the order finding the declaratory judgment action moot, this issue is not presently reviewable by this Court.Â  While Friends is correct in the argument that the first trial courtâ€™s order is not before the Court, Friends fails to acknowledge that the first trial courtâ€™s order was amended to allow Sloan to go forward in his pursuit of a declaratory judgment in this cause of action.Â  Accordingly, we find the order issued by the second trial court is the order that declared the declaratory judgment cause of action moot. Therefore, this issue is properly before the Court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26152","title":"Charleston County DSS v.

Servs. v. King, Op. No. 2005-UP-155 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 4, 2005).[1]\r\nPetitioners, Charleston County Department of Social Services (DSS) and the pre-adoptive parents of the child (the Kendles),[2] appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent, Pamela King (King), and her husband, Kenneth King, were arrested in October 1999, after attempting to pass a fraudulent check.Â  The couple and their three children were traveling through South Carolina from Pennsylvania and were moving to Texas to live near Kingâ€™s family.Â  The couple was arrested for obtaining goods under false pretenses.Â  Upon further inspection by police, a crack pipe was found in Kingâ€™s purse.[3] Â The\r\ncouple was placed in jail and DSS took the children into emergency protective custody.Â  At the time of removal, Casey was nine, Ashley was five, and Cody was two years old. \r\nA treatment plan was presented to the family court in January 2000 and finalized as of July 2000.Â  The plan directed King to undergo a psychological evaluation, complete parenting classes, complete various forms of counseling, and pay child support.\r\nIn February 2000, King and her husband moved from Charleston County to Jasper County.Â  King completed parenting classes in September 2000.Â  King attended counseling sessions, but then ceased to attend in April 2000.Â  She later attended more counseling sessions for approximately five months.Â  She paid six months of child support before her payments became sporadic.\r\nKing testified that, although she had never used drugs before, she began to use cocaine in October 2000.Â  She twice tested positive for cocaine in February and June 2001.Â  King testified she used cocaine two to three times a week from October 2000 to June 2001.Â  Meanwhile, in February 2001, King left her husband and moved in with her mother and stepfather in Smoaks, South Carolina.[4]Â  She resided there for approximately two years before the termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing and apparently continues to reside there with the two children who were returned to her.Â  At the time of the TPR hearing, King was in divorce proceedings with her estranged husband.Â  Throughout the time the children were in protective custody, King visited the children.\r\nThe Foster Care Review Board recommended terminating Kingâ€™s parental rights in October 2000.Â  Because King had not fully complied with her treatment plan, the family court adopted a permanence plan of\r\nterminating Kingâ€™s parental rights as to all of her children in March 2001.Â  The TPR action was filed in May 2001. \r\nKing, in the meantime, began to accomplish the goals set out in the treatment plan.Â  She entered substance abuse treatment, which included family counseling, through a Drug Court program following her September 2001 arrest for breach of trust.Â  She completed her substance abuse treatment in September 2002 and had completed all the requirements set out in the treatment plan except for paying child support, for which she was briefly imprisoned in March 2002.Â  She completed the anger management and domestic abuse counseling in March 2001 and the psychological evaluation in June 2001.Â  As a result, in April 2002, the Foster Care Review Board and the former guardian ad litem (GAL), Ruth Buck, changed their recommendations from termination of parental rights to reunification.Â  DSS looked at each childâ€™s individual best interest and returned Ashley and Casey, an autistic child, to King in November 2002.Â  DSS did not return Cody to King.Â  The DSS caseworker testified it was in Ashleyâ€™s and Caseyâ€™s best interests to be returned to King, but it was not in Codyâ€™s best interest to be returned to King.\r\nAs for the children, they were placed in separate foster homes after being removed from their parents.Â  Cody was placed with the Shanklin family for two years but was removed in September 2001.[5]Â  He was then placed in two short-term households before being placed in the pre-adoptive home of Kurtis and Gayle Kendle in October 2001.Â  When the Kendles took Cody in, the DSS caseworker informed them they could call him â€œCody Kendleâ€ and gave them a Medicaid card with the name â€œCody Kendle.â€Â  The caseworker also informed them they could raise him as their own son and represent themselves as his parents.Â  The caseworker stated that such actions are\r\nstandard practice for adoptive placements.Â  She testified she informed the Kendles that Cody was a high-risk adoption. \r\nWhen he was removed from the Kings, Cody was diagnosed with psychosocial dwarfism or psychosocial failure to thrive, an environmentally-induced condition that occurs when a child is not receiving appropriate nurturing behaviors from a parent.\r\nDSS withdrew its action to terminate Kingâ€™s parental rights as to the older two children but continued with the action to terminate her rights as to Cody.Â  After a hearing, the family court judge terminated Kingâ€™s parental rights pursuant to three statutory grounds. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1572 (2), (4), and (8) (Supp. 2005).Â  First, the court found King had failed to remedy the condition which caused the removal within six months following the adoption of the placement plan.Â  The family court judge also found King had failed to support her child by not paying child support in excess of six months.Â  Additionally, the family court found Cody had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\r\nAs for Codyâ€™s best interests, the family court found his best interests were served by terminating Kingâ€™s parental rights.Â  The court noted that, at that time, Cody had spent over half his life in foster care and was thriving with the Kendles.Â  The court found the evidence showed Cody did not have an accurate perception of his birth mother or siblings.Â  He viewed his siblings only as two children with whom he visits and King as Casey and Ashleyâ€™s mother.Â  The court also noted the overwhelming evidence that Cody had â€œbondedâ€ with the Kendles and referred to the Kendles as mom and dad.Â  The court distinguished Codyâ€™s situation from that of his siblings because, due to Codyâ€™s young age, he had essentially no memory of his biological family.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, finding only one of the grounds for termination existed, and that Codyâ€™s best interests would be served by preserving Kingâ€™s parental rights.Â  The Court of Appeals found DSS had proved only one ground for TPR which was that Cody had been in foster care fifteen out of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  The Court of Appeals found it was in Codyâ€™s best interests to return to King and his siblings.Â  In finding for King, the Court of Appeals relied on the Moore factors (to be discussed infra), and determined that Codyâ€™s best interests would be served by denying the termination of Kingâ€™s parental rights.\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ decision upholding the family courtâ€™s ruling that Cody had been in foster care fifteen out of the most recent twenty-two months at the time of the hearing was not appealed.Â  Because one statutory ground for TPR has been met, the only issue remaining for us to consider is whether termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005) (family court may terminate parental rights if it finds at least one of the nine statutory grounds for termination has been met and that termination is in the best interest of the child).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err by applying the Moore v. Moore[6] criteria to a determination of the best interests of the child in a termination of parental rights case?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err by ruling that the best interests of the child required the parental rights of the mother to be preserved?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nPetitioners argue the Court of Appeals erred by applying the Moore factors to a determination of the best interests of the child in a termination of parental rights case.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Moore case involved a child custody dispute between a natural father and the family that offered to take care of one of his five children.Â  The natural father accepted the familyâ€™s offer of taking care of the child, but continued to visit the child regularly.Â  Eventually, when the family refused to allow the father to visit with the child except in their home, the father commenced a suit requiring the family to show cause why he should not be allowed to remove the child from their home.\r\nIn Moore, we stated the dilemma is how to assure that parents who temporarily relinquish custody for their childâ€™s best interests can regain custody when conditions become more favorable.Â  To address this dilemma, we stated the following factors should be considered in making custody determinations when a natural parent seeks to reclaim custody of his child:Â  (1) the parent must prove that he or she is a fit parent, able to properly care for the child and provide a good home; (2) the amount of contact, in the form of visits, financial support or both, which the parent had with the child while the child was in the care of a third party; (3) the circumstances under which temporary relinquishment occurred; (4) the degree of attachment between the child and the temporary custodian.Â  After applying the criteria, we determined the natural father should be awarded custody of the child.\r\nPetitioners argue the Moore factors were established to determine the best interests of a child in a custody dispute involving voluntary relinquishment of custody, not in a termination of parental rights action.Â  Petitioners are correct.\r\nThe Moore factors have been used in actions seeking to regain custody after a voluntary relinquishment.Â  See, e.g., Malpass v. Hodson, 309 S.C. 397, 424 S.E.2d 470 (1992) (factors used in case where mother sought to regain custody after voluntarily relinquishing custody to maternal grandparents Â while in abusive relationship); Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 505 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1998) (factors used in case where father sought to regain custody after voluntarily relinquishing custody to grandparents).\r\nWe have used the Moore factors in one termination of parental rights case.Â  Hopkins v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 313 S.C. 322, 437 S.E.2d 542 (1993), overruled on other grounds by Joiner ex rel Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000).Â  However, this case is distinguishable.Â  Although a TPR action was involved, the target of that action was an innocent natural father who had attempted to establish his paternity of the child but could not because the mother continually disappeared with the child and later, without the fatherâ€™s knowledge, subjected the child to abuse and neglect.Â  While the child had not been voluntarily relinquished by the father as envisioned by the Moore case, DSS removed the child from the mother before the father was given a chance to establish his paternity; therefore, it was an action involving an innocent parent attempting to gain custody of his child from a third party.Â  Therefore, Hopkins, does not stand for the proposition that the Moore factors should be used when determining the best interests of a child in a termination of parental rights case.\r\nThe Court of Appeals has also mentioned the Moore factors in a TPR case.Â  In Shake, the parents of Michael voluntarily relinquished custody of him to the Department of Social Services (DSS) because he had been diagnosed with failure to thrive.Â  Shake v. Darlington County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 306 S.C. 216, 410 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  DSS placed Michael with Shake and Shake later moved to terminate the parental rights of the parents and for custody of Michael regardless of termination of parental rights.Â  The court found DSS and Shake had failed to establish grounds sufficient to meet the standard required to terminate parental rights.Â  Therefore, the court found the motherâ€™s parental rights should not be terminated and did not reach the issue of whether the best interests of the child required that the motherâ€™s parental rights be terminated.\r\nHowever, Shake further argued that even if parental rights were not terminated, it was in Michaelâ€™s best interest to remain in her custody.Â  The court utilized the Moore factors and determined that Michaelâ€™s best interests required that he be placed in Shakeâ€™s custody.Â  The Court of Appeals, therefore, did not apply the Moore factors to the termination of parental rights portion of the case but only to the custody portion of the case.\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by applying the Moore factors to the instant action.Â  The Moore factors apply where a natural parent, who has voluntarily relinquished custody of his child, seeks to reclaim custody from a third party.Â  The Moore factors cannot apply in the termination of parental rights situation because that situation is governed by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1560 to -1582 (Supp. 2005).\r\nII\r\nPetitioners argue that because Cody has bonded with the Kendles, is thriving in their home, and has no memory of his biological mother and siblings, his best interests require that Kingâ€™s parental rights be terminated.\r\nBoth parties questioned the experts presented at trial regarding Codyâ€™s best interests.Â  Dr. Elizabeth Ralston, a clinical psychologist, testified she had observed Cody and the Kendles, and King and her other children. Â Dr. Ralston testified Cody had no verbal memory of his natural parents and did not identify King as his mother or Ashley and Casey as his siblings.Â  Instead, she testified Cody identifies King as â€œAshley and Caseyâ€™s motherâ€ and his siblings as â€œa boy and a girl, and as brother and sister.â€Â  In Dr. Ralstonâ€™s opinion, Cody has blossomed in the Kendlesâ€™ care and no longer shows any symptoms of psychosocial dwarfism.Â  On cross, Dr. Ralston testified Codyâ€™s removal from the Kendles might be mitigated by the fact that he was being returned to his natural mother and siblings if he had any memory of those people in that capacity.Â  However, she testified Cody does not have that memory. \r\nDr. Charles Barton Saylor, a forensic psychologist, testified Cody did not express any recollection of his natural parents and did not have a real concept of his natural family.Â  He testified Cody thinks of Mrs. Kendle, not King, as his mother.Â  Dr. Saylor testified Codyâ€™s best interests would be served by allowing him to remain with the Kendles and have closure.\r\nThe DSS caseworker testified Cody is happy, bonded, and attached to the Kendles and has no real attachment to his mother during visits and that he mostly plays with his siblings during those visits.\r\nOne of the adoption specialists testified that Cody believes the Kendlesâ€™ home is his home and that he is comfortable there.Â  She felt his best interests required that he remain with the\r\nKendles.\r\nThe Kendles testified that Cody calls them mom and dad and is very affectionate towards them.Â  Mrs. Kendle, at the time of the hearing, was a stay-at-home mother and Mr. Kendle was a homebuilder working at an office inside the home.\r\nThe former GAL, Ruth Buck, testified Cody does not know King as his natural mother because he was too young when he was removed.Â  Buck stated she changed her position regarding TPR because King never missed a visit with Cody and she saw an improvement in Codyâ€™s relationship with her once the estranged husband stopped visiting.Â  She further changed her position because King made substantial progress on her treatment plan.Â  She admitted that Cody has bonded with the Kendles and calls them mom and dad and that Cody has a nice home to live in with a private room.Â  Buck testified that because King has been deemed to be a fit enough mother to take care of her special needs child, she is very able to accept Cody back into the family.Â  Buck recommended that Cody be returned to King.\r\nWhen reviewing the family court decision, appellate courts may make their own conclusions of whether DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that parental rights should be terminated.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 614 S.E.2d 642 (2005).Â  We have stated:Â  â€œThe termination of the legal relationship between natural parents and a child presents one [of] the most difficult issues this Court is called upon to decide.Â  We exercise great caution in reviewing termination proceedings and will conclude termination is proper only when the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates such a result.â€Â  Id.\r\nat 626, 614 S.E.2d at 645.\r\nOur General Assembly has mandated that when the interest of the child and the parental rights conflict, the interest of the child shall prevail. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2005).Â  See also South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, supra (in balancing the interests of the child and the mother, the best interest of the child is paramount to that of the parent).\r\nAt the time of the family court hearing, Cody had been out of Kingâ€™s care for almost three and one-half years and had been with the Kendles for almost one and a half years.Â  By the time King had completed her treatment plan, Cody was in a loving, stable environment with the Kendles and had no memory of his biological family.Â  As the experts at trial testified, Cody did not realize King was his natural mother and he identified the Kendles as his parents.Â  To remove Cody from the Kendles clearly would be very traumatic for him.Â  We find the family court correctly determined that the best interests of Cody were that his motherâ€™s parental rights be terminated and that he remain with the Kendles.Â  See Â§ 20-7-1578 (if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict, the interest of the child shall prevail). Â Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Howard P. King, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Kenneth King, the biological father of the child, did not appeal the termination of his parental rights.\r\n[2]Although the Kendles filed their motion to intervene under the pseudonyms John Roe and Mary Roe, they used their real names at the hearing.\r\n[3]The charge regarding the crack pipe was dismissed.\r\n[4]Kingâ€™s mother and step-father moved to South Carolina to assist their daughter in regaining her children.\r\n[5]When Cody arrived at the Shanklin home, he was underweight, scared, cried for his brother, and had food issues.Â  He allegedly would eat until he made himself sick, hide food, and pick up objects and smell them to see if he could eat them.Â  Cody was removed from the Shanklin home when the Shanklins separated.\r\n[6]300 S.C. 75, 386 S.E.2d 456 (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26153","title":"Riddle v.

Maryland[1] when it suppressed certain evidence involving witness Jason Riddle (Jason), and that that office violated petitionerâ€™s due process rights when it failed to correct misstatements made by Jason while testifying against petitioner.Â  See Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959).Â  The PCR order denying petitioner relief is reversed, and the matter remanded for further proceedings. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn the early morning hours of August 8, 1985, Mrs. Abby Sue Mullinax was murdered in her home when her throat was cut.Â  Nineteen-year-old petitioner and his seventeen-year-old brother Jason were arrested on August 20, based on information supplied by their older brother, Bruce.Â  On August 22, Jason gave a statement confessing that he and petitioner[2] had entered the home through a window, that he had stolen money from a purse on a dresser, and that petitioner had cut Mrs. Mullinaxâ€™s throat.\r\nPetitioner was convicted of the murder, burglary, and armed robbery of Abby Mullinax and received a death sentence.Â  There was no physical evidence connecting petitioner with the murder and robbery of Mrs. Mullinax.Â  Rather, the Stateâ€™s case rested on the eyewitness testimony of petitionerâ€™s alleged accomplice, his mildly mentally retarded brother Jason, and the testimony of various witnesses concerning petitionerâ€™s statements after Mrs. Mullinaxâ€™s death.\r\nAt the 1986 trial Jason testified against petitioner.Â  Bruce, who had been staying with Jimmy and Tammy Lewis in their home near Mrs. Mullinaxâ€™s, testified that petitioner had come to the Lewis home around 3 or 4 am on the 8th, panicky, covered with blood, and wet from the knees down.Â  Bruce testified that later that day Jason and petitioner were seen with cash, and that when a news story about the murder came on TV, petitioner said, â€œwe donâ€™t have to worry about that bitch anymore.â€Â  Tammy Lewis testified and confirmed Bruceâ€™s story about the money and petitionerâ€™s statement.\r\nFourteen-year-old Jerry Walker testified that several days after the murder petitioner said, in a joking manner, that he had killed a woman before.Â  Another witness, James Buster Smith, testified that he, Jerry, and petitioner had gone to a lake around August 12, and that petitioner told them he had known Mrs. Mullinax, and that she had had valuable possessions and money in her home.\r\nPetitioner called his stepmother to testify that Bruce had admitted turning Jason and petitioner in for reward money.Â  Petitioner also called Clifton Coker, the Lewisâ€™s neighbor, who testified that shortly after the murder occurred he heard other neighbors Ricky and Lisa Nuzum (also spelled Newsome) up on his porch knocking on his door.Â  He then heard car doors slam as they drove away.Â  The next day he and his roommate found what appeared to be drops of blood on their porch.Â  They cleaned up the blood.Â  Bloodhounds taken to the Mullinax home â€œtrackedâ€ to the area around the Lewis-Nuzum-Coker homes and not to the barn.Â  Although the jury learned only that the State had used bloodhounds but not what trail they had followed, at the PCR hearing the State acknowledged that the dogs had tracked to the Lewis-Nuzum-Coker homes.\r\nOn appeal, the Court affirmed the murder conviction but set aside the death sentence.Â  State v. Riddle, 291 S.C. 232, 353 S.E.2d 138 (1987).Â  Following a 1987 resentencing proceeding, a second jury returned a death sentence, which was also reversed on direct appeal.Â  State v. Riddle, 301 S.C. 68, 389 S.E.2d 665 (1990).Â  In 1991, a third jury returned a death sentence which was affirmed.Â  Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d 557 (1994).[3]\r\nThis PCR action involves the guilt phase of the 1986 trial and the 1991 resentencing proceeding.Â  We address only the grave constitutional violations which occurred during the 1986 guilt phase, and which mandate reversal of the PCR order.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Whether there is any evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that no Brady violation occurred?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2)&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the PCR judge erred in concluding that the Solicitorâ€™s failure to correct Jasonâ€™s false trial testimony did not require a new trial?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nScope of Review\r\nOn certiorari, this Court must uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s findings where they are supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Gibson v. State, 344 S.C. 515, 514 S.E.2d 320 (1999).Â  We are concerned here not with the routine PCR issue whether trial counsel was ineffective, but instead with the question whether prosecutorial misconduct denied petitionerâ€™s due process right to a fair trial.Â  Id.\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brady violation\r\nAn individual asserting a Brady violation must demonstrate that evidence: (1) favorable to the accused; (2) in the possession of or known by the prosecution; (3) was suppressed by the State; and (4) was material to the accusedâ€™s guilt or innocence or was impeaching.Â  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995); Gibson, supra.Â  If a Brady violation is found to have occurred, PCR must be granted.Â  Gibson, supra.Â  Petitioner points to several instances of alleged Brady violations.Â  We find it necessary to discuss only two.\r\nFirst, as noted above, Jason gave a statement confessing to his and petitionerâ€™s guilt on August 22, 1985.Â  The first trial commenced on January 27, 1986.Â  On January 22, 1986, Jason gave a second statement to police which petitioner contends was not disclosed to his attorneys.Â  The PCR judge found that had petitionerâ€™s counsel interviewed the officer who took notes of the statement between January 22 and the start of the trial, they would have learned of this statement.Â  The PCR judge therefore concluded that the January 22 statement was available to petitioner, and thus the Stateâ€™s failure to disclose this statement did not violate Brady.Â  We disagree.Â  Not only is it unrealistic to require petitioner and his attorneys to reinterview all officers and investigators in the days before the trial, but that is not what Brady requires.Â  The burden is on the solicitor to disclose material evidence which is exculpatory or impeaching.Â  Gibson, supra.\r\nThe PCR judge also held that nothing in Jasonâ€™s January 22 statement was material for Brady impeachment purposes.Â  Evidence is material under Brady if there is a â€œreasonable probabilityâ€ that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the information been disclosed.Â  E.g., State v. Proctor, 358 S.C. 424, 595 S.E.2d 480 (2004).Â  The question is not whether petitioner would more likely have been acquitted had this evidence been disclosed, but whether, without this impeachment evidence, he received a fair trial â€œresulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.â€Â  Kyles v. Whitley, supra, at 434.\r\nThere were several inconsistencies between Jasonâ€™s original statement and his trial testimony, and the undisclosed January 22 statement.Â  Among these differences were whether Jason or petitioner removed the window fan from the window before entering the home; whether the brothers both went to the bedroom or whether one went to the kitchen and the other to the bedroom; whether the victimâ€™s purse was found on a large or small dresser; whether Jason fell before or after he heard the victim getting up, and where he fell; where he was when he saw petitioner kill Mrs. Mullinax; what he saw or heard as he left the house; and whether they got $100 or $125.\r\nThe most glaring inconsistency is that in his January 22 statement, Jason claimed that a friend had picked the brothers up after the murder and given them a ride to the barn, whereas in his original statement and in his trial testimony he maintained the brothers had walked the approximately three miles from the Mullinax home to the barn.Â  Before the commencement of the trial, officers questioned the person Jason identified as having given the brothers a ride, who denied having done so. Â The State therefore chose not to present any evidence of the brothers having been driven to the barn.\r\nThe impeachment value of this statement is clear.Â  Either the brothers were given a lift or they were not: Jason could not have been telling the truth in all his statements.Â  Moreover, without the automobile ride, it is difficult to conceive how the brothers were able to travel the three miles from the Mullinax home to the barn, and back to the Lewisâ€™s home, in the time between the murder and the time when Bruce testified they returned to the Lewis home.\r\nWhether this statement alone was material under Brady is a close question.Â  As we stated in Gibson, citing the United States Supreme Court:\r\n\r\nThe overriding theme of the Brady cases is the emphasis the Supreme Court has placed on the prosecutorâ€™s responsibility for fair play.Â  In close cases, â€œthe prudent prosecutor will resolve doubtful questions in favor of disclosure.Â  This is as it should be.Â  Such disclosures will serve to justify trust in the prosecutor as the representativeâ€¦of a sovereigntyâ€¦whose interestâ€¦in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.Â  And it will tend to preserve the criminal trial, as distinct from the prosecutorâ€™s private deliberations, as the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations.â€\r\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. at 438-40 (quotes omitted) (citing Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935)).\r\n\r\nOur judicial system relies upon the integrity of the participants.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).Â  In this case, a prudent solicitor would have chosen to disclose the January 22 questioning and the resulting statement.\r\nWhen determining whether the suppression of more than one item of evidence was material under Brady, we consider the collective impact of the undisclosed evidence.Â  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. at 436.Â  The second undisclosed evidentiary item in this case was the fact that on January 24, 1986, two days after Jasonâ€™s second statement and three days before the trial commenced, several police officers, Solicitor Gossett, and the solicitorâ€™s assistant took Jason by automobile to the Mullinax home and from there retraced the route he and Ernest took to the barn.Â  There were questions asked of Jason during this outing, although it is unclear whether any new information was gleaned.Â  The defense was not informed of this trip. \r\nThe PCR judge concluded, among other things, that information relating to the trip was in the prosecutorâ€™s file and therefore available to the defense under the solicitorâ€™s â€œopen fileâ€ policy.Â  The evidence at trial, however, was that the solicitorâ€™s office maintained an unusual â€œopen fileâ€ policy in that they removed not only work product, but also â€œother documents on a case-by-case basis.â€Â  Even had a true â€œopen fileâ€ policy existed, the existence of such a policy does not negate the solicitorâ€™s Brady obligation. Â Porter v. State, Op. No. _________ (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 6, 2006).Â  This is especially so where the â€œreconstructionâ€ trip took place only three days before trial.\r\nJason was a young man of limited mental abilities: knowledge of this trip would have bolstered petitionerâ€™s contention that Jason was an unreliable witness who had to be coached, and whose testimony was not worthy of belief.Â  Given the absence of any physical evidence tying petitioner to the Mullinax murder, the Stateâ€™s case rested almost exclusively on Jasonâ€™s recounting. \r\nÂ The PCR judgeâ€™s finding that the evidence of the January 22nd statement and the January 24 trip was not material under Brady is without evidentiary support in the record, and therefore is reversed.\r\n3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to correct false testimony\r\nAt the 1986 trial, Jason was asked more than once whether he had spoken about the case to anyone other than Officer Harris in August 1985 when he gave his first statement.Â  Jason denied speaking with anyone other than his lawyers, neglecting to mention either the January 22, 1986 statement or the trip on January 24, 1986. Â The solicitor failed to correct Jasonâ€™s false trial testimony.\r\nThe PCR judge found that the State did not violate due process by failing to correct Jasonâ€™s false testimony because the State may have thought either that Jason misunderstood the questions or that he simply did not recall the recent events.Â  Since the State did not know why Jason failed to testify truthfully, petitioner was found not to have met his burden of showing the State knowingly used perjured testimony.\r\nWe disagree.Â  The issue is not why Jason failed to tell the truth: rather, it is why the solicitor, who knew Jasonâ€™s testimony to be false, failed to correct it.\r\nA &quot;prosecutorâ€™s deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice.â€Â  Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150, 153 (1972).Â  The failure to correct false evidence is as reprehensible as its presentation.Â  Washington v. State, 324 S.C. 232, 478 S.E.2d 833 (1996).Â  The PCR judge erred in concluding that the State was not obligated to correct Jasonâ€™s false testimony, and in failing to hold that this violation of petitionerâ€™s due process rights required that he be granted a new trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Constitution requires only that a defendant receive a fair trial, not a perfect one.Â  U.S. Const. Am. VI; State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d 795 (1999).Â  Petitionerâ€™s trial was rendered fundamentally unfair by prosecutorial misconduct.Â  No probative evidence exists in this record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s findings and conclusion.Â  Accordingly, the PCR order denying petitioner relief is \r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Brooks P.

King, both of Lewis, Babcock &amp; Hawkins, LLP, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  This is an appeal from a circuit court order granting respondentâ€™s (Palmetto Princessâ€™s) motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn April 2004, Palmetto Princess brought a declaratory judgment action against appellant, Georgetown County (the County), on the grounds the County had exceeded its authority in passing two ordinances and that the ordinances violated the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Palmetto Princess brought the action because it intended to run a gambling day cruise, also known as a â€œcruise to nowhere,â€ out of the County, and the Countyâ€™s ordinances prevented such a business.\r\nThe Countyâ€™s first ordinance, Ordinance # 2002-12, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nNo person shall open, keep, maintain, dock, moor, anchor or operate any gaming vessel within the corporate limits of the County, or suffer any gaming vessel to operate from any marina, terminal or marine facility within the corporate limits of the County for the purpose of embarking or disembarking persons whose intent is to use gambling devices or gambling facilities within the vessel.\r\n. . .\r\nAnyone violating this ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by the payment of a fine of up to five hundred dollars and be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of up to thirty days in jail.\r\n\r\nThe Countyâ€™s second ordinance, Ordinance # 2004-11, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe manufacture, reconditioning, repair, sale, transportation, possession or use of any gambling device on any vessel on a day cruise is prohibited.\r\n. . .\r\n Section 2.Â Â  By enacting this ordinance, County Council under the authority delegated to it by the South Carolina Legislature in S.C. Code Ann. Section 4-9-25, exercises the authority granted the State of South Carolina by the Congress of the United States in 15 U.S.C. Section 1175(b)(2)(A)[1] and declares that Georgetown County is exempt from the provisions of 15 U.S.C. Section 1175(b)(1).\r\n Section 3.Â Â  This civil prohibition is adopted for the sole objective of having gambling day cruises remain a federal offense within Georgetown County, under 15 U.S.C. Section 1175, and not for the purpose of rendering such conduct a misdemeanor penalized under state law, and such prosecution is hereby prohibited.\r\n\r\nBoth parties filed for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted Palmetto Princessâ€™s motion for summary judgment based on two grounds.Â  First, the court held the plain language of the Johnson Act makes clear that the authority to declare gambling day cruises illegal is vested with a State and not a county.Â  Therefore, the County was without authority to enact the ordinances.Â  Second, the court found that the ordinances violate article VIII, Â§ 14, of the state constitution because the ordinances make conduct illegal that is not illegal under state law.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err by finding the County had exceeded its authority in passing the ordinances?Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe County argues it has authority to opt out of the Johnson Act and enact an ordinance prohibiting gambling day cruises.Â  The County contends the Johnson Act allows a local government, rather than just a state government, to enact a law prohibiting gambling day cruises.\r\nThe Johnson Act generally prohibits the use or possession of any gambling device on a United States flag vessel.Â  One exception is that the possession or transport of a gambling device within state territorial waters is not a violation of the prohibition if the device remains on board the vessel and is used only outside those territorial waters.Â  15 U.S.C. Â§ 1175(b)(1).Â  That exception does not apply, however, â€œif the State or possession of the United States in which the voyage or segment begins and ends has enacted a statuteâ€ prohibiting gambling day cruises.Â  15 U.S.C. Â§ 1175(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\r\nThe circuit court correctly held that the plain language of the Johnson Act indicates that only a State, not a division of the state government such as the County here, can act to prohibit gambling day cruises.Â  See Brown v. County of Berkeley, 366 S.C. 354, 622 S.E.2d 533 (2005) (clear and unambiguous words in a statute should be given their plain and ordinary meaning).Â  The Countyâ€™s alleged power to enact the ordinances, therefore, cannot derive from the Johnson Act.Â  We further note that, at the time the ordinances were enacted, the State had not opted out of the Johnson Act and had not enacted a statute prohibiting gambling day cruises.[2]Â  See Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001) (gambling day cruises are not unlawful).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the plain language of the Johnson Act indicates that only a State, not a division of the state government such as the County here, can act to prohibit gambling day cruises.Â  Therefore, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to Palmetto Princess.Â  See Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003) (summary judgment appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law).Â  Given our decision, it is unnecessary to address the Countyâ€™s argument that the circuit court erred by finding its ordinances violated article VIII, Â§14, of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  See Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 607 S.E.2d 707 (2005) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, J., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr., and Mark J. Hayes, II, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Also known as the Johnson Act, to be discussed infra.\r\n[2]Subsequent to the circuit courtâ€™s order issued in this case, the General Assemblyâ€™s Gambling Cruise Prohibition Act was signed into law by the governor with an effective date of June 1, 2005.Â  Section 3-11-200(A) of this Act specifically allows the type of ordinance enacted by the County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Lewis v.

This order gave petitioner twenty days to show cause why the conditional order should not become final. Instead of filing a reply to this conditional order of dismissal, petitioner has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court, which we have construed as a notice of appeal.\r\nUnder Rule 227, SCACR, and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-100 (2003), only a final decision or judgment in a post-conviction relief action is subject to review. &quot;Any judgment or decree, leaving some further act to be done by the court before the rights of the parties are determined, is interlocutory; but if it so completely fixes the rights of the parties that the court has nothing further to do in the action, then it is final.&quot; Adickes v.

Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 593 S.E.2d 486 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBynum Rayfield (Petitioner) was convicted of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor, three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  Petitioner was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of thirty years for CSC, fifteen years for lewd acts, and three years for contributing to delinquency.Â  \r\nDuring the initial jury selection, Petitioner exercised peremptory challenges against five members of the jury venire: Â five white females, one of whom was a potential alternate, and one white male.Â  The petit jury selected was composed of nine males and three females.Â  The alternates were one male and one female.\r\nAfter the jury was selected, the State moved the court pursuant to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), to find that Petitioner had exercised his peremptory challenges based on gender.[1]Â  The Stateâ€™s main argument was that Petitioner had discriminatorily challenged female jurors, but the State also argued that Petitioner had discriminatorily challenged one male juror, the only male he challenged.\r\nThe trial judge found no Batson violation with respect to the female jurors.Â  The trial judge did find a violation with respect to the one male, Juror # 70; therefore, the judge granted the Stateâ€™s motion and redrew the jury.Â  None of the jurors initially challenged by Petitioner was selected for the second jury.Â  No Batson motion was made, and the second jury served at trial. \r\nLater, during the hearing on requests to charge, Petitioner objected to the trial judge charging the jury that under South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ Â 16-3-657 (2003), â€œthe testimony of a victim need not be corroborated in prosecutionsâ€ for CSC with a minor.Â  Petitioner argued that the charge improperly implies that the alleged victimâ€™s testimony is more credible than other witnessesâ€™ testimony.Â  The trial judge disagreed and gave the charge.Â Â  \r\nAfter the jury returned with guilty verdicts, Petitioner moved for a new trial based both on the trial judgeâ€™s redrawing of the jury and on the charge to the jury.Â  The judge court denied the motion on both grounds.\r\nPetitioner appealed the convictions and the Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  The Court of Appeals held that the trial judge had erred in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, because â€œno gender based discrimination was associated with the striking ofâ€ the one male juror.Â  Rayfield, 357 S.C. at 503, 593 S.E.2d at 490.Â  The Court of Appeals further held, however, that the trial judgeâ€™s error was harmless because none of the jurors whom Petitioner excused from the original jury served on the trial jury.Â  Id. at 504, 593 S.E.2d at 490.Â  According to the Court of Appeals, its holding was required under our opinion in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  Id.\r\nWith respect to the jury charge, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge had committed no error.Â  The Court of Appeals noted that the no-corroboration charge withstood appellate scrutiny in State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993).Â  Rayfield, 357 S.C. at 505, 593 S.E.2d at 491.Â  The Court of Appeals held that the charge as a whole was proper.Â  Id.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the trial judge, in granting a groundless Batson motion by the State, committed harmless error in quashing the original jury and drawing a new one?\r\nII.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the trial judge properly charged Section 16-3-657 to the jury?\r\n\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  BATSON MOTION\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding that, although the trial judge erred in granting the Stateâ€™s groundless Batson motion, Petitioner failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the error.Â  Allowing the State to pursue a meritless Batson motion as a strategic ploy to draw a jury more to its liking is inconsistent with the Stateâ€™s duty to ensure that justice is done even while striving vigorously to obtain a conviction.Â  Petitioner contends he was unfairly prejudiced due to the improper advantage gained by the State and, in any event, he should not be required to demonstrate prejudice in this instance because any remedy short of a new trial rewards the State for using an improper trial tactic.\r\nâ€œThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.â€Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  â€œThe purposes of Batson and its progeny are to protect the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a jury of the defendantâ€™s peers, protect each venirepersonâ€™s right not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory reasons, and preserve public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection process.â€Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 628-29, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1999).Â  Both the State and defendants are prohibited from discriminatorily exercising a peremptory challenge of a prospective juror.Â  Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 58, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 2358-59, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992).\r\nWe set forth the proper procedure for a Batson hearing in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (citing Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995)).Â  After a party objects to a jury strike, the proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation. Â This explanation is not required to be persuasive or even plausible. Â Once the proponent states a reason that is race-neutral, the burden is on the party challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, either by showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury or the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 123-24, 470 S.E.2d at 371-72; Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629-30, 515 S.E.2d at 90-91.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly held that the trial judge erred in granting the Stateâ€™s meritless Batson motion and redrawing the jury.Â  The record contains no evidence Petitioner struck the male juror based on gender.Â  During the Batson hearing, Petitioner gave a gender-neutral explanation for the strike: Â the juror had a conservative appearance and was retired.Â  E.g. State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 538, 413 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1991) (party may strike potential juror based on demeanor and disposition); Haigler, 334 S.C. 632, 515 S.E.2d at 92 (lack of employment or place of employment may be neutral reason for strike).Â  The record does not reveal a pattern of striking male jurors or any other evidence to support a finding that Petitionerâ€™s explanation was a pretext.Â  Petitioner struck only one out of ten prospective male jurors.Â  As the Court of Appeals observed, the State took a â€œdisjointed and moving-target approach to its Batson motion.â€Â  Rayfield, 357 S.C. at 503, 593 S.E.2d at 489.Â  We agree with Petitioner that it appears the State willfully made a meritless Batson motion for the sole purpose of seeking a second chance to draw a jury which might look more favorably upon the Stateâ€™s case.\r\nNevertheless, we conclude the Court of Appeals correctly held the trial judgeâ€™s error was harmless.Â  In Adams, we held that when the trial judge improperly quashes a jury panel, no jurorâ€™s equal protection rights are violated because no Batson violation has occurred.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 125-26, 470 S.E.2d at 373.Â  We further held that if the jury which actually serves at trial is not tainted by an erroneous Batson ruling in favor of the prosecution, then the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial is not violated because a defendant does not have a right to be tried by any particular jury.Â  Consequently, we held that the judgeâ€™s erroneous Batson ruling was harmless error.Â  Id. at 126, 470 S.E.2d at 373; see also State v. Wright, 304 S.C. 529, 534, 405 S.E.2d 825, 828 (1991) (concluding there was no prejudice to defendant when, despite earlier erroneous rulings by trial judge, he received what Batson was intended to provide).\r\nWe have held that a defendant need not always show actual prejudice for an erroneous Batson ruling to be reversible.Â  Unlike Adams and the present case, however, those cases involved erroneous Batson rulings which actually tainted the jury which served at trial.Â  See State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 63-66, 512 S.E.2d 500, 503-04 (1999) (defendant was not required to show actual prejudice stemming from judgeâ€™s erroneous granting of Stateâ€™s Batson motion because, during selection of second jury, defendant was wrongfully denied the right to exercise a peremptory challenge against one or more jurors he previously had struck for racially neutral reasons); State v. Short, 333 S.C. 473, 476-78, 511 S.E.2d 358, 360-61 (1999) (applying same principle under similar facts); State v. Floyd, 353 S.C. 55, 58-59 &amp; n. 5, 577 S.E.2d 215, 216 &amp; n. 5 (2003) (defendant was not required to show actual prejudice stemming from judgeâ€™s erroneous excusal of juror who refused to take a religious oath).Â  Prejudice is presumed in such cases because there is no way to determine with any degree of certainty whether a defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury was abridged.Â  Short, 333 S.C. at 476-77, 511 S.E.2d at 360.\r\nIn the present case, the second jury was not tainted by the trial judgeâ€™s erroneous Batson ruling.Â  No juror whom Petitioner challenged in the initial drawing was selected to serve on the trial jury.Â  The Court of Appeals properly held this case is controlled by Adams, and Petitioner must show actual prejudice for the trial judgeâ€™s error to be reversible.Â  Petitioner may not have received the jury he wanted, but as we held in Adams, a defendant has no right to a particular jury.Â  For these reasons, we conclude the trial judgeâ€™s erroneous quashing of the original jury and the drawing of a new one constitutes harmless error.\r\nIn reaching our conclusion, we emphasize it is improper for a party to assert a groundless Batson motion as a tactic to gain a second shot at selecting another jury panel which the party believes might look more favorably upon his case.Â  We admonish counsel for the State that abuses such as the meritless motion in this case are looked upon with disfavor and will not be countenanced in the future.Â  The solicitor and defense counsel are officers of a court of law, and are expected and required to have lawful and reasonable bases for motions presented to the trial judge.Â  Moreover, a solicitor\r\n\r\nshould bear in mind that he is an officer of the court, who represents all the people, including [the] accused, and [he] occupies a quasi-judicial position, whose sanctions and traditions he should preserve. Â It is his duty to see that justice is done. Â He must see that no conviction takes place except in strict conformity with the law, and that [the] accused is not deprived of any constitutional rights or privileges. Â However strong the prosecuting attorneyâ€™s belief may be of the prisonerâ€™s guilt, it is his duty to conduct the trial in such a manner as will be fair and impartial to the rights of the accused, . . . and not say or do anything which might improperly affect or influence the jury or [the] accusedâ€™s counsel.\r\n\r\nState v. King, 222 S.C. 108, 119, 71 S.E.2d 793, 798 (1952).Â  â€œThis Court, on numerous occasions, has held that the duty of a solicitor is not to convict a defendant, but to see that justice is done.Â  At the same time, the solicitor should prosecute vigorously.â€Â  State v. Durden, 264 S.C. 86, 92, 212 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1975); accord Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935) (federal prosecutor â€œis the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be doneâ€).\r\nII.Â  JURY INSTRUCTION\r\nPetitioner argues the trial judge erred in charging South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-657 (2003) to the jury because the charge constitutes an impermissible comment on the facts of the case, it improperly emphasizes the testimony of one witness, and it carries a strong possibility of unfairly biasing the jury against the defendant.Â  Petitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in relying on State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) to find the instruction was permissible.Â  We disagree and conclude the Court of Appeals properly relied on Schumpert in holding the trial judge did not err in charging the jury that the victimâ€™s testimony need not be corroborated by other testimony or evidence. \r\nPetitioner was charged with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (2003).Â  A related statute, Â§ 16-3-657, provides â€œ[t]he testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in prosecutions under Â§Â§ 16-3-652 through 16-3-658.â€Â  These statutes prohibit various forms of criminal sexual conduct.Â  In Schumpert, we held it was not error to charge Â§ 16-3-657 as long as the charge as a whole comports with the law.Â  Schumpert, 312 S.C. at 509, 435 S.E.2d at 863.\r\nThe trial judge in the present case instructed the jury in accordance with the statute, stating â€œÂ§ 16-3-657 of our code of laws provides that the testimony of a victim need not be corroborated in prosecutions under this section.â€Â  The trial judge charged the jury the State had the burden of proving Petitioner was guilty of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  The trial judge further instructed the jury:\r\n\r\nIn every case tried in this court before a jury, the jury becomes the sole and exclusive judges of the facts of the case.Â  You, the ladies and gentlemen of this trial jury, are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts in this case.Â  The constitution of the state of South Carolina has declared that a trial judge shall not intimate, state, comment upon, or make any statement to a trial jury about the facts in a case.\r\nSince you are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts in this case, ladies and gentlemen, you are not to infer anything that I have said during the progress of this trial in ruling upon the admissibility of the evidence or from anything that I now say to you during the course of my charge to you that I have an opinion about the facts in this case.Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the law does not permit me to have an opinion about the facts in this case.Â  That is a matter solely for you, the ladies and gentlemen of the trial jury, to determine.\r\nAs jurors, then, it is your duty to determine, as I have stated to you, the effect, the value, the weight, and the truth of the evidence presented during the course of this trial.Â  Necessarily, then, ladies and gentlemen, you must assess the credibility of the witnesses who have testified in this case.Â  Credibility is simply a legalistic word which means believability.Â  It becomes your duty as jurors to analyze and to evaluate the evidence and to determine that evidence which convinces you of its truth.\r\nI charge you in determining the question of the credibility or the believability of the witnesses, you may believe one witness as against several witnesses or several witnesses as against one witness.Â  You may believe a part of the testimony of a witness and reject the remaining part of the testimony of that same witness.Â  You may believe the testimony of a witness in its entirety or you may reject the testimony of a witness in its entirety.\r\nYou may consider whether any witness has exhibited any interest, any bias, or any prejudice in this case.Â  And, ladies and gentlemen, you may consider the demeanor of a witness, that is, the appearance of the witness on this witness stand during the trial of this case, and you may consider the opportunity for knowledge concerning those things about which a witness has testified.\r\nThese considerations you do not exercise arbitrarily, but if, in your good judgment, there is sound reason in the record of this case for so doing, because your objective, ladies and gentlemen, is to find the truth, whether it come from witness or witnesses for the state of South Carolina or from witness or witnesses for the defendant, and in so doing, in exercising your mental processes and in determining what you consider to be true, ladies and gentlemen, our law simply requires that you exercise your good, common sense, your good judgment, your sense of logic and reason, and your experiences in life.\r\n\r\nIt is not always necessary, of course, to charge the contents of a current statute.Â  Section 16-3-657 prevents trial or appellate courts from finding a lack of sufficient evidence to support a conviction simply because the alleged victimâ€™s testimony is not corroborated.Â  However, Â§ 16-3-657 does much more.Â  In enacting this statute, the Legislature recognized that crimes involving criminal sexual conduct fall within a unique category of offenses against the person.Â  In many cases, the only witnesses to a rape or sexual assault are the perpetrator and the victim.Â  An investigation may or may not reveal physical or forensic evidence identifying a particular perpetrator.Â  The Legislature has decided it is reasonable and appropriate in criminal sexual conduct cases to make abundantly clear - not only to the judge but also to the jury - that a defendant may be convicted solely on the basis of a victimâ€™s testimony.\r\nA trial judge is not required to charge Â§ 16-3-657, but when the judge chooses to do so, giving the charge does not constitute reversible error when this single instruction is not unduly emphasized and the charge as a whole comports with the law.Â  The jury in this case was thoroughly instructed on the Stateâ€™s burden of proof and the juryâ€™s duty to find the facts and judge the credibility of witnesses.Â  The trial judge in this case, as shown in the above portions of the charge, fully and properly instructed the jury on these principles.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the Court of Appeals correctly held that the trial judge erred in granting the Stateâ€™s meritless Batson motion and redrawing the jury.Â  While we conclude the error was harmless because the second jury was not tainted by the erroneous Batson ruling, we emphasize it is improper for a party to assert a groundless Batson motion as a tactic to gain a second shot at selecting another jury panel which the party believes might look more favorably upon his case.Â  We further conclude the Court of Appeals properly held the trial judge did not err in charging the jury that the victimâ€™s testimony need not be corroborated by other testimony or evidence. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice Stephen S. Bartlett, concurs.\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority opinionâ€™s holding that the circuit courtâ€™s Batson ruling constituted harmless error under State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  I respectfully dissent from the majority opinionâ€™s holding that the circuit court committed no error in charging the jury.Â  In my opinion, the circuit court committed reversible error, and Petitioner is entitled to a new trial.\r\nPetitioner was charged with three counts of first-degree CSC with a minor, in violation of South Carolina Code section 16-3-655.[2]Â  Another statute, section 16-3-657,[3] provides that â€œ[t]he testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in prosecutions under Â§Â§ 16-3-652 through 16-3-658.â€Â  The circuit court charged the jury the above quoted language of section 16-3-657. Â This was reversible error.Â  \r\nâ€œIn general, the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. ... A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct\r\ndefinition of the law when read as a whole.â€Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472 (2004) (citations omitted). Â Some principles of law, however, are not to be charged to a jury.Â  See, e.g., State v. Grant, 275 S.C. 404, 408, 272 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (holding that although evidence of a defendantâ€™s flight is admissible as circumstantial evidence of guilt, it is improper for the trial judge to instruct the jury on the law of flight, because such an instruction â€œoftentimes has the potential for creating more problems than solutions,â€ as it â€œplaces undue emphasis upon that part of circumstantial evidenceâ€).\r\nContrary to the majority opinion, we did not hold in Schumpert that this no-corroboration charge was proper.Â  Rather, â€œ[t]aking the charge as a whole, we [found] no reversible error.â€Â  312 S.C. at 509, 435 S.E.2d at 863.[4]Â  We observed that the trial judge, in addition to charging the jury under section 16-3-657, had charged â€œthe jury it could believe any single witness over several, it was the sole judge of the facts, [the trial judge] had no opinion about those facts, and the State had the burden of proving the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nI would hold that it is error for a trial court to charge the jury that an alleged victimâ€™s testimony needs no corroboration.Â  Although section 16-3-657 contains current and correct law, it is not a proper subject of a jury charge.Â  Section 16-3-657 prevents courts, either on a dispositive motion at the trial level or on appellate review, from finding a lack of sufficient evidence to support a conviction because the alleged victimâ€™s testimony is uncorroborated.Â  See James Cranston Gray, Jr., Criminal Law-Rape Reform in South Carolina, 30 S.C. L. Rev. 45, 55-60 (1979) (discussing the no-corroboration rule as governing judicial review of the sufficiency of the evidence); cf. Ludy v. State, 784 N.E.2d 459, 463 (Ind. 2003) (holding that the no-corroboration rule is a legal standard for a court reviewing a conviction).Â  Charging this rule does not assist the jury in fulfilling its function of deciding the facts and determing whether the state has proved the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  In fact, it â€œhas the potential for creating more problems than solutions,â€[5] for it might cause confusion when read with the general charge on witness credibility.[6] Â \r\nMore important, charging this rule carries a strong possibility of biasing the jury against the defendant.Â  No witnessâ€™s testimony need be corroborated.Â  By specifically charging that the alleged victimâ€™s testimony need not be corroborated, the trial court singles out the alleged victim and â€œappears to express an opinion on her credibility.â€Â  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 510, 435 S.E.2d 859, 864 (1993) (Finney, J., dissenting); see also S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 17 (providing that â€œ[j]udges shall not charge juries in respect to matters of fact, but shall declare the lawâ€).Â  I would therefore hold that charging a jury on the contents of section 16-3-657 constitutes error.\r\nFurther, I would overrule the holding in Schumpert that the charge as a whole can render this no-corroboration charge harmless.Â  Separately instructing the jury that it may believe one witness against many or many against one does not ameliorate or remove the favorable emphasis on the alleged victimâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\nFurthermore, this case is different from Ludy, supra, in which the Supreme Court of Indiana held that although the trial court had erred in giving the no-corroboration charge, the error was harmless because:Â  â€œ[T]he testimony of the victim was not uncorroborated. ... [A]side from the victimâ€™s testimony there was substantial probative evidence establishing the elements of the charged offenses.â€Â  784 N.E.2d at 463.Â  Here, the only evidence of Petitionerâ€™s committing CSC was the testimony of the alleged victims.Â  The jury had to determine whether it believed the purported victims or Petitioner.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, I would hold that the circuit court committed reversible error in charging the jury.Â  I would therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for a new trial.\r\n Acting Justice Stephen S. Bartlett, concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Batson actually prohibits only race-based strikes.Â  J.E.B. v.

Â A hearing was then held to determine whether he was guilty but mentally ill (GBMI).Â  An expert, Dr. Everett Kuglar, testified appellant was mentally ill.Â  However, two other experts, Dr. Jeffrey Musick and Dr. Pamela Crawford, testified appellant was not\r\nmentally ill.Â  After considering the evidence, the court ruled appellant failed to prove he was GBMI.Â  Appellant was subsequently sentenced to death and the sentence was affirmed in State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004).\r\nAppellantâ€™s counsel filed a petition for a stay of execution to allow him to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.Â  The stay petition was granted.Â  Subsequently, appellant notified this Court that he wished to dismiss his appeals and be executed.Â  We remanded this case to the trial court for a competency hearing.Â  Meanwhile, the United States Supreme Court denied counselâ€™s motion, on appellantâ€™s behalf, for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.Â  See Downs v. South Carolina, 544 U.S. 972 (2005).\r\nIn February 2005, the first evidentiary hearing was held.Â  Counsel requested more time to allow their psychiatric experts an opportunity to review materials and evaluate appellant.Â  The hearing judge ruled the State would be allowed to offer Dr. Pamela Crawford and Dr. Jeffrey Musick at the hearing, and that the defense would be able to cross-examine those doctors at a later date.\r\nA second evidentiary hearing was held in March 2005.Â  At the beginning of this hearing, counsel moved for a continuance so that Dr. Margaret Melikian, who had met with appellant only once, could treat appellant and see him at least twice more.Â  The court, after hearing evidence, denied the motion.\r\nFollowing closing statements, the court ruled appellant was competent to be executed under the Singleton v. State[1] standard and that his decision to waive his right to challenge his conviction and death sentence was knowing and voluntary.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the lower court abuse its discretion by refusing to grant a continuance of the hearing until appellant could be further evaluated?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Is appellant competent to waive any challenges to his conviction and death sentence?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe standard for determining whether an appellant is mentally competent to be executed is set forth in Singleton, supra, and states:\r\n\r\nThe first prong is the cognitive prong which can be defined as:Â  whether a convicted defendant can understand the nature of the proceedings, what he or she was tried for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the punishment.Â  The second prong is the assistance prong which can be defined as:Â  whether the convicted defendant possesses sufficient capacity or ability to rationally communicate with counsel.\r\n\r\nSingleton v. State, 313 S.C. at 83, 437 S.E.2d at 58 (emphasis added).\r\nAt the February hearing, appellant informed the court he did not want to appeal and wanted to have his competency hearing completed as soon as possible.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the hearing, Dr. Pamela Crawford, a court-appointed expert in forensic psychiatry, testified she had evaluated appellant for a GBMI determination on six prior occasions from May 2001 to June 2002.Â  Pursuant to this Courtâ€™s order, she also evaluated appellant for competency, along with Dr. Jeffrey Musick, on February 11, 2005.Â  Dr. Crawford summarized her record review and indicated she learned appellant had attempted suicide while incarcerated.Â  She opined appellant had mild depression that was not sufficient to be diagnosed as major depression.Â  She testified appellant was competent to waive his appeals and be executed under the Singleton standard.Â  Her diagnoses included pedophilia, paraphilia, substance abuse, and antisocial personality disorder.Â  She stated none of these diagnoses impacted on appellantâ€™s ability to understand the proceedings or communicate with his counsel.\r\nSpecifically, on the cognitive prong of Singleton, Dr. Crawford stated appellant clearly articulates an understanding of the appeals process, the consequences of waiving his appeals, that he prefers lethal injection, and that he does not have any delusional thoughts about death.Â  On the assistance prong, she opined appellant communicates clearly and that he was willing to work with an attorney who would further his goal of being executed but did not want to work with an attorney who did not want to help further that goal.Â  Dr. Crawford stated there was no evidence appellant had a deteriorating mental disorder and that his status was the same as when he was evaluated in 2001 and 2002.\r\nDr. Jeffrey Musick, testified he had been involved in the 2002 evaluations of appellant.Â  For purposes of this competency hearing, he stated he met with appellant twice.Â  At the second meeting, he administered several psychological tests.Â  Dr. Musick found appellant had mild depression, but did not have a major disorder.Â  He stated that, during the evaluation, appellant was cooperative, friendly, laughed at the appropriate times, and had rational and coherent speech.Â  He found no evidence of delusions and appellant informed him he thought the legal process had been fair.\r\nDr. Musick opined appellant met the Singleton requirements for competency.Â  Regarding the cognitive prong, Dr. Musick stated appellant understood the proceedings, what he was tried for, and stated his punishment fit the crime.Â  Appellant was able to relate that it was possible that existence stops when you die and said that would be preferable to living in prison.Â  Appellant stated he hoped for better things after death and that he preferred lethal injection because it was peaceful.Â  Regarding the assistance prong, Dr. Musick testified appellant was able to express himself and understand others.Â  Appellant informed Dr. Musick that he was happy to work with an attorney who had his same goals, i.e. that he be executed.Â  Dr. Musick did not see any potential of appellantâ€™s mental state deteriorating in the future.\r\nOn cross-examination, Dr. Musick admitted appellant may have suffered a major depressive episode in the past and that he has been unhappy all his life.Â  Dr. Musick indicated he was aware of appellantâ€™s suicide attempts while incarcerated and of his attempt to commit suicide when he was about ten years old.Â  Dr. Musick stated those facts did not change his opinion that appellant was competent under Singleton.\r\nDr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, a forensic psychiatrist, testified appellant was very cooperative during her evaluation.Â  She stated appellant had mild depression.Â  As for major depression, she stated he met only four of the five criteria and therefore, was not diagnosed with major depression.Â  She stated that diagnosis could change in the future.\r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts opined appellant was competent under both prongs of Singleton.Â  She testified appellant met the cognitive prong because he understood the proceedings, his punishment, and that he was able to communicate that he desired lethal injection.Â  She stated he wants to be free but otherwise he wants to be executed instead of being imprisoned.Â  She testified that he does not suffer from delusions and that he hopes for something better in the afterlife.Â  Regarding the assistance prong, Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified appellant met this prong because he could communicate with counsel and that, because he was sometimes irritated with counsel, he chose not to cooperate.Â  She stated her diagnoses were that appellant has depression, not otherwise specified; post-traumatic stress disorder, paraphilia, pedophila, and substance abuse.Â  She opined that none of these diagnoses affect either prong of Singleton.Â  She testified he has a mild form of depression that does not prevent him from doing the things he needs to do and that he could have depression and still be competent under Singleton.Â  She stated that depressive people can function on a day-to-day basis and that it just depends on the severity of the depression.\r\nJames Whittle, the attorney who represented appellant for his plea, testified appellant did not wish to contest his guilt and wanted to die.Â  He stated appellant forbade him from offering mitigation evidence but that he was able to seek a guilty but mentally ill finding by telling appellant his case could help others.Â  Whittle felt appellant had significant mental health issues and that he was depressed.Â  Whittle testified he felt appellant was competent to stand trial and had the ability to rationally communicate with him.Â  He stated appellant did not appear to be very different since the time when he was representing appellant.\r\nDr. Margaret Melikian, a forensic psychiatrist, testified she met with appellant once for a four-hour evaluation on February 28, 2005.Â  She stated appellant was guarded but cooperative during the meeting.Â  She testified regarding her knowledge of appellantâ€™s numerous suicide attempts.Â  Dr. Melikian testified appellant met the cognitive prong of Singleton.Â  However, regarding a diagnosis of appellant, she stated she did not have enough information to rule out a diagnosis of a major depressive episode.Â  Dr. Melikian testified appellant met some of the criteria for being diagnosed with major depression.\r\nDr. Melikian testified appellantâ€™s wish to waive his appeals process may be a rational decision or a product of his depression.Â  She opined he should be offered treatment for depression and then have his competency reevaluated.Â  For that reason, she stated she could not offer an opinion on his competency.Â  She wanted to see if treatment would cause him to change his mind.Â  She stated appellant told her he would take anti-depressants if the court ordered him to do so.\r\nDr. Melikian stated appellant does not suffer from any delusions or psychosis.Â  She stated appellant can communicate but she was unsure if he could â€œrationallyâ€ communicate as stated in the assistance prong of the Singleton standard.Â  She agreed that one could meet the criteria of major depression but still be competent under Singleton.Â  However, she had no opinion on appellantâ€™s competency at the time of the hearing.Â  She recommended medication so that a more accurate evaluation could be completed.Â  Significantly, she stated she was unsure if appellant chose not to take drugs voluntarily whether she could form an opinion on the Singleton assistance prong.Â  She stated she would like to see him additional times but she did not know if she would be able to form an opinion.\r\nDuring closing arguments, counsel for appellant reasserted his request for a continuance so that Dr. Melikian could provide appellant with medication, or at the very least if appellant refused the medication, so that she could meet with appellant at least twice more.Â  The motion for continuance was denied.\r\nAppellant personally addressed the hearing judge.Â  He did not feel Dr. Kuglar (from his previous GBMI evaluation) and Dr. Melikian could state that he was incompetent or depressed given they did not conduct a full mental evaluation. Â Appellant concluded by asking the judge, if he decides competency is proven, to impose an injunction on appellantâ€™s counsel so that he would not file any more motions or other documents in his case because appellant wished to fire him.\r\nIn his order, on the cognitive prong of Strickland, the judge found it is evident from the communication appellant had during his recent evaluations that there is a plethora of evidence to support a finding of competency on each factor within that prong.Â  On the assistance prong, the judge found appellant possesses sufficient mental capacity or ability to rationally communicate with counsel.Â  The judge found that, in discussions with himself and each of the evaluators, it was without question that appellant had the mental capacity and ability to express ideas, analyze options, understand the facts and law, and intelligently convey his thoughts and ideas to others.Â  The judge noted the record is void of any evidence that appellant cannot understand any communication with counsel or others due to any mental impairment or that he cannot make himself understood.Â  The judge stated the record indicates appellantâ€™s responses to inquiries have always been rational.Â  \r\nThe judge stated he did not share Dr. Melikianâ€™s hesitation on the assistance prong.Â  He stated that, although her desire to treat appellant with medication and see what develops may be well-intentioned, the delay was unnecessary for the court to render its opinion because appellant clearly satisfies the assistance prong.Â  The judge stated, â€œIt is difficult to recall a defendant more attentive and more observant than [appellant.]â€Â  The judge specifically found appellant did not have a present wish to commit suicide or die, but that he has maintained he prefers death to being locked up for the rest of his life.Â  In conclusion, the judge found appellant competent to waive post-conviction proceedings under the Singleton standard.\r\nIn appellantâ€™s pro se response, he states he has repeatedly asked counsel not to file any appeals on his behalf.Â  Regarding Dr. Melikianâ€™s belief that appellant should be placed on anti-depressants, appellant states he has been placed on anti-depressants since the time of the hearing.Â  For various reasons, he had to cease taking the medications.Â  While on medication, appellant states he did not at any point think of changing his mind about dropping his appeals.Â  He states he knows he will be in prison for the rest of his life and that he has been sentenced to be executed.Â  He foresees nothing productive coming from being on death row.Â  He concludes, â€œI want to go ahead with my execution A.S.A.P.â€\r\nI. Motion for Continuance\r\nCounsel for appellant argues the hearing judge erred by denying the motion for a continuance and that this case should be remanded with an order allowing Dr. Melikian additional time to possibly medicate appellant and further evaluate him so that she can have a final opinion under the second prong of the Singleton standard.\r\nThe hearing judge did not err by refusing counselâ€™s motion for a continuance.Â  The judge appropriately determined that more time was not needed to determine appellantâ€™s competency.Â  Three experts testified appellant was mildly depressed but that this condition did not affect his capacity on either prong of Singleton.Â  Dr. Melikian testified appellant met the cognitive prong, but stated she could not come to a conclusion on the assistance prong.Â  She also was uncertain whether appellant suffered from major depression, rather than mild depression.Â  However, Dr. Melikian admitted that one could meet the criteria of Singleton even if that person suffered from major depression.Â  Most importantly, Dr. Melikian testified that, even if she was allowed to treat appellant with medication and/or see him more times, she was unsure whether she could ever form an opinion on the Singleton assistance prong.Â  The hearing judge gave the proper weight to Dr. Melikianâ€™s testimony when deciding whether a motion for a continuance should be granted.Â  Accordingly, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.Â  Cf. State v. McMillian, 349 S.C. 17, 561 S.E.2d 602 (2002) (trial judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for continuance will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion).\r\nII. Competency\r\nA capital defendant may not waive his appellate or PCR rights unless this Court first determines the defendant is competent.Â  See Hughes v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 626 S.E.2d 805 (2006) (Court will issue execution notice if person, who is determined by Court to be mentally competent, knowingly and voluntarily waives appeals and post-conviction relief); State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (1994) (waiver may not be found unless Court first determines defendant is competent and his decision is knowing and voluntary).\r\nIn making a determination on the competency of a convicted defendant to waive his appellate or PCR rights, we are not bound by the circuit courtâ€™s findings or rulings,\r\nalthough we recognize the circuit court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  See Hughes v. State, supra.Â  It is this Court which must finally determine whether a particular appellant is mentally competent to make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his appellate or PCR rights.Â \r\nId.Â  In deciding the issue of an appellantâ€™s competency, we carefully and thoroughly review the appellantâ€™s history of mental competency; the existence and present status of mental illness or disease suffered by the appellant, if any, as shown in the record of previous proceedings and in the competency hearing; the testimony and opinions of mental health experts who have examined the appellant; the findings of the circuit court which conducted a competency hearing; the arguments of counsel; and the appellantâ€™s demeanor and personal responses to any questions at oral argument regarding the waiver\r\nof appellate and PCR rights.Â  Id.\r\nAs noted previously, the standard for determining whether an appellant or PCR applicant is\r\nmentally competent to waive the right to a direct appeal or PCR includes a cognitive prong and an assistance prong under Singleton.Â  The failure of either prong is sufficient to warrant a stay of execution and a denial of the convicted defendantâ€™s motion to waive his right to appeal or pursue PCR.Â  Hughes v. State, supra.\r\nWe find appellant is competent and comprehends his circumstances, such that the waiver of his appeals and PCR is knowing and voluntary.Â  Although appellant has been diagnosed as having mild depression, this diagnosis does not affect appellantâ€™s capacity on either the cognitive or assistance prong of Singleton.\r\nAt the hearing, the two State experts:Â  Drs. Crawford and Musick, and one of the defense experts, Dr. Schwartz-Watts, all testified that appellant suffered from mild depression and not major depression.Â  The doctors all testified appellant was competent to waive his appeals under Singleton.Â  On the cognitive prong of Strickland, the doctors, including Dr. Melikian, testified appellant met this prong.Â  They all testified appellant had an understanding of the appeals process, the consequences of waiving his appeals, and an understanding of his death sentence and the finality of that sentence.\r\nDrs. Crawford, Musick, and Schwartz-Watts also testified appellant met the assistance prong of Singleton.Â  Dr. Crawford testified appellant can communicate clearly and was able to discuss his desires and that he was willing to work with an attorney who would further his goal of being executed but that he did not wish to work with an attorney who would hinder that goal.Â  Dr. Musick and Dr. Schwartz-Watts gave similar testimony.\r\nAppellantâ€™s former counsel, James Whittle, testified that, while he felt appellant had significant mental health issues and was depressed, appellant was competent to stand trial and had the ability to rationally communicate with him.Â  Whittle stated appellantâ€™s condition did not seem to have changed since the time he represented appellant.Â  Therefore, at this point in the hearing, the only evidence presented was that appellant was competent.\r\nThe defense expert, Dr. Melikian, however, felt she needed more time to make a proper diagnosis of appellantâ€™s depression and whether he was competent to waive his appeals.Â  Dr. Melikianâ€™s testimony, however, does not prevent a finding of competency in light of the other expert testimony.Â  The other experts clearly found appellant competent and that he had met each prong of Singleton.Â  Further, the fact Dr. Melikian was unsure she could ever reach an opinion on the assistance prong is significant.Â  Finally, on the point of Dr. Melikianâ€™s wish that appellant be medicated, appellant, himself, wrote to this Court and stated he had been placed on anti-depressants after the hearing.Â  While on medication, appellant stated he did not think of changing his mind about dropping his appeals.Â  He stated, as he has consistently stated throughout the proceedings, that he wishes to proceed with his execution as soon as possible.\r\nAccordingly, we find appellant is competent to waive his appeals and be executed.Â  Further, his decision to waive is knowing and voluntary.Â  Therefore, the hearing judgeâ€™s findings are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26157","title":"Palmetto Princess v.

Clenten Campbell, both of Bogoslow, Jones, Stephens &amp; Duffie, of Walterboro, for appellant.\r\nHeath Preston Taylor, of Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas, P.A., of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  This is an appeal from a circuit court order granting respondentâ€™s (Palmetto Princessâ€™s) motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 23, 2003, Palmetto Princess applied for a business license from appellant, the Town of Edisto Beach (Edisto).Â  Palmetto Princess intended to operate one or more gaming vessels on cruises originating within the waters and municipal boundaries of Edisto.Â  The plan was for the vessels to travel beyond the three mile territorial waters of the State of South Carolina, at which point games such as black jack, roulette, and craps would be hosted for Palmetto Princessâ€™s customers.Â  These gambling cruises are known as â€œcruises to nowhere.â€Â  The cruises would conclude, and debarkations take place, within Edistoâ€™s municipal boundaries.\r\nEdisto denied Palmetto Princessâ€™s application.Â  Edisto based its denial on the Town of Edisto Beach Code Â§ 58-138.Â  Section 58-138 specifically prohibits the possession of a gambling device on a vessel within the waters of the municipal boundaries of Edisto operated for the purposes of conducting a day cruise.\r\nPalmetto Princess commenced a declaratory judgment action seeking to set aside Town of Edisto Beach Ordinance Â§ 58-138 based partly on the grounds that:Â  (1) Edisto did not have the power to enact the ordinance because the Johnson Act, 15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1171, et seq., restricts the prohibition of gaming activity to states or possessions of the United States; that is, that the Johnson Act preempts the local legislation embodied in the ordinance; and (2) Â§ 58-138 violates article VIII, Â§ 14, of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.\r\nThe circuit court held Edistoâ€™s ordinance is not preempted by the Johnson Act.[1]Â  However, the court granted Palmetto Princessâ€™s motion for summary judgment based on the alternative ground that Edistoâ€™s ordinance violates the South Carolina Constitution.Â  The court found that because Â§ 58-138 prohibits an activity otherwise legal within the state, Â§ 58-138 violates the state constitution.Â  Citing Diamonds v. Greenville County, 325 S.C. 154, 480 S.E.2d 718 (1997), the court stated that the draftersâ€™ intent for article VIII, Â§ 14, was to prevent local governmentâ€™s making an act a crime that was not a crime under state law.Â  Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment to Palmetto Princess on its declaratory judgment action.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err by finding Town of Edisto Beach Ordinance Â§ 58-138 violates article VIII, Â§14, of the South Carolina Constitution?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nEdisto argues the circuit court erred by finding its ordinance, Â§ 58-138, violates article VIII, Â§14, of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (2004) provides:Â  â€œEach municipality of the State . . . may enact . . . ordinances, not inconsistent with the Constitution and general law of this State, . . . for preserving health, peace, order, and good government in it . . . .â€Â  (Emphasis added).\r\nSouth Carolina Const. art. VIII, Â§ 14 provides:Â  â€œIn enacting provisions required or authorized by this article, general law provisions applicable to the following matters shall not be set aside:Â  . . . (5) criminal laws and the penalties and sanctions for the transgression thereof . . . .â€\r\nAs stated previously, Ordinance Â§ 58-138 specifically prohibits the possession of a gambling device on a vessel within the waters of the municipal boundaries of Edisto operated for the purposes of conducting a day cruise.Â  This ordinance was enacted in 1999.Â  However, subsequently, we held that â€œcruises to nowhereâ€ are not unlawful.Â  Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001).Â  Therefore, at the time Edistoâ€™s ordinance was enacted and Palmetto Princess had requested a business license to operate a gambling day cruise, a gambling day cruise was a legal activity allowed by the State. [2] \r\nBecause a gambling day cruise was a legal activity allowed by the State, Edistoâ€™s ordinance is unconstitutional because it makes a legal activity unlawful. Â See Connor v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 314 S.C. 251, 442 S.E.2d 608 (1994) (where ordinance proscribed conduct which was not unlawful at the time the ordinance was enacted under state criminal laws governing the same subject, town exceeded its power in enacting ordinance); and Diamonds v. Greenville County, supra (same).Â  Where the General Assembly has occupied the field in a particular area, i.e. gambling, by describing what is and what is not proscribed, local governments are not free to alter the standards established by the General Assembly. Â Cf. Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 530 S.E.2d 369 (2000) (ordinance upheld where there was no relevant state law governing conduct in question).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Edisto exceeded its power in enacting the ordinance in question, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to Palmetto Princess.Â  See Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003) (summary judgment appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law).Â  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, J. and Acting Justice Ralph King Anderson, Jr., concur.Â  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nBURNETT, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, Edisto did not exceed its power in enacting Ordinance Â§ 58-138 because the Ordinance did not set aside any statewide criminal laws.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Constitution Article VIII, Â§ 14, provides:Â  â€œIn enacting provisions required or authorized by this article, general law provisions applicable to the following matters shall not be set aside: . . . (5) criminal laws and the penalties and sanctions for the transgression thereof . . . .â€ \r\nWhen construing the Constitution, the Court applies rules similar to those relating to the construction of statutes.Â  Davis v. County of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 463, 443 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1994).Â  In construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  First Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229, 417 S.E.2d 592, 593 (1992).\r\nAs I explained in Diamonds v. Greenville County, 325 S.C. 154, 161, 480 S.E.2d 718, 721 (1997) (Burnett, J., dissenting): \r\n\r\n\r\n Article VIII, Â§ 14 does not require statewide uniformity of\r\ngeneral law provisions regarding â€œcriminal laws and the penalties and sanctions for the transgression thereof.â€\r\nInstead, the preamble to Article VIII, Â§ 14, provides â€œgeneral law provisions applicable to the following matters\r\nshall not be set aside.â€ (emphasis added). The plain meaning of this provision requires local enactments â€œset\r\nasideâ€ some existing provision of the general law before a constitutional violation occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Article VIII, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina Constitution does not prohibit local governments from criminalizing conduct which is not unlawful under state law.Â  Until the Gambling Cruise Prohibition Act was enacted, there was no legislative action that made a gambling day cruise a legal activity.Â  Further in Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 387-91, 556 S.E.2d 357, 362-64 (2001) (Burnett, J., dissenting), I would have held â€œboats located within South Carolina and its territorial waters are subject to the same laws concerning gambling as any other premises in this state.â€Â  I therefore disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that gambling day cruises are lawful.Â  Ordinance Â§ 58-138 could not and did not set aside any statewide criminal laws.\r\nThe majority also relies on Connor v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 314 S.C. 251, 442 S.E.2d 608 (1994) for the proposition that conduct which is not unlawful under state laws cannot be made unlawful by local enactment.Â  In my opinion the Connor Court erred because the Court effectively held all conduct is lawful unless made unlawful by enactment of the General Assembly.Â  Article VIII, Â§ 14 does not yield to such an interpretation.Â  I would overrule Connor to the extent it holds that local governments may not criminalize conduct which is not unlawful under statewide criminal law.\r\n    \r\nEdistoâ€™s Ordinance Â§ 58-138 does not set aside any criminal laws enacted by the state because the ordinance is not inconsistent with any state law.Â  Therefore, I would hold Edisto did not exceed its power in enacting Ordinance Â§ 58-138.Â  I conclude the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment to Palmetto Princess.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]The circuit courtâ€™s ruling regarding preemption is not before the Court.Â  However, for edification, the Johnson Act generally prohibits the use or possession of any gambling device on a United States flag vessel.Â  One exception is that the possession or transport of a gambling device within state territorial waters is not a violation of the prohibition if the device remains on board the vessel and is used only outside those territorial waters.Â  15 U.S.C. Â§ 1175(b)(1). \r\n[2]Subsequent to the circuit courtâ€™s order issued in this case, the General Assemblyâ€™s Gambling Cruise Prohibition Act was signed into law by the governor with an effective date of June 1, 2005.Â  Section 3-11-200(A) of this Act specifically allows the type of ordinance enacted by Edisto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26158","title":"In the Matter of William B.

Ariail, Deputy Solicitor Betty C. Strom, and Assistant Solicitor Andrew Burke Moorman, all of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Hearst-Argyle Television and The Greenville News (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the trial courtâ€™s decision closing the courtroom during a pre-trial suppression hearing in a capital murder case.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis case arises out of Charles Christopher Williamsâ€™ (Defendantâ€™s) trial for the murder of his former girlfriend (Victim).Â  In July of 2003, Defendant assaulted Victim as she left her job at a Greenville grocery store.Â  Police arrested Defendant and charged him with assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  While out of jail and awaiting trial on the ABIK, Defendant entered Victimâ€™s workplace with a shotgun and held her hostage for several hours.Â  The incident ended when police stormed the grocery store and found Victim dead.Â  Police arrested Defendant at the crime scene, and an autopsy revealed that Victim had been shot four times with a shotgun.\r\nPrior to trial, issues arose regarding statements Defendant made to police.Â  Specifically, Defendant gave police a lengthy confession immediately after his arrest and a forensic psychiatrist interviewed Defendant for several hours immediately thereafter.Â  Defendantâ€™s testimony to the psychiatrist yielded incriminating information and also led police to discover a journal Defendant kept which contained additional incriminating evidence.Â  One week prior to selecting the jury for Defendantâ€™s trial, Defendant moved to suppress the journal and the statements he made to the psychiatrist.\r\nImmediately, this case received a great deal of media attention.Â  Several television stations broadcast live from the grocery store during the hostage standoff, and Appellant Greenville News published at least thirty-eight news and opinion articles either exclusively devoted to this case or addressing the case in the broader context of â€œthe domestic violence problem in South Carolina.â€\r\nThe trial court held most of the pre-trial proceedings in Anderson in hopes that the media would not attend.Â  Prior to the hearing on Defendantâ€™s motion to suppress, this strategy was successful.Â  In fact, until the suppression hearing, the media did not attend any of the pre-trial proceedings.Â  Appellants sent reporters to the suppression hearing however, and after these reporters identified themselves to the trial court, the court announced its intention to close the courtroom.[1]Â  \r\nAppellants requested a hearing to allow their attorneys to present arguments opposing closing the courtroom.Â  While Appellants phoned their attorneys, the court asked the parties if limiting the hearing to legal arguments regarding suppression might allow Appellants to remain present.Â  Defendant voiced strong opposition to the presence of the media, expressing concern about not being able to prevent witnesses from discussing substantive facts in their answers.\r\nAfter Appellantsâ€™ attorneys arrived, the court conducted a hearing on closing the courtroom.Â  Relying on precedent of this Court and the United States Supreme Court, the trial court held that a courtroom may be closed only upon specific findings showing â€œa substantial probability of prejudice from publicity that closure would prevent and [that] thereâ€™s no reasonable alternatives.â€Â  Relying on the fact that this case involved the â€œhot buttonâ€ issue of domestic violence, an issue which had played prominently in the mediaâ€™s coverage of the case, and because this case also involved sensitive racial issues, the court closed the suppression hearing.Â  \r\nThough not relevant to the merits of this appeal, the trial court denied Defendantâ€™s motion to suppress. The trial proceeded, and a jury convicted Defendant and sentenced him to death.Â  This appeal followed,[2] and Appellants raise the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court close the courtroom without sufficient justification?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court violate Appellantsâ€™ procedural due process rights in closing the courtroom?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nAlthough both the suppression hearing and the criminal trial in this case have concluded, we review the case despite its mootness because, as courts have generally held in these cases, closing the courtroom is a wrong â€œcapable of repetition yet evading review.â€Â  See In re S.C. Press Assâ€™n, 946 F.2d 1037, 1039 (4th Cir. 1991); and Ex parte Columbia Newspapers, Inc., 286 S.C. 116, 118, 333 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1985) (citing Gannett v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368 (1983) and Steinle v. Lollis, 279 S.C. 375, 307 S.E.2d 230 (1983)). \r\nI. Justification for Closure\r\nAppellants argue the trial court closed the suppression hearing without sufficient justification.Â  We agree.\r\nThe rights of the public and the press to attend criminal trials are guaranteed by the South Carolina Constitution and the United States Constitution.Â  Because the majority of â€œclosed courtroomâ€ cases focus largely on the federal constitutional analysis and jurisprudence, we begin there.\r\nUnited Stated Supreme Court has interpreted the guarantees of free speech and freedom of the press found in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to include a constitutional guarantee of open and public courts.Â  Richmond Newpapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580 (1980).Â  Because the court views the rights of the public and press as constitutionally guaranteed, the First Amendment analysis applies a strong presumption favoring open criminal proceedings.Â  In re Charlotte Observer, 882 F.2d 850, 852 (4th Cir. 1989); In re Knight Publishing Co., 743 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir. 1984). Â This presumption may only be overcome by an overriding interest based on specific findings that closure is necessary to preserve â€œhigher values,â€ and the closure must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest.Â  In re Charlotte Observer, 882 F.2d at 852-53 (citing Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California, 478 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1986) (Press Enterprise II)); In re Knight Publishing Co., 743 F.2d at 234 (citing Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (Press Enterprise I)).\r\nWhen the alleged â€œhigher valueâ€ justifying closure is protecting the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury, the courtroom may be closed only if specific findings are made that (1) there is a substantial probability that the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity, (2) there is a substantial probability that closure would prevent that prejudice, and (3) reasonable alternatives to closure could not adequately protect the defendantâ€™s rights.Â  In re S.C. Press Assâ€™n, 946 F.2d at 1041; In re Charlotte Observer, 882 F.2d at 853.Â  Additionally, the trial court must list specific findings justifying closure so an appellate court may review the decision and determine its correctness.Â  In re Knight Publishing Co., 743 F.2d at 234. Â Courts have generally interpreted this requirement as establishing a de novo standard of review.Â  In re Charlotte Observer, 882 F.2d at 853 (citing In re Washington Post, 807 F.2d 383, 381 (4th Cir. 1986)).\r\nAlthough South Carolina, like the federal courts, has a rich jurisprudential history in the area of courtroom closure, the origins of the state and federal guarantees of open courtrooms are quite different.Â  Â Our Constitution parallels the United States Constitution in numerous ways.Â  For example, article I, Â§ 2 of the South Carolina Constitution is strikingly similar to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Also, article I, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina Constitution provides the equivalent of the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s guarantee of a speedy and public trial to a criminal defendant.Â  Arguably, the difficulty the federal courts experienced in the early stages of closed courtroom jurisprudence involved finding a constitutional basis for the guarantee of open courtrooms.[3]Â  As we have explained, the federal courts eventually interpreted the First Amendment in such a manner as to provide this guarantee, and the federal law in this area has largely become well-settled.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, however, our Constitution contains a particular provision that has no parallel at the federal level.Â  Specifically, our Constitution provides â€œ[a]ll courts shall be public, and every person shall have speedy remedy therein for wrongs sustained.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 9.[4]Â  While federal case law was still in considerable flux, our jurisprudence recognized article I, Â§ 9â€™s independent constitutional guarantee of open courts and held â€œ[e]xclusion of the press and public from judicial proceedings is a drastic measure calling for a careful weighing of interests affected.â€Â  Steinle v. Lollis, 279 S.C. 375, 376-77, 307 S.E.2d 230, 231 (1983).Â  As both federal and state law evolved, we clarified that a judgeâ€™s decision to close any proceeding must be supported by specific findings explaining the balancing of the interests at stake and the need for closure.Â  Ex parte Island Packet, 308 S.C. 198, 201, 417 S.E.2d 575, 577 (1992) (explicitly adopting Press Enterprise IIâ€™s test); Ex parte Columbia Newspapers, 286 S.C. at 118-19, 333 S.E.2d at 338 (relying on Steinle and article I, Â§ 9 of the South Carolina Constitution, as well as Gannett).\r\nAlthough the state and federal constitutional origins of these rights are substantially different, we now hold that the test for reviewing the propriety of closing a courtroom under the South Carolina Constitution is identical to the First Amendment analysis of the issue.Â  This holding is grounded in the fact that this Courtâ€™s earliest precedent closely mirrors the current First Amendment analysis of this issue, and in the fact that this Court has continually relied on both state and federal precedent in analyzing these cases.[5]\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court relied on concerns about racial issues and the â€œhot buttonâ€ issue of domestic violence in closing the pre-trial suppression hearing.Â  Though these concerns were no doubt genuine, closing the courtroom could not possibly have alleviated either of them.Â  As the record demonstrates, closing the courtroom had no effect on Appellantsâ€™ abilities to publish or disseminate news about Defendantâ€™s case.Â  Though the trial court had the ability to prevent the press from attending the suppression hearing, the court did not have the ability to prevent the press from speaking on the subject matter.Â  Indeed, preventing the press from attending the suppression hearing had no impact on the pressâ€™ ability to further publicize Defendantâ€™s race, crime, or any issue related to his case.Â  Thus, assuming there was a substantial probability that pre-trial publicity would prejudice Defendant, closing the courtroom could not have prevented that prejudice.\r\nAdditionally, it is helpful to discuss another of the trial courtâ€™s concerns involving the mediaâ€™s presence at the suppression hearing, though it was not specifically articulated in the courtâ€™s justifications for its decision.Â  In this case, the trial court was concerned that details of Defendantâ€™s confession to the psychiatrist might be revealed in the hearing and subsequently published by the media.Â  Similar, however, to the justifications offered above, this concern would also fail to support closure.Â  We believe the trial courtâ€™s original suggestion to limit the hearing to legal arguments addressing suppression would be sufficient to alleviate this fear.Â  Additionally, we take this opportunity to reiterate that jury voir dire is the preferred and generally accepted tool that protects a defendant from the prejudicial effects of pre-trial publicity.Â  In re Charlotte Observer, 882 F.2d at 855.\r\nBecause closing the courtroom had no effect on preventing additional publicity regarding Defendantâ€™s case, the case as it related to the issue of domestic violence in South Carolina, or any racial issues involved in the trial, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision closing the pre-trial suppression hearing. [6] \r\n\r\n\r\nII. Procedural Due Process\r\nAppellants allege the trial court closed the courtroom in violation of their procedural due process rights.Â  Specifically, Appellants allege the trial court closed the hearing sua sponte and without giving Appellants adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, we note that the trial court, in this case, did not close the courtroom on its own motion.Â  Although the court stated its intention to close the hearing on its own motion if Defendant did not make a motion first, the record clearly indicates that Defendant made an oral motion to close the courtroom.Â  Therefore, the argument that the court closed the courtroom sua sponte is without support in the record.\r\nIf, however, the trial court had closed the courtroom sua sponte, the distinction would not be significant.Â  In In re S.C. Press Assâ€™n, the fourth circuit upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision closing voir dire after the trial court sua sponte issued a notice that it would hold a closure hearing.Â  946 F.2d at 1039.Â  Because the court raised the issue on its own motion, no formal notice was docketed prior to the hearing.Â  Id.Â  The fourth circuit upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision, and in doing so, the court held that this process gave the press and public adequate notice and opportunity to voice opposition to the courtâ€™s decision.Â  Id.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ argument, â€œthat a court cannot, in some circumstances, raise matters on its own motion,â€ overstates the case and ignores the critical balance at work in closed courtroom cases.Â  Although the public and the press have constitutionally guaranteed rights in the courtroom, those rights are not absolute and will sometimes compete with and obstruct a criminal defendantâ€™s constitutionally secured right to receive a fair trial.Â  In criminal cases, the trial court has a duty to protect a defendantâ€™s constitutional right to a fair trial.Â  Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 362-63 (1966).Â  We decline to take such a view of these cases as to, with one hand, charge the trial court with the duty of protecting both the defendantâ€™s and the publicâ€™s constitutional rights, and with the other hand, hamstring the court by requiring it to refrain from considering these issues until asked to do so.Â  If closing the courtroom is the only available option to prevent the substantial probability that publicity would prejudice the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial, the trial court may raise the issue on its own motion, conduct the required hearing, and issue a ruling.\r\nRegarding notice and an opportunity to be heard, in this case, the trial court identified Appellantsâ€™ presence in the courtroom, announced his intention to close the courtroom, and asked Appellants if they had any comment.Â  Appellants requested a hearing during which they could argue against closing the courtroom, and the trial court held a hearing on closure where both Appellants were represented by legal counsel.\r\nIn closed courtroom cases, individual notice is not required.Â  In re Knight Publishing Co., 743 F.2d at 235.Â  Generally, notifying the persons present in the courtroom â€œreasonably in advance of deciding the issueâ€ is appropriate.Â  Id.[7]Â  Here, the trial court alerted Appellantsâ€™ representatives of its intentions, and the court allowed Appellantsâ€™ attorneys a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue.Â  Appellants provided the trial court with the relevant authority on the issue, and each presented skillful arguments.Â  In our view, it would indeed take a skewed view of the record to conclude that the trial courtâ€™s decision making process in this case violated Appellantsâ€™ procedural due process rights.\r\nConclusion\r\nAlthough we are satisfied that the trial court in this case paid careful consideration to Appellantsâ€™ due process rights and applied the proper legal standard, we hold that the reasons offered in support of closing the courtroom were insufficient to justify infringing upon the state and federal constitutional guarantees of open courts. Â Â We believe the trial courtâ€™s justifications are accurately re-characterized as concerns regarding additional pre-trial publicity and its possible effect on being able to draw an impartial jury.Â  Because closing the suppression hearing had no effect on preventing additional publicity of the trial, we reverse.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The court initially stated that if Defendant did not move to close the proceeding, the court would do so sua sponte.Â  Later, Defendant made an oral motion to close the proceeding.\r\n[2] Although this appeal does not involve the merits of Defendantâ€™s conviction or sentence, the appeal came directly to this Court because Defendantâ€™s trial resulted in a death sentence.Â  See Rule 203(d)(1)(A), SCACR (stating that an appeal in a death penalty case is heard in this Court).Â  Defendantâ€™s direct appeal to this Court is currently pending.\r\n[3] Compare Gannett v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 391-92 (1978) (holding that the members of the public have no constitutional rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to attend criminal trials, and assuming arguendo that the First Amendment guarantees the public a right to attend pre-trial criminal proceedings, the trial court heard arguments in objection to the closure and adequately â€œbalanced the â€˜constitutional rights of the press and publicâ€™ against the â€˜defendantsâ€™ right to a fair trial.â€™â€), with Richmond Newpapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580 (1980) (stating â€œthat the right to attend criminal trials is implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment; without the freedom to attend such trials . . . important aspects of freedom of speech and â€˜of the press could be eviscerated.â€™â€).Â  \r\n[4] In State v. Lagerquist, 254 S.C. 501, 506, 176 S.E.2d 141, 143 (1970), we declined to interpret the latter portion of this provision as guaranteeing a right to a speedy appeal in a criminal case.Â  Additionally, we clarified that the latter portion applies only to civil proceedings.Â  Id.Â  (stating that construing the provision to apply to criminal trials would render article I, Â§ 14â€™s guarantees superfluous).Â  These interpretations are not relevant to this case, however, because they have no bearing on the unqualified language at the beginning of the section.\r\n[5] Arguably, our analysis begins by determining whether the particular type of proceeding has historically been open and whether public scrutiny plays a significant role in the functioning of the proceeding.Â  Ex parte Island Packet, 308 S.C. at 201, 417 S.E.2d at 577 (citing Press Enterprise II). This inquiry is unnecessary in this case because this Court has recognized the publicâ€™s right of access to pre-trial suppression hearings.Â  See In re Greenville News, 332 S.C. 394, 396, 505 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1998) (citing Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 47 (1984)).Â  Again, this proposition is strengthened by the South Carolina Constitutionâ€™s unqualified language guaranteeing open courtrooms.Â  \r\n[6] Although we reverse the trial courtâ€™s ultimate decision, we are satisfied that the trial court applied the proper legal standard in considering this issue.Â  Though the court initially referred to the case of Gannett v. DePasquale and to Rule 605(f)(iii), SCACR (governing media coverage of court proceedings), as the relevant authority in this area, the courtâ€™s articulation of the test, that there be â€œa substantial probability of prejudice from publicity that closure would prevent and [that] thereâ€™s no reasonable alternatives,â€ is a proper restatement of the constitutional analysis mandated by the Island Packet and Press Enterprise II decisions.\r\n[7] Appellants rely on In re Knight Publishing Co., and argue that the trial court had already made his decision before he held the hearing.Â  The record does not support this argument; particularly in light of the trial courtâ€™s statements before and during the hearing.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26160","title":"Butler Contracting v.

Allen, of Greenville, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This appeal raises issues relating to whether a mechanicâ€™s lien was timely perfected and the denial of prejudgment interest to the prevailing party.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nButler Contracting, Inc. (Subcontractor) signed a contract with Morris Construction Co. (Contractor) to provide labor and materials for interior walls and ceilings in a commercial renovation project.Â  Court Street, LLC (Owner) hired the companies to transform and expand a former church site in Greenville into condominiums.Â  The original contract amount between Subcontractor and Contractor was $493,156.[1]Â  Including additional work and change orders, Subcontractor asserted it was owed a total of $713,364, of which Contractor paid $536,363, leaving a balance due of $177,001.Â  \r\nHenry Holseberg, a principal owner of both Owner and Contractor who apparently controlled both companies, did not dispute the original contract amount, the various amounts for additional work and changes asserted by Subcontractor, or the amount still owed to Subcontractor.Â Â  Owner, however, filed a counterclaim seeking an offset for $94,878 in damages allegedly caused by delays attributable to Subcontractor and work which Subcontractor failed to timely or properly perform.[2]\r\nDuring construction, Owner or Contractor apparently began having financial difficulties and fell behind in payments to various companies working on the project.Â  Contractor did not prepare contemporaneous records of tasks Subcontractor allegedly failed to perform or provide detailed back-charges to Subcontractor as the project progressed.Â  Instead, Contractor declined to pay Subcontractorâ€™s invoices in full.Â  After Subcontractor filed a notice of mechanicâ€™s lien and a lawsuit seeking to enforce the lien, Contractor reviewed past records such as time and material sheets in an attempt to document the proper amount of back-charges allegedly owed by Subcontractor.Â  Contractorâ€™s staff made these calculations during or after Holsebergâ€™s deposition; some two years after the project was completed.Â  \r\nHolseberg testified the work Subcontractor failed to do included work in the church basement, repairing areas damaged by other subcontractors, completing changes requested by owners who had purchased units, and completing â€œpunch listsâ€ of minor problems in finished units.Â  Contractor eventually hired a drywall finisher fired by Subcontractor to help complete the necessary work.Â  There apparently was some degree of miscommunication and disagreement between the parties regarding changes and repairs, with Subcontractor insisting it properly performed the work and objecting to potential back-charges due to confusion about which company had performed repairs.Â  \r\nSubcontractor provided labor and materials at the project on a regular basis from mid-1999 until December 2000, although it apparently was not constantly at the jobsite due to delays caused by asbestos removal and the work of other subcontractors.Â  Danny Hodge testified Subcontractor was supposed to perform additional work in the church basement after December 2000, and was ready, willing, and able to do so, but Contractor never asked Subcontractor to complete the work.\r\nIn early 2001, Subcontractor, at the request of Contractorâ€™s supervisor, delivered one box of ceiling tiles to replace tiles at the project which had been damaged by water leaks.Â  Hodge testified the ceiling tiles were surplus materials from the project stored at Subcontractorâ€™s warehouse.Â  Subcontractor routinely included the cost of replacing some damaged ceiling tiles in its estimates, and often provided replacement tiles even though it was not explicitly required to do so by a particular contract.Â  A project foreman for Contractor signed a form accepting delivery of the tiles.Â  Holseberg testified the tiles were not needed, although he was uncertain whether they were used. \r\nSubcontractor filed a notice and certificate of its mechanicâ€™s lien in circuit court approximately one month after delivering the ceiling tiles.Â  About two months later, Subcontractor filed a lawsuit in circuit court against Owner and Contractor, asserting causes of action based in contract, the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, and quantum meruit.Â  Subcontractor sought the balance due of $177,001, attorneyâ€™s fees, prejudgment interest, and foreclosure and sale of the real property to satisfy its lien.\r\nThe case was referred with finality to a master-in-equity.Â  After a bench trial, the trial court found the mechanicâ€™s lien had been timely served and recorded as required by statute.Â  The trial court awarded $152,001 to Subcontractor, which represented a reduction of $25,000 from the original demand stemming from delays attributable to Subcontractor.Â  The trial court did not offset any damages claimed by Contractor for work it allegedly performed that was Subcontractorâ€™s responsibility.Â  Subcontractor requested payment of attorneyâ€™s fees of $43,529 as the prevailing party, and the trial court separately awarded $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The trial court denied Subcontractorâ€™s request for prejudgment interest.\r\nOwner and Contractor appealed and Subcontractor cross-appealed.Â  We certified this case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and the parties present the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.Â \r\n         Did the trial court err in ruling Subcontractor timely served and recorded its mechanicâ€™s lien?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in ruling Subcontractor was not entitled to prejudgment interest on the balance due?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nA proceeding for the enforcement of a statutory lien, such as a mechanicâ€™s lien, is legal in nature.Â  Willard v. Finch, 123 S.C. 56, 116 S.E. 96 (1923); Stoudenmire Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Co. v. Craig Bldg. Partnership, 308 S.C. 298, 301, 417 S.E.2d 634, 636 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  In an action at law, when a case is tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will be upheld on appeal when they are reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Stated another way, the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or unless it clearly appears the findings were influenced or controlled by an error of law.Â  The trial courtâ€™s findings in such a case are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976); Willard, 123 S.C. at 58, 116 S.E. at 96; Stoudenmire, 308 S.C. at 301, 417 S.E.2d at 636.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  Perfection of Mechanicâ€™s Lien\r\nOwner argues the trial court erred in ruling that Subcontractor timely served and recorded a mechanicâ€™s lien within the statutory ninety-day deadline.Â  Owner asserts that Subcontractorâ€™s â€œunilateral, unsolicited deliveryâ€ of one box of ceiling tiles to the jobsite did not revive Subcontractorâ€™s expired right to file a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  The delivery of â€œsurplus materialsâ€ was not required by the contract, and the materials were â€œmerely provided as a gratuity or an act of friendly accommodation.â€Â  In fact, the delivery was nothing more than â€œa contrived effort to revive lien rights.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real estate,â€ by virtue of an agreement with or with the consent of the owner or his agent, shall have a mechanicâ€™s lien upon the real property to secure payment of the debt.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (Supp. 2005).Â  The right to a lien arises inchoate; i.e., when the labor is performed or material is furnished, the right exists but the lien has not been perfected.Â  Preferred Sav. and Loan Assn., Inc. v. Royal Garden Resort, Inc., 301 S.C. 1, 3, 389 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1990); Wood v. Hardy, 235 S.C. 131, 138, 110 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1959); Williamson v. Hotel Melrose, 110 S.C. 1, 30, 96 S.E. 407, 409 (1918).Â  When the person claiming the lien was employed by someone other than the owner, such as a contractor, he must notify the owner of the furnishing of labor or material in order for the lien to attach to the property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-40 (1991); Lowndes Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229 S.C. 619, 629, 93 S.E.2d 855, 860 (1956); Shelley Constr. Co. v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 26-27, 336 S.E.2d 488, 490-91 (Ct. App. 1985).[3]Â  \r\nIn order to perfect and enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien, the person asserting the lien (1) must serve upon the owner or person in possession and file with the register of deeds or clerk of court a notice or certificate of lien containing the lien amount, a description of the real property, and other required information â€œwithin ninety days after he ceases to labor on or furnish labor or materials for such building or structureâ€; (2) must commence a lawsuit seeking to enforce the lien within six months after ceasing to provide labor or materials for such real property; and (3) must file a notice of the pending action (lis pendens) within six months after ceasing to provide labor or materials for such real property. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-5-90 and 29-5-120 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2005); Preferred Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., 301 S.C. at 3-4, 389 S.E.2d atÂ  854; Franke Associates by Simmons v. Russell, 295 S.C. 327, 329, 368 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1988); Multiplex Bldg. Corp. v. Lyles, 268 S.C. 577, 235 S.E.2d 133 (1977); Crystal Pools, Inc. v. Old Claussenâ€™s Bakery Partners, 303 S.C. 68, 399 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  If these steps are taken, the person claiming the lien may foreclose against the property to satisfy the debt.Â  On the other hand, if he fails to take any one of these steps, the lien against the property is dissolved pursuant to Sections 29-5-90 and 25-9-120.Â  The failure to perfect a mechanicâ€™s lien does not preclude an action on the debt.Â  Shelley Constr. Co., 287 S.C. at 27, 336 S.E.2d at 490.Â  \r\nThe time limits run from the same event: Â the certificate of lien must be filed within ninety days, and the foreclosure suit (and accompanying notice of pending action) must be commenced within six months after the person asserting the lien ceases to furnish labor or materials.Â \r\nThe effect of these provisions is that the six-month limitations period for enforcing the lien necessarily commences no later than the date the certificate of lien is\r\nfiled. If suit is not commenced within six months after the date the certificate of lien is filed, title examiners may assume that the mechanicâ€™s lien is dissolved.[4] Â Â Preferred Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., 301 S.C. at 4-5, 389 S.E.2d at 854-55.Â  A mechanicâ€™s lien is purely statutory.Â  Therefore, the requirements of the statute must be strictly followed.Â  Lyles, 268 S.C. at 578, 235 S.E.2d at 134.\r\nIn Wood, a residential contractor abandoned the construction of a house midway through the job.Â  The materials provider had not been paid by the contractor.Â  The materials provider agreed to furnish the rest of the materials, and the provider and homeowner agreed to hire others to complete the house.Â  The homeowner moved into the house upon completion.Â  Approximately one month later, the materials provider, acting upon a complaint by the homeowner, sent a plumber to properly complete the kitchen drain line by installing two pieces of pipe costing about $4.Â  The materials provider subsequently served and filed a notice of mechanicâ€™s lien within ninety days of effecting the minor plumbing repair, but not within ninety days of the provision of any other material or labor.Â  Wood, 235 S.C. at 133-36, 110 S.E.2d at 157-59.\r\nThe homeowner argued the minor plumbing repair was so â€œtrivial or inconsequentialâ€ that it was insufficient to extend the time for serving a mechanicâ€™s lien beyond the date the bulk of materials and labor had been provided.Â  This Court disagreed, noting, as other courts had in similar cases, that the statute does not specify any particular amount of materials or labor which must be furnished.Â  Wood, 235 S.C. 136-40, 110 S.E.2d at 159-61.\r\nâ€œ[W]here a claimant, after a contract is substantially completed, does additional work or furnishes additional material which is necessary for the proper performance of his contract, and which is done in good faith at the request of the owner or for the purpose of fully completing the contract, and not merely as a gratuity or act of friendly accommodation, the period for filing the lien will run from the doing of such work or the furnishing of such materials, irrespective of the value thereof.â€Â  Wood, 235 S.C. at 140, 110 S.E.2d 157 at 161.Â  The deadline to serve and record a mechanicâ€™s lien begins running from the date the last material was furnished or work performed, regardless of whether such material or work is insignificant and regardless of whether the final work is delayed, provided the reason for the delay is not to improperly extend the period for perfecting the lien.Â  Id.; accord Crystal Pools, 303 S.C. at 68, 399 S.E.2d at 5 (warranty work performed by carpeting contractor five months after initial installation of carpeting, which was necessary to complete performance under the contract, constituted furnishing of labor or materials and extended time for perfecting mechanicâ€™s lien).\r\nThe position adopted in Wood, as reflected in foreign precedent cited in that 1959 opinion, has not changed substantially in more recent cases from other courts.Â  â€œ[W]hen an unreasonable period of time has elapsed since substantial completion of the work, the performance of trivial services or the furnishing of trivial materials generally will not extend the time for filing the certificate past the date of substantial completion. . . .Â  If, however, subsequent to the date of substantial completion, trivial services or materials are provided at the request of the owner, rather than at the initiative of the contractor for the purpose of saving a lien, the furnishing of such work or material will extend the commencement of the period for filing a certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien.â€Â  F.B. Mattson Co. v. Tarte, 719 A.2d 1158, 1161 (Conn. 1998) (holding that, although roofing project had been substantially completed more than a month earlier, deadline to file mechanicâ€™s lien began to run upon removal of scaffolding and roofing brackets from property at request of owner); accord Franklin Bldg. Supply Co. v. Sumpter, 87 P.3d 955, 959-61 (Idaho 2004) (deadline to file mechanicâ€™s lien began to run when builder purchased a sheet of cedar and locking door handle for house, not when certificate of occupancy was issued several weeks earlier; although dollar value of items was minimal, they were actually used in constructing and repairing the home, were reasonably necessary to complete construction and punch list according to terms of contract, were not merely trivial or insubstantial, and purchases were not intended to extend time for filing lien); Interstate Elec. Servs. Corp. v. Cummings Props., LLC, 825 N.E.2d 1059, 1063-64 (Mass. App. 2005) (mere delay in completing contract and performance of trifling items of work have never been held under Massachusetts statute fatal to maintenance of a mechanicâ€™s lien when work was done in good faith and was necessary to a complete performance of the contract); Security Ben. Life Ins. Corp. v. Fleming Companies, 908 P.2d 1315, 1321-22 (Kan. App. 1995) (for purposes of mechanicâ€™s lien filing deadline, store checkout system installer last performed work on date it set up direct store delivery system and trained employees on its use; although other work was completed earlier, work performed on that date was necessary to comply with terms of contract); 53 Am.Jur.2d Mechanicsâ€™ Liens Â§ 211 (1996).\r\nIn the present case, Contractor asked Subcontractor to provide a single box of ceiling tiles to replace water-damaged tiles.Â  As shown by a delivery form signed by Contractorâ€™s supervisor, Subcontractor provided the tiles in early 2001.Â  The trial court correctly ruled that Subcontractor, in this instance, furnished additional materials which were necessary for the proper performance of the contact, and did so in good faith at the request of Contractor or for the purpose of fully completing the contract.Â  Subcontractor did not provide the materials merely as a gratuity or an act of friendly accommodation; nor did Subcontractor provide the materials merely to improperly extend the period for perfecting its lien.\r\nSubcontractor routinely provided such materials on its projects to properly complete the job and foster a good reputation.Â  Although it was not explicitly required by contract to leave surplus tiles on site or replace tiles damaged by others during the construction process, the parties implicitly considered the provision of such materials necessary to comply with the contract and fulfill the duty of good faith and fair dealing which is an implied term of every contract.Â  E.g. Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 201, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970) (â€œThere exists in every contract an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.â€).\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s ruling that the deadline for Subcontractor to file a mechanicâ€™s lien began to run upon delivery of the box of ceiling tiles to the jobsite at the request of Contractor is reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision that Subcontractor timely perfected its mechanicâ€™s lien pursuant to Sections 29-5-90 and 29-5-120.\r\nII.Â  Prejudgment Interest\r\nSubcontractor contends the trial court erred in denying its request for prejudgment interest because the amount owed was certain or capable of being reduced to certainty upon demand for payment.Â  We agree.\r\nThe law has long allowed prejudgment interest on obligations to pay money from the time when, either by agreement of the parties or operation of law, the payment is demandable, if the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty.Â  Smith-Hunter Constr. Co. v. Hopson, 365 S.C. 125, 128, 616 S.E.2d 419, 421 (2005); Babb v. Rothrock, 310 S.C. 350, 353, 426 S.E.2d 789, 791 (1993); Ancrum v. Slone, 29 S.C.L. (2 Speers) 594 (1844).Â  Stated another way, prejudgment interest is allowed on a claim of liquidated damages; i.e., the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty based on a mathematical calculation previously agreed to by the parties.Â  Prejudgment interest is not allowed on an unliquidated claim in the absence of an agreement or statute.Â  Babb, 310 S.C. at 350, 426 S.E.2d at 791; Builders Transport, Inc. v. S.C. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Assn., 307 S.C. 398, 406, 415 S.E.2d 419, 424 (Ct. App. 1992); Wayne Smith Constr. Co. v. Wolman, Duberstein, and Thompson, 294 S.C. 140, 146-47, 363 S.E.2d 115, 119 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nThe fact that the amount due is disputed by the opposing party does not render the claim unliquidated for the purposes of an award of prejudgment interest.Â  The proper test for determining whether prejudgment interest may be awarded is whether the measure of recovery, not necessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.Â  Smith-Hunter Constr. Co., 365 S.C. at 128, 616 S.E.2d at 421; Babb, 310 S.C. at 353, 426 S.E.2d at 791; Wayne Smith Constr. Co., 294 S.C. at 146-47, 363 S.E.2d at 119.Â  The right of a party to prejudgment interest is not affected by rights of discount or offset claimed by the opposing party.Â  It is the character of the claim and not the defense to it that determines whether prejudgment interest is allowable.Â  Lee v. Thermal Engineering Corp., 352 S.C. 81, 88-89, 572 S.E.2d 298, 302 (Ct. App. 2002); Southern Welding Works, Inc. v. K &amp; S Constr. Co., 286 S.C. 158, 164, 332 S.E.2d 102, 106 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\nA judgment debtor is required to pay interest on his debt as compensation for his continued retention and use of the creditorâ€™s money beyond the date payment was due.Â  Sears v. Fowler, 293 S.C. 43, 45-46, 358 S.E.2d 574, 575 (1987).Â  In South Carolina, prejudgment interest is set by statute at annual rate of 8Â¾ percent, although parties are free to agree, within legal limits, on a higher rate of interest.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A) (Supp. 2005); Turner Coleman, Inc. v. Ohio Constr. &amp; Engr., Inc., 272 S.C. 289, 292, 251 S.E.2d 738, 740 (1979).\r\nIn the present case, the trial court denied Subcontractorâ€™s claim for prejudgment interest because there was a â€œgood faith dispute by [Owner and Contractor] as to the amount due.â€Â  This ruling conflicts with established law and it is not reasonably supported by the evidence.\r\nThe parties do not dispute the amount of the original contract.Â  Including additional work and change orders, Subcontractor asserted it was owed a total of $713,364, of which Contractor paid $536,363, leaving a balance due of $177,001.Â  Contractor did not dispute the various amounts for additional work and changes asserted by Subcontractor, or the amount still owed to Subcontractor.Â  Contractor, however, filed a counterclaim seeking an offset for $94,878 in damages allegedly caused by delays attributable to Subcontractor and work which Subcontractor failed to timely or properly perform.\r\nWe hold the trial court erred in denying the award of prejudgment interest because Subcontractor asserted a claim for liquidated damages.Â  The amount Contractor owed Subcontractor was a certain sum or capable of being reduced to a certainty based on contractual provisions regarding the amount of the original contract, the amount of change orders approved by Contractor, and payments made by Contractor.Â  In this case, the trial court should have awarded prejudgment interest to Subcontractor after determining the amount Contractor owed Subcontractor.Â  Furthermore, Contractorâ€™s assertion of a counterclaim seeking an offset does not prevent an award of prejudgment interest because it is the character of the claim and not the defense to it that determines whether prejudgment interest is allowable.\r\nWe reverse the trial courtâ€™s order refusing to award prejudgment interest to Subcontractor and remand this case for calculation of prejudgment interest on the sum of $152,001 from the date Subcontractor filed its notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien in circuit court.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision that Subcontractor timely perfected its mechanicâ€™s lien and the verdict awarding damages to Subcontractor.Â  We reverse the trial courtâ€™s order refusing to award prejudgment interest to Subcontractor and remand this case for the calculation of such interest.Â  \r\nWe affirm the rulings of the trial court on the remaining issues raised by Owner and Contractor pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Issues II, III, and IV:Â  Willard v. Finch, 123 S.C. 56, 116 S.E. 96 (1923); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976); Stoudenmire Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Co. v. Craig Bldg.
