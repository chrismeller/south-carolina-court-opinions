Emory Smith, Jr., all of Columbia, for respondents\r\n \r\n  MOORE, A.J.: Appellants commenced this action challenging the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 6-1-70 (Supp. 1995) which requires real estate transfer fees collected by local government to be remitted to the State. The trial judge found the statute constitutional. We affirm.\r\n \r\n  ISSUES\r\n\r\n  1) Does &#167; 6-1-70 violate Home Rule?\r\n   2) Does it violate Article III, &#167;17?\r\n   3) Does it unconstitutionally change the purpose for which the fees were imposed?\r\n   4) Does it violate Article X?\r\n   5) Does it violate equal protection?\r\n\r\n \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n  Section 6-1-70 provides:\r\n   The governing body of each county and municipality which enacts and collects any fee which is charged on the transfer of real estate shall, not later than ten days after the close of a fiscal year quarter, remit to the State Treasurer an amount equal to the amount of real estate transfer fees collected in the previous fiscal year quarter. The county or municipality may voluntarily elect to have the State Treasurer or Comptroller General, as appropriate, deduct the amount required to be remitted from any distributions authorized to be made to the county or municipality under Aid to Subdivisions.Fn.1\r\n\r\nThis statute became effective July 1, 1994, but its enforcement is suspended through\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.1 &nbsp; The State Aid to Subdivisions Act is codified at S.C. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 6-27-10 through -50 (Supp. 1995).\r\np. 6\r\n\r\nTOWN of HILTON HEAD, et al. v. EARL E. MORRIS etc. et al.\r\n \r\n  January 1, 1997, for real estate transfer fees imposed on or before August 1, 1993. 1994 S.C. Act No. 497, Part 11, &#167;13B.\r\n \r\n  1) Home Rule\r\n \r\n  Appellants contend &#167; 6-1-70 violates article VIII, &#167 17, part of the Home Rule Amendment of our State constitution. They argue since Williams v. Town of Hilton Head, 311 S.C. 417, 429 S.E.2d 802 (1993), held a real estate transfer fee was within a local government's general statutory authority, &#167; 6-1-70 violates Home Rule by limiting the imposition of such a fee.\r\n This argument is without merit. Under Home Rule, the General Assembly is charged with passing general laws regarding the powers of local government. S.C. Const. art. VIII, &#167;7 (counties); &#167;9 (municipalities). The authority of a local government is subject to the general laws passed by the General Assembly. See S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 5-7-30 (municipalities); &#167; 4-9-30 (counties) (Supp. 1995). The General Assembly can therefore pass legislation specifically limiting the authority of local government. In this case, although &#167; 6-1-70 does not prohibit the imposition of real estate transfer fees, it prohibits local governments from retaining the revenue generated by them. This limitation on revenue-raising does not violate article VIII, &#167; 17, since the General Assembly is constitutionally empowered to determine the parameters of local government authority.\r\nAppellants also argue &#167; 6-1-70 violates article VIII because it applies only to local governments that impose a real estate transfer fee and therefore it is not a general law. A general law is one that applies to the entire State and operates wherever the specified conduct takes place. Owens v. Smith, 216 S.C. 382, 58 S.E.2d 332 (1950). Section 6-1-70 is a general law because it applies to all real estate transfer fees. We find no violation of article VIII.\r\n\r\n  2) Article III, &#167; 17\r\n \r\n  Section 6-1-70 was passed as part of the 1994 Appropriations Act. Appellant contends enactment of this statute as part of the Act violated article III, &#167;17, of our State constitution which provides that \"[e]very Act or resolution having the effect of law shall relate to but one subject and that shall be expressed in the title.\"\r\n A measure enacted as part of a general appropriations act does not violate article III, &#167;17, if it reasonably and inherently relates to the raising and spending of tax monies. Keyserling v. Beasley, __ S.C. __, __ S.E.2d __ (1996); Hercules v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137, 262 S.E.2d 45 (1980). Section 6-1-70 is related to the amount of money the State spends on Aid to Subdivisions since it provides a local government may either remit the amount collected from real estate\r\np. 7\r\n\r\nTOWN of HILTON HEAD, et al. v. EARL E. MORRIS etc. et al.\r\n \r\n  transfer fees or request a reduction in the amount receivable under the Aid to Subdivisions Act. Accordingly, &#167; 6-1-70 reasonably and inherently relates to the raising and spending of tax monies and does not violate article III, &#167;17.\r\n \r\n  3) Change in purpose for which fees were imposed\r\n \r\n  Appellants contend the General Assembly cannot constitutionally divert the transfer fees from the purpose for which they were imposed by local government to State use. We disagree. The cases cited by appellants, Watson v. Pulliam, 239 S.C. 186, 121 S.E.2d 910 (1961), and Sossamon v. Greater Gaffney Metro. Utilities, 236 S.C. 173, 113 S.E.2d 534 (1960), are inapposite. The legislation in those cases created a duty that a local government contribute a certain benefit to another local government. The legislation here creates no such duty. There is no requirement that a local government levy a real estate transfer fee to be remitted to the State. Further, in this case, taxpayers who pay the transfer fee still receive a benefit in return, albeit more indirectly, when it is remitted to the State. This remittance is unlike a forced contribution to another local government.\r\n4) Article X\r\n Appellants contend &#167; 6-1-70 violates &#167; 6 of article X of our State constitution which provides that \"[p]roperty tax levies shall be uniform\" since the State does not control the amount of the transfer fee imposed. A statute levies a tax when it fixes the amount or rate to be imposed. Myers v. Patterson, 315 S.C. 248, 433 S.E.2d 841 (1993). Section 6-1-70 levies no tax and therefore does not violate art. X, &#167; 6.\r\nAppellants contend &#167; 6-1-70 violates &#167; 5 of article X as taxation without representation or, in the alternative, unlawful delegation of the State's taxing power. This argument is without merit. As discussed above, &#167; 6-1-70 does not levy a tax nor does it delegate any taxing power.\r\n Appellants contend &#167; 6-1-70 violates &#167; 7 of article X, which requires the General Assembly to provide for a balanced budget, since the State cannot foresee the amount of revenue to be remitted from the transfer fees imposed by local government. This argument is without merit. Article X, &#167; 7, specifically requires that expenditures not exceed annual State revenue but does not prohibit a surplus of revenue. There is no evidence the General Assembly has incurred a short-fall from relying on revenue from transfer fees or has used any surplus for an improper purpose. Accordingly, appellants have failed to show a violation of article X, &#167; 7. See Business License Opposition Committee v. Sumter County, 304 S.C. 232, 403 S.E.2d 638 (1991) (surplus not unconstitutional if not diverted to improper cause).\r\n5) Equal protection.\r\np. 8\r\n\r\nTOWN of HILTON HEAD, et al. v. EARL E. MORRIS etc. et al.\r\n \r\n  Appellants contend &#167; 6-1-70 violates equal protection because it applies only to those local governments that impose real estate transfer fees. Since &#167; 6-1-70 applies to all local governments that are similarly situated, i.e. impose a transfer fee, there is no unconstitutional classification. Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (in challenging a classification on equal protection grounds, the party challenging it must show that similarly situated persons received disparate treatment).\r\n Appellants further complain that local governments which imposed such fees before August 1, 1993, are exempt until January 1, 1997, from the application of &#167; 6-1-70 and that such a classification is arbitrary. This lapse in enforcement allows local governments which have relied on such fees in adopting budgets to phase them out as a source of revenue. Accordingly, this classification is not arbitrary but is reasonably related to a proper legislative purpose and therefore does not violate equal protection. Brown v. County of Horry, 308 S.C. 180, 417 S.E.2d 565 (1992).\r\n Accordingly, we hold the trial judge did not err in upholding the constitutionality of &#167; 6-1-70.\r\n \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n \r\n  FINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\np. 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24597","title":"In the Matter of Joseph P.

Ballard of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n \r\n  Attorney General Charles M. Condon and Assistant Deputy Attorney General J. Emory Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, for complainant.\r\n \r\n  PER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent admits he has committed misconduct and consents to a suspension of up to two years. We accept respondent's admissions and suspend him from the practice of law for two years.\r\nBank Accounts\r\nRespondent wrote a check for $525.20 to Bell's Automatic Transmission in February 1996. The check was drawn on a joint personal account that had been closed. An arrest warrant was served upon respondent for issuing the fraudulent check, but the charge was dismissed after respondent paid his bill at the transmission shop.\r\nIn addition, respondent's law office and escrow bank accounts were overdrawn several times in January 1996. Respondent states that no clients were deprived of funds and he did not convert any client funds to personal use.\r\nThe Bruce Matter\r\nThe South Carolina Bar administratively suspended respondent from the practice of law on February 14, 1996, for non-payment of license fees. He also\r\np. 10\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF MIZZELL\r\n \r\n  was administratively suspended on May 6, 1996, for failure to comply with continuing legal education requirements. Respondent closed his Orangeburg law office in September 1996.\r\nWhile his license was suspended, respondent accepted $500 in April 1996 to represent John Bruce at a bond reduction hearing. Respondent asked a judge to reduce Mr. Bruce's bond in May 1996. Respondent states he did not know his license had been administratively suspended because he failed to retrieve his mail in a timely fashion. Respondent subsequently paid overdue license fees and fulfilled his continuing legal education requirements for 1995.\r\nThe Williams Matter\r\nRespondent accepted a $250 retainer in August 1995 from Louise Williams to represent her in a contractual dispute related to construction on a house. Respondent wrote the contractor several letters between August and mid- October 1995, but did little or no work on the matter after that date despite numerous telephone calls from Ms. Williams' daughter, who had her mother's power of attorney.\r\nIn February 1996, Ms. Williams asked respondent to release her file and refund part of her retainer. Respondent failed to keep three appointments with Ms. Williams in March 1996 to release her file, and did not release the file until it was subpoenaed in July 1996 for the purpose of the disciplinary proceedings. Respondent has agreed to refund the retainer paid by Ms. Williams and asserts that the delay did not prejudice her rights.\r\nThe Howell Matter\r\nRespondent accepted $800 from Bennie Lee Howell and his employer during the last six months of 1994 to represent Mr. Howell in a post-conviction relief (PCR) action. Mr. Howell's prior attorney had filed the PCR application and the State filed a return in October 1994. Respondent took no action on Mr. Howell's behalf other than requesting a continuance in January 1995.\r\nRespondent ignored efforts by Mr. Howell and his family to reach him, and did not inform Mr. Howell that he had been suspended from the practice of law. Mr. Howell's case was still pending when disciplinary proceedings against respondent were instituted in August 1996. Respondent has agreed to refund the fees paid by Mr. Howell and his employer.\r\nThe Rivers Matter\r\nRespondent accepted $5,000 from Eugene Rivers' mother in August 1994 to represent Mr. Rivers in a PCR action. A circuit judge signed an order granting Mr. Rivers a new trial in September 1995, but the order was not filed\r\np. 11\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF MIZZELL\r\n \r\n  until June 1996 due to respondent's failure to file it or inquire into its filing. Respondent did not notify his client the order had been filed, or that respondent had been suspended from the practice of law. Mr. Rivers disputed the amount of the fee before the Bar's Fee Dispute Resolution Committee, which found that respondent had fully earned the fee.\r\nConclusion\r\nBy his conduct, respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR. He failed to properly safeguard clients' property, failed to promptly deliver funds owed to a clients or third persons, and failed to promptly render a full accounting regarding the property of clients or third persons. Rule 1.15. Respondent engaged in acts and conduct involving moral turpitude that reflect adversely upon his honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer. He acted in a dishonest and fraudulent manner, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Rule 8.4(b), (c), (d), and (e).\r\nIn addition, respondent failed to represent his clients competently. Rule 1.1. He failed to act with reasonable diligence in representing his clients, failed to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of matters, and failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information. Rules 1.3 and 1.4(a). He practiced law while under suspension and failed to inform clients of his suspension. Finally, respondent failed to cooperate with an investigation by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline by not responding to two letters inquiring into the above matters. See In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).\r\nWe find that respondent's conduct warrants a definite suspension of two years from the practice of law. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Paragraph 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n/s/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ernest A.

Gregory of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n \r\n  Attorney General Charles Molony Condon, Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Teresa Nesbitt Cosby, and Assistant Attorney General Allen Bullard, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n \r\n  Burnett, A.J.: Petitioner pled guilty to second degree arson, six counts of first degree burglary, two counts of second degree burglary, and seven counts of grand larceny.Fn.1 This Court granted petitioner a writ of certiorari to review the decision\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.1   Petitioner was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment for arson, twenty-five years' imprisonment for each first degree burglary charge, fifteen years' imprisonment for each second degree burclary charge, and ten years' imprisonment for each grand larceny charge. All sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. As part of the negotiations, petitioner also agreed to plead guilty to two Beaufort County charges in\r\np. 13\r\n\r\nPADGETT v. STATE\r\n \r\n  of the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge denying petitioner relief. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and vacate one of petitioner's convictions.\r\nPetitioner argues his trial counsel was ineffective, thereby rendering his guilty pleas involuntary. Specifically, he contends: 1) counsel had a conflict of interest, 2) counsel should have more vigorously defended him once he received a letter from Vernon Johnson recanting Johnson's statements to the police, and 3) counsel did not adequately investigate the first degree burglary charge concerning victim James Richardson.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Is there any evidence which supports the PCR judge's finding petitioner received effective assistance of counsel?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTo establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must show counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and he was prejudiced by the deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Where there has been a guilty plea, the applicant must prove counsel's representation fell below the standard of reasonableness and, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability he would not have pled guilty but would have insisted upon going to trial. Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 402 S.E.2d 484 (1991). Where counsel articulates a valid reason for employing certain trial strategy, the conduct will not be deemed ineffective. Roseboro v. State, __ S.C. __, 454 S.E.2d 312 (1995); Underwood v. State, 309 S.C. 560, 425 S.E.2d 20 (1992). If there is any evidence to support the findings of the PCR judge, those findings must be upheld. Cherry v. State, supra. This Court will not uphold the findings of the PCR judge if there is no probative evidence to support them. Holland v. State, __ S.C. __, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\n1) Conflict of Interest\r\nEight months prior to petitioner's plea, trial counsel moved to be relieved. Petitioner was present at the motion hearing. At the hearing, counsel told the trial judge two of the burglary victims, Gustin and Lambridge, were his friends and he was\r\n_______________\r\nexchange for a recommended twenty-five year sentence which would be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in Colleton County. In addition, the solicitor agreed to dismiss four other warrants pending against petitioner.\r\np. 14\r\n\r\n  PADGETT v. STATE\r\n \r\n  representing the sheriff in a civil matter. Counsel stated he had disclosed these concerns to petitioner. Upon questioning by the trial judge, counsel stated he did not believe his representation of petitioner would be influenced by his representation of the sheriff. The trial judge then denied the motion, indicating petitioner could move on his own behalf to have counsel removed.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, counsel testified his friendships with two of the victims did not affect his representation of petitioner. Petitioner testified, while he was present at the motion to be relieved, he was not informed he could move to have counsel relieved.\r\nThe PCR judge did not rule on the conflict of interest issue. Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for the Court's consideration. Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 423 S.E.2d 127 (1992).\r\nIn any event, petitioner failed to establish counsel had an actual conflict of interest. Counsel specifically denied his relationships with two of the victims or his representation of the sheriff affected his representation of petitioner. Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 426 S.E.2d 793 (1993)(the mere possibility of a conflict of interest is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction).\r\n2) Vernon Johnson, Jr., Letter\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Vernon Johnson, Jr., petitioner's nephew and co- defendant, testified he had given statements to the police in which he implicated petitioner in various burglaries. He explained he later sent a letter to trial counsel in which he stated petitioner had not been involved in two of the burglaries and the statements he had previously given the police were false. Johnson testified counsel did not contact him concerning the letter.\r\nTrial counsel testified he received the letter from Johnson and discussed the letter with petitioner. He stated he told petitioner his chances would improve if his nephew did not testify against him at trial. Counsel explained, however, from his experience it was risky to rely on a person who had recanted his statement to the police because his testimony would be uncertain until he actually testified at trial.\r\nTrial counsel further testified, in addition to Johnson's statement, other evidence against petitioner included a statement from another co-defendant, forensic evidence indicating tools found in petitioner's car were used in the break-ins, and testimony from a pawn shop owner that petitioner had sold stolen property to the pawn shop.\r\nThe PCR judge concluded \"counsel's reluctance to rely on Johnson's\r\np. 15\r\n\r\nPADGETT v. STATE\r\n \r\n  retraction on [sic] Johnson's statement to police was reasonable.\"\r\nThe PCR judge did not rule on whether counsel should have \"more vigorously defended the charges\" after obtaining Johnson's letter. Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for the Court's consideration. Pruitt v. State, supra.\r\nIn any event, petitioner has failed to establish counsel was deficient by not more vigorously defending the charges. Petitioner has not suggested what action counsel should have taken to more vigorously defend him after receiving Johnson's letter. Moreover, petitioner has not established prejudice. The record indicates there was other evidence against petitioner, including a statement by another co-defendant. Accordingly, petitioner has not met his burden of establishing ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Strickland v. Washington, supra; Cherry v. State, supra.\r\n3) James Richardson Burglary\r\nThe first degree burglary indictment in question alleges petitioner unlawfully entered the dwelling of James Richardson. At the PCR hearing, Richardson testified his barn had been broken into, no one lived in the barn, and there were no other buildings on the premises.\r\nPetitioner testified he worked on construction projects near the Richardson property and knew the building on the property was a barn. Trial counsel testified he did not talk to petitioner about the Richardson burglary and did not know if his investigator spoke with petitioner about the burglary. He stated he did not visit the crime scene and did not have an opinion as to whether breaking into a bam was first or second degree burglary. At the PCR hearing, the State conceded burglary of Richardson's bam did not constitute first degree burglary,Fn.2 but argued petitioner was not prejudiced because the Richardson indictment was one of six first degree burglary indictments for which petitioner received the benefit of a negotiated sentence.\r\nThe PCR judge concluded counsel's failure to challenge the first degree burglary indictment for the Richardson burglary was trial strategy.\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.2   First degree burglary requires the entering of a dwelling without consent. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. 1996). \"Dwelling\" is defined as any building in which a person sleeps or lodges and all other buildings within two hundred yards of it. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-10 (1985). Additionally, \"dwelling\" is defined as the living quarters of a building which are normally used for sleeping, living, or lodging by a person. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310 (2) (Supp. 1996). Since no one lived in the Richardson barn and there were no other buildings on the premises, the evidence did not support an indictment for first degree burglary.\r\np. 16\r\n\r\nPADGETT v. STATE\r\n \r\n  We disagree with the PCR judge. Trial counsel did not articulate any strategy for not challenging the Richardson indictment. In fact, since counsel did not know the Richardson break-in occurred at a barn, he could not have decided as a matter of strategy not to challenge the indictment. Moreover, it appears counsel did not recognize a distinction between Richardson's barn and a dwelling for first degree burglary purposes. As to this issue, the PCR judge's conclusion is not supported by the evidence of record and should be reversed. Holland v. State, supra. Accordingly, we vacate petitioner's conviction as to this one indictment.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND VACATED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\np. 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24619","title":"In the Matter of Stecen E.

Mundy, of Abbeville, pro se.\r\n Attorney General Charles Molony Condon and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for complainant.\r\n PER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance matter, respondent has admitted the allegations against him and consents to disbarment with restitution as a condition of reinstatement. We accept his admission and disbar respondent.\r\n The admitted allegations involve several different matters, discussed separately below.\r\n Drawdy Matter\r\n In March of 1995, Drawdy borrowed $43,500 from Associates Finance Company of Greenwood as a first mortgage on a home. In October of 1996, Drawdy refinanced that loan by borrowing $44,300 from First Union Bank of Greenwood. Respondent closed the loan. Drawdy's check for $44,300 was deposited in respondent's trust account on October 29, 1996. On October 31, the balance of respondent's trust account fell to $17,987.92; the balance then fell to $2,943 on November 7, 1996, with no disbursement to Associates Finance as required. The majority of Drawdy's funds were misappropriated and converted to purposes other than which they were intended.\r\n On three occasions, respondent represented to Drawdy and Associates Finance he had mailed the check but it had gotten lost. In fact, no payoff check\r\np.42\r\n\r\n IN THE MATTER OF MUNDY\r\n had been issued. In late December of 1996, respondent delivered a trust account check in the amount of $41,701.05 to Associates Finance to pay off Drawdy's loan. This check was returned for non-sufficient funds (NSF). As of the date of respondent's Affidavit and Consent to Sanction, Associates Finance had not been paid.\r\n Sammons Matter\r\n The Sammons borrowed $63,000 from First Union Bank of Greenwood in December 1996 to pay off a mortgage and consolidate loans. They retained respondent to close their loan. The monthly statements from respondent's trust account show a deposit of $63,000 on January 3, 1997. The account had a negative beginning balance of $72,912.91 on January 1, 1997, so the deposit of the Sammons money only reduced the negative balance to $9,960.91. The Sammons funds were immediately misappropriated and converted to purposes other than those for which they were intended.\r\n When the Sammons' loan closed, respondent issued a trust account ' check for $39,759.06 to pay off a different mortgage. That check was returned for NSF and has not been repaid. Respondent also issued four additional trust account checks totaling $20,691.99, all of which were returned for NSF. Ms. Sammons received one of these checks in the amount of $3,155.68 and contacted respondent when it was returned. Respondent's parents loaned him money and he deposited $3,200 into the Sammons' account. Respondent also gave Ms. Sammons a trust account check for $1,181.11 to be applied toward her Master Card bill as part of the plan to consolidate loans. That check cleared and was posted to the Master Card account in January of 1997.\r\n Murdock Trust Matter Respondent served as trustee in a Probate Court matter involving Murdock. In late December of 1996, respondent sold land relating to the trust for $80,500. The buyer's check for the purchase price was deposited in respondent's trust account on December 19, 1996. The purchaser stopped payment on the check causing a return item chargeback to respondent's trust account for the amount of the check.\r\n Before this chargeback was debited on December 26, 1996, respondent wrote two trust account checks in the amounts of $40,000 and $93,500 which were negotiated on December 23, 1996. Neither check related to the Murdock Trust; one was a refund to another client and the other was a payment relating to another client's real estate closing. The beginning balance of respondent's trust account for the month of December 1996 was (-) $23,816.65. The ending balance for that month was (-) $72,912.91. Accordingly, the Murdock Trust funds were misappropriated and converted to purposes other than those for which they were intended.\r\n p.43\r\n\r\n IN THE MATTER OF MUNDY\r\n Wagler Matter\r\n In January of 1997, Wagler sold property to the Isbles for approximately $56,000 with a $6,000 down payment. Respondent was the closing attorney and deposited $50,285 into his trust account. The entire deposit was immediately misappropriated and converted to purposes other than those for which it was intended. Respondent issued a trust account check to Wagler in the amount of $49,555 which was returned for NSF. Wagler contacted respondent on numerous occasions and was told efforts were underway to correct the problem. As of the date of the complaint against respondent, the check was still outstanding.\r\n Cooper Communities Matter\r\n The Baschs purchased a lot at Savannah Lakes Village; respondent did the closing in December of 1996. The payoff check in the amount of $38,086.99 was issued on respondent's trust account and delivered to the developer of Savannah Lakes Village, Cooper Communities of Bella Vista, Arkansas. The check was returned for NSF. Robert Duvall with the Legal Department of Cooper Communities, or someone at his request, left three messages for respondent concerning the returned check. Respondent called Duvall or his designee and gave him false information,. telling him two of respondent's clients had given him personal checks that did not clear which caused the Cooper Communities check to be returned NSF. Thereafter, telephone calls to respondent's office were not returned.\r\n Forgery Respondent negotiated checks from his trust account which contained manufactured, false and misleading information with the intent to deceive. Two checks in the amount of $7,800 were made payable to Marion E. Mundy. Respondent then forged the name of the payee and assigned the check back to himself, received the funds, and applied them to personal debts or gave them to Helen Miller. Respondent also drew a check payable to Helen Miller for $6,100 with the manufactured information that it was \"proceeds from loan to April Williams.\"\r\n Helen Miller, a/k/a Helen Leach; a/k/a/ Helen Anderson Helen Miller retained respondent to represent her in her divorce and in some criminal matters including check fraud and NSF checks. Respondent also represented her in an action for breach of trust and another civil action. Respondent and Miller1 are currently defendants in a civil suit alleging fraud,\r\n_____________\r\n1 &nbsp; The lawsuit names Helen Miller as Helen Anderson.\r\np.44\r\n\r\n IN THE MATTER OF MUNDY\r\n negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract.\r\n Between July of 1996 and January of 1997, respondent issued to Miller a minimum of five checks from the law firm's operating account, twenty-two checks from the law firm's trust account, and one check from a second business in which respondent is involved. These checks totaled $348,100. Respondent admits these checks were completely outside the scope of the attorney/client relationship and outside the scope of any lawful purpose. He also admits he misappropriated and converted client and estate funds totaling approximately $300,000 to pay Miller for an unlawful purpose.\r\n Respondent received two checks for $125,000 each from Helen Miller issued from her business account payable to the law firm. Respondent states he asked Miller for these funds to cover client fund shortages created by an ongoing scheme of extortion by Miller. Respondent deposited these checks into the law firm's trust account on January 8, 1997, based purely on the information these checks were good. After deposit, the two checks were returned due to NSF.\r\n Trust Account Matter\r\n The bank statements from respondent's trust account show twenty- two NSF charges and at least one overdraft charge during the time between July 1996 and January 1997. During this time period, the account had a negative balance approximately twelve times.\r\n Conclusion\r\n The acts committed by respondent are ones of serious misconduct. By his ow-n admission he has violated many of the Rules of Professional Responsibility. Rule 407, SCACR. He has failed to provide competent representation. Rule 1.1. He has failed to keep clients reasonably info=ed and has not promptly complied with reasonable requests for information. Rule 1.4(a). He has not consulted clients concerning the means by which the objectives of his representation were to be pursued. Rule 1.2(a). He has not acted with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his clients. Rule 1.3.\r\n Furthermore, respondent has failed to promptly deliver funds to third persons which they were entitled to receive, misappropriated client funds, and failed to promptly render a full accounting as required by Rule 1.15. He has made false statements of material fact and offered evidence he knew to be false to a tribunal. Rule 3.3. He has also made false statements of material fact to third persons. Rule 4.1(a). He has committed criminal acts that reflect adversely upon his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer. Rule 8.4(b). He has engaged in reprehensible conduct involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation. Rule 8.4(c) and (d). He has also engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Rule 8.4(e). Under the Rules for\r\np.45\r\n\r\n Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, his behavior is grounds for disbarment. Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n Accordingly, we disbar respondent from the practice of law. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Paragraph 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court. Restitution is a condition of his reinstatement.\r\n DISBARRED.\r\n p.46 \r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24599","title":"Hagley Homeowners Assn.

Cleveland, III, of Haynsworth, Marion, McKay & Guerard, L.L.P., for Defendants-Respondents Georgetown County Water & Sewer District.\r\nJack M. Scoville, Jr., of Georgetown, for Intervening Defendants-Respondents.\r\n \r\n  Burnett, A.J.: This is an appeal from orders of the circuit court 1) upholding the constitutionality of Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539, which created Defendant-Respondent Georgetown County Water and Sewer District (the District) and 2) upholding monthly charges and front-foot assessments imposed by the District. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHagley Estates subdivision was created by a private developer in the mid- 1960s. After the developer filed bankruptcy, the lots were publicly auctioned.\r\np. 4\r\n\r\nHAGLEY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., et al. v.\r\nHAGLEY WATER, SEWER and FIRE AUTHORITY, etc., et al.\r\n \r\n  The District, a special purpose district, was created by the General Assembly in 1967 for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, and operating a water and sewer system. The District's service area encompasses Georgetown County (excluding the City of Georgetown and the Town of Andrews), including Hagley Estates. Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539.\r\nThe predecessor to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) determined most of the approximately 1000 lots in Hagley Estates did not have sufficient size or suitable soil conditions to support private septic tanks and wells; consequently, most of the lots were not conducive for building. At the request of DHEC, the General Assembly created Defendant-Respondent Hagley Water, Sewer, and Fire Authority (the Authority)Fn.1 for the purpose of controlling septic tank permit issuance and planning for future water, sewer, and fire protection needs of Hagley Estates. Act No. 285, 1971 Acts 344.\r\nDue to lack of development, it was not economically feasible to construct a public water and sewer system for Hagley Estates. To permit some development, the Authority and DHEC entered into an ageement which provided the Authority could issue septic tank permits to every third lot upon the specific condition the applicant would subscribe to the public water and/or sewer system when it became available, even if the applicant had a well and/or septic tank. The ageement further stated, once an area of the subdivision reached the saturation point as determined by engineers and DHEC, no more permits would be issued until a community water and sewer system was provided. In accordance with these terms, approximately 322 of the 950 Hagley Estate lots received septic tank permits between 1971 and 1988.\r\nIn 1988, the Hagley Estates Property Owners Association petitioned the District to provide water and sewer service. According to the petition, 80% of the property owners supported construction of the system. The District obtained a preliminary engineering report and made a preliminary application for financing. At a public hearing in February 1991, the District became aware of some homeowners' opposition to the project.\r\nThe District sent a survey to every property owner of record in March of 1991. Survey results indicated there was no clear mandate either for or against the project. In April 1991, the District voted to defer construction of a community water and sewer system.\r\nIn July 1991, the Authority requested the District proceed with\r\n________________ \r\nFn.1 &nbsp; The Authority has not participated in this appeal.\r\np. 5\r\n\r\nHAGLEY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., et al. v.\r\nHAGLEY WATER, SEWER and FIRE AUTHORITY, etc., et al.\r\n \r\n  construction of the community water and sewer system for Hagley Estates. The District voted to proceed with the project on July 24, 1991.\r\nOn June 1, 1992, the Authority and the District entered into a formal agreement to implement the water and sewer project. This agreement was reached after eleven months of planning and study at a cost of $250,000. The estimated completion date of the project was November 1994. Construction costs for the system would be recovered by front-foot assessment of lot owners once the system is available.\r\nAppellants, most of whom have homes with individual wells and septic tanks in the Hagley Estates subdivision, brought this action challenging the constitutionality of Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539, which created the District. They contend the Act is special legislation in contravention of art. III, &#167; 34 (IX) of the S.C. Constitution. In addition, they argue the monthly charges and front-foot assessments imposed by the District violate S.C. Constitution art. X, &#167; 5, and charges to recover construction costs should be based on a lot owner's proportionate share of benefits realized from the community water and sewer system, rather than front-foot assessments. Intervening Defendants-Respondents support the construction of a community water and sewer system for the subdivision.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I. Did the trial court err by determining Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539, does not violate the constitutional prohibition against special legislation?\r\n  II. Did the trial court err by determining imposition of front-foot assessments and monthly charges by the District do not constitute taxation without representation in violation of S.C. Constitution art. X, &#167; 5?\r\n  III. Did the trial court err by determining the District may impose charges by way of front-foot assessment rather than by the method proposed by Appellants?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nAppellants contend the trial judge erred by determining creation of the District by Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539 (the Act), did not constitute special legislation in contravention of S.C. Constitution art. III, &#167; 34 (IX). They further argue no compelling reasons justified creation of the District by special law. We disagree.\r\np. 6\r\n\r\nHAGLEY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., et al.\r\nHAGLEY WATER, SEWER and FIRE AUTHORITY, etc., et al.\r\n \r\n  In relevant part, S.C. Constitution art. III, &#167; 34 (IX) provides: \"where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted . . . \". South Carolina Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 6-11-10 to -1260 (1976) provide the method by which special purpose districts may be established by petition of the affected landowners. Former versions of &#167;&#167; 6-11-10 to -1260 existed at the time the General Assembly promulgated the Act creating the District. Sections 6-11-10 to - 1260 and its predecessors constitute general law. Town of Hilton Head v. Morris, Op. No. 24575 (S.C. Sup. Ct. refiled April 7, 1997) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 5)(a general law is one which applies to the entire State and operates wherever the specified conduct takes place).\r\nFor decades this Court has recognized the right of the General Assembly to create special purpose districts without regard to the prohibition of S.C. Constitution art. III, &#167; 34 (IX). Distin v. Bolding, 240 S.C. 545, 126 S.E.2d 649, 653 (1962), citing Mills Mill v. Hawkins, 232 S.C. 515, 103 S.E.2d 14 (1957). Even special purpose districts which were primarily concerned with \"mere conveniences or other matters not so vital to the public welfare\" or for which \"there was no real necessity for a special act\" have been upheld by numerous decisions of the Court.Fn.2 Mills Mill, S.C. at 524, 527, S.E.2d at 17, 19, citing cases therein.\r\nWe conclude, although it is special legislation, the Act did not contravene the constitutional prohibition against special legislation. Distin, supra; Mills Mill, supra. Furthermore, we view the functions and powers of the District stated in the Act as sufficient evidence of need for the District's creation. Rutledge v. Greater Greenville Sewer Dist., 139 S.C. 188, 193, 137 S.E. 597, 598 (1927)(\"Every presumption must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative act. Courts should not declare a statute unconstitutional unless the invalidity is \"manifest beyond a reasonable doubt\").\r\nII.\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred by determining the imposition of monthly charges and front-foot assessments to cover the construction costs of the project by the District do not constitute taxation without representation in violation of S.C. Constitution art. X, &#167; 5. We disagree.\r\nThe District is composed of five members who are appointed by the governor upon the recommendation of the Legislative Delegation of Georgetown\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.2 &nbsp; We note the existence of special purpose districts is protected, even under home rule, until they are dissolved by the General Assembly. Michelin Tire Corp. v. Spartinburg County Treasurer, 281 S.C. 31, 314 S.E.2d 8 (1984).\r\np. 7\r\n\r\nHAGLEY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION INC., et al. v.\r\nHAGLEY WATER, SEWER and FIRE AUTHORITY, etc., et al.\r\n \r\n  County. The District has the power to prescribe rates for water service and to exercise all powers given to special purpose districts by general law. Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539, &#167;&#167; 2 and 4 (11) & (23). South Carolina Code Ann. &#167; 6-11-12 10(g) authorizes special purpose districts to collect charges for sewage collection and to impose front- foot assessments against properties abutting the sewage collection lines.\r\nS.C. Constitution art. X, &#167; 5 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  No tax, subsidy or charge shall be established, fixed, laid or levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people or their representatives lawfully assembled. Any tax which shall be levied shall distinctly state the public purpose to which the proceeds of the tax shall be applied.\r\n\r\nThis provision is known as the prohibition against taxation without representation. Crow v. McAlpine, 277 S.C. 240, 285 S.E.2d 355 (1981).\r\nPursuant to S.C. Constitution art. X, &#167; 5, the power of taxation rests with the people of South Carolina who have entrusted this power to the General Assembly. While the General Assembly can delegate its taxing authority to a subordinate agency, it can only delegate this power to a body which is either composed of persons assented to by the people or subject to the supervisory control of a body chosen by the people. Bradley v. Cherokee School Dist. No. One, __ S.C. __, 470 S.E.2d 570 (1996). A board composed of persons appointed by the governor upon the recommendation of the county legislative delegation cannot levy taxes without violation of the constitutional provision against taxation without representation. Crow, supra. It is undisputed the District is appointive, not representative.\r\nGenerally, taxes are imposed on all property for the maintenance of government while assessments are placed only on the property to be benefited. Robinson v. Richland County Council, 293 S.C. 27, 358 S.E.2d 392 (1987). A \"charge\" is \"[t]he price of, or rate for, something.\" Black's Law Dictionary 233 (6th ed. 1990). Unlike taxes, charges and assessments are similar in that a person receives something specific in exchange for payment of a charge and/or assessment.\r\n\"The imposition of an assessment for the expenses of the local improvement upon adjoining lands benefited by it, although an exercise of the taxing power is not taxation within the provisions of the State Constitution regulating or prescribing the manner of taxation.\" Distin, S.C. at 554, S.E.2d at 653.Fn.3 Similarly, we\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.3 &nbsp; See 70A Am. Jur.2d Special or Local Assessments &#167; 1. \"[A] special or local assessment is not a tax in the sense of a tax to raise revenue for general governmental\r\np. 8\r\n\r\nHAGLEY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., et al. v.\r\nHAGLEY WATER, SEWER and FIRE AUTHORITY, etc., et al.\r\n \r\n  hold the imposition of a charge in exchange for a service does not constitute taxation for constitutional purposes. Accordingly, legislative delegation of authority to impose charges and assessments to an appointed body does not run afoul of the prohibition against taxation without representation. See Soliah v. Cormack, 117 N.W. 125 (N.D. 1908)(legislature had authority to delegate to appointed board of drain commissioners the functions of constructing drains and levying assessments to pay for them).Fn.4 Therefore, the imposition of charges and assessments by the District, an appointed body, does not violate S.C. Constitution art. X, &#167; 5.\r\nIII.\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred by directing a verdict on their cause of action for \"disproportionality.\" They contend charges (presumably those charges to offset the construction costs) should be based upon the lot owners' proportionate share of benefits realized by the installation of the community water and sewer system, rather than front-foot assessments. Consequently, appellants assert charges should be based upon the increase in fair market value of the unbuildable lots and the decrease in the fair market value of their lots as a result of the community water and sewer system. We disagree.\r\nThe legislature has authorized special purpose districts to impose front-foot assessments against property abutting sewer lines. S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 6-11-1210(e). Furthermore, this Court has previously upheld front-foot assessments against properties abutting on water and sewer lines. Hedeman v. Postell, 250 S.C. 515, 159 S.E.2d 230 (1968); Newton v. Hanlon, 248 S.C. 251, 149 S.E.2d 606 (1966). In Newton, the Court held:\r\n\r\n  Assessments for local improvements must be fairly and justly apportioned among those charged with their payment. A method of apportionment, whether by statute or by regulation, that is manifestly arbitrary or discriminatory does not fulfill the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection. But there never has been and probably never can be a perfectly equitable distribution of the tax burden; and statutes or regulations for the apportionment of assessments for local improvements are not to be stricken down merely because they fail to attain the unattainable. All that is required of them by constitutional law\r\n\r\n______________\r\npurposes, and it is not, in the constitutional sense, a tax at all.\" \r\nFn.4 &nbsp; See also 70A Am.Jur.2d. Special or Local Assessments &#167; 8. \"Constitutional limitations upon the power of the legislature to levy taxes do not restrict its power to authorize municipalities to impose special assessments for local improvements. . .\".\r\np. 9\r\n\r\nHAGLEY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., et al. v.\r\nHAGLEY WATER, SEWER and FIRE AUTHORITY, etc., et al.\r\n\r\n  is that they apportion the burden of assessments with approximate equality, upon a reasonable basis of classification, and with due regard to the benefits to the individual property owners and the requirements of the public health, safety or welfare.\r\n\r\nId. S.C. at 263, 149 S.E.2d at 613.\r\nThe record indicates when appellants applied for septic tank permits, they agreed to tie into the community water and sewer system once it became available. In exchange, appellants received permits to construct septic systems while the remaining lot owners were prohibited from obtaining septic permits and developing their property. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for appellants to pay their portion of the cost for the construction of the community water and sewer system.\r\nAlthough appellants may not presently receive as great a benefit from the community water and sewer system as property owners who do not have private water and sanitation facilities, there has never been any requirement that benefits to assessed land be direct or immediate or that there be absolute equality of benefits. Mills Mill, supra. Accordingly, we conclude apportionment of the construction costs for the community water and sewer system by front-foot assessment is fair and reasonable.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\np. 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24600","title":"Gladden v.

The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial judge properly submitted the issue of the existence of a contract to the jury. We find that he did and, accordingly, affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn early 1993, appellant, Columbia Hyundai, Inc. (Gibbes),Fn.1 negotiated with respondent, Carll Hyundai (Carll) to purchase Carll's Hyundai automobile dealership. After several months of negotiations between the parties and their attorneys, and\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.1 &nbsp; George Gibbes was president and sole shareholder of Columbia Hyundai. They are referred to collectively herein as Gibbes.\r\np. 13\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA HYUNDAI, INC. v. CARLL HYUNDAI, INC., et al.\r\n \r\n  numerous revisions to drafts of a proposed contract, Carll submitted an \"Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Assets\" to Gibbes on July 20, 1993. The contract contained a provision to the effect that \"This Agreement may not be amended, changed or modified except by instrument in writing signed by the parties to be charged.\" Paragraph 1(a) of the agreement, concerning the assets to be transferred, reads \"All of Seller's right title and interest in and to all saleable new Hyundai vebicles in existence at the close of business on the last business day before final closing date ....\" Gibbes signed the agreement but added the words \"current year\" such that the agreement now reads \"all saleable current year new Hyundai vehicles.\" Upon receipt of the agreement from Gibbes one week later, Carll advised the \"counter-offer\" was rejected.Fn.2\r\nGibbes instituted this suit for breach of contract and specific performance. The trial judge submitted the issue to the jury which found there was no contract. Gibbes appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the court err in failing to direct a verdict for Gibbes on the ground that, under section 36-2-207 of the South Carolina Uniform Commercial Code, a contract was formed as a matter of law?Fn.3\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGibbes contends a contract was formed as a matter of law under S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 36-2-207 (1976) (hereinafter &#167; 2-207), such that it was entitled to a directed\r\n_______________\r\nFn.2 &nbsp; The dispute of the parties centers on whether this insertion merely relieved Gibbes of the obligation to purchase any 1992 new vehicles or, as Carll testified, whether insertion of the term \"current year\" could be interpreted to render Gibbes liable for only 1993 or 1994 new vehicles, but not both. The alteration was critical to Carll as it planned to finance $600,000.00 in new vehicles for Gibbes until such time as Gibbes was approved as a Hyundai dealer. If Gibbes was not obligated to purchase the 1994 vehicles, Carll could be forced to sell them for a reduced price, as it would no longer be an \"authorized Hyundai dealer.\" Fn.3 &nbsp; Carll contends section 2-207 is inapplicable as the sale of a business does not involve \"goods.\" This contention was not specifically raised to the trial judge and is therefore not preserved. Cook v. S.C.D.H.P.T., 309 S.C. 179, 420 S.E.2d 847 (1992) (issue must be raised to and ruled on by trial court to be preserved for appeal). In any event, although there is a split of authority, the majority view is that the sale of a business is treated as the sale of \"goods\" under the UCC. See Annotation, 4 A.L.R.4th 912; White and Summers, Uniform Commercial Code &#167; 1-2 at p. 5 (4th Ed. 1995).\r\np. 14\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA HYUNDAI, INC. v. CARLL HYUNDAI, INC., et al.\r\n \r\n  verdict. Under the facts of this case, we find the trial judge properly submitted the issue of the existence of a contract to the jury.\r\nAt common law, a purported acceptance containing terms which did not \"mirror\" those of the offer operated as a rejection thereof and amounted to a counteroffer. Sossamon v. Littlejohn, 241 S.C. 478, 129 S.E.2d 124 (1963). S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 36-2-207 was designed to abrogate the rather severe consequences of the \"mirror image\" rule.Fn.4 Mace Industries, Inc. v. Paddock Pool Equip. Co., Inc., 288 S.C. 65, 339 S.E.2d 527 (1986). It provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.\r\n  (2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:\r\n  \r\n    (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;\r\n    (b) they materially alter it; or\r\n    (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAdoption of &#167; 2-207 resulted from what is commonly known as \"the battle of the forms\" in which parties exchange preprinted, standardized forms to finalize their bargain, which forms tend to use \"boilerplate language\" and omit material terms. Weisz Graphics Division v. Peck Industries, Inc., 304 S.C. 101, 403 S.E.2d 146 (1991). See also Official Comment 1 to &#167; 36-2-207(typical situation covered by section 2-207 involves memoranda or acknowledgement confirming oral agreement or letter intended as confirmation of agreement which adds further minor suggestions or\r\n_______________\r\nFn.4 &nbsp; Notwithstanding the beneficient intentions s=ounding adoption of section 2-207, it has been the subject of much criticism and has been recognized by numerous commentators as \"chaotic.\" See, e.g., Murray, The Chaos of the \"Battle of the Forms\": Solutions, 39 Vand.

Jordan Intern. Co., 552 F.2d 1228 (7th Cir. 1977)(in battle of forms, each party typically has printed form drafted by his attorney, containing as many terms favorable to him/her as may be envisioned).\r\nHowever, there are some situations which simply do not warrant application of &#167; 2-207. It has been noted by Professors White and Summers that in the case of non-form agreements, there is no pattern of exchange of printed forms. Under such circumstances, when the parties fully negotiate each provision of a contract, a contract may be \"beyond the reach of 2-207 and adrift on the murky sea of common law.\" White and Summers, &#167; 1-3 at p. 29. See also Brown, supra at p. 943 (concluding section 2-207 is inapplicable if no form is used or if the disputed term was the subject of precontract negotiation). We find the present case presents such a situation. The parties met and negotiated the provisions of their contract, through their attorneys, for several months. They exchanged at least four draft proposals, making numerous changes. The contract specifically contained a negotiated provision to the effect that it could not be amended or changed except by instrument in writing signed by the parties.\r\nUnder the limited factual circumstances presented here, we find this is simply not a \"battle of the forms\" case; on the contrary, this was merely one more in a series of contract negotiations. Accordingly, we find section 2-207 inapplicable to the present facts. Therefore, we find the matter of the existence of a contract was properly submitted to the jury.Fn.5 Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 382 S.E.2d 891 (1989) (South Carolina common law requires that, in order to have a valid and enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement).\r\nThe judgment below is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.5 &nbsp; The trial court charged the jury concerning the common law of contract formation and meeting of the minds.\r\np. 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24602","title":"Davis v.

NATIONSCREDIT FINANCIAL SERVICES, CORP., et al.\r\n \r\n  FACTS\r\nThis action arises out of a mortgage loan transaction in which Plaintiff Mary Davis (\"Davis\") contends Defendants NationsCredit Financial Services Corporation and NationsBank Corporation (collectively \"Lender\") failed to follow several provisions of the South Carolina Consumer Protection Code, particularly S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-10-102 (1989). Davis attempts to bring this matter as a class action.\r\nDavis and Lender entered into a mortgage loan transaction in May 1994 in which Davis sought and received financing from Lender to consolidate various consumer debts. In connection with Lender's loan of approximately $20,000, Davis provided Lender with a mortgage on her Columbia, South Carolina residence. Davis received an attorney and hazard insurance preference statement contemporaneously with her credit application, but the statement was on a separate piece of paper and was not part of, or included on, the first page of the credit application. In providing Plaintiff with a preference statement contained in a separate document, Lender relied on Administrative Interpretation 10.102(a)-8302, issued by the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs on October 11, 1983.\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS\r\n1. In a loan secured by real estate and obtained by a borrower primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, is it a violation of S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-10-102 for a lender to use a separate piece of paper to ascertain a borrower's preferences of legal counsel and hazard insurance, rather than including a preference statement on the first page of the credit application?\r\n2. If using a separate piece of paper to ascertain a borrower's preference of legal counsel and hazard insurance is a violation of S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-10-102, does S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-6-506(3) prevent the imposition of penalties, assuming that the practice conforms with Administrative Interpretation No. 10.102(a)-8302?\r\n3. Does S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-6-506(3) prevent the imposition of penalties for a violation of S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-10-102 even though penalties are specifically provided for in other provisions of the Code, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-10-105 and 37-5-202?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSection 37-10-102 states in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  Whenever the primary purpose of a loan that is secured in whole or in part by a lien on real estate is for a personal, family or household\r\n\r\np. 18\r\n\r\nDAVIS v. NATIONSCREDIT FINANCIAL SERVICES, CORP., et al.\r\n\r\n  purpose . . .[t]he creditor must ascertain the preference of the borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed to represent the debtor in all matters of the transaction relating to the closing of the transaction and . . . the insurance agent to furnish required hazard and flood property insurance in connection with the mortgage and comply with such preference, and the credit application on the first page thereof must contain information as is necessary to ascertain these preferences of the borrower.Fn.1\r\n\r\nDavis argues that it is a violation of section 37-10-102 for a lender to use a separate piece of paper to ascertain a borrower's preferences of legal counsel and hazard insurance, rather than including a preference statement on the first page of the credit application. We disagree.\r\nWhen interpreting a statute, the Supreme Court's primary function is to ascertain the intention of the Legislature. Plowman v. Bagnal, 316 S.C. 283, 450 S.E.2d 36 (1994). A statutory provision should be given a reasonable construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the statute. Jackson v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 447 S.E.2d 859 (1994). Section 37-1-102, which sets forth the purposes of the South Carolina Consumer Protection Code, declares that it shall be\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.1 &nbsp; Section 37-10-102 has been amended by 1996 S.C. Acts No. 355, &#167; 1 and states in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The creditor must ascertain prior to closing the preference of the borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed to represent the debtor in all matters of the transaction relating to the closing and . . .the insurance agent to furnish required hazard and flood property insurance in connection with the mortgage and comply with such preference.\r\n  \r\n    The creditor may comply with this section by:\r\n    (1) including the preference information on or with the credit application so that this information shall be provided on a form substantially similar to a form distributed by the administrator; or\r\n    (2) providing written notice to the borrower of the preference information with the notice being delivered or mailed no later than three business days after the application is received or prepared. If a creditor uses a preference notice form substantially similar to a form distributed by the administrator, the form is in compliance with this section.\r\n  \r\n\r\np. 19\r\n\r\nDAVIS v. NATIONSCREDIT FINANCIAL SERVICES, CORP., et al.\r\n \r\n  liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies. S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-1-102(l)(1989). One of the primary purposes of the Consumer Protection Code is to \"protect consumer buyers, lessees, and borrowers against unifair practices by some suppliers of consumer credit, having due regard for the interests of legitimate and scrupulous creditors.\" S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-1-102(2)(d).\r\nWe find that the intention of the Legislature in crafting section 37-10-102 was to protect borrowers by requiring in the credit application clear and prominent disclosure of the information necessary to ascertain the borrower's preference as to the legal counsel employed to represent the debtor in all matters relating to the closing of the transaction, and the borrower's preference as to the insurance agent to furnish required hazard and flood property insurance in connection with the mortgage. Although a lender technically deviates from the literal language of section 37-10-102 by not ascertaining the attorney and insurance agent preferences through information contained on the first page of the application, we conclude that a lender substantially complies with section 37-10-102 if the borrower receives a clear and prominent disclosure of the statutorily required information. See Jordan v. Tadlock, 223 S.C. 326, 75 S.E.2d 691 (1953)(substantial compliance with statute was sufficient).\r\nIt would elevate form over substance to hold to the contrary. The facts certified to us declare that Davis received an attorney and hazard insurance preference statement \"contemporaneously with her credit application.\" Although not part of the record, a copy of the statement indicating her preferences in this transaction has been included by Davis herself as an appendix to her brief. Thus, we find that the purpose of the statute -- clear and prominent disclosure of the information necessary to ascertain the relevant preferences -- has been satisfied.\r\nThe approach of not elevating form over substance in consumer protection cases has its basis in our decision in General Motors Acceptance Corporation v. McMinn, 285 S.C. 67, 328 S.E.2d 472 (1985). In McMinn, this Court considered whether a lender had complied with the Federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1601 et seq., the purpose of which is to assure meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer can shop for credit on an informed basis. See Tuloka Affiliates, Inc. v. Moore, 275 S.C. 199, 268 S.E.2d 293 (1980). The particular issue addressed in the case was whether GMAC had violated Federal Reserve Regulation Z by failing to print the terms \"Finance charge\" and \"annual percentage rate\" more conspicuously. In finding that the terms were conspicuous and within the provisions of Regtilation Z, we adopted the following language in McMinn:\r\n\r\n  In order to avoid such misuse of the Truth in Lending Act, this court will strongly construe its provisions against borrowers who were not misled by a lender's disclosure but merely seek a penalty for finding a technical problem with the loan form which could not have conceivably influenced\r\n\r\np. 20\r\n\r\nDAVIS v. NATIONSCREDIT FINANCIAL SERVICES, CORP., et al.\r\n\r\n  his choice of credit.\r\n\r\nMcMinn, 285 S.C. at 70, 328 S.E.2d at 474. Thus, we find that it is not a violation of S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 37-10-102 for a lender to use a separate piece of paper to ascertain a borrower's preferences of legal counsel and hazard insurance, rather than including a preference statement on the first page of the credit application.\r\nBecause we have answered the first certified question in the negative, we need not answer the latter two questions.\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., WALLER, A.J., and Acting Associate Justices L.

We affirm.\r\np. 3\r\n\r\nHAMITER v. THE RETIREMENT DIVISION OF S.C. BUDGET and CONTROL BOARD, et al.\r\n \r\n  FACTS\r\n Hamiter, a Senate employee, was directly employed by Senator John Lindsay. Upon his death in January 1991, she was notified her employment would terminate on February 1, 1991.\r\nAt the time of termination of her employment, Hamiter was suffering from various illnesses. According to Hamiter, she has been disabled since 1987 due to these medical problems. The Senate does not dispute her disability.\r\nHamiter alleges, upon her inquiry in 1991, Frank Caggiano, the Clerk of the Senate, who supervises all Senate employees, and Jean Padgett, Personnel Director of the Senate, failed to inform her about disability retirement and long-term disability benefits even though both of them were aware of Hamiter's medical problems. Hamiter claims these employees were under a duty to inform her of these benefits when she consulted them about possible benefits.\r\nOn January 22, 1992, Mr. Purvis Collins, Director of the Retirement Division, told Hamiter disability benefits were available; however, she was no longer eligible because she had not applied for the benefits within 90 days of her termination. In 1993, Hamiter consulted an attorney who advised her Mr. Collins could waive the 90 day requirement, and thus, she could receive the benefits. Subsequently, with the help of her attorney, Hamiter was awarded her disability benefits, including retroactive pay. However, Hamiter contends she suffered damages of insurance premiums and medical expenses which would have been avoided had she been enrolled in the State's disability plan.\r\nIn her complaint Hamiter alleges three causes of action: (1) the Senate failed to advise Hamiter, as required by the Retirement Act or as required as trustee of the retirement funds, of the availability of disability retirement benefits: (2) Hamiter requested a judgment declaring she was entitled to her benefits; and (3) the Senate fraudulently withheld information of available benefits. The trial judge granted summary judgment, concluding neither the Senate nor its employees owed Hamiter a duty and her claim was barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial judge properly grant summary judgment in favor of the Senate based on the grounds the Senate owed Hamiter no duty and the statute of limitations had run on her claim?\r\n\r\np. 4\r\n\r\nHAMITER v. THE RETIREMENT DIVISION OF S.C. BUDGET and CONTROL BOARD, et al.\r\n \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\nStandard of Review\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. City of Colurnbia v. ACLU of South Carolina, __ S.C. __, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996). In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\r\nHamiter claims the trial judge erred by granting summary judgment on the ground the Senate and its employees owed her no duty. We disagree.\r\nHamiter alleges the South Carolina Retirement Systems Act, S.C. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 9-1-10 to 9-1-1970 (1986 & Supp. 1996) (the Act), imposes a duty upon the Senate and its employees to advise Hamiter of the availability of disability retirement benefits. The Act contains no language which places a duty upon the Senate as an employer to inform Hamiter of her benefits. The Act only imposes ministerial duties on the Senate. See S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 9-1-1050 (Supp. 1996) (requiring employer to contribute to retirement fund); S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 9-1-1160 (Supp. 1996) (collection of member's contributions); S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 9-1-1170 (Supp. 1996) (collection of employer's contributions).\r\nHamiter further claims the Senate acted as a trustee of her retirement funds, and therefore, owed her a fiduciary duty. We disagree.\r\nA trustee is a person holding legal title to property under an express or implied agreement for the benefit and use of another. Neel v. Clark, 193 S.C. 412, 8 S.E.2d 740 (1940). The Senate retains no control over these funds. Rather, under the Act, the State Budget and Control Board manages these funds. See S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 9-1-20 (1986) (retirement system shall be managed by Board); S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 9-1-210 (1986) (Board shall administer retirement system); S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 9-1-1310 (1986) (Board shall be trustee of funds). Thus, the Senate is not a trustee of these retirement funds and owes Hamiter no fiduciary duty.\r\nHamiter alleges, for the first time on appeal, a claim of negligent misrepresentation. The elements of negligent misrepresentation must be alleged in the complaint. AMA Management Corp. v Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 420 S.E.2d 868 (Ct.\r\np. 5\r\n\r\nHAMITER v. THE RETIREMENT DIVISION OF S.C. BUDGET and CONTROL BOARD, et al.\r\n \r\n  App. 1992). Further, an issue raised for the first time on appeal is barred from review. SSI Medical Services, Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990) (a theory not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge cannot properly be presented to an appellate court).\r\nBecause we affirm on the absence of duty ground, we do not reach the statute of limitations issue.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, JJ., and Acting Associate Justice Marc H.

Sowell, of Sowell, Todd, Laffitte, Beard & Watson, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n \r\n  MOORE, A.J.: This is an appeal of a final accounting between partners and an award of judgment for breach of a fiduciary duty. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant Ott held an option to purchase a tract of land known as Lakewood Estates. Without disclosing his option, Ott approached respondent Corley about providing the capital to purchase the land and \"making some money on it.\" Corley agreed. On March 30, 1979, Ott signed a contract to individually purchase Lakewood Estates including 128 lots, a 34.68 acre lot called the \"pond tract,\" and a water plant, for a purchase price of $171,200. Ott had the property transferred to a third party as trustee in order to conceal this purchase from Corley. That same day, the trustee contracted to convey the property to Ott and Corley \"trading as Lakewood Associates of South Carolina, a general partnership.\" The purchase price was\r\np. 7\r\n\r\nCORLEY v. OTT\r\n \r\n  $198,200 for the same property conveyed earlier that day to Ott but without the 34.68 acre pond tract.\r\nBoth contracts called for annual installment payments on the same day. Each time an installment was paid by the Ott and Corley partnership, Ott received from the trustee the difference between the amount due on his contract and the amount due on the partnership contract. Ott received a total of $27,000 under this arrangement. He also received the 34.68 acre pond tract which was valued at $41,000 at the time of its conveyance to him.\r\nThe parties memorialized their partnership in a written partnership agreement dated September 28, 1979. In 1990, Corley commenced this action for dissolution of the partnership. Sometime during litigation, Corley discovered Ott's purchase contract and amended his complaint to allege a breach of fiduciary duty.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Should Ott's time and labor be credited as capital contributions?\r\n  2. Does the evidence support the trial judge's finding that Ott breached his fiduciary duty?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1. Capital contributions\r\nUpon dissolution of a partnership, the liabilities of the partnership rank in order of payment as follows: third-party debts, debts to partners, return of capital to partners, profits to partners. S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 33-41-1060(2) (Supp. 1996). Ott contends his contributions of time and labor in improving Lakewood Estates should be credited to him as capital contributions.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. &#167; 33-41-510(6) (1990) provides that no partner is entitled to remuneration for acting in the partnership business. Applying this provision of the Uniform Partnership Act, other courts have held that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a partner's services are not considered capital contributions upon dissolution. See, e.g., Schymanski v. Conventz, 674 P.2d 281 (Alaska 1983); Larsen v. Claridge, 23 Ariz. App. 508, 534 P.2d 439 (1975). We adopt this same rule. In this case, there is no evidence of any agreement between the partners that Ott's services should be credited as capital contributions. Accordingly, the trial judge properly refused to credit them as such.\r\np. 8\r\n\r\nCORLEY v. OTT\r\n \r\n  2. Breach of fiduciary duty\r\nThe trial judge found Ott breached his fiduciary duty to Corley by failing to disclose to Corley that he, Ott, had individually purchased Lakewood Estates, including the pond tract, for $27,000 less than the partnership paid on the same day for the same property minus the pond tract. The trial judge found Corley, who provided the capital for the purchase, was damaged in the amount of $27,000, the difference in the purchase price, plus $41,000, the value of the pond tract, for a total of $68,000.\r\nOtt contends he breached no fiduciary duty on March 30, 1979, the date of the purchase contract, because the partnership did not yet exist as evidenced by the written partnership agreement signed September 28, 1979. We disagree.\r\nA partnership may be found to exist by implication from the parties' conduct. Stephens v. Stephens, 213 S.C. 525, 50 S.E.2d 577 (1948); see also Wyman v. Davis, 223 S.C. 172, 74 S.E.2d 694 (1953) (a partnership agreement may be implied and without express intention). On March 30, 1979, Corley and Ott entered into the purchase agreement as \"Lakewood Associates of South Carolina, a general partnership.\" This evidence indicates the partnership was formed, at the latest, concurrently with that transaction on March 30.\r\nFurther, under S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 33-41-540 (1990), a partner must account to the partnership for any benefit from any transaction connected with the formation of the partnership. In this case, Ott's prior undisclosed purchase of the property was intimately connected with the formation of the partnership and purchase of the property on March 30. Accordingly, this evidence supports the trial judge's finding that Ott breached his fiduciary duty as a partner.Fn.1\r\nOtt's remaining arguments are without merit and are affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n_______________ \r\nFn.1 &nbsp; When legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal. Future Group v. Nationsbank, __ S.C. __, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996). An action for breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law and the trial judge's findings of fact will be upheld unless without evidentiary support.

Weatherford, III, of Gaffney, for respondent/appellant.\r\np. 14\r\n\r\nWYATT v. FOWLER, et al.\r\n \r\n  MOORE, A.J.: Respondent/appellant (Wyatt) commenced this action against defendants alleging he was damaged as the result of an unreasonable search and seizure. The jury returned a verdict against appellant/respondent (Sheriff). Sheriff appeals. Wyatt cross-appeals the granting of a directed verdict for claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nWyatt originally brought this action against Sheriff and three deputies. Two of the deputies, Johnny SainFn.1 and William Fowler, entered Wyatt's house while he was asleep at 5:30 p.m. in an attempt to execute an arrest warrant against Allen Parrish. Wyatt heard the deputies and armed himself with a pistol because he thought someone was breaking into his house. Deputy Sain identified himself upon entering the house and drew his weapon when he heard a clicking noise coming from the bedroom. After the deputies again identified themselves, Wyatt came out of the bedroom and produced identification establishing he was not Parrish. The deputies then left. The entire incident lasted eight minutes. Two days earlier, another deputy, Robert Wooten, had stopped at Wyatt's house and asked for Parrish. Wyatt showed him his identification and told Wooten that Parrish's parents lived around the corner. Wooten did not tell anyone at the sheriff's department about this incident.\r\nIn his complaint, Wyatt alleged a state law negligence cause of action and &#167; 1983 civil rights violations claims against the deputies and Sheriff, individually and in their official capacities.Fn.2 Wyatt alleged he suffered humiliation, pain, mental suffering, and anguish. He experienced insomnia for two weeks after the incident and was prescribed sleeping pills ten days after the incident.\r\nThe trial judge granted the deputies directed verdict motions on the state law cause of action and the &#167; 1983 cause of action. The trial judge also granted a directed verdict on the &#167; 1983 cause of action against Sheriff. The only cause of\r\n_______________\r\nFn.1 &nbsp; Sain was never personally served and the trial judge dismissed him. Fn.2 &nbsp; 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 states, in part:\r\n\r\n  Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\r\n\r\np. 15\r\n\r\nWYATT v. FOWLER, et al.\r\n \r\n  action submitted to the jury was a state law negligence cause of action for an unreasonable search and seizure against Sheriff. The jury returned a verdict of $16,000.00 for Wyatt. Sheriff moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new trial, or new trial nisi. The trial judge denied these motions.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1) Did the trial judge err in denying Sheriffs JNOV motion?\r\n  2) Did the trial judge err in granting one of the deputies a directed verdict on the &#167; 1983 claim?\r\n  3) Did the trial court err in granting Sheriff a directed verdict on the &#167; 1983 claim?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1) JNOV motion\r\nSheriff contends the trial judge should have granted him a JNOV on the state law negligence cause of action on the ground Wyatt did not establish Sheriff owed him a legal duty. We agree.\r\nAn essential element in a negligence cause of action is the existence of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Without such a duty, there can be no actionable negligence. Rodgers v. Department of Parole & Comm. Corrections, 320 S.C.253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995). Generally, there is no common law duty to act. An affirmative legal duty, however, may be created by statute, contract, status, property interest, or some other special circumstance. Jenson v. Anderson County Dept. of Social Services, 304 S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (1991). While South Carolina does not have a case on point, other jurisdictions have held the police owe a duty to the public at large and not to any individual. See e.g. Flones v. Dalman, 502 N.W.2d 725 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993); Wimer v. State, 841 P.2d (Idaho Ct. App. 1992). More specifically, the state does not owe its citizens a duty of care to proceed without error when it brings legal action against them. Stephens v. State Dept. of Revenue, 746 P.2d 908, 910 (Alaska 1987). We agree with these jurisdictions and hold Sheriff did not owe Wyatt a duty. Therefore, the trial judge erred in not granting Sheriff a JNOV.\r\n2) Directed verdict for Deputy Fowler on &#167; 1983 claim\r\nWyatt sued the deputies in their official capacities and individually for the &#167; 1983 claims. The trial judge directed a verdict for the deputies, individually and in their official capacities, on the &#167; 1983 action. Wyatt contends the trial judge erred\r\np. 16\r\n\r\nWYATT v. FOWLER, et al.\r\n \r\n  in dismissing the &#167; 1983 claim against Deputy Fowler.\r\nSection 1983 allows for a civil action to recover damages for deprivation of a constitutionally protected right. In Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), the United States Supreme Court held that neither the state, nor a state official acting in an official capacity, are \"persons\" within &#167; 1983. See also Cones v. Nettles, 308 S.C. 109, 417 S.E.2d 523 (1992). In Cones, we specifically held deputies and sheriffs are state officials and therefore not liable in their official capacity under &#167; 1983. Thus, the trial judge correctly directed verdicts as to the &#167; 1983 claim against the deputies in their official capacities.\r\nHowever, in Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991), the United State Supreme Court held state officials sued in their individual capacities are \"persons\" for purposes of &#167; 1983. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in directing a verdict on the &#167; 1983 claim against Deputy Fowler in his individual capacity.\r\n3) Directed verdict for Sheriff on &#167; 1983 claim\r\nWyatt contends the trial judge erred in directing a verdict in favor of Sheriff on the &#167; 1983 cause of action. We disagree. As stated above, a sheriff is not liable in his official capacity under &#167; 1983. Will, supra. See also Cone, supra.\r\nWyatt contends Sheriff's individual liability rests on S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 23-13-10 (1989). This section provides for the appointment and responsibility of the sheriffs and their deputies. The last sentence states: \"The sheriff shall in all cases be answerable for neglect of duty or misconduct in office of any deputy.\" Wyatt contends this state statute renders Sheriff vicariously liable under &#167; 1983. We disagree.\r\nWyatt relies upon Scott v. Vandiver, 476 F.2d 238 (4th Cir. 1973). However, this case and other cases which have held a state law may render an official vicariously liable under &#167; 1983 have been either criticized or overruled. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court effectively overruled it in Monell, supra. In Monell the Supreme Court rejected vicarious liability as a theory of recovery under &#167; 1983. See Westmoreland v. Brown, 883 F.Supp. 67 (E.D.Va. 1995)(declined to apply holding in Scott and held official cannot be held vicariously liable for &#167; 1983 action); McDonald v. Dunning, 760 F.Supp. 1156 (E.D.Va. 1991)(questioning Scott and holding state law cannot render a person vicariously liable under &#167; 1983). In fact, since Scott was decided in 1973, the Fourth Circuit has rejected vicarious liability as a theory of recovery under &#167; 1983. Strickler v. Waters, 989 F.2d 1375 (4th Cir. 1993); Revenue v. Charles County Comm'rs, 882 F.2d 870 (4th Cir. 1989); Fisher v. Washingion Metro. Area Transit Authority, 690 F.2d 1133 (4th Cir. 1982).\r\np. 17\r\n\r\nWYATT v.

Buford Grier, Master-in-Equity\r\n \r\n  Opinion No. 24607 \r\n  Heard March 19, 1997 - Filed April 21, 1997\r\n \r\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n \r\n  David A. White and Sarah B.

Keith Martens, both of Kennedy, Covington, Lobdell & Hickman, L.L.P., of Rock Hill, for respondent.\r\n \r\n  MOORE, A.J.: This case involves the construction of our statutory scheme allowing the distraint of personal property for rent. The master found third-\r\np.19\r\n\r\nTOLEMAC, INC. v. UNITED TRADING, INC., et al.\r\n \r\n  party property on the rented premises was not subject to distraint. We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant Tolemac (Landlord) subleased a warehouse to United Trading, Inc. (Tenant). When Tenant's rent was in arrears for $41,666, Landlord commenced this action for collection of rent by distraint pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 27-39-210 (1991). Under this statutory procedure, a landlord obtains a distress warrant from a magistrate after a predistress hearing. An officer then enforces the distress warrant by seizing property located on the rented premise. If the tenant fails to pay rent or post bond, the property seized from the rented premises is sold at public auction to satisfy the rent. S.C. Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 27-39-220 to -320 (1991).\r\nOn the rented premises at the time Landlord instituted this proceeding was cotton baling equipment owned by respondent TRP Cotton, Inc. (TRP). TRP filed a motion requesting release of its property on the grounds that (1) a landlord has no right to distrain property not owned by his tenant and (2) distraint of third-party property violates substantive due process as provided by the federal constitution. The master found distraint for rent did not apply to third-party property and accordingly did not reach the constitutional issue. Landlord appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSection 27-39-250 provides:\r\n\r\n  Effect of property of others on premises. If any property so distrained is not the property of the tenant, the tenant shall immediately name the owner thereof and inform the officer of the ownership and the officer shall distrain sufficient other property of the tenant to pay the rent and costs. Even though property of the tenant must be first applied to payment of the rent and costs, all property upon the rented premises is subject to distress as herein provided, except property mentioned in &#167; 27-39-230 [personal clothing, food, bedsteads, bedding, and cooking utensils]. If at any time prior to sale as provided in &#167; 27-39-320, the landlord is given or receives written notice containing facts substantiating ownership that some of the distrained property is owned by a third party, the third party must receive notice, as provided in &#167; 27-39-210, and opportunity to be heard, as provided in &#167; 27-39-220, before the distrained property of the third party is subject to sale\r\n\r\np. 20\r\n\r\nTOLEMAC, INC. v. UNITED TRADING, INC., et al.\r\n\r\n  pursuant to &#167; 27-39-320.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). Landlord contends the master's ruling disallowing distraint of third-party property violates the plain language of the statute. We agree.\r\nThe master based his construction of &#167; 27-39-250 on dicta from Frady v. Smith, 247 S.C. 353, 358, 147 S.E.2d 412 (1966), which states that distraint is proper only \"when the property belongs to the tenant in his own right.\" This proposition cited in Frady comes from earlier case law1 interpreting a statutory scheme which at the time included a provision that \"no property shall be seized under a distress warrant ... except such as belongs to the tenant in his own right.\"2 We overrule Frady to the extent it may be read for the proposition that the current distraint statutes apply only to property of the tenant.\r\nContrary to the master's ruling, the plain language of &#167; 27-39-250 specifically provides that \"all property upon the rented premises is subject to distress.\" Further, the statute currently provides that notice and an opportunity to be heard is required \"before the distrained property of the third party is subject to sale.\"3 We hold the master erred in ruling &#167; 27-39-250 does not allow distraint of third-party property on the rented premises.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n_______________\r\n1 &nbsp; See, e.g., Fidelity Trust & Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 158 S.C. 400, 155 S.E. 622 (1930). 2 &nbsp; Civ. C. 1922 &#167; 5285. That statute was repealed in 1946 before Frady was decided. 1946 S.C. Act No. 873, &#167; 50. 3 &nbsp; In 1984, the federal district court considered a case where a stereo loaned to the tenant by a third party was distrained for rent under &#167; 27-39-250. Pettigrew v. Womble, 589 F. Supp. 242 (D.S.C. 1984). The district court held &#167; 27-39-250 violated procedural due process because it allowed seizure of third-party property without notice and an opportunity to be heard. The statute was subsequently amended to provide these procedural safeguards. 1988 S.C.

He was sentenced, respectively, to death, life imprisonment, twenty years' imprisonment, and ten years' imprisonment.1 This appeal consolidates his direct appeal with the mandatory review provisions of S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-25 (1985). We affirm.\r\n_______________ \r\n1 &nbsp; The jury found the statutory aggravating circumstances of burglary and robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.\r\np. 3\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  ISSUES\r\n\r\n  I. Did the trial court err by excluding evidence that Jim Doe was the accomplice referred to in appellant's statement?\r\nII. Did the trial judge err by refusing to instruct the jury on parole eligibility?\r\nIII. Did the trial judge err by allowing excessive victim impact evidence?\r\nIV. Did the trial judge err by allowing television cameras in the courtroom during the sentencing phase of trial?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by prohibiting him from introducing evidence that \"Jim Doe\" was the accomplice referred to in his statement.2 He claims this evidence was not introduced to prove his innocence, but rather in mitigation of punishment. Appellant contends the trial judge's exclusion of this evidence violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.3 We disagree.\r\nDuring the guilt phase of trial, the evidence revealed that on Sunday, May 23, 1993, at approximately 3:00 a.m. the victim's home was broken into, her handbag and white van were stolen, and she was stabbed to death with her own butcher knife. Appellant was arrested later that afternoon. He gave a statement to the police in which he admitted entering the victim's home and stabbing her to keep her quiet. Appellant stated he had an accomplice named \"Jim\" whom he described as 5'7\" tall, 180 pounds, bald-headed, and in his thirties. He stated he met Jim on May 22, 1993, outside of a particular gay bar. In his statement, appellant suggested Jim was the principal of the crimes and stated Jim repeatedly stabbed the victim.\r\nAccording to testimony, the police attempted to locate \"Jim,\" but found no one who matched the description and had been at the named gay bar or in the area on the evening of May 22, 1993. The manager of the bar testified the club is private\r\n_______________ \r\n2 &nbsp; At trial, appellant named a specific individual as his accomplice. We will refer to this individual as \"Jim Doe.\" 3 &nbsp; U.S. CONST. amend. VIII and U.S. CONST. amend. XIV.\r\np. 4\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  and a person must either be a member or be with a member and fill out documentation to enter. He testified appellant was not a member of the club and did not enter the club on May 22, 1993. The manager further testified he patrols the parking lot of the club for vandals and saw no vans in the parking lot on the evening of May 22 or early on May 23. The manager stated he knew of no club member named \"Jim\" who was in his thirties, 5'7\" tall, 180 pounds, and bald-headed.\r\nThe victim's husband and a police officer testified the victim's statements before she died indicated only one person was involved in the assault.\r\nAn individual who rented a room in the same boarding house as appellant, and who was mentioned in appellant's statement, testified he saw appellant around 12:00 a.m. on May 23, 1993, in a white van. He stated appellant had blood on his shirt. The witness asked appellant who owned the van, and was told it belonged to a friend and not to tell anyone about it. The witness testified he did not see anyone else in the van.\r\nAt the close of the State's case, appellant stated he was prepared to introduce testimony regarding the identity of \"Jim.\" The solicitor objected and the trial judge allowed appellant to proffer evidence regarding the identity of \"Jim.\" Appellant explained the purpose of the proffered evidence was to bolster the statement he had given to the police. Noting the proffered evidence only speculated the \"Jim\" in appellant's statement was Jim Doe and the evidence was not inconsistent with appellant's guilt, the trial judge denied appellant's motion to admit evidence that \"Jim\" was Jim Doe.4\r\nAs noted above, appellant now argues the proffered evidence was offered in mitigation of punishment, not to prove his innocence. The trial judge did not rule on this issue. Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for appeal. State v. McWee, __ S.C. __, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996)(a constitutional argument is not preserved for appeal where appellant failed to argue the constitutional basis for his request at trial); State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995)(a party cannot argue one ground below\r\n_______________ \r\n4 &nbsp; The trial judge relied on a line of cases which hold evidence offered by an accused as to another's commission of the crime charged must be limited to facts inconsistent with the accused's guilt and raise a reasonable inference or presumption of his innocence. Evidence which merely casts bare suspicion on another or raises conjectural inference as to his commission of crime is inadmissible. State v. Williams, __ S.C. __, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996); State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. 377, 447 S.E.2d 862 (1994), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 115 S.Ct. 1136, 130 L.Ed.2d 1096 (1995); State v. Parker, 294 S.C. 465, 366 S.E.2d 10 (1988); State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941).\r\np. 5\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  and then argue another ground on appeal).\r\nIn any event, even if appellant had offered the testimony for the purpose of mitigating his sentence, the proffered evidence would still not have been admissible. While the Eighth Amendment prohibits the sentencer in capital cases from being precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any circumstance of the offense, such as the defendant's minor participation, for the purpose of imposing a sentence less than death,5 the evidence offered must still be properly admissible.\r\nHere, appellant proffered the testimony of four witnesses. One witness (\"the bartender\") testified his memory of May 22, 1993, was very weak, but he thought he was probably working as a bartender at a gay club on that evening. (The bartender did not work in the same club mentioned in appellant's statement). The bartender stated he thought on that evening a patron came into the club and later spoke with Jim Doe. The bartender described Jim Doe as 5'6\" to 5'8\" tall, possibly taller, 185 pounds, with medium brown hair, thinning on top. The bartender testified he could not recall whether he had ever seen appellant at the club or whether Jim Doe and appellant ever met at the club.\r\nThe patron testified he went with appellant to the club mentioned by the bartender between April and May 23, 1993, where he \"set up\" appellant with a very tall man (taller than 6'0\") who weighed between 190 and 200 pounds and had a receding hairline. The patron testified he was sure the \"set up\" was not on May 22, 1993, and stated he did not know the man's name. The patron testified he knew one man named \"Jim\" who was very short, thin, and had a harelip.\r\nThe former manager of this same club testified two days before appellant's trial an investigator from the Public Defender's Office asked him if he knew Jim Doe. The manager stated he knew Jim Doe and described him as 5'10\" tall, 210 pounds, with a receding hairline. The manager offered no testimony indicating he had ever seen Jim Doe with appellant.\r\nOver the solicitor's objection and contrary to the bartender's testimony, an investigator with the Public Defender's Office testified the bartender had told him he believed \"Jim\" was Jim Doe and he had seen appellant leave the club on May 22, 1993, with Doe. The investigator stated Doe contacted him. The investigator met with Doe and described him as a white male, approximately 40 years old, about 5'8\" tall, 175-180 pounds, with brown hair, balding in the front. The investigator testified Doe\r\n_______________ \r\n5 &nbsp; See, Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986), Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976).\r\np. 6\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  denied knowing appellant. Appellant did not call Doe as a witness. Appellant did not testify.\r\nThe only proffered evidence which places appellant with Jim Doe at any time was the testimony from the investigator.6 However, this testimony impeached that of appellant's other witness, the bartender, and was, therefore, inadmissible. State v. Anderson, 304 S.C. 551, 406 S.E.2d 152 (1991)(a party must vouch for its own witness and may not impeach its witness unless the witness is declared hostile upon a showing of actual surprise and harm).7 Accordingly, while appellant was entitled to offer in mitigation evidence that he was only a minor participant in the murder, he produced no relevant, admissible evidence which indicated Jim Doe was with him on the morning of the murder and was the accomplice referred to in his statement.8.\r\nII.\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury on parole eligibility after the solicitor argued his future dangerousness to the jury. We disagree.\r\nAt the close of the sentencing phase, appellant requested the trial Judge instruct the jury if it did not recommend a sentence of death but found a statutory\r\n_______________ \r\n6 &nbsp; Appellant's identification of a male with the common name \"Jim\" and with ordinary characteristics which fit the description of \"Jim\" in appellant's statement is, alone, not relevant evidence in mitigation. At issue was whether appellant actually knew Jim Doe and whether Jim Doe could have been the accomplice to the murder. State v. McWee, supra (evidence is relevant if it tends to make a fact in issue more or less probable). 7 &nbsp; Under Rule 607, SCRE, which became effective approximately six months after appellant's trial, a party may attack the credibility of its own witness. 8 &nbsp; Based on appellant's statement to the police, the court instructed the jury on mere presence, accomplice liability, and \"the hand of one is the hand of all\" during the guilt phase of trial. During the sentencing phase, the trial judge instructed the jury it must focus on appellant's own personal culpability in determining the appropriate sentence and could not impose the death penalty unless the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt appellant personally killed the victim or else personally intended that a killing take place or lethal force be used. Further, the trial judge instructed the jury it could consider in mitigation circumstances such as the defendant was an accomplice in the murder committed by another and his participation was relatively minor, and the defendant acted under duress or the domination of another person. See, S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(b)(4) and (5)(Supp. 1995).\r\np. 7\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  aggravating circumstance, appellant would be ineligible for parole for thirty years, and if the jury did not find a statutory aggravating circumstance, appellant would be ineligible for parole for twenty years. The trial judge denied appellant's request and stated he would give the \"plain meaning charge\" on the terms \"life imprisonment\" and \"death penalty.\"\r\nThe State concedes the prosecution focused upon appellant's future dangerousness during portions of its closing argument.\r\nSince appellant was eligible for parole if a life sentence was imposed, he was not entitled to a charge on parole eligibility.9 Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994); State v. Williams, supra; State v. McWee, supra (where the defendant's future dangerousness is at issue and state law prohibits the defendant's release on parole, due process requires the sentencing jury be informed the defendant is ineligible for parole); State v. Tucker, supra.\r\nAppellant further argues the solicitor misled the jury about the conditions of incarceration and the likelihood of his parole and, therefore, the trial judge should have charged the jury on parole eligibility. We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note appellant never stated this argument in support of his requested charge on parole eligibility. Consequently, this issue is not preserved for appeal. State v. McWee, supra.\r\nIn any event, during closing, the solicitor argued as follows:\r\n\r\n  There is only one sentence that will ensure that [appellant] will never do this to anyone again. Anyone. That [appellant] will never cause anymore pain, anymore suffering to anyone and you know that one sentence is. It is the only sentence that is dispositive ....\r\nAnything less than death in this case is a victory for this man. It's a victory for him. But, you know, he's already had one victory in this case. He had the victory over that defenseless woman the night this took place. Don't give him another victory.\r\n\r\nThis argument does not refer to the conditions of appellant's incarceration or the likelihood of his parole. Accordingly, the trial judge properly refused to instruct the jury on parole eligibility.\r\n_______________ \r\n9 &nbsp; See, S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1995).\r\np. 8\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  III.\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment due process clause by allowing excessive victim impact evidence and an improper reference to this testimony during the solicitor's closing argument. Appellant asserts this was error because the State failed to provide adequate notice of the particular victim impact evidence it intended to use as required by S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-20(B) (Supp. 1995). We disagree.\r\nPrior to trial, appellant filed a Motion for More Definite Statement of Evidence in Aggravation. Attached to this motion was the solicitor's letter of February 7, 1995, in which he notified appellant, pursuant to Section 16-3-20(B), of the four categories of aggravating evidence he intended to introduce. The fourth of these categories stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  4. Any and all evidence concerning the \"Victim Impact\" evidence relating to [the victim's] personal characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on [the victim's] family and school children, pursuant to Payne v. Tennessee, 111 S.Ct. 2597 (1991); State v. Johnson, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991); and Lucas v. Evatt, 416 S.E.2d 646 (1992).\r\n\r\nAppellant also filed a Motion to Bar Victim Impact Evidence and Statements.\r\nAt the conclusion of the State's case during the guilt phase of trial, appellant moved to prohibit all victim impact testimony. This motion was denied. Thereafter, he moved to limit the victim impact evidence to specific harm and the impact on the victim's family. The solicitor informed appellant he would be offering testimony from the victim's teacher assistant, a parent of one of the victim's emotionally handicapped students, the victim's sister, and the victim's husband, and he stated the purpose for each of these witnesses' testimony. At the beginning of the sentencing phase, the trial judge ruled the notice provided was adequate under Section 16-3-20(B).\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, the solicitor offered the four witnesses he had previously stated he would present. Betty Satterfield, the teacher's assistant, testified the victim was a wonderful teacher of emotionally handicapped children and the victim's students were devastated to learn of their teacher's death. Vickie Wells, a parent of one of the victim's students, testified the victim had a positive impact upon her son. The victim's sister testified about the effect of the victim's death upon herself and the victim's three children. The victim's husband also testified about the impact of his wife's death on their children. Appellant did not object to any of this testimony.\r\np. 9\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  Pursuant to Section 16-3-20(B)10 the State was not required to provide appellant with notice it intended to introduce victim impact testimony. State v. Humphries, Op. No. 24562 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed December 9, 1996) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 33 at 10)(victim impact evidence is not evidence in aggravation and, therefore, the State is not required to notify a defendant pursuant to Section 16-3-20(B) it intends to present victim impact evidence). Accordingly, there was no error.\r\nIn any event, by the solicitor's letter of February 7, 1995, appellant was provided with notice of the victim impact evidence the State intended to introduce.11 The notice informed appellant the State would introduce evidence of the victim's personal characteristics and the impact of her death on her family and students. This is exactly the evidence the State presented at trial.\r\nFinally, appellant expressed no objection to any portion of the witnesses' testimony. Accordingly, whether their testimony was excessive or unduly prejudicial is not preserved for review. State v. Tucker, supra (where appellant did not object to victim impact evidence as excessive and unrestricted at trial, the argument was not preserved for review).\r\nIn any case, the victim impact evidence which was introduced showed the specific harm committed by appellant in murdering the victim. This testimony was relevant for the jury to meaningfully assess appellant's moral culpability and blameworthiness and not so unduly prejudicial as to render appellant's trial fundamentally unfair. Therefore, the victim impact evidence did not violate appellant's rights under the Eighth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment due process clause. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991)(Eighth Amendment did not establish a per se bar prohibiting the jury from considering or the solicitor from arguing victim impact); Riddle v.

BYRAM\r\n \r\n  IV.\r\nPrior to trial, appellant moved to exclude the television media from the courtroom. He argued the video media was sensationalizing the trial. The trial judge held he had no discretion to exclude the television media without excluding other forms of media.\r\nAppellant now argues the trial judge erred by permitting television cameras in the courtroom during sentencing because the television publicity affected the witnesses who wanted a reasonable degree of privacy, placed extraneous pressure on the jury in making its sentencing decision, and prevented him from receiving a fair sentencing determination. We disagree.\r\nAppellant's argument was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial judge. Accordingly, it is not preserved for appellate review. State v. Tucker, supra.\r\nIn any event, the trial judge erroneously concluded he had no authority to prohibit the television media from filming appellant's trial. Under Rule 605(b)(3), SCACR, the presiding judge has full discretion to \"refuse, limit, or terminate media coverage of an entire case, portions thereof, or testimony of particular witnesses as may be required in the interests of justice.\" See also In the Matter of Decker, __ S.C. __, 471 S.E.2d 462 (1995)(the press may constitutionally be prohibited from publishing information about trials if necessary to assure a fair trial by an impartial tribunal). Rule 605 implicitly authorizes the trial judge to preclude trial coverage by a particular media when the interests of justice so require.\r\nNonetheless, despite the trial judge's erroneous conclusion, there is no evidence appellant was prejudiced by having television cameras in the courtroom during the sentencing phase of trial.12 None of the witnesses during the sentencing phase requested privacy in presenting their testimony. Further, the trial judge prohibited the press from photogaphing or recording the jury and from disseminating the jurors' names. The trial judge informed the jury venire they would not be photographed or televised. Additionally, in charging the jury during the sentencing phase, the trial judge instructed the jury it could not be governed by public opinion or any other arbitrary factor in determining appellant's sentence. Accordingly, any error was harmless. State v. McWee, supra (error which does not result in prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\n_______________ \r\n12 &nbsp; In fact, in referring to his ability to establish prejudice from television coverage of the trial, appellant's counsel stated he was \"well aware of the burden I probably can't reach.\"\r\np. 11\r\n\r\n.STATE v. BYRAM\r\n \r\n  PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the jury's finding of statutory aggravating circumstances is supported by the evidence. See S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 16-3-25 (1985). Further, we hold the death penalty is neither excessive nor disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. See State v. Tucker, Op. No. 24517 (S.C. Sup.

Clary, Judge\r\nOpinion No. 24609 \r\n  Heard January 8, 1997- Filed April 28, 1997\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\nChief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia; and Ray E. Thompson, Jr., of Spartanburg, for appellant.\r\nAttorney General Charles Molony Condon, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Robert F. Daley, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Holman C. Gossett, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n \r\n  FINNEY, C.J.: Appellant was convicted of murder and received a life sentence. He raises several issues on appeal, including a claim that the State unconstitutionally intimidated a potential defense witness, causing the witness to refuse to be interviewed by appellant's counsel. We find appellant has established prejudicial error on this ground, and reverse and remand.\r\nThe State's theory was that appellant was the driver of a van from which shots were fired into a church parking lot following a heated basketball game. There is no contention appellant actually fired the shots. A coach of one of the basketball teams was the victim. The evidence tended to show that the fatal shot was fired out of the driver's window of the van, which had been rolled down, while the van cruised by slowly with its headlights off. Following the shooting, the van careened through several neighborhoods, hitting several cars, before being\r\np. 13\r\n\r\nSTATE v. BRAD EDWARD WILLIAMS\r\n \r\n  pulled over. The gun from which the fatal bullet was fired was never found.\r\nMarion Lindsey was a passenger in the van. He was represented by Attorney Johnston, and had negotiated a plea agreement. Appellant's attorney learned from Johnston that Lindsey had given an oral statement to the police in which he stated that at the same time the shooter in the van was firing shots, other shots were being fired by an unknown gun man (or men) outside the van. This information would be exculpatory as to appellant since his liability for murder rested on the fatal shots being fired from the van. Further, while several witnesses heard shots being fired in the area after the game, only one other witness1 would testify he heard the other shots fired contemporaneously with those fired from the van. Lindsey did not testify at appellant's trial.\r\nAt trial, appellant alleged that the State had unconstitutionally interfered with his due process right to establish his defense by intimidating Lindsey from speaking to appellant's counsel. See Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95 (1972). The circuit court conducted an in camera hearing. At this hearing, appellant's attorney testified Attorney Johnston agreed to allow appellant's attorney to interview Lindsey, conditioned on informing the solicitor's office of the meeting, which the attorney did by letter dated April 11. An investigator (McGraw) for the solicitor's office called appellant's attorney on April 13, the day before the scheduled interview, and told him \"that it would be improper for me to interview Marion Lindsey and that the Solicitor's Office would not allow the interview.\" This statement is uncontradicted in the record since the State failed to call Investigator McGraw at the hearing.\r\nAttorney Johnston testified that he conditioned appellant's interview of Lindsey on the \"permission\" of the Solicitor's Office. He testified that Assistant Solicitor Mabry spoke to him and \"expressed disapproval\" of the planned interview, and told Attorney Johnston it would not be in Lindsey's \"best interest\" to allow him to be interviewed by defense counsel. Attorney Johnston perceived from Mabry's comments that allowing the interview to go forward could jeopardize the plea offer, and communicated this \"implication\" to Lindsey and his mother,2 who then declined to speak with appellant's attorney. A lawyer who was representing a third codefendant, and who had hoped to interview Lindsey along with appellant's attorney, testified and supported the testimony of appellant's attorney and Attorney Johnston.\r\n_______________\r\n1 &nbsp; Codefendant Moore, discussed infra. 2 &nbsp; Lindsey was a juvenile, and his plea agreement involved reduced charges in family court.\r\np. 14\r\n\r\nSTATE v. BRAD EDWARD WILLIAMS\r\n \r\n  Assistant Solicitor Mabry said that while he told Attorney Johnston that he could not tell his client not to talk to another attorney,3 he did tell him he believed it was not in his client's \"best interest\" to talk to another defendant's attorney because that attorney might \"shake him up\" and cause Lindsey not to cooperate and therefore lose his deal. He admitted telling Attorney Johnston that he did not want Lindsey to go through with the interview.\r\nThe trial judge ruled that he understood \"from the testimony and evidence and questions by the Court that Mr. Johnston did not in anyway feel that the State prevented this witness from being interviewed or talking with anyone else. But that it was a decision made by the two of them that it would be in his best interest not to testify, but the ultimate decision [sic], or to be interviewed, but the ultimate decision of an individual as to whether or not they talk with a defense attorney or anyone else is made by them.\" The findings of the circuit court are binding on this Court unless unsupported by the evidence or clearly wrong, or controlled by an error of law. State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341 (1994). We agree that the evidence shows that the decision not to talk to appellant's counsel was made by Lindsey, but that finding is not dispositive of the issue raised by the appellant: whether that decision was influenced by improper governmental interference? On this point, we find the only evidence in the record shows improper interference.\r\n\"Improper intimidation of a witness may violate a defendant's due process right to present his defense witnesses freely if the intimidation amounts to 'substantial government interference with a defense witness' free and unhampered choice to testify.\"' United States v. Saunders, 943 F.2d 388, 392 (4th Cir. 1991)(citations omitted). Generally, courts have found unconstitutional intimidation where the government has advised a potential defense witness that it would not be in his \"best interest\" to talk to the defendant or his attorney. See, e.g., United States v. Terzado-Madruga, 897 F.2d 1099 (llth Cir. 1990)(error cured by subsequent governmental advice that witness was free to talk to defense); United States v. Wellman, 830 F.2d 1453 (7th Cir. 1987)(while \"best interest\" advice susceptible of construction as veiled threat, where witness none-the-less gave statement to defense, no reversible error occurred). Where substantial interference is found, the next issue is whether the error can be deemed harrnless. United States v. Saunders, supra. The rule in the Fourth Circuit appears to be that governmental intimidation can be deemed harniless error where the witness nonetheless testifies. Compare United States v. Teague, 737 F.2d 378 (4th Cir. 1984)(harmless where defendant was not denied either all or the helpful part of the witness' testimony as a result of the attempted intimidation) with United States v. MacCloskey, 682 F.2d 468 (4th Cir. 1982). Under this rule, the intimidation in this case could not be deemed harmless. We decline, however, to adopt such an automatic reversal rule and hold that in order\r\n_______________ \r\n3 &nbsp; Attorney Johnston testified he did not recall these words being said.\r\np. 15\r\n\r\nSTATE v. BRAD EDWARD WILLIAMS\r\n \r\n  to obtain relief, a defendant must demonstrate both substantial interference and prejudice.\r\nIn brief, the State essentially admits improper conduct occurred, but asserts three grounds why \"the present case presents a weaker case for government overreaching\" than others, and why the conduct can therefore be deemed harmless error. First, there was one witness (out of many) who testified directly that the victim was killed by a bullet fired from the van. The testimony of this single lay witness, whose testimony is unsupported by any forensic evidence, does not make this an overwhelming evidence situation. Second, the State asserts Lindsey's testimony would have been merely cumulative to that of other witnesses, his codefendants Juan Moore and Ernest Williams. Juan Moore, however, was impeached by the fact his current description of the event, including the testimony that he heard simultaneous shooting, was not consistent with his original statement. He was further impeached by evidence that his statement had changed to exonerate appellant and his codefendants only after he was incarcerated with them. We do not find Moore's impeached testimony renders the exclusion of Lindsey's harmless error. Further, contrary to the State's assertion, Williams testified that after the shots were fired from the van towards the parking lot, some shots were fired back from the lot towards the street. Obviously, Williams \"after the fact\" testimony cannot be equated with Lindsey's \"simultaneous shooting\" evidence.\r\nThird, the State asks the Court to take judicial notice of Lindsey's testimony in the shooter's case, currently on appeal to this Court. The State alleges Lindsey's testimony in that case was consistent with codefendants Moore and William's testimony at appellant's trial that the shots were fired at the same time as the shots fired from the van. This contention bolsters appellant's claim of prejudice. As noted above Williams did not testify that there was a \"simultaneous shooter,\" and Lindsey, unlike Moore, was not impeached. In short, we do not deem the improper intimidation harmless.\r\nThe remedy to be afforded a defendant in this situation is determined by the facts and circumstances of each case, depending on the prejudice suffered by the defendant. State v. Melvin, 388 S.E.2d 72 (N.C. 1990). Under the circumstances here, we find the proper remedy is a reversal of appellant's conviction, and a remand for a new trial. Appellant now knows what Lindsey's testimony would be, and can use the transcript from the shooter's case if Lindsey is unavailable to testify at appellant's retrial. Even if Lindsey does not testify, the knowledge of what his testimony would be will unquestionably aid appellant in formulating his trial strategy. See United States v. Opager, 589 F.2d 799,804 (5th Cir. 1979) (subsequent history omitted)(\"The importance to a litigant of interviewing potential witnesses is undeniable. In particular in criminal cases, where a defendant's very liberty is at stake, such interviews are especially crucial\").\r\np. 16\r\n\r\nSTATE v. BRAD EDWARD WILLIAMS\r\n \r\n  In light of our ruling on this issue, we need reach only one other claim raised by appellant. As noted above, the evidence showed that after the van left the church area, it crashed into several cars and traveled for several more miles before being stopped by police officers. Prior to this murder trial, appellant pled guilty in municipal court to leaving the scene of an accident, and received a thirty day sentence. At this trial, he moved to dismiss the murder charge alleging this prosecution was barred by double jeopardy. This argument was properly rejected by the trial judge. Double jeopardy is not implicated where, as here, the charges arise from different unlawful acts. e.g., State v. Clarke, 302 S.C. 423, 396 S.E.2d 827 (1990). Accordingly, this matter is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\np. 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24610","title":"State v.

Whetstone, Jr., Judge\r\n \r\n  Opinion No. 24610 \r\n  Heard December 3, 1996 - Filed April 28, 1997\r\n \r\n  AFFIRMED\r\n \r\n  Chief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n \r\n  Attorney General Charles Molony Condon, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, both of the Attorney General's Office, of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n \r\n  Burnett, A.J.: Appellant was convicted by a verdict of guilty but mentally ill of first degree burglary and murder. He appeals his conviction on the grounds the guilty but mentally ill verdict and statute, S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 17-24-20 (Supp. 1995), are unconstitutional. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was indicted on charges of first degree burglary and murder. He entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. A jury convicted appellant by\r\np. 18\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HORNSBY\r\n \r\n  verdicts of guilty but mentally ill on each charge and he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life in prison.\r\nAppellant contends the guilty but mentally ill statute, S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 17-24-20 (Supp. 1995) (GBMI statute), is unconstitutional. In support of his contention, appellant offered the testimony of Dr. DeWitt and Dr. Morgan, both experts in forensic psychiatry. According to these experts, all prisoners, whether found guilty or guilty but mentally ill, are afforded the same initial mandatory evaluation by the Department of Corrections. In Dr. Morgan's opinion, defendants receiving a GBMI verdict receive no benefit over defendants found guilty. In fact, he concluded the GBMI verdict attaches a \"stigma\" to a prisoner. The trial court held the GBMI statute was constitutional.\r\nIn his brief, appellant further argues (1) the GBMI statute and verdict are unconstitutional because they impinge on his right to a fair trial by allowing the jury to think a GBMI verdict is a lesser verdict with a different mens rea than a guilty verdict; (2) the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury on the sentencing consequences and the mens rea requirement of a GBMI verdict; and (3) the GBMI verdict distracts the jury and leads to compromise verdicts.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in holding the guilty but mentally ill statute, S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 17-24-20 (Supp. 1995), and verdict constitutional?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant claims the GBMI statute and verdict violate his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, appellant argues a GBMI inmate receives \"no benefit\" from the verdict because other mentally ill inmates who are found guilty also receive necessary psychiatric treatment and the GBMI verdict attaches a \"stigma\" to these inmates causing them to serve longer prison sentences.1 We disagree.\r\n_______________ \r\n1 &nbsp; At trial, appellant asserted the GBMI statute also violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and it constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Appellant makes no reference to these arguments in his appellate brief Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (issues which are not argued in brief are deemed abandoned and preclude consideration on appeal).\r\np. 19\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HORNSBY\r\n \r\n  When a statute is challenged under the Due Process Clause, this Court only requires the act to be reasonably designed to accomplish its purposes, unless some fundamental right or suspect class is implicated. See Walker v. SCDHPT,320 S.C. 496 446 S.E.2d 346 (1995); People v. Smith, 465 N.E.2d 101 (Ill. Ct. App. 1984) (finding the GBMI statute constitutional under the Due Process Clause). The burden of showing a statute is unreasonable falls on the one who attacks it. See State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888 (1994) (burden on challenger to prove statute violates Equal Protection Clause); Commonwealth v. Trill, 543 A.2d 1106 (Pa. Super. 1988) (burden of persuasion falls on party seeking to rebut presumption of constitutionality). Further, when this Court considers the constitutionality of a statute passed by the General Assembly, it construes the statute so as to render it valid if possible. University of South Carolina v. Mehlman, 245 S.C. 180, 139 S.E.2d 771 (1964). A legislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless its repugnance to the constitution is clear and beyond reasonable doubt. Id. Every presumption is made in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment. Id.\r\nThe purposes for the enactment of GBMI statutes are (1) to reduce the number of defendants being completely relieved of criminal responsibility and (2) to insure mentally ill inmates receive treatment for their benefit as well as society's benefit while incarcerated. State v. Wilson, 306, S.C. 498, 413 S.E.2d 19 (1992). A verdict of GBMI does not absolve a defendant of guilt. A defendant found GBMI must be sentenced as provided by law for a defendant found guilty. Id. However, under the GBMI statute, a defendant found GBMI is entitled to immediate treatment and evaluation. S.C. Code A-nn. &#167; 17-24-70 (Supp. 1995).\r\n The GBMI statute is rationally designed to accomplish the two purposes set forth above.2 The GBMI statute simply recognizes the continuum in the law regarding mental illness and provides a guide for a jury when considering whether a defendant is not guilty; not guilty by reason of insanity (incapable of determining right from wrong); guilty but mentally ill (incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law but capable of distinguishing right from wrong); or guilty (suffers no mental illness). Further, a conviction of GBMI provides a signal to the\r\n_______________ \r\n2 &nbsp; Appellant properly does not claim a suspect class or fundamental right are implicated by the GBMI statute. Mental illness is not a suspect class. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). Further, because appellant has been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a judicial proceeding, his liberty interests have been curtailed. Thus, no fundamental right is involved. See also Commonwealth v. Trill, supra (a challenge to the GBMI verdict does not implicate a fundamental right or suspect class); People v. McLeod, 288 N.W.2d 909 (Mich. 1980) (finding no fundamental right or suspect class).\r\np. 20\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HORNSBY\r\n \r\n  Department of Corrections that a new prisoner may have a mental illness and should be treated before integrating him into the general prison population. We find the purposes of the GBMI statute are reasonably accomplished by the provisions of the statute and there is no due process violation.\r\nFurther, contrary to appellant's assertion, GBMI prisoners do benefit from the GBMI statute in that they are automatically sent to special centers for evaluation and treatment while guilty inmates in need of mental health care are directly integrated into the prison system. See S.C. Code Ann. &#167; 17-24-70 (Supp. 1995). We note the statute was not designed to \"benefit\" GBMI inmates to the exclusion of guilty inmates. Psychiatric care should be available for all inmates, and GBMI inmates should not receive better treatment than guilty inmates. This statute is not rendered a nullity because a defendant found guilty and not mentally ill may also receive mental health treatment. See State v. Neely, 819 P.2d 249 (N.M. 1991) (the reasonableness and legitimacy of the State's purpose is not diminished because all convicted defendants may receive psychiatric care if it is needed); People v. Darden, 346 N.W.2d 915 (Mich. Ct. App. 1984) (rejecting appellant's claim that the GBMI verdict is unconstitutional because a defendant found simply guilty is also entitled to treatment for mental illness).\r\nMoreover, appellant's argument that the GBMI verdict attaches a \"stigma\" to those inmates because their actual time served may be longer is speculative. Appellant offered no evidence on this issue. Dr. Morgan did give an opinion that he thought GBMI inmates serve longer sentences; however, no study had been done on this issue. The possibility of a stigma is not sufficient to hold the statute unconstitutional. See People v. Smith, supra.\r\nOn appeal, appellant argues that since jurors are not informed the same mens rea and sentencing consequences exist under a guilty and a GBMI verdict, jurors are misled to believe GBMI is a lesser verdict than guilty resulting in compromise verdicts. Consequently, appellant maintains the GBMI statute and verdict deprive him of a fair trial, thus violating his due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and his right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment. We disagree.\r\nFirst, while appellant offered in camera expert testimony that there is no difference between mental health treatment for a guilty or GBMI defendant and argued at trial this lack of distinction violated his rights to due process, appellant did not argue that since jurors are not informed the same mens rea and sentencing consequences exist under a guilty and GBMI verdict, jurors are misled to believe GBMI is a lesser verdict than guilty. Accordingly, appellant's current argument is not preserved for appeal. State v. Tucker, 319 S.C.425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995) (a party cannot argue one ground below and then another gound on appeal).\r\np. 21\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HORNSBY\r\n \r\n  In any event, appellant's argument is speculative. Appellant presented no evidence that members of his jury panel thought GBMI was a lesser verdict than guilty or that the GBMI verdict was chosen as a compromise. When polled after rendering the verdict, all members of appellant's panel indicated GBMI was their verdict.\r\nMoreover, we note, at appellant's request, the trial judge instructed the jury on the necessary mens rea for murder. The trial judge specifically told the jury, under insanity, a defendant does not have criminal intent and should be acquitted. The trial judge explained a person who is guilty but mentally ill has the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong or to recognize an act is wrong but lacks capacity to conform his conduct. Based on these instructions, reasonable jurors could only have concluded a defendant must have the same mens rea whether guilty or GBMI, and the lack of mens rea only exists in a finding of insanity. Accordingly, appellant's jurors were not misled to believe GBMI is a lesser verdict than guilty.\r\n Further, appellant did not request the trial judge instruct the jury the sentencing consequences for a guilty or GBMI verdict are the same. Accordingly, he cannot now complain the jury was misled because it thought GBMI is a lesser verdict than guilty. State v. Whipple, Op. No. 24458 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 1, 1996) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 6); Rule 20, SCRCrimP. In any case, the function of a jury is to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty and the consequences of a conviction are of no aid in determining whether the defendant committed the offense. State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 431 S.E.2d 254 (1993).\r\nNonetheless, we have considered the merits of appellant's argument and conclude there was no violation of due process or the right to a fair trial by the GBMI statute and verdict. A denial of due process occurs when a defendant in a criminal trial is denied the fundamental faimess essential to the concept of justice. See 21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law &#167;640 (1981). As discussed above, the GBMI statute and verdict did not deprive appellant of fundamental faimess.\r\nOther jurisdictions have rejected similar claims that the GBMI statute and verdict render the trial unfair and lead to compromise verdicts. See United States v. Weismiller, 815 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir. 1987) (finding the Illinois GBMI statute does not deny a defendant a fair trial); People v. DeWit, 463 N.E.2d 742 (Ill. Ct. App. 1984) (GBMI statute does not violate due process); People v. Ramsey, 375 N.W.2d 297 (Mich. 1985) (verdict is not a compromise because to hold otherwise would require the court to presume jury compromise in every case where more than one verdict or charge is submitted to the jury); State v. Neely, supra (statute did not violate due process requirements); Commonwealth v. Trill, supra (GBMI verdict is constitutional); State v. Baker, 440 N.W.2d 284 (S.D. 1989) (GBMI verdict is not a lesser verdict; instead, by disclosing the full spectrum of criminal responsibility to the jury, the jury better understands the gradation of responsibility in the law and is thereby helped in\r\np. 22\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HORNSBY\r\n \r\n  their assessment of the case). We find these cases persuasive.\r\nWhen, as here, the jury is properly apprised of the legal standards to determine insanity and mental illness, the right to a fair trial is not infringed. The GBMI statute ensures the jury applies the legal definition of insanity correctly by underscoring that a person may be mentally ill, yet not legally insane. Weismiller, supra; Neely, supra. The GBMI verdict clarifies the distinction between a defendant who is not guilty by reason of insanity and one who is mentally ill yet not criminally insane and, therefore, is criminally liable. Although the verdict may complicate a jury's decision, it does not make the inquiry beyond a jury's competence.\r\nThe risk of a compromise is neither greater than nor different from that presented when a jury is instructed on lesser included offenses, which have not been found to create an impermissible risk of jury compromise. See Weismiller, supra; Ramsey, supra. Further, appellant offered no evidence to support his contention that the GBMI verdict encourages a jury to reject a bona fide insanity defense. Weismiller, supra. Thus, it would be speculative for this Court to consider this argument.\r\nBecause we find the GBMI statute and verdict constitutional, appellant's conviction is AFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\np. 23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24611","title":"O'Neal v.

In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent admits that while serving as a municipal court judge, he committed ethical violations. He consents to a public reprimand. We accept respondent's admission and publicly reprimand him.\r\n The misconduct is based on an arrest warrant served on respondent charging him with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. Respondent admits to the allegations in the arrest warrant. Respondent has committed misconduct under Rule 501, SCACR, Code of Judicial Conduct 'Canons 1, 2, and 2(A). Since he no longer holds judicial office, the most severe sanction available is a public reprimand. Matter of Gravely. --- S.C. --- 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996).
