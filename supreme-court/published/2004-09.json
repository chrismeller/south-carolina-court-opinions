Stacey and Assistant Appellate \r\n  Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, \r\n  of Columbia, for appellant.\r\nDeputy Director Teresa A. Knox, Tommy Evans, Jr., and J. \r\n  Benjamin Aplin, all of South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole &amp; \r\n  Pardon Services, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  This is a statutory construction case.Â  The \r\n  sole issue before us is the application ofÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(D) (Supp. \r\n  2003) which determines the sentence for successive revocations of a prisonerâ€™s \r\n  community supervision.Â  We affirm the trial judgeâ€™s reading of the statute and \r\n  the sentence imposed.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant pled guilty to distribution of crack cocaine, second offense, and \r\n  was sentenced to six months imprisonment.Â  He was given credit for two days \r\n  served.Â  After serving five months and two days, he entered a Community Supervision \r\n  Program (CSP) which was to continue for two years.Â  \r\nThis case was commenced when appellantâ€™s supervising \r\n  agent swore out a warrant alleging numerous violations of CSP including failure \r\n  to report, use of controlled substances, failure to maintain employment, and \r\n  failure to pay supervision fees.Â  The trial judge revoked appellantâ€™s CSP and \r\n  sentenced him to five months and seven days.Â  Because this was the second time \r\n  appellantâ€™s CSP was revoked, his sentence was determined under Â§ 24-21-560(D).\r\nAppellant claims Â§ 24-21-560(D) limits his sentence \r\n  for revocation to the remaining time left on his original sentence for the substantive \r\n  crime.Â  His original sentence was six months, of which he served five months \r\n  and two days, and he served three weeks on the prior revocation.Â  Appellant \r\n  contends his revocation sentence therefore should not exceed five days.Â  He \r\n  complains the trial judge erroneously interpreted Â§ 24-21-560(D) to allow a \r\n  revocation sentence that was â€œalmost doubleâ€ his original sentence.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nUnder Â§ 24-21-560(A), participation in CSP is a mandatory condition of release \r\n  for most no-parole offenses. [1] Â  \r\n  Section 24-21-560 further provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(C) If the department determines \r\n  that a prisoner has violated a term of the community supervision program and \r\n  the community supervision should be revoked, a probation agent must initiate \r\n  a proceeding in General Sessions Court.Â  \r\n. . . .\r\nIf the court determines \r\n  that a prisoner has wilfully violated a term or condition of the community supervision \r\n  program, the court may impose any other terms or conditions considered appropriate \r\n  and may continue the prisoner on community supervision, or the court may revoke \r\n  the prisoner's community supervision and impose a sentence of up to one year \r\n  for violation of the community supervision program. . . .\r\n(D) If a prisoner's community supervision is revoked by \r\n  the court and the court imposes a period of incarceration for the revocation, \r\n  the prisoner also must complete a community supervision program of up to two \r\n  years as determined by the department pursuant to subsection (B) when he is \r\n  released from incarceration.\r\nA prisoner who is sentenced for successive revocations of the \r\n  community supervision program may be required to serve terms of incarceration \r\n  for successive revocations, as provided in Section 24-21-560(C), and may be \r\n  required to serve additional periods of community supervision for successive \r\n  revocations, as provided in Section 24-21-560(D).Â  The maximum aggregate \r\n  amount of time the prisoner may be required to serve when sentenced for successive \r\n  revocations may not exceed an amount of time equal to the length of incarceration \r\n  imposed for the original &quot;no parole offense&quot;.Â  The original term \r\n  of incarceration does not include any portion of a suspended sentence.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Appellant contends the underscored language \r\n  means his sentence for revocation can equal only the amount of unserved time \r\n  remaining on his original sentence.Â  This construction of Â§ 24-21-560(D) is \r\n  not supported by a plain reading of the statute.\r\nAlthough a penal statute must be strictly construed \r\n  against the State, when the terms of the statute are clear and unambiguous, \r\n  we are constrained to give them their literal meaning.Â  State v. Blackmon, \r\n  304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991).Â  The words of the statute must be given \r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction \r\n  to limit or expand the statute's operation.Â  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. \r\n  342, 540 S.E.2d 849 (2001).\r\nSubsection (C) of Â§ 24-21-560\r\nprovides that â€œthe court may revoke the prisonerâ€™s community supervision and\r\nimpose a sentence of up to one year for a violation of the community supervision program.â€Â  Subsection \r\n  (D) then provides that for a successive revocation, the prisoner may \r\n  be sentenced â€œas provided in [subsection] (C)â€ i.e., for up to one year, \r\n  with the limitation that the total time imposed â€œfor successive revocationsâ€ \r\n  i.e., all revocations, cannot exceed the length of time of the \r\n  prisonerâ€™s original sentence.Â  Subsection (D) does not provide, as appellant \r\n  contends, that the sentence for any successive revocation is limited to the \r\n  amount of time remaining on the prisonerâ€™s original sentence, nor does this \r\n  statute inevitably result in the â€œdoublingâ€ of a prisonerâ€™s sentence.Â  Further, \r\n  we emphasize that the only issue before us is the construction of this particular \r\n  statute and not the wisdom of the CSP statutory scheme as a whole. \r\n  [2] \r\nSince appellant served three weeks on his prior revocation, \r\n  and his time for all revocations cannot exceed six months, the trial judge properly \r\n  sentenced appellant to five months and seven days.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  The majority holds that \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560 (Supp. 2003) permits an inmate found to have violated \r\n  the terms of his community supervision program (CSP) to serve an additional \r\n  sentence, [3]  up to an amount equal to the \r\n  period of incarceration imposed as part his original sentence.Â  I would read \r\n  the statute differently\r\nCSP â€œserves essentially the same function for persons convicted of \r\n  â€˜no parole offensesâ€™ as parole does for other inmates.â€Â  Jackson v. State, \r\n  349 S.C. 62, 562 S.E.2d 475 (2002).Â  As with parole, the Department of Probation, \r\n  Parole, and Pardon Services (DPPPS) sets the initial length, [4]  terms, and conditions of CSP, \r\n  and determines whether violations have occurred, and initiates a judicial revocation \r\n  process.Â  If the circuit court judge determines the inmate has willfully violated \r\n  the terms of his CSP, then the judge has three options:Â  1) continue the CSP; \r\n  2) continue the CSP but alter the terms and conditions; or 3) revoke CSP and \r\n  order the inmate reincarcerated.Â  The statute limits the total amount of prison \r\n  time an inmate can serve following CSP revocation(s) to the period of incarceration \r\n  ordered by the sentencing judge.Â  Read literally, then, I agree with the majority \r\n  that the statute permits appellant to be reincarcerated for another six months, \r\n  the â€œlength of incarceration imposed for the original â€˜no parole offense.â€™â€\r\nIn my opinion, however, to read the statute literally is to render \r\n  it unconstitutional.Â  Compare In re Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, \r\n  568 S.E.2d 338 (2002) (no double jeopardy or due process violation in involuntary \r\n  commitment for sexually violent predators because commitment is not penal).Â  \r\n  An inmateâ€™s original â€˜no paroleâ€™ sentence ordinarily contains a period of incarceration \r\n  plus a suspended portion. Section 24-21-560 (D) limits the maximum period \r\n  of reincarceration for CSP revocations to â€œan amount equal to the length of \r\n  incarceration imposed for the original â€˜no parole offenseâ€™â€.Â  The original term \r\n  of incarceration does not include any portion of a suspended sentence.â€Â  In \r\n  order to avoid any constitutional infirmity, I would read this language as putting \r\n  an outside limit on incarceration of twice the period imposed by the trial judge.Â  \r\n  The outside limit on the total amount of time an inmate could be incarcerated \r\n  and/or required to participate in the CSP program is the length of the original \r\n  sentence, that is, the term of incarceration plus any period of suspension.Â  \r\n  For example, an individual sentenced to 20 years, suspended on service of seven \r\n  years, would be subject to serving an additional seven years for CSP violations, [5]  but in no case could be held \r\n  in prison or required to participate in a CSP program after the expiration of \r\n  the 20 years.Â  Here, appellant received a six-month sentence, no part of which \r\n  was suspended.Â  In my view, the maximum time he could constitutionally be subjected \r\n  to incarceration and/or required to participate in the CSP program pursuant \r\n  to this sentence was six months.Â  That period having expired, I would hold the \r\n  trial court erred in reincarcerating\r\nappellant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Distribution \r\n    of crack cocaine, second offense, is a â€œno parole offense.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 24-13-100 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] See \r\n    State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162, 167, 573 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2002) (construing \r\n    CSP statutes and noting that â€œall parties agree the statutory scheme is convoluted.â€)\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  This is the term used in Â§ 24-21-560; if the revocation \r\n    judge is truly imposing a new sentence of up to one year, then the protections \r\n    afforded all criminal defendants, including but not limited to the right to \r\n    an indictment, counsel, and a jury, must be afforded her.Â  None of these constitutional \r\n    niceties were afforded appellant, or any of the other CSP violators who have \r\n    come before the Court.Â  Our obligation to construe statutes as constitutional \r\n    where possible, e.g. Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d \r\n    245 (2000), is a driving force behind my construction of Â§ 24-21-560.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The maximum period of CSP is two years. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Of course, an inmate is subject to a maximum one \r\n    year period of incarceration each time he is found to have willfully violated \r\n    CSP, but each reincarceration is followed by another CSP until the program \r\n    is successfully completed or until the term of the original sentence is met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25865","title":"Blakely v.

Haile, of Columbia, \r\n  for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition to review the grant \r\n  of relief in this post-conviction relief (PCR) action.Â  The PCR judge found \r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence of respondentâ€™s previous \r\n  threats.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was charged with murder and assault and \r\n  battery with intent to kill (ABIK) for wounding his girlfriend Sarah Ann Moss \r\n  (a.k.a. â€œAnnâ€) and killing her friend John Henderson (a.k.a. â€œSteveâ€) after \r\n  a domestic dispute earlier in the day.Â  Respondent shot both victims in front \r\n  of Annâ€™s house as they were getting out of a car.Â  Steve managed to drive off \r\n  after being shot but was found dead near his car about a half-mile away.Â  \r\nRespondent claimed self-defense on the murder charge.Â  \r\n  He testified he saw Steve and Ann kissing in the car.Â  When he confronted them, \r\n  Steve came at respondent with a knife.Â  To the contrary, eye-witnesses testified \r\n  they saw Steve put his hands up immediately before being shot.Â  No one saw a \r\n  knife and no knife was ever found at the scene or in Steveâ€™s car.Â  In his statement \r\n  to police, respondent did not mention that Steve had a knife when respondent \r\n  shot him.Â  Respondent claimed he told detectives about the knife but they omitted \r\n  it from his statement.Â  \r\nAs a defense to ABIK, respondent testified he accidentally \r\n  shot Ann when she came up behind him after he shot Steve.Â  \r\nThe jury found respondent guilty of the lesser offenses of voluntary manslaughter \r\n  and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  He was given consecutive \r\n  sentences of thirty years and ten years.Â  Respondentâ€™s direct appeal was dismissed \r\n  after an Anders review.Â  He then filed this action for PCR.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas counsel ineffective for not objecting to evidence of previous threats?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn direct examination, Ann testified as follows:\r\n\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  What was your relationship with [respondent]?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  I was his girlfriend.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  How long did yâ€™all date?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  About six months.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Were you dating that day on January 1st, 1998?Â  Were yâ€™all \r\n  still dating then?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  No. We had quit.Â  I had been calling the relationship all along \r\n  off, and he like kept threatening me.Â  And, you know, threatened to do something \r\n  to my family like killing us and blowing up the house.Â  And so I kind of like \r\n  hung in there because I was afraid of him.\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge found counsel should have objected to this evidence of previous \r\n  threats because it impermissibly placed respondentâ€™s character in issue.Â  \r\nIt is well-settled that evidence of previous threats by the defendant \r\n  is admissible to show malice.Â  State v. Lee, 255 S.C. 309, 178 S.E.2d \r\n  652 (1971); see also State v. Alford, 264 S.C. 26, 212 S.E.2d \r\n  252 (1975) (previous threats against companion of victim at time of assault \r\n  also admissible).Â  Respondent was charged with murder and ABIK, both of which \r\n  include the element of malice.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (1985) (murder is killing \r\n  of any person with malice aforethought); State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, \r\n  532 S.E.2d 283 (2000) (ABIK is an unlawful act of violent injury to person of \r\n  another with malice aforethought).Â  Further, under Rule 404(b), SCRE, this evidence \r\n  is admissible as evidence of intent.Â  \r\nWe conclude counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the evidence \r\n  of previous threats.Â  Accordingly, the grant of relief is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25866","title":"Medical University of South Carolina v.

[1] \r\nAs of October 1, 2001, Dr. Arnaud entered the TERI program, which \r\n  did not affect his job in any manner.Â  The Dean of MUSC wrote Dr. Arnaud a letter \r\n  on October 22 informing him that, although he had entered the TERI program, \r\n  he would still have to retire at the end of June 2002 pursuant to his agreement \r\n  with MUSC. [2] Â  Joe Good, General \r\n  Counsel to MUSC, wrote a letter to Dr. Arnaud on December 10, 2001.Â  In this \r\n  letter, Good indicated that Dr. Arnaudâ€™s TERI participation would not alter \r\n  the prior agreement and that Dr. Arnaudâ€™s employment would terminate in June \r\n  2002.Â  However, in April 2002, counsel for Dr. Arnaud sent a letter to Good \r\n  stating that Dr. Arnaud was entitled to work at MUSC for another five years \r\n  from the date he entered the TERI program. [3] \r\nDuring his deposition, Dr. Arnaud gave inconsistent testimony.Â  \r\n  He testified Good told him TERI superseded the agreement and that he could continue \r\n  to work under TERI.Â  However, he also testified he was not told by anyone that \r\n  TERI would supersede his agreement.Â  Specifically, Dr. Arnaud acknowledged that \r\n  no one in his department had informed him that after he entered TERI, his previous \r\n  agreement was no longer in effect and that he would be guaranteed a job for \r\n  five years if he signed up for TERI.Â  Dr. Arnaud stated that Good, the counsel \r\n  for MUSC, told him resignation agreements could be changed and new agreements \r\n  could be entered into, but, he acknowledged, counsel was not specifically talking \r\n  about his agreement.Â  Dr. Arnaud testified Good told him that, even though the \r\n  agreement did not mention TERI, he could join TERI.Â  Dr. Arnaud acknowledged \r\n  that Good did not tell him he did not have to resign in June 2002.\r\nHolly Maben, the benefits coordinator of MUSC, gave an affidavit \r\n  in which she stated she told Dr. Arnaud the agreement controlled over his TERI \r\n  application and he would have to terminate his employment on June 30, 2002, \r\n  despite his TERI participation.Â  She stated he was given five years on the TERI \r\n  application only so he could continue TERI participation if he decided to work \r\n  for another state employer when he left MUSC. \r\n  [4] \r\nThe trial court found MUSC was entitled to summary judgment on its \r\n  breach of contract claim and was entitled to specific performance in the form \r\n  of Dr. Arnaudâ€™s immediate resignation.Â  The court further found, pursuant to \r\n  the declaratory judgment action, that Â§ 9-1-2210(A) does not alter a state employeeâ€™s \r\n  underlying employment rights or grant any additional employment rights to the \r\n  employee while that employee participates in the TERI program.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by granting summary judgment to MUSC?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \r\n  law.Â  Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, \r\n  575 S.E.2d 549 (2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist \r\n  for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that can \r\n  be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.\r\nDr. Arnaudâ€™s contention that the court improperly granted summary \r\n  judgment by ignoring disputed issues of material fact is without merit because \r\n  any alleged disputed issues of fact exist solely due to Dr. Arnaudâ€™s own inconsistent \r\n  statements in his deposition.Â  Dr. Arnaud testified MUSCâ€™s counsel, Good, did \r\n  not tell him he did not have to resign June 30, 2002, i.e. that \r\n  the previous resignation agreement was nullified by participation in the TERI \r\n  program.Â  He also stated that no one told him participation in TERI would \r\n  override the agreement.Â  However, he also testified at various times that Good \r\n  told him that entering in the TERI program superseded his previous agreement \r\n  and that he could continue to work under TERI.\r\nGiven Dr. Arnaudâ€™s vacillation, his mere allegation that he was informed TERI \r\n  superseded the agreement is not enough to survive a summary judgment motion.Â  \r\n  See City of Columbia v. Town of Irmo, 316 S.C. 193, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  855 (1994) (opposing party may not rest upon mere allegations, but must respond \r\n  with specific facts showing genuine issue).Â  All that was presented to the trial \r\n  court was Dr. Arnaudâ€™s bare assertion that he had been informed TERI nullified \r\n  his previous agreement.Â  In fact, the evidence is clear Dr. Arnaud was informed \r\n  several times that he was expected to honor the agreement even though he had \r\n  entered the TERI program. [5] \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment \r\n  in favor of MUSC. [6] Â  See \r\n  Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., supra (summary \r\n  judgment appropriate only if no genuine issue of material fact and moving party \r\n  entitled to judgment as matter of law).Â  The remaining two issues raised by \r\n  Dr. Arnaud are deemed abandoned given the arguments on those issues were conclusory.Â  \r\n  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) \r\n  (failure to provide arguments or supporting authority for an issue renders it \r\n  abandoned).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Pertinent portions of the TERI \r\n    guidelines for state government state:Â  (1) â€œParticipants in the TERI program \r\n    retain the same status and employment rights they held upon entering the program;â€ \r\n    (2) â€œWhile program participants retain the same rights to their positions \r\n    they held prior to entering the program, participation in the TERI program \r\n    does not guarantee employment for the specified program period;â€ and (3) â€œEmployees \r\n    who enter the TERI program gain no new employment rights and are subject to \r\n    the employment policies and procedures associated with whatever position(s) \r\n    they occupy during the program period, to include those policies and procedures \r\n    related to salary, benefits, and grievance rights.â€Â  See also S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-2210 (Supp. 2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] This \r\n    letter was in response to Dr. Arnaudâ€™s letter requesting the Deanâ€™s approval \r\n    of his entrance into the TERI program and indicating his plan to remain at \r\n    MUSC until 2005.Â  His letter did not reference the earlier resignation agreement.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  MUSC sent appellant two more \r\n    letters.Â  The first letter indicated Dr. Arnaudâ€™s resignation was effective \r\n    June 30, 2002.Â  The second letter, dated July 1, 2002, instructed Dr. Arnaud \r\n    to return his identification badge and any keys to the departmental space \r\n    he held and to remove all personal items from his office.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The \r\n    affidavit of Peggy Boykin, the director of the South Carolina State Retirement \r\n    System, was also submitted.Â  In this affidavit, Boykin, who was involved in \r\n    the drafting of the TERI legislation, gave opinions regarding what the TERI \r\n    legislation was and was not intended for.Â  Boykin also gave specific opinions \r\n    regarding how the TERI legislation applied to Dr. Arnaudâ€™s situation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] We note that while the affidavit \r\n    of Peggy Boykin, the director of the South Carolina State Retirement System, \r\n    was also submitted, this affidavit is not admissible as evidence of legislative \r\n    intent.Â  See Kennedy v. South Carolina Retirement Sys., 345 \r\n    S.C. 339, 549 S.E.2d 243 (2001) (it is a settled principle in the interpretation \r\n    of statutes that even where there is some ambiguity or some uncertainty in \r\n    the language used, resort cannot be had to the opinions of legislators or \r\n    of others concerned in the enactment of the law, for the purpose of ascertaining \r\n    the intent of the legislature).Â  Therefore, the trial court should not have \r\n    considered this affidavit when deciding to grant summary judgment to MUSC.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] Dr. Arnaud further argues the \r\n    court erred by deciding the novel issue of the statutory construction of a \r\n    state employeeâ€™s retirement rights in a summary judgment proceeding.Â  However, \r\n    the mere fact a case involves a novel issue does not render summary judgment \r\n    inappropriate.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v.

Goode, Post-Conviction Relief \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25867\r\nSubmitted June 23, 2004 - Filed September \r\n  7, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Chief, Capital and Collateral Litigation Donald J. \r\n  Zelenka, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Allen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney \r\n  General David Spencer, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Pachak, of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Edward Huggler (Respondent) \r\n  was convicted of two counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and sentenced \r\n  to concurrent sentences of nine years for each count. [1] Â  Respondent appealed and the \r\n  court of appeals dismissed the case.Â  State v. Huggler, 98-UP-492 (S.C. \r\n  Ct. App. filed November 9, 1998).Â  Respondent applied for post-conviction relief \r\n  (PCR).Â  After a hearing, the PCR judge found that trial counsel was ineffective \r\n  for (1) failing to object to the admission of written statements given by the \r\n  victims to the police, describing the sexual abuse and (2) failing to conduct \r\n  a meaningful cross-examination of the testifying victims.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  PCR judge granted a new trial.Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari \r\n  and now reverse.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nMother \r\n  [2]  invited 33-year-old Edward Huggler (Respondent) to live with her and \r\n  her family in order to help out with transportation and childcare.Â  Respondent \r\n  was a friend of Motherâ€™s brother and, at the time, Respondent had no place to \r\n  live.Â  Also living with Mother were her mother, her husband, 14-year-old daughter \r\n  Jane, 10-year-old son John, and 12-year-old stepdaughter Jill. \r\nOne afternoon, when Respondent was watching \r\n  the children, the children, Respondent, and Janeâ€™s friend Lisa [3]  began to play a game of â€œtruth or dare.â€Â  Although \r\n  the game began with innocent dares, the dares eventually became sexual in nature.Â  \r\n  Lisa testified that Jane â€œsucked [Respondentâ€™s] private part,â€ and then Jane \r\n  dared Lisa to do the same.Â  Lisa declined and then Jane dared Jill to do it, \r\n  and she did.Â  Lisa also testified that â€œ[Respondent] licked Janeâ€™s private part.â€\r\nJane also testified as to what happened \r\n  during the game.Â  Jane testified that the game first became sexual with dares \r\n  including kisses on the cheek and french kissing.Â  Later, the dares involved \r\n  oral sex and were carried out in the bathroom, with all the children present.Â  \r\n  After one of the â€œroundsâ€ in the bathroom, Respondent and the children returned \r\n  to the living room, and Respondent asked Jill â€œto do something about a man in \r\n  a boat.â€Â  Respondent then began masturbating himself, and Jill masturbated herself \r\n  as well.\r\nJohn, Janeâ€™s 10-year-old brother, testified \r\n  that Respondent dared John to â€œmoonâ€ Lisa, and John did so.Â  He also testified \r\n  that Respondent â€œmade Jane and Jill suck [Respondentâ€™s] private parts.â€Â  Finally, \r\n  John testified that he did not engage in sexual activity with Respondent.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLastly, Jill, who is John and Janeâ€™s stepsister \r\n  and who lived with them at the time, testified that the game went from dares \r\n  of kissing to â€œeating each other out.â€Â  She also testified that Respondent bit \r\n  her breast.\r\nThe â€œgameâ€ ended when Mother returned \r\n  home.Â  The front door was locked, so Mother knocked on the window, asking â€œWhy \r\n  canâ€™t I get in?â€Â  The children did not tell Mother why the door was locked or \r\n  about what had happened while she was away.Â  Soon thereafter, Respondent moved \r\n  out, and eventually the children told Mother about the sexual activity with \r\n  Respondent.Â  Mother contacted the police.\r\nThe police took written statements from \r\n  all three children. [4] Â  In their \r\n  written statements, the children detailed sexual acts that they engaged in with \r\n  Respondent.Â  During trial, each of these written statements was entered into \r\n  evidence, and defense counsel affirmatively stated, each time, that he did not \r\n  object to the statementsâ€™ admission.Â  In addition, defense counsel did not cross-examine \r\n  John or Jill. [5] Â  Counsel did, however, cross-examine Lisa and \r\n  Jane.Â  \r\nAfter the State finished presenting its \r\n  case, defense counsel announced that he was not presenting any witnesses, including \r\n  Respondent, and requested thirty minutesâ€”instead of fifteen minutes, as the \r\n  judge offeredâ€”to give his closing argument.Â  In closing, defense counsel presented \r\n  a chart outlining the inconsistencies between the childrenâ€™s live testimonies \r\n  and their written statements.Â  In addition, he argued that the State failed \r\n  to adequately investigate the case.Â  Finally, he argued that the children made \r\n  up the allegations to get out of trouble for smoking cigarettes.\r\nThe jury found Respondent guilty on two \r\n  counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor, and he was sentenced to nine \r\n  years imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently.Â  After his appeal \r\n  was dismissed, Respondent applied for PCR, and on October 17, 2000, a hearing \r\n  was held.Â  Defense counsel did not attend the hearing. [6] Â  Although the PCR judge left the record open so that defense \r\n  counsel could be deposed at a later date, defense counsel was never located, \r\n  and his deposition was never taken. \r\nAt the hearing, PCR counsel argued that defense \r\n  counsel â€œfell below the standardâ€ by allowing the childrenâ€™s written statements \r\n  to be admitted into evidence without adequately cross-examining the children \r\n  when they were on the witness stand.Â  PCR counsel further argued that the written \r\n  statements improperly bolstered the childrenâ€™s testimony on direct.Â  If it were \r\n  not for this â€œfatal flaw,â€ PCR counsel argued, there was â€œa reasonable possibility \r\n  that the jury could have reached a different verdict had the case been tried \r\n  correctly.â€Â  \r\nThe PCR judge agreed and granted relief based, \r\n  in part, on the following rationale:Â  \r\n\r\nThis Court has great concerns that [Respondentâ€™s] attorney \r\n  agreed or otherwise did not speak against the introduction of the three statements.Â  \r\n  Normally statements of witnesses are not allowed into evidence, they not being \r\n  confessions of the [Respondent].Â  Also, normally juries have to decide verdicts \r\n  from their oral remembrance, not a writing that bolsters one side.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the PCR judge stated:\r\n\r\nTo forego cross-examination of any witness and let the same \r\n  witnessâ€™ statement be admitted into evidence is not effective representation.Â  \r\n  To challenge credibility in closing argument without any cross-examination to \r\n  establish inconsistencies is not effective representation and not trial strategy.\r\n\r\nThis Court granted the Stateâ€™s \r\n  petition for certiorari, and the State now raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in finding counsel ineffective?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact and conclusions of law. Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 \r\n  S.E.2d 686 (1995)).Â  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there \r\n  is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.Â  Cherry v. \r\n  State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â  If no probative evidence \r\n  exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.Â  Pierce v. State, \r\n  338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (citing Holland v. State, \r\n  322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)).\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in finding counsel \r\n  ineffective.Â  We agree.\r\nTo establish a claim that counsel was ineffective, a PCR \r\n  applicant must show that (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective \r\n  standard of reasonableness and (2) but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable \r\n  probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different. Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984); Johnson v. State, \r\n  325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is \r\n  a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeâ€ of the trial.Â  \r\n  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.Â  \r\nWhen reviewing a counselâ€™s performance, there is a strong \r\n  presumption that counsel â€œrendered adequate assistance and made all significant \r\n  decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.â€Â  Strickland, \r\n  466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.Â  Consequently, courts apply a â€œhighly deferentialâ€ \r\n  standard of review.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.Â  \r\n  Counsel may avoid a finding of ineffectiveness if he articulates a valid reason \r\n  for using a certain strategy.Â  Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 470, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 401, 402 (2002) (citations omitted).Â  Counselâ€™s strategy will be reviewed \r\n  under â€œan objective standard of reasonableness.â€ Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn the present case, the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that defense \r\n  counsel rendered ineffective assistance was based on two grounds:Â  (1) defense \r\n  counsel erred by not objecting to, or otherwise speaking out against, the admission \r\n  of the witnessesâ€™ written statements that were taken by the police during the \r\n  investigation; and (2) defense counsel failed to adequately cross-examine the \r\n  victims.Â  In sum, the PCR judge had â€œgreat concernâ€ that counsel allowed the \r\n  written statements to be admitted and found that it was not â€œtrial strategyâ€ \r\n  for defense counsel to argue inconsistencies between the written statements \r\n  and the testimonies during closing; instead, such inconsistencies should have \r\n  been highlighted during cross-examination. \r\n  [7] Â  Â Â \r\nFirst, as to counselâ€™s failure to object to the admission \r\n  of the victimsâ€™ written statements, we find that even though the statements \r\n  likely constituted inadmissible hearsay and were improperly admitted, the outcome \r\n  of Respondentâ€™s case was not prejudiced by their admission.Â Â  \r\nThe rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of out-of-court \r\n  statements used to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception \r\n  to the rule applies.Â  Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151, 156, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  260, 262 (2001) (citing Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 443 S.E.2d 566 (1994)).Â  \r\n  A well-settled exception in criminal sexual conduct cases allows the admission \r\n  of limited corroborative testimony.Â  Id.Â  When the victim testifies and \r\n  is subject to cross-examination, the victimâ€™s prior consistent statement is \r\n  admissible and is not hearsay, provided the statement is limited to the \r\n  time and place of the incident. Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE; State v. Jeffcoat, \r\n  350 S.C. 392, 395-396, 565 S.E.2d 321, 323 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Therefore, when \r\n  a victim testifies and is subject to cross-examination, the details of the victimâ€™s \r\n  complaint or report are not admissible.Â  State v. Cox, 274 S.C. 624, \r\n  627-628, 266 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1980).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the police obtained written statements \r\n  from each of the three child witnesses, recounting, in detail, the sexual activity \r\n  that occurred with Respondent.Â  After each witness testified on direct, the \r\n  State introduced the witnessâ€™s corresponding written statement into evidence, \r\n  and defense counsel affirmatively stated that he did not object.Â  Because the \r\n  victims testified and were subject to cross, and because the victimsâ€™ written \r\n  statements went beyond describing the time and place of the incident, the statements \r\n  constituted inadmissible hearsay.Â  Therefore, defense counselâ€™s failure to object \r\n  to their introduction fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Dawkins, \r\n  346 S.C. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 263; but see Sanchez v. State, \r\n  351 S.C. 270, 569 S.E.2d 363 (2002) (Burnett &amp; Toal, JJ., dissenting) (noting \r\n  that there are circumstances where it may be reasonable trial strategy for counsel \r\n  to decline to object to inadmissible hearsay testimony in a case involving criminal \r\n  sexual conduct).Â Â  \r\nBut given that the witnessesâ€™ testimonies on direct provided \r\n  overwhelming evidence that sexual abuse did in fact occur, counselâ€™s failure \r\n  to object to the admission of the written statements did not prejudice the outcome \r\n  of Respondentâ€™s case.Â  The evidence of abuse was overwhelming even without the \r\n  content in the written statements.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSecond, as to counselâ€™s failure to adequately cross-examine \r\n  the child victims, we find that the inconsistencies between the testimony and \r\n  the written statements were not substantial enough to warrant a cross-examination \r\n  beyond that which defense counsel conducted.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAll of the children who participated in the â€œgameâ€ testified \r\n  and were subject to cross-examination.Â  Counsel cross-examined two of the four \r\n  witnesses.Â  During cross, counsel did not focus on the inconsistencies between \r\n  the direct testimonies and the written statements; instead counsel raised the \r\n  inconsistencies in his closing argument.Â  The gist of counselâ€™s closing argument \r\n  was that the written statements were more descriptive than the live testimonies \r\n  (and vice versa), and therefore the witnesses lacked credibility.Â  After reviewing \r\n  each of the inconsistencies cited by counsel in closing, we find that the inconsistencies \r\n  were insignificant, relating, for example, to the number of times a particular \r\n  sexual act occurred or whether it occurred in the bathroom or in the living \r\n  room.Â  Therefore, it may have been reasonable for counsel to highlight the inconsistencies \r\n  in closing rather than attempt to use them for impeachment purposes.Â  Moreover, \r\n  given that this was a sexual abuse case involving children, it may have been \r\n  prudent for counsel to limit cross-examination to the issues he thought were \r\n  most important, without picking apart the witnessesâ€™ testimonies based on meaningless \r\n  inconsistencies.Â  \r\nNonetheless, because we do not have the benefit of counselâ€™s \r\n  testimony as to why he limited cross and instead raised the inconsistencies \r\n  during closing, we cannot scrutinize counselâ€™s trial strategy.Â  As a result, \r\n  we focus on whether counselâ€™s assistance prejudiced Respondentâ€™s case as required \r\n  under Strickland v. Washington.Â  In light of the overwhelming evidence \r\n  presented by the State, namely the live, consistent testimonies of four witnesses \r\n  who testified, in detail, that sexual abuse occurred, and our findings that \r\n  (1) Respondentâ€™s case was not prejudiced by the admission of the witnessesâ€™ \r\n  written statements, and (2) counselâ€™s decision to attack witness credibility \r\n  in closing rather than in cross does not, on its face, constitute error, we \r\n  find that there is not a â€œreasonable probabilityâ€ that but for counselâ€™s error, \r\n  the outcome of Respondentâ€™s case would have been different.Â  Strickland, \r\n  466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.\r\nConclusion\r\nBecause there is no evidence of probative value sufficient \r\n  to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that counsel was ineffective, the PCR courtâ€™s \r\n  decision is REVERSED.Â  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, \r\n  J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that the post-conviction \r\n  relief judge erred in granting respondent a new trial.Â  It is apparent from \r\n  the trial record that counselâ€™s strategy was to exploit in closing argument \r\n  the only weakness in the Stateâ€™s case, that is, the inconsistencies between \r\n  the victimsâ€™ written statements and their trial testimony.Â  Having concluded \r\n  that counselâ€™s performance was not objectively unreasonable, I find it unnecessary \r\n  to reach the second prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that \r\n  is, whether respondent was prejudiced as a result of counselâ€™s actions.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Before trial, defense counsel negotiated a plea, which allowed Respondent \r\n    to plead to two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  \r\n    Respondent decided not to plead guilty to this lesser charge, and the trial \r\n    proceeded as a criminal sexual conduct case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Given the sensitive nature of this matter, we have chosen not to \r\n    disclose Motherâ€™s name and to use pseudonyms for the minorsâ€™ names. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Lisa was 13-years old at the time of trial and was either 12 or 13-years \r\n    old at the time the alleged incident occurred.Â  Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The police did not take a statement from Lisa, Janeâ€™s friend who \r\n    was present during the game, but who apparently stopped participating after \r\n    she kissed Respondent.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Again, John was 10-years old at the time, and in both his testimony \r\n    and his written statements, he did not allege that Respondent touched him.Â  \r\n    And although defense counsel did not cross-examine Jill, he did attack her \r\n    credibility by having the State explain, on the record, that Jill had accused \r\n    someone else of criminal sexual conduct in the past and that the case had \r\n    been dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  By order dated August 13, 1999, this Court placed defense counsel \r\n    on incapacity inactive status.Â  In re Banks, 336 S.C. 334, 520 S.E.2d \r\n    316 (1999).Â  A year and a half later, this Court disbarred counsel for engaging \r\n    in check kiting, improperly converting funds, and violating record keeping \r\n    requirements.Â  In re Banks, 344 S.C. 17, 19-20, 542 S.E.2d 721, 722 \r\n    (2001).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  We \r\n    note that defense counsel did not appear at the PCR hearing, was subsequently \r\n    unreachable for deposition, and thus has never testified as to the trial strategy \r\n    employed in Respondentâ€™s case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25868","title":"State v.

Morgan, of Aiken, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Appellant was convicted \r\n  of capital murder and related charges for killing three employees at the Aiken \r\n  County Department of Social Services (DSS) on September 16, 1996.Â  We affirm \r\n  appellantâ€™s murder convictions and three death sentences, vacate his conviction \r\n  for attempted murder, and reverse his conviction for burglary.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\nWhen these murders took place, appellant was married and had three children: \r\n  a three-year-old daughter who was a quadriplegic [1]  and twin two-year-old boys.Â  \r\n  DSS became involved with the family because of concern about the parentsâ€™ abuse \r\n  of prescription drugs.Â  The children were eventually removed from the home.Â  \r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 16, 1996, appellant had a telephone conversation \r\n  with his caseworker, James Riddle.Â  Appellant then called his sister-in-law, \r\n  Tammy Campbell, to ask for a ride to the DSS office.Â  Tammy and her husband \r\n  gave appellant a ride to the Business &amp; Technology Center where the DSS \r\n  office was located.Â  On the way, appellant said that he was tired of people \r\n  â€œplaying Godâ€ with his children.Â  The Campbells dropped appellant off at the \r\n  front of the building.\r\nSometime before 2:00 p.m., several DSS workers returned to work after a birthday \r\n  luncheon.Â  Annette Michael was walking towards her cubicle in the DSS office \r\n  area when another worker, Josie Currie, approached with her hands up.Â  Appellant \r\n  was behind Josie with a gun.Â  Josie asked Annette where James Riddleâ€™s office \r\n  was.Â  When Annette motioned with her hand, appellant told her to step in behind \r\n  Josie.Â  The three of them walked down the aisle to Jamesâ€™s cubicle.Â  James was \r\n  seated at his desk speaking on the telephone.Â  Josie stepped into the cubicle \r\n  and said, â€œThis man would like to see you.â€Â  \r\nAppellant fired a shot into the cubicle, hitting James in the head.Â  He then \r\n  pointed the gun over Annetteâ€™s shoulder and shot Josie in the head.Â  Annette \r\n  fell with Josie as a third shot was fired.Â  Annette saw James fall over in his \r\n  chair and she saw a hole in his forehead before she fainted on the floor.Â  Another \r\n  DSS worker, Michael Gregory, was found dead of a gunshot wound in the menâ€™s \r\n  restroom. Both Josie and James died within the next few hours. Annette was not \r\n  injured.Â  \r\nThe next morning, police were still searching for appellant.Â  At around 9:20 \r\n  a.m., appellant was found lying on the railroad tracks behind the building with \r\n  his gun nearby.Â  He had a bullet hole through the roof of his mouth and an exit \r\n  wound in the top of his skull.Â  Although he was seriously injured, appellant \r\n  was able to speak.Â  After he was taken to the hospital, he was given Miranda \r\n  warnings.Â  Appellant admitted to the shootings.Â  He said he first shot Michael \r\n  Gregory in the restroom because Gregory had seen him.Â  He shot James Riddle \r\n  because Riddle was his caseworker.Â  He shot Josie Currie â€œbecause she was black.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, defense counsel conceded appellant was guilty of the shootings \r\n  and urged that the real issue was the penalty to be imposed.Â  Appellant was \r\n  convicted of three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, kidnapping, \r\n  second-degree burglary, and weapon charges.Â  At the penalty phase, the jury \r\n  found four aggravating circumstances: (1) murder while in commission of a burglary, \r\n  (2) kidnapping, (3) two or more persons murdered, and (4) risk of death of two \r\n  or more persons in a public place.Â  The jury returned three death sentences.\r\nAs to the guilt phase of the trial, appellant raises the following issues for \r\n  review:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial judge properly find appellant competent \r\n      to stand trial?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n      on the attempted murder charge?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial judge properly deny a motion for \r\n      directed verdict on the burglary charge?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial judge properly admit appellantâ€™s \r\n      statement regarding Josie Currie?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAs to the penalty phase, appellant raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    5.\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial judge properly charge section 16-3-20(A) \r\n      as requested?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    6.\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial judge properly restrict voir \r\n      dire?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n1.Â  Competence\r\nAppellant contends the \r\n  trial judge erred in finding him competent to stand trial because of his memory \r\n  loss surrounding the murders.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe test for determining competency to stand trial is whether the defendant \r\n  has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable \r\n  degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational as well as a \r\n  factual understanding of the proceedings against him.Â  State v. Weik, \r\n  356 S.C. 76, 81, 587 S.E.2d 683, 685 (2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 930 \r\n  (2003); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 395-96, 360 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1987).Â  \r\n  The defendant bears the burden of proving his incompetence by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Weik, 356 S.C. at 81, 587 S.E.2d at 685.Â  The trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s decision as to whether the defendant is competent to stand trial will \r\n  be upheld if supported by any evidence.Â  Id.\r\nAt the competency hearing, Dr. Evans testified appellant had frontal lobe damage \r\n  from the gunshot wound to his brain and some resulting memory loss after the \r\n  trauma.Â  Dr. Bellard testified appellant had difficulty with his memory during \r\n  the time leading up to the crime but admitted â€œit is possible [appellant] does \r\n  remember what happened during the crime.â€Â  Dr. Bellard further stated appellant \r\n  understood the charges against him and could follow the proceedings if he paid \r\n  attention.Â  The Stateâ€™s expert testified appellant was competent.Â  \r\nThe trial judge found appellant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence \r\n  that his alleged memory loss rendered him incompetent.Â  The evidence, which \r\n  indicates that appellant understood the charges and the proceedings, supports \r\n  this ruling.\r\n2.Â  \r\n  Attempted murder charge\r\nAppellant was indicted \r\n  for assault with intent to kill (AWIK) and â€œattempted murderâ€ for shooting at \r\n  Annette Michael, whom he shot at but missed.Â  Because both charges involved \r\n  the same victim, the State elected to proceed on the attempted murder charge \r\n  rather than AWIK.Â  The indictment for AWIK was nol-prossed.Â  Appellant \r\n  was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to life.Â  He contends the trial \r\n  court did not have subject matter jurisdiction of this charge under this Courtâ€™s \r\n  decision in State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 532 S.E.2d 283 (2000).Â  We \r\n  agree.\r\nIn State v. Sutton, the Court of Appeals held attempted murder is not \r\n  a recognized offense in South Carolina.Â  333 S.C. 192, 194, 508 S.E.2d 41, 42 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).Â  This decision was filed October 26, 1998, and we granted certiorari \r\n  on July 8, 1999.Â  Appellantâ€™s trial commenced February 7, 2000.Â  On May 15, \r\n  2000, we affirmed as modified the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling in Sutton, \r\n  holding that attempted murder is not a recognized offense in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  340 S.C. at 398, 532 S.E.2d at 286. \r\nThe State argues that in affirming the Court of \r\n  Appeals, we did not reiterate the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis that such an offense \r\n  â€œnever existed,â€ but instead clarified the definition of AWIK and concluded \r\n  the offense of attempted murder is unnecessary.Â  The State claims our decision \r\n  is therefore a new rule that should apply prospectively only.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n  A decision announcing a new rule of law will be given retroactive effect to \r\n  all cases pending on direct review.Â  State v. Jones, 312 S.C. 100, 102, \r\n  439 S.E.2d 282, 282 (1994).Â  Accordingly, we vacate the attempted murder conviction \r\n  and the five-year sentence for possession of a firearm during the attempted \r\n  murder.\r\n3.Â  Burglary conviction\r\nAppellant was convicted of second-degree burglary under S.C. Code Ann. section \r\n  16-11-312(B)(1) (2003), which provides: \r\n \r\n  (B) A person is guilty of burglary in the second degree if the person enters \r\n    a building without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, and \r\n    either:\r\n   \r\n     (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Â When, in effecting entry or while in the building or \r\n      in immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n     (a)Â  Is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive;Â  or\r\n    (b)Â  Causes physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the \r\n      crime; or\r\n    (c) Uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or\r\n    (d) Displays what is or appears to be a knife, pistol, revolver, rifle, \r\n      shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nUnder section 16-11-310(1)(b), â€œbuildingâ€ includes \r\n  a structure where people assemble for purposes of business or government.Â  Further, \r\n  the same section states:Â  \r\n\r\n  Where a building consists of two or more units separately occupied or \r\n    secured, each unit is deemed both a separate building in itself and a \r\n    part of the main building.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred in denying appellantâ€™s motion for directed \r\n  verdict on the burglary charge because there is no evidence he entered without \r\n  consent.Â  The State contends the DSS office area was â€œseparately securedâ€ from \r\n  the public area and, because appellant had no authority to enter that area, \r\n  his entry was without consent.\r\nThe DSS offices are located in the Business &amp; Technology Center, also referred \r\n  to as the â€œBTC building.â€Â  Glass front doors are at the main entrance to the \r\n  building and these open onto the main hall that runs down the length of the \r\n  building with an exit at the end.Â  DSS has its own outside entrance on the right \r\n  side of the building that leads into the DSS lobby.Â  There is also a locked \r\n  employee entrance that opens directly into the office area of DSS.Â  From the \r\n  main building hallway, there are two inside entrances to the DSS area, one to \r\n  the DSS lobby and one to the DSS office area, which apparently was a locked \r\n  door with a buzzer.\r\nWithin the DSS area, there is a door between the lobby and the office area.Â  \r\n  Typically, clients enter the DSS lobby, and the receptionist calls the DSS worker \r\n  who comes to the lobby and escorts the client back to the workerâ€™s office cubicle.Â  \r\n  Clients generally are told they are not to go back into the office area unescorted.Â  \r\n  There is no evidence, however, that this door was locked or even closed on the \r\n  day of the shootings.Â  In addition, there is no sign posted telling clients \r\n  not to enter.\r\nBritt Campbell, who gave appellant a ride to the DSS office on the day of the \r\n  shootings, testified he saw appellant go to the front glass doors of the BTC \r\n  building, open the door, and take a step inside before Campbell drove away.Â  \r\n  After the shootings, Appellant himself told police that he â€œentered the side \r\n  door and exited the back door.â€ [2] Â  There is no eyewitness testimony \r\n  indicating how appellant got into the DSS office area.Â  The first time he was \r\n  seen, he was already in the office area.Â  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s theory to support appellantâ€™s burglary conviction rests on the \r\n  statutory definition of â€œbuilding,â€ which includes a unit in a building that \r\n  has two or more units where each unit is â€œseparately occupied or secured.â€ S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310(1)(b).Â  At least one other court has applied this statutory \r\n  term to find an area within a building to be separately secured if the unit \r\n  requires a separate key for entry.Â  Hawaii v. Vowell, 837 P.2d 1308, \r\n  1311-1312 (Haw. 1992); see also State v. Vinyard, 78 P.3d 1196, \r\n  1198 (Kan. App. 2003) (holding separate businesses in a shopping mall are separate \r\n  buildings).Â  In light of our rule that a penal statute must be strictly construed \r\n  against the State, State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 268, 559 S.E.2d 847, \r\n  849 (2002), we construe â€œseparately occupied or securedâ€ to require some objective \r\n  manifestation that the unit is secure. [3] Â  \r\nIn this case, the evidence indicates that at least \r\n  one entry into the DSS office area was not securedâ€”the entry from the DSS lobby \r\n  into the office area.Â  There was no sign refusing admittance, no evidence the \r\n  door was secured, and no evidence appellant was denied entry.Â  We find the DSS \r\n  office area does not qualify as a separate building for purposes of the burglary \r\n  statute and reverse the denial of a directed verdict on this charge.\r\n4.Â  Admission of statement\r\nAppellant contends his \r\n  statement that he killed the third victim, Josie Currie, â€œbecause she was black,â€ \r\n  should have been suppressed as an involuntary statement because police told \r\n  him he was dying and because of his mental condition due to his brain injury.Â  \r\n  We disagree. \r\nWhen appellant was found on the railroad tracks, he had a bullet wound in the \r\n  top of his head.Â  The arresting officers did not tell him he was dying.Â  Agent \r\n  McAlhany testified he thought appellant was dying but did not tell him.Â  Agent \r\n  Otterbacher did not recall telling appellant he was dying but did ask him if \r\n  he believed in God and, if so, he needed to ask Godâ€™s forgiveness.Â  \r\nAppellant was then taken to the hospital where he was interviewed, with the \r\n  doctorsâ€™ permission, after being given Miranda warnings.Â  Appellant was \r\n  coherent and indicated he understood his rights when he gave the contested statement.Â  \r\n\r\nA defendantâ€™s mental condition in and of itself does not render a statement \r\n  involuntary in violation of due process.Â  Absent coercive police conduct causally \r\n  related to a confession, there is no basis for finding a confession constitutionally \r\n  involuntary.Â  Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 164 (1986); State \r\n  v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 594, 521 S.E.2d 500, 505 (1999); see also State \r\n  v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 709, 258 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1979) (under state law, \r\n  a confession is not inadmissible because of mental deficiency alone).Â  \r\nAgent Ottenbacherâ€™s suggestion that appellant ask \r\n  Godâ€™s forgiveness does not, on its face, rise to the level of police coercion.Â  \r\n  In addition, there is no testimony in the record that appellant felt coerced \r\n  by this statement.Â  Appellantâ€™s mental condition alone does not support a finding \r\n  of involuntariness absent evidence of police coercion.Â  Accordingly, we conclude \r\n  that the trial judge properly admitted the statement.Â  State v. Owens, \r\n  346 S.C. 637, 660, 552 S.E.2d 745, 757 (2001) (conclusion of the trial judge \r\n  on issues of fact as to the voluntariness of a confession will not be disturbed \r\n  unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion).\r\n5.Â  Section 16-3-20(A)\r\nDuring the penalty phase of trial, the defense put up an extensive case, including \r\n  mental health experts who testified as to appellantâ€™s mental illnesses \r\n  [4]  and prison officials who testified as to his good behavior while incarcerated. \r\n\r\nCaptain Angie Pinkney, a shift supervisor at Lee Correctional Institute, \r\n  described prison conditions for inmates according to their classification.Â  \r\n  â€œSafekeepersâ€ are inmates in maximum security.Â  They are kept in lockdown for \r\n  twenty-three out of twenty-four hours and escorted everywhere.Â  This was appellantâ€™s \r\n  classification.Â  On cross-examination, Captain Pinkney was asked if â€œgeneral \r\n  lifersâ€ were treated differently from those in maximum security.Â  She answered \r\n  that the level of freedom changes and inmates â€œhave much more flexibility out \r\n  there in the yard, they can leave at their leisure, go to work, school, they \r\n  have a job. . . .â€Â  \r\nWhen the case was submitted to the jury, the trial judge properly charged \r\n  that life imprisonment means life without the possibility of parole.Â  After \r\n  the jury began deliberations, it returned with a question:Â  \r\n\r\n  [Captain Pinkney] stated something to the fact that with a life sentence \r\n    Mr. Hill can go to school, work, etc. Please reiterate the response to the \r\n    solicitorâ€™s question.Â  Whatâ€™s the difference between life in prison and super \r\n    max.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge \r\n  then had Captain Pinkneyâ€™s testimony replayed.Â  He refused defense counselâ€™s \r\n  request that an additional charge be given based on S.C. Code Ann. section 16-3-20(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2003), which in pertinent part provides:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished \r\n      by death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment \r\n      for thirty years. . . .No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant \r\n      to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early \r\n      release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, \r\n      education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would \r\n      reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\n  The trial judge ruled that the italicized language expressed only the legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent that the mandatory term not be reduced and does not prohibit a person \r\n  sentenced to life imprisonment from working or seeking an education.Â  \r\nA plain reading of the statute supports the trial judgeâ€™s interpretation.Â  \r\n  The statute speaks strictly in terms of prohibiting credit for certain \r\n  activities but does not prohibit those activities in the day-to-day life of \r\n  an inmate sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  We find no error in refusing the \r\n  additional charge.\r\n6.Â  \r\n  Jury voir dire\r\nDuring voir dire, the trial judge refused defense counselâ€™s request \r\n  to ask jurors whether they would give up their vote in order to go with the \r\n  majority.Â  Appellant contends this was error under State v. Bennett, \r\n  328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d 845 (1997).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn general, the scope of voir dire and the manner in which it is \r\n  conducted are within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion.Â  State v. Wise, \r\n  359 S.C. 14, 23, 596 S.E.2d 475, 479 (2004) (citations omitted).Â  To constitute \r\n  reversible error, a limitation on questioning must render the trial â€œfundamentally \r\n  unfair.â€Â  Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 730, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 2230 \r\n  (1992); State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 104, 501 S.E.2d 122, 127 (1998).Â  \r\n  On review, a jurorâ€™s responses must be examined in light of the entire voir \r\n  dire, with the primary consideration being that the juror is unbiased, impartial, \r\n  and capable of following instructions on the law.Â  State v. Green, 301 \r\n  S.C. 347, 354, 392 S.E.2d 157, 161, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881, 111 S. \r\n  Ct. 229 (1990).Â  \r\nIn Bennett, we found a juror unqualified \r\n  who, when asked, stated he could not go against the majority if the eleven other \r\n  jurors voted for death.Â  We held that the jurorâ€™s statement indicated he would \r\n  not have been able to follow the law as explained to him and his earlier generalized \r\n  statement that he could follow the law did not cure this deficiency.Â  Bennett, \r\n  328 S.C. at 257, 439 S.E.2d at 848.\r\nBut Bennett does not determine whether it \r\n  is appropriate, much less mandatory, for defense counsel to ask the â€œgo with \r\n  the majorityâ€ question.Â  In fact, the appropriateness of the question was not \r\n  at issue in Bennett; instead, the ultimate inquiry in Bennett \r\n  was whether the juror was â€œunbiased, impartial, and able to carry out the law \r\n  as explained to him.â€ Id.Â  Considering the voir dire as a whole, \r\n  we determined that the juror was not impartial.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, however, a review of the entire \r\n  voir dire reveals that the defendant had an impartial jury.Â  Prior to \r\n  qualification, the judge asked all potential jurors to read summaries of three \r\n  potential juror types:Â  (1) one who would feel required to give the death penalty \r\n  in every case where murder had been proved; (2) one who would not give the death \r\n  penalty under any circumstance, including when the defendant had been found \r\n  guilty of murder; and (3) one who would not have his or her mind made up in \r\n  advance concerning punishmentâ€”this person would need to hear the facts and circumstances \r\n  in aggravation and mitigation, and would want to listen to and follow the law \r\n  as charged before making a decision.Â  Qualified jurors indicated that they were \r\n  like the third type of jurorâ€”the kind of juror who would listen to all the circumstances \r\n  and follow the judgeâ€™s instructions on the law.Â  They were repeatedly questioned \r\n  by the State and the defense as to whether they understood the nature of this \r\n  category of potential jurors.\r\nMoreover, there is no indication that the limitation on questioning affected \r\n  the selection of an impartial jury.Â  Appellant does not point to a single juror \r\n  whose responses vacillated or whose responses suggested that the juror was incapable \r\n  of hearing all of the evidence before making a decision.Â  Further, unlike the \r\n  question asked in Bennett, the question asked in the present case does \r\n  not probe whether jurors would automatically vote for death regardless of their \r\n  view on the evidence and therefore reveals little, if anything, about juror \r\n  impartiality.Â  In sum, a review of the entire voir dire indicates that \r\n  the jurors were unbiased, impartial, and capable of following instructions on \r\n  the law.\r\nIn the final analysis, what is constitutionally \r\n  mandated is the selection of a fair and impartial jury.Â  No particular formula \r\n  of questions is mandated to achieve this goal.Â  In our justice system, the trial \r\n  judge has the discretion and the duty to monitor the voir dire so as \r\n  to ensure that the jury selected measures up to the constitutional standard.Â  \r\n  The judgeâ€™s ruling in this case, disallowing defense counsel to question jurors \r\n  about their propensity to go with the majority, did not render the trial â€œfundamentally \r\n  unfair.â€Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s decision on this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s murder convictions and three death sentences are affirmed, the \r\n  convictions for attempted murder and the related weapon charge are vacated, \r\n  and the conviction for second-degree burglary is reversed.Â  Appellantâ€™s remaining \r\n  issues are without merit:Â  See Issue 4:Â  State v. Taylor, 333 \r\n  S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998) (prejudice must be shown from erroneous admission \r\n  or exclusion of evidence); Issues 8 &amp; 9:Â  State v.

Colf, 337 \r\n  S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246 (2000) (trial judgeâ€™s ruling on scope of cross-examination \r\n  will be reversed only if showing of prejudice);Â  Issue 11:Â  Clark v.

Brogdon, Jr., concur. Â MOORE, J., dissenting \r\n  in a separate opinion in which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Because I disagree with the majorityâ€™s holding that \r\n  juror voir dire was properly limited, I respectfully dissent.Â  \r\nIn my view, our decision in State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d \r\n  845 (1997), is controlling here.Â  In Bennett, we found unqualified a \r\n  juror who stated he could not go against the majority if the eleven other jurors \r\n  voted for death.Â  We concluded the jurorâ€™s earlier generalized statement that \r\n  he could â€œfollow the lawâ€ did not cure this deficiency.Â  Our holding in Bennett \r\n  compels the conclusion that a jurorâ€™s general statement that he or she could \r\n  follow the law does not satisfy the specific inquiry defense counsel requested \r\n  here.Â  Cf. State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 501 S.E.2d 122 (1998) (fundamental \r\n  fairness not violated by limited voir dire where other questions covered request).\r\nFurther, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, â€œThe measure of a jury \r\n  is taken by reference to the impartiality of each individual juror. . . . each \r\n  of these jurors must stand equally impartial in his or her ability to follow \r\n  the law.â€Â  Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 735 (1992).Â  A jurorâ€™s ability \r\n  to decide the case independently of the majority is particularly relevant under \r\n  our capital sentencing scheme because even one vote for life will defeat a death \r\n  sentence.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 2003) (where jury fails \r\n  to return unanimous verdict, the judge must impose a life sentence). [5] Â  It is therefore crucial that the defendant \r\n  be able to inquire whether a juror has a propensity to follow the majority.\r\nIn light of our sentencing scheme, \r\n  I would hold that fundamental fairness requires that the defense be allowed \r\n  to probe a jurorâ€™s ability to vote independently of the majority.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  I would reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding. \r\nWALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The daughter was injured when appellantâ€™s wife \r\n    had a car accident less than a year earlier.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  A maintenance worker saw appellant \r\n    exit the back door of the building at the end of the main hallway. \r\n\r\n [3] We are aware that other courts \r\n  addressing the issue of burglary in a public building have held that consent \r\n  to enter a public building is limited to the purpose for which the building \r\n  is open and therefore any unlawful act is without consent as a matter of law.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., People v. Blair, 288 N.E.2d 443, 445 (Ill. 1972); State \r\n  v. Adams, 581 P.2d 868, 869 (Nev. 1978).Â  This approach has been criticized, \r\n  however, because it elevates every crime committed in a public building, such \r\n  as shoplifting, to a burglary.Â  State v. Hall, 3 P.3d 582, 585 (Kan. \r\n  App. 2000), affâ€™d, 14 P.3d 404, 409 (Kan. 2000).Â \r\n\r\n [4]  Appellant was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \r\n    disorder, panic disorder, and major depression.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] The \r\n    jury, however, need not be told the consequences of its failure to agree.Â  \r\n    Jones v.

Ct. App. Order dated July 25, 2002.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent Hattie Rose Elam (Elam) sued Petitioner (SCDOT) under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act [1]  \r\n  for personal injuries and property damage sustained by Elam in a single-car \r\n  accident which occurred in March 1998.Â  Elam alleged the accident was caused \r\n  by SCDOTâ€™s improper maintenance of a highway, which allowed excessive rain water \r\n  to accumulate on the highway.\r\nAt the conclusion of Elamâ€™s case, SCDOT moved for a directed verdict on various \r\n  grounds.Â  The trial court denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury \r\n  on January 10, 2001.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Elam for $250,000.Â  Immediately \r\n  thereafter, SCDOT made oral motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  (JNOV) and a new trial absolute, or in the alternative, for a new trial nisi \r\n  remittitur.Â  SCDOTâ€™s motions were denied by the trial judge in an oral ruling \r\n  from the bench, and a one-page Form 4 order was filed with the clerk on January \r\n  11, 2001, effecting entry of the juryâ€™s verdict.Â Â Â  \r\nSCDOT timely filed a written motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied the Rule 59(e) motion in a written order dated April 6, 2001.Â  \r\n  SCDOT served its notice of appeal on April 27, 2001, and in its appeal contested \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s denial of its motions for JNOV and new trial.\r\nThe Court of Appeals, sua sponte, raised the issue of the timeliness \r\n  of SCDOTâ€™s appeal in light of Quality Trailer Products v. CSL Equipment Co., \r\n  349 S.C. 216, 562 S.E.2d 615 (2002), and directed the parties brief the issue.Â  \r\n  The Court of Appeals subsequently concluded SCDOTâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion merely \r\n  repeated grounds previously raised to and ruled on by the trial judge as a result \r\n  of SCDOTâ€™s oral JNOV/new trial motions.Â  Therefore, the Rule 59(e) motion did \r\n  not stay the running of the thirty-day deadline to appeal and SCDOTâ€™s appeal \r\n  was dismissed as untimely.\r\nISSUES\r\n \r\n  \r\n    I.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding SCDOTâ€™s appeal untimely because \r\n      its written Rule 59(e) motion, which repeated grounds previously raised \r\n      to and ruled on by the trial judge as a result of oral JNOV/new trial motions \r\n      made immediately after the juryâ€™s verdict, did not stay the time to appeal?\r\n    II.Â  Did the trial court err in denying SCDOTâ€™s motion to amend its answer \r\n      and its post-trial motions?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Timeliness of SCDOTâ€™s appeal\r\nWe take this opportunity to clarify the limits and rationale of Quality \r\n  Trailer, supra, and two Court of Appealsâ€™ opinions, Coward Hund \r\n  Const. Co. v. Ball Corp., 336 S.C. 1, 518 S.E.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1999), and \r\n  Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  We conclude the Court of Appeals in the present case and in Matthews v. Richland \r\n  County School Dist. One, 357 S.C. 594, 594 S.E.2d 177 (Ct. App. 2004) has \r\n  extended the holdings and rationale of those three cases in a manner which unnecessarily \r\n  complicates post-trial and appellate practice.Â  \r\nPost-trial motions such as a JNOV or new trial motion â€œshall be made promptly \r\n  after the jury is discharged, or in the discretion of the court not later than \r\n  10 days thereafter.â€Â  Rules 50(e) and 59(b), SCRCP.Â  In actions tried without \r\n  a jury or with an advisory jury, a party may move the court to amend its findings \r\n  or judgment or for a new trial not later than 10 days after receipt of written \r\n  notice of entry of judgment.Â  Rule 52(a), SCRCP.\r\nThe notice of appeal in a case appealed from the Court of Common Pleas must \r\n  be served on all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written notice \r\n  of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  The requirement \r\n  of service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, i.e., if a party \r\n  misses the deadline, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction to consider the \r\n  appeal and has no authority or discretion to â€œrescueâ€ the delinquent party by \r\n  extending or ignoring the deadline for service of the notice.Â  Mears v. Mears, \r\n  287 S.C. 168, 337 S.E.2d 206 (1985).Â  A timely post-trial motion, including \r\n  a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, stays \r\n  the time for an appeal for all parties until receipt of written notice of entry \r\n  of the order granting or denying such motion.Â  See Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR; \r\n  Rules 50(e), 52(c), and 59(f), SCRCP.\r\nThe Court of Appeals in 1999 took the first step toward Quality Trailer \r\n  in Coward Hund, 336 S.C. 1, 518 S.E.2d 56.Â  In that case, the trial court \r\n  by written order granted summary judgment to the defendants.Â  Appellant Coward \r\n  Hund timely served a written â€œmotion for reconsiderationâ€ pursuant to Rule 59(e), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  The trial court heard oral arguments on the Rule 59(e) motion and issued \r\n  a written order denying the motion.Â  Coward Hund subsequently filed a second, \r\n  written motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), seeking clarification \r\n  of the courtâ€™s ruling on an issue on which the court had ruled.Â  After a telephone \r\n  conference, the trial court issued a supplemental written order again denying \r\n  Coward Hundâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Coward Hund served its notice of appeal within \r\n  thirty days of receipt of written notice of entry of the order denying its second \r\n  Rule 59(e) motion.Â  The issue, then, was whether Coward Hundâ€™s filing of a second, \r\n  written Rule 59(e) motion stayed the time for serving a notice of appeal.\r\nFinding no South Carolina case directly on point, the Court of Appeals endorsed \r\n  the prevailing view espoused by federal courts that a second motion for reconsideration \r\n  under Rule 59(e) is appropriate only if it challenges something that was altered \r\n  from the original judgment as a result of the initial motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\n  The Court of Appeals reasoned nothing in the written order denying Coward Hundâ€™s \r\n  first Rule 59(e) motion altered anything in the written summary judgment order.Â  \r\n  Thus, the finality of the summary judgment order was restored and the time for \r\n  serving a notice of appeal began to run upon Coward Hundâ€™s receipt of written \r\n  notice of entry of the order denying its first Rule 59(e) motion.Â  The Court \r\n  of Appeals held Coward Hundâ€™s second Rule 59(e) motion did not stay the time \r\n  for appeal and consequently dismissed the appeal as untimely.Â  Coward Hund, \r\n  336 S.C. at 4, 518 S.E.2d at 58.\r\nIn Quality Trailer, decided three years later, a jury returned a verdict \r\n  in favor of Quality Trailer.Â  Appellant I Corp. timely served a written post-trial \r\n  motion for JNOV and a new trial.Â  The trial court issued a written order denying \r\n  the motion and explaining the reasons for the denial.Â  I Corp. then filed a \r\n  written motion pursuant to Rules 52, 59, and 60, SCRCP, which was virtually \r\n  identical to its written JNOV/new trial motion.Â  The only changes I Corp. made \r\n  were to caption the Rule 59(e) motion differently and to change the relief sought \r\n  in the Rule 59(e) motionâ€™s final paragraph to coincide with the Rule 59(e) motionâ€™s \r\n  caption.Â  I Corp.â€™s Rule 59(e) motion did not identify a single issue raised \r\n  but not ruled on, but merely recited, verbatim, the arguments made in the written \r\n  JNOV/new trial motion.\r\nWe held the filing of a written, successive, virtually identical post-trial \r\n  motion - raising issues which already had been raised to and ruled on by the \r\n  trial court in a previous written order - does not stay the time for serving \r\n  notice of appeal.Â  â€œThe time for filing appeal is not extended by submitting \r\n  the same motion under a different caption.â€Â  Quality Trailer, 349 S.C. \r\n  at 220, 562 S.E.2d at 618.Â  We dismissed I Corp.â€™s appeal as untimely because \r\n  its written, successive, virtually identical post-trial motion did not stay \r\n  the time for serving a notice of appeal.\r\nThus, Quality Trailer took Coward Hund a step further.Â  Coward \r\n  Hund barred as untimely an appeal from a second, written Rule 59(e) motion \r\n  raising the same issues on which a ruling had been obtained by virtue of a previous, \r\n  written Rule 59(e) motion; Quality Trailer barred as untimely an appeal \r\n  from a first, written Rule 59(e) motion raising the same issues, verbatim, on \r\n  which a ruling had been obtained in a previous, written JNOV/new trial motion.\r\nThe Quality Trailer view of successive post-trial motions has been applied \r\n  in only two other published opinions by the Court of Appeals:Â  Collins Music, \r\n  353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524, and Matthews, 357 S.C. 594, 594 S.E.2d \r\n  177. \r\nIn Collins Music, the Court of Appeals found that an appeal was not \r\n  timely by relying on Quality Trailer and Coward Hund.Â  From a \r\n  verdict in favor of Collins, appellant IGT timely filed and served written post-trial \r\n  motions for JNOV, new trial, and new trial nisi remittitur, asserting \r\n  twenty-eight grounds as support for its requested relief.Â  The trial court denied \r\n  all IGTâ€™s post-trial motions in a written order â€œafter carefully reviewing the \r\n  matter.â€\r\nSeven days later, IGT served a substantively identical Rule 59(e) motion to \r\n  alter or amend the judgment, asking the court to make specific rulings on each \r\n  ground raised in the earlier motions.Â  The trial court issued a written order \r\n  denying IGTâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion and specifically stating IGT failed to raise \r\n  any issue not already considered.Â  IGT served a notice of appeal within thirty \r\n  days of receipt of written notice of entry of the order denying its Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded IGTâ€™s written Rule 59(e) motion merely restated \r\n  the same twenty-eight grounds and arguments the trial court had denied in its \r\n  written order made in response to IGTâ€™s initial, written JNOV/new trial motions.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the time to appeal began to run from the date IGT received written \r\n  notice of entry of the order denying its initial JNOV/new trial motions.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the Court of Appeals dismissed IGTâ€™s appeal as untimely.Â  Collins Music, \r\n  353 S.C. at 565, 579 S.E.2d at 526-527.Â  Collins Music is similar to \r\n  Quality Trailer because it barred an appeal as untimely from a first, \r\n  written Rule 59(e) motion raising the same issues on which a ruling had been \r\n  obtained in a previous, written, virtually identical JNOV/new trial motion.\r\nIn Matthews, the defendant school district appealed a verdict in favor \r\n  of Matthews.Â  The Court of Appeals, acting sua sponte because it correctly \r\n  recognized the timeliness of an appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, raised \r\n  the Quality Trailer issue even though the parties had not.\r\nThe school district, immediately following the verdict, made oral motions for \r\n  JNOV and new trial nisi remittitur, which the trial court orally denied.Â  \r\n  The school district received a written copy of entry of the judgment almost \r\n  a month later, at which time the school district timely filed a first, written \r\n  Rule 59(e) motion.\r\nThe school districtâ€™s written Rule 59(e) motion restated its oral arguments \r\n  made at the conclusion of the trial for remittitur of the verdict.Â  Matthews \r\n  submitted a response to the motion, requesting the verdict stand or, in the \r\n  alternative, a new trial nisi to allow her to recover attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â  \r\n  The trial court reduced the verdict and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees to Matthews.Â  \r\n  The school district appealed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded the school district had restated the same grounds \r\n  in its first, written Rule 59(e) motion as it had in its oral JNOV/new trial \r\n  motion made at the end of the trial.Â  The trial court lacked jurisdiction to \r\n  entertain an identical, successive post-trial motion.Â  Relying on Quality \r\n  Trailer, Collins Music, and Coward Hund and finding the case \r\n  before it factually similar, the Court of Appeals held the school district had \r\n  filed a successive post-trial motion that did not raise any new issue, but merely \r\n  repeated the same arguments made in an earlier motion.\r\nAlthough the trial court had granted the school districtâ€™s successive motion \r\n  - unlike precedent in which the successive motion was denied - the Court of \r\n  Appeals reasoned that distinction made no difference in the outcome.Â  The school \r\n  districtâ€™s first, written Rule 59(e) motion, which followed oral JNOV/new trial \r\n  motions in which the same issues had been raised and ruled on, was not proper \r\n  and did not toll the time for appeal.Â  The school districtâ€™s appeal was dismissed \r\n  as untimely.Â  Matthews, 357 S.C. at 597-600, 549 S.E.2d at 178-180. \r\nMatthews is similarly postured to the case now before us.Â  In both cases, \r\n  the Court of Appeals has expanded the reach of Quality Trailer and Collins \r\n  Music by applying them to cases in which a first, written Rule 59(e) motion \r\n  was deemed to raise issues and arguments which already had been raised to and \r\n  ruled on by virtue of previous, oral JNOV/new trial motions.\r\nWe conclude Coward Hund correctly stated and applied the prevailing \r\n  view among federal courts that a second Rule 59(e) motion which raises the same \r\n  issues and arguments made in a previous Rule 59(e) motion does not toll the \r\n  time to appeal.Â  E.g., Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d \r\n  10, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1997) (subsequent Rule 59 motion served within 10 days after \r\n  denial of initial Rule 59 motion for reconsideration, but more than 10 days \r\n  after entry of original judgment, does not toll time for appeal); Glinka \r\n  v. Maytag Corp., 90 F.3d 72, 74 (2d Cir. 1996) (â€œ[a]llowing subsequent motions \r\n  to repeatedly toll the filing period for a notice of appeal would encourage \r\n  frivolous motions and undermine a fundamental canon of our legal system, to \r\n  promote the finality of judgmentsâ€; court noted this view is â€œwell-establishedâ€ \r\n  in federal circuits); Wright v. Preferred Research, Inc., 891 F.2d 886, \r\n  889 (11th Cir. 1990) (â€œthe language and purpose of [federal] Rule 4(a)(4) indicate \r\n  that the time for appeal is postponed only by an original motion of the \r\n  type specified.Â  I.e., a motion to reconsider an order disposing of such \r\n  a motion will not further postpone the time to appealâ€) (emphasis in original); \r\n  12 Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â§ 59.32[2] (3d ed. 2003); 11 Wright, Miller \r\n  &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d Â§ 2817 (1995).Â  \r\n  However, â€œif the disposition of the first motion results in a judgment which \r\n  is substantively altered, a subsequent motion will again postpone the appeal \r\n  period.â€Â  Wright, 891 F.2d at 889; 12 Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice \r\n  Â§Â§ 59.35 and 59.37.\r\nWe further conclude Quality Trailer and Collins Music - which \r\n  involved written JNOV/new trial motions, a written ruling by the trial court, \r\n  followed by a first, written, virtually identical Rule 59(e) motion - were correctly \r\n  decided.Â  See Ex parte Mutual Sav. Life Ins. Co., 765 So.2d 649 \r\n  (Ala. 1998) (in case involving successive written motions, court explained the \r\n  recourse following denial of a partyâ€™s own post-judgment motion is by timely \r\n  appeal because the rules do not provide for a â€œmotion to reconsiderâ€ such a \r\n  denial; however, a motion to reconsider is proper and will toll the time for \r\n  appeal when post-judgment motion is granted and new judgment is entered); Wenzoski \r\n  v. Central Banking System, Inc., 736 P.2d 753 (Cal. 1987) (in case involving \r\n  successive written motions, appeal was untimely because second separate motion \r\n  for new trial, filed because party feared his first motion was filed too early, \r\n  did not toll time to appeal); Sears v. Sears, 422 N.E.2d 610 (Ill. 1981) \r\n  (successive written post-trial motion which repeats what was raised or could \r\n  have been raised in first written motion is not authorized by rules and does \r\n  not extend time for appeal; losing litigant is not entitled to return to trial \r\n  court indefinitely hoping for change of heart or a more sympathetic judge, or \r\n  string out arguments one at a time over months because â€œ[t]here must be finality, \r\n  a time when the case in the trial court is really over and the loser must appeal \r\n  or give upâ€); State ex rel. Douglas v. Bible Baptist Church of Lincoln, \r\n  353 N.W.2d 20 (Neb. 1984) (in case involving successive written motions, appeal \r\n  was untimely because second motion for new trial, based in part on events which \r\n  occurred after denial of first motion for new trial, was not proper and did \r\n  not toll time for appeal); Kaufman v. Oregonian Pub. Co., 245 P.2d 237 \r\n  (Or. 1952) (in case involving successive written motions, a party may not extend \r\n  time for appeal from an order denying a motion for reinstatement of action by \r\n  filing a second, substantively identical motion with a different judge); Gassaway \r\n  v. Patty, 604 S.W.2d 60 (Tenn. App. Ct. 1980) (in case involving successive \r\n  written motions, appeal was untimely where a party filed second post-judgment \r\n  motion seeking reconsideration of order denying first post-judgment motion; \r\n  rules are meant to prevent filing of repetitive post-trial motions and avoid \r\n  undue delays); 5 Am.Jur.2d Appellate Review Â§Â§ 303-310 (1995).\r\nAccordingly, we reaffirm the rationale and principles expressed in Coward \r\n  Hund, Quality Trailer, and Collins Music.Â  An appeal may be \r\n  barred due to untimely service of the notice of appeal when a party - instead \r\n  of serving a notice of appeal - files a successive Rule 59(e) motion, where \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the first Rule 59(e) motion does not result in a \r\n  substantial alteration of the original judgment.Â  Coward Hund.Â  An appeal \r\n  also may be barred due to untimely service of the notice of appeal when a party \r\n  - instead of serving a notice of appeal - recaptions a written JNOV/new trial \r\n  motion, which has been ruled on, and resubmits it as a virtually identical, \r\n  written Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Quality Trailer, Collins Music. \r\n  [2] \r\nWe have found no foreign case similarly postured to the present case or Matthews, \r\n  i.e., a case in which a court held a written Rule 59(e) motion following \r\n  an oral JNOV/new trial motion did not toll the time for appeal.Â  At least one \r\n  court has drawn a distinction between â€œperfunctoryâ€ oral motions made at the \r\n  end of trial and more thoughtful written post-trial motions, concluding the \r\n  former will not bar the latter or result in an appeal being dismissed as untimely.Â  \r\n  Sherrod v. Nash Gen. Hosp., Inc., 500 S.E.2d 708, 710-711 (N.C. 1998).\r\nAfter studied review, we reject the rationale and result reached by the Court \r\n  of Appeals in the present case and in Matthews.Â  We conclude a party \r\n  usually is free to file an initial Rule 59(e) motion, regardless of whether \r\n  the previous JNOV/new trial motions were made orally or in writing, without \r\n  unnecessary concern the repetition of an issue or argument made in a previous \r\n  motion will result in a subsequent appeal being dismissed as untimely.Â  In essence, \r\n  we view the use of oral or written JNOV/new trial motions, followed by an initial \r\n  Rule 59(e) motion, as part and parcel of a partyâ€™s â€œsingle bite at the appleâ€ \r\n  in presenting his case to the trial court.Â  Again, we caution a party who files \r\n  post-trial motions to note carefully the exceptions to this general rule as \r\n  expressed in Coward Hund, Quality Trailer and Collins Music. \r\n\r\nWe believe this view of the propriety of post-trial motions to be the correct \r\n  approach for several reasons.Â  First, it is proper to view a Rule 59(e) motion \r\n  not only as a vehicle to request the trial court â€œalter or amend the judgment,â€ \r\n  but also as a vehicle to seek â€œreconsiderationâ€ of issues and arguments.Â  A \r\n  motion under Rule 59(e) long has been viewed as â€œmotion for reconsiderationâ€ \r\n  despite the absence of those words from the rule.Â  Consequently, a party usually \r\n  is allowed to ask the court to reconsider its decision even if it means rehashing \r\n  all or part of an argument previously presented.Â  See, e.g., Arnold \r\n  v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992) (â€œpurpose of Rule 59(e), SCRCP, \r\n  to alter or amend the judgment is to request the judge to reconsider matters \r\n  properly encompassed in a decision on the meritsâ€); Curcio v. Caterpillar, \r\n  Inc., 355 S.C. 316, 585 S.E.2d 272 (2003) (an example of the many cases \r\n  in which trial and appellate courts describe a Rule 59(e) motion as a â€œmotion \r\n  to reconsiderâ€ or â€œmotion for reconsiderationâ€); James Flanagan, South Carolina \r\n  Civil Procedure 474-475 (2dÂ  ed. 1996).Â  There is nothing inherently \r\n  unfair in allowing a party one final chance not only to call the courtâ€™s attention \r\n  to a possible misapprehension of an earlier argument, but also to revisit a \r\n  previously raised argument.Â  It is inherently unfair to disallow such an opportunity.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 59(e) in the South Carolina and federal rules of civil procedure is practically \r\n  identical. [3] Â  Neither contains \r\n  any provision for a motion for â€œreconsideration.â€Â  However, federal courts consider \r\n  it appropriate for a party to make a â€œmotion for reconsiderationâ€ under Rule \r\n  59(e) even though the rule mentions only a â€œmotion to alter or amend a judgment.â€Â  \r\n  This view holds true even when a party mislabels a post-trial motion.Â  See \r\n  Blair v. Equifax Check Services, Inc., 181 F.3d 832, 837 (7th Cir. 1999) \r\n  (Rule 4(a)(4), FRAP, restates long-accepted practice of considering motions \r\n  forÂ  reconsideration, a practice independent of any appellate rule); 12 Mooreâ€™s \r\n  Federal Practice Â§ 59.30[2][a] and[7]; 11 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane Â§ 2810.1; \r\n  20 Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â§Â§ 304.13[2] and 304.13[4][b] (3d ed. 2003).Â  \r\n  â€œ[T]he wisdom of giving district courts the opportunity promptly to correct \r\n  their own alleged errors is all the justification neededâ€ for the practice of \r\n  freely allowing a motion for reconsideration.Â  Blair, 181 F.3d at 837. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the United States Supreme Court explicitly has described a motion \r\n  under federal Rule 59(e) as one which â€œinvolves reconsideration of matters \r\n  properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.â€Â  Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; \r\n  Whinney, 489 U.S. 169, 174, 109 S.Ct. 987, 990, 103 L.Ed.2d 146, 154 (1989) \r\n  (a request relating to discretionary prejudgment interest is a part of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  compensation and thus a part of the decision on the merits, which means a Rule \r\n  59(e) motion raising prejudgment interest tolled the time for appeal; Court \r\n  cited precedent in which Rule 59(e) motions relating to attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  case costs are deemed collateral issues, thus such motions did not toll the \r\n  time for appeal) (emphasis added).Â  The Court explained its decision furthered \r\n  the goals of avoiding piecemeal appeals and fostering informed appellate review.Â  \r\n  Osterneck, 489 U.S. at 177-178, 109 S.Ct. at 992, 103 L.Ed.2d at 156.\r\nThe commentators explain that the approach taken in todayâ€™s rules allowing \r\n  a motion for reconsideration which addresses the merits of the case at hand \r\n  originated in the common law.Â  â€œIt is absolutely necessary to justice, \r\n  that there should, upon many occasions, be opportunities of reconsidering \r\n  the cause by a new trial.â€Â  11 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane Â§ 2801 (quoting a 1757 \r\n  opinion written by an English judge) (emphasis in original); 12 Mooreâ€™s Federal \r\n  Practice Â§ 59 App. 102 (even before 1946 amendment adding subdivision (e) \r\n  to Rule 59, courts routinely found that motions seeking such relief as rehearing \r\n  or reconsideration were proper under Rule 59, although the motions were not \r\n  literally or technically motions for a new trial).\r\nSecond, a great number of reported cases in South Carolina for at least four \r\n  generations, and more recently the appellate court rules and rules of civil \r\n  procedure, have emphasized the importance and absolute necessity of ensuring \r\n  that all issues and arguments are presented to the lower court for its consideration.Â  \r\n  Issues and arguments are preserved for appellate review only when they are raised \r\n  to and ruled on by the lower court.Â  E.g., Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, \r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue \r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Long \r\n  v. Dunlap, 87 S.C. 8, 68 S.E. 801 (1910) (Supreme Court will not consider \r\n  any point which was not presented and considered below unless it involves jurisdiction \r\n  of the court); Gaffney v. Peeler, 21 S.C. 55 (1884) (question of law \r\n  which was not presented to or passed upon by the trial court cannot be raised \r\n  on appeal); Rule 210(c), SCACR (record on appeal shall not include matter which \r\n  was not presented to lower court).\r\nIn recently clarifying the law on the presentation and use of additional sustaining \r\n  grounds in an appeal, we emphasized we did not â€œmean to dilute the important \r\n  principle that all parties should raise all necessary issues and arguments to \r\n  the lower court and attempt to obtain a ruling.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of \r\n  Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 421, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000); [4]  see also Jean Hoefer Toal, \r\n  et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina 55-60 (2002).\r\nThird, our rules contemplate two basic situations in which a party should consider \r\n  filing a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  A party may wish to file such a motion when \r\n  she believes the court has misunderstood, failed to fully consider, or perhaps \r\n  failed to rule on an argument or issue, and the party wishes for the court to \r\n  reconsider or rule on it.Â  A party must file such a motion when an issue \r\n  or argument has been raised, but not ruled on, in order to preserve it for appellate \r\n  review.\r\nFourth, South Carolina appellate courts do not recognize the â€œplain error rule,â€ \r\n  under which a court in certain circumstances is allowed to consider and rectify \r\n  an error not raised below by the party.Â  Dykema v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, \r\n  P.C., 348 S.C. 549, 554, 560 S.E.2d 894, 896 (2002); Kennedy v. South \r\n  Carolina Retirement System, 349 S.C. 531, 564 S.E.2d 322 (2001).Â  Our mandatory \r\n  preservation requirements make it doubly important that litigants generally \r\n  be freely allowed to file a first, written Rule 59(e) motion without concern \r\n  a later appeal will be deemed untimely.\r\nFifth, civil procedure and appellate rules should not be written or interpreted \r\n  to create a trap for the unwary lawyer or party, but a careful consideration \r\n  of this issue has led us to conclude that is precisely the effect of an unwarranted \r\n  expansion of Quality Trailer.Â  Cf. Gamble v. State, 298 \r\n  S.C. 176, 379 S.E.2d 118 (1989) (stating rules applicable to post-conviction \r\n  relief actions should not be construed in manner which operate as a trap for \r\n  the unwary or deprive an applicant of the adjudication on the merits of his \r\n  original petition); Rule 1, SCRCP (civil procedure rules â€œshall be construed \r\n  to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every actionâ€).\r\nIf a party is unsure whether he properly raised all issues and obtained a ruling, \r\n  he must file a Rule 59(e) motion or an appellate court may later determine the \r\n  issue or argument is not preserved for review.Â  But in filing the motion, he \r\n  may unwittingly forfeit the right to an appeal if an appellate court later determines \r\n  the Rule 59(e) motion was unnecessary because he already had raised the issue \r\n  and obtained a ruling.Â  We strive to avoid an interpretation of procedural rules \r\n  which routinely would place a party between the proverbial rock and a hard place. [5] \r\nTurning to the present case, SCDOT argued, inter alia, in its first, \r\n  written Rule 59(e) motion, which followed oral JNOV/new trial motions made immediately \r\n  after the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court misapplied the appropriate standard \r\n  for notice.Â  SCDOT asserted that notice of a hazard is â€œinterruptedâ€ by responsive \r\n  action to correct the defect.Â  SCDOT contended, although the trial court had \r\n  instructed the jury correctly on its notice theory, the court in denying SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  JNOV/new trial motions considered evidence of notice at any time sufficient \r\n  to create a factual issue for the jury, regardless of whether the notice occurred \r\n  before or after the remedial work.Â  SCDOT in its Rule 59(e) motion also raised \r\n  other issues and arguments it had previously addressed in its JNOV/new trial \r\n  motions.\r\nWhile SCDOT in its written Rule 59(e) motion may have revisited some issues \r\n  and arguments raised in its oral JNOV/new trial motions, we conclude the Rule \r\n  59(e) motion was proper for the reasons we explain today.Â  This case is not \r\n  factually similar to Coward Hund because it involves a first, written \r\n  Rule 59(e) motion, not a second one.Â  It is not factually similar to Quality \r\n  Trailer or Collins Music because SCDOT did not simply resubmit a \r\n  virtually identical, written Rule 59(e) motion raising the same issues on which \r\n  it already had obtained a ruling by virtue of a previous, written JNOV/new trial \r\n  motion.\r\nSCDOT timely served its notice of appeal within thirty days after receipt of \r\n  written notice of entry of the order denying its Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Consequently, \r\n  we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ order dismissing SCDOTâ€™s appeal as untimely.Â  \r\n  We also overrule Matthews, 357 S.C. 594, 594 S.E.2d 177, because it is \r\n  inconsistent with the view of post-trial motions we set forth today.\r\nII.Â  Denial of SCDOTâ€™s motions \r\nIn the interest of judicial economy, we address the merits of SCDOTâ€™s appeal.Â  \r\n  See Floyd v. Horry County School Dist., 351 S.C. 233, 234, 569 \r\n  S.E.2d 343, 344 (2002); Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 \r\n  S.C. 315, 328, 566 S.E.2d 536, 543 (2002).\r\nSCDOT argues (1) the trial court erred in denying its motion for new trial \r\n  absolute based upon the excessiveness of the verdict; (2) the trial court erred \r\n  in denying itâ€™s motion for leave to amend to assert the statutory defense of \r\n  immunity for design; and (3) the trial court erred in denying its motions for \r\n  a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict based upon the absence \r\n  of proof of causative negligence on the part of SCDOT and the absence of notice \r\n  of defect to SCDOT after its remedial actions and prior to Elamâ€™s accident.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWhen considering a motion for a new trial based on the inadequacy or excessiveness \r\n  of the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court must distinguish between awards that \r\n  are merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, \r\n  caprice, or prejudice.Â  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 431 \r\n  S.E.2d 557 (1993).Â  The decision to grant or deny a new trial absolute based \r\n  on the excessiveness of a verdict rests in the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  court and will not ordinarily be disturbed on appeal.Â  South Carolina State \r\n  Highway Depâ€™t v. Clarkson, 267 S.C. 121, 226 S.E.2d 696 (1976).Â  We conclude \r\n  the record reflects the jury was presented with uncontradicted evidence that, \r\n  as a result of the accident, Elam suffered physical and mental injuries sufficient \r\n  to support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in denying SCDOTâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute based on the amount of the \r\n  verdict.Â Â  \r\nFurther, the trial court did not err in denying SCDOTâ€™s motion for leave to \r\n  amend to assert the statutory defense of immunity of design.Â  During Elamâ€™s \r\n  case in chief, SCDOT moved the trial court to allow it to amend its answer to \r\n  assert the design defense of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(15) (Supp. 2003).Â  SCDOT \r\n  sought to amend its answer to conform to the evidence presented that the water \r\n  on the roadway, which allegedly caused Elamâ€™s accident, was a result of an inadequate \r\n  drainage pipe.Â  The trial court ruled there was no competent evidence the water \r\n  on the highway was due to a design error.Â  The decision whether to allow a party \r\n  to amend a pleading to conform to the evidence is left to the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial judge.Â  Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 313 S.C. 98, 431 S.E.2d \r\n  587 (1993).Â  We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying \r\n  SCDOTâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nFinally, we find no error on the part of the trial judge in denying SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  motions for a directed verdict and JNOV based on the absence of negligence on \r\n  the part of SCDOT.Â  When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict \r\n  or JNOV, an appellate court must employ the same standard as the trial court \r\n  by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Strange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; \r\n  Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994).Â  The appellate court \r\n  will reverse the trial court only where there is no evidence to support the \r\n  ruling below.Â  Id.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Elam, it isÂ  reasonably \r\n  inferable the jury could find SCDOTâ€™s negligence caused the accident.Â  The jury \r\n  heard the testimony of several witnesses, including SCDOTâ€™s former resident \r\n  maintenance engineer for Allendale County, who testified SCDOT had actual notice \r\n  the site of Elamâ€™s accident was a flood hazard.Â  Sergeant G.F. King, a trooper \r\n  with the South Carolina Highway Patrol, testified there had been numerous accidents \r\n  during the past eight years at the same location.Â  Sergeant King testified he \r\n  had reported the condition to SCDOT on numerous occasions. Given the testimony \r\n  of these witnesses and others, the jury could reasonably have found SCDOT negligent \r\n  in failing to properly maintain the highway.\r\nSCDOT argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict \r\n  and JNOV based on the absence of notice of the defect after the departmentâ€™s \r\n  remedial work actions and prior to Elamâ€™s accident.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling the evidence presented a jury question on whether SCDOT took any remedial \r\n  actions.Â  See Strange, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reaffirm the principles set forth in Coward Hund, 336 S.C. 1, 518 \r\n  S.E.2d 56; Quality Trailer, 349 S.C. 216, 562 S.E.2d 615; and Collins \r\n  Music, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524.Â  We reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ order \r\n  in the present case and overrule the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Matthews, \r\n  357 S.C. 594, 594 S.E.2d 177.Â  We conclude SCDOT timely served its notice of \r\n  appeal after receipt of written notice of entry of the order denying its Rule \r\n  59(e) motion.\r\nOn the merits of SCDOTâ€™s appeal, the trial court did not err in denying SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend its answer or its motions for a directed verdict, JNOV, and \r\n  new trial.Â  Accordingly, we reinstate the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Elam and \r\n  remand this case to circuit court for entry of judgment on the verdict.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J., concur.Â  WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate \r\n  opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE WALLER: Â I respectfully dissent.Â  \r\n  In my opinion, SCDOTâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion, raising the same issues orally raised \r\n  to and ruled upon in its motions for directed verdict, JNOV, and a new trial, \r\n  did not stay the time for filing a notice of appeal.Â  I would affirm the Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ holding that SCDOTâ€™s appeal was untimely.Â  \r\nPost-trial motions are required in two primary \r\n  circumstances:Â  to preserve issues that have been raised to the trial court \r\n  but not yet ruled upon or when the trial court grants relief not requested or \r\n  rules on an issue never raised at trial.Â  Jean Hoefer Toal, et al, Appellate \r\n  Practice in South Carolina 59-60 (2d ed. 2002).Â  Issues are preserved for \r\n  appeal even where a JNOV motion is denied in a form order, if the issues have \r\n  been adequately raised and argued to the court and the record on appeal contains \r\n  transcripts of the court proceedings.Â  Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nHere, SCDOT repeatedly argued its position to the \r\n  trial court: in its directed verdict motion, in renewing its directed verdict \r\n  motion, in its motion for JNOV, and in its motion for a new trial.Â  Each time \r\n  the trial judge denied SCDOTâ€™s motions.Â  Two years ago, in Quality Trailer \r\n  Products v. CSL Equipment Co. Inc., 349 S.C. 216, 565 S.E.2d 615 (2002), \r\n  we held the filing of a successive motion, raising issues already raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge, does not stay the time to appeal.Â Â  Nothing \r\n  in Quality Trailer limited our holding to the filing of written \r\n  post-trial motions.Â  In my opinion, once a litigant has fully argued, either \r\n  orally or in writing, its post-trial motions to a judge, and obtained a ruling \r\n  thereon, there is simply no need to permit the same exact arguments to be re-raised \r\n  in a subsequent Rule 59(e) motion.Â Â  \r\nI would hold SCDOT had its one full bite at the \r\n  apple such that the filing of its written Rule 59(e) motion did not stay the \r\n  time for filing an appeal in this case.Â  I would affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion.  [6] \r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (Supp. 2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  We are aware that a party may \r\n    attempt to file both a Rule 59 motion and a notice of appeal.Â  If this does \r\n    occur, one or the other will be inappropriate depending on whether the motion \r\n    is both timely under Rule 59 and permissible under our ruling today.Â  Cf. \r\n    Hudson v. Hudson, 290 S.C. 215, 349 S.E.2d 341 (1986) (holding that \r\n    when a timely post-trial motion is pending before the lower court, any notice \r\n    of appeal will be dismissed without prejudice as premature).Â  It is, of course, \r\n    the partyâ€™s responsibility to determine whether a Rule 59 motion or notice \r\n    of appeal is appropriate under the facts of the case, and we caution parties \r\n    not to attempt to avoid this responsibility by the simple expedient of filing \r\n    both.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, provides:\r\n    Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment.Â  A motion to alter or amend the judgment \r\n    shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of \r\n    the entry of the order.\r\n  Rule 59(e), FRCP, provides:\r\n    Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment.Â  Any motion to alter or amend a judgment \r\n    shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\r\n  \r\n \r\n   [4] Â  In discussing the need for a \r\n    Rule 59(e) motion, we explained that\r\n\r\n\r\n  [t]he losing party must first try to convince the lower court it \r\n    has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the appellate court \r\n    that the lower court erred. This principle underlies the long-established \r\n    preservation requirement that the losing party generally must both present \r\n    his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling before an \r\n    appellate court will review those issues and arguments. . . .\r\n  If the losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but \r\n    the court fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or \r\n    amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review. . \r\n    . . Imposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable \r\n    the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, \r\n    law, and arguments.Â  The requirement also serves as a keen incentive for a \r\n    party to prepare a case thoroughly.Â  It prevents a party from keeping an ace \r\n    card up his sleeve - intentionally or by chance - in the hope that an appellate \r\n    court will accept that ace card and, via a reversal, give him another opportunity \r\n    to prove his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Iâ€™On, 338 S.C. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â  We are presented in \r\n    this case with a party which believed a Rule 59(e) motion was necessary and \r\n    appropriate.Â  We do not mean to imply by our emphasis on the potential importance \r\n    of such a motion that one is necessary or desirable in every case.Â  An aggrieved \r\n    party who is confident his issues and arguments were sufficiently raised to \r\n    and ruled on by the trial court may wish to simply file and serve a timely \r\n    notice of appeal.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] Â  I would also affirm the opinion in Matthews \r\n    v.

Cordell Maddox, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25870\r\n  Submitted May 13, 2004 - Filed September 13, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General \r\n          John W.

Pachak, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  Respondent was convicted of murder and sentenced to \r\n  life imprisonment.Â  Respondent filed an application for post-conviction relief \r\n  (PCR), which was granted on a number of grounds.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s \r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  We hold there is probative evidence to support \r\n  the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 10, 1992, Bobby Marler was found robbed \r\n  and beaten to death in his pawnshop in Laurens.Â  In early 1993, Thomas E. Whitehead, \r\n  Jr. gave police a statement about the murder, implicating respondent.Â  From \r\n  February 1993 to February 1994, Whitehead gave four vastly different statements \r\n  to police, and was eventually promised by the Sheriffâ€™s Department that he would \r\n  not be charged with murder in return for his testimony. [1] \r\nÂ In Whiteheadâ€™s first statement, which he made on February 26, 1993, Whitehead \r\n  told police that Jaime McAlister and respondent committed the crime.Â  Whitehead \r\n  told police that he was not involved.Â  Whitehead claimed respondent told him \r\n  he and McAlister originally went to Marlerâ€™s pawnshop to buy marijuana, but \r\n  that the two ended up robbing and killing Marler.Â  However, McAlister was in \r\n  jail on the night of the murder, and could not have been involved.Â  Further, \r\n  Whitehead admitted at trial that police suggested to him that McAlister was \r\n  involved.\r\nIn the second statement, made on November 22, 1993, \r\n  Whitehead again claimed McAlister and respondent committed the crime.Â  Whitehead \r\n  told police respondent and McAlister used a baseball bat to beat Marler, and \r\n  that he saw a silver baseball bat in the hatchback of Matt Cagleâ€™s \r\n  [2]  car.Â  Whitehead also claimed respondent used the money from the robbery \r\n  to buy cocaine. Whitehead admitted at trial that the statement was false.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWhitehead made a third statement on February 8, \r\n  1994.Â  In that statement, Whitehead again implicated respondent and McAlister.Â  \r\n  It appears that shortly after the third statement, police finally discovered \r\n  McAlister was incarcerated the night of the murder and could not have been involved.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe sheriffâ€™s office promised Whitehead that he \r\n  would not be charged with murder before Whitehead provided the fourth statement \r\n  in late February 1994. [3] Â  In \r\n  the fourth statement, Whitehead admitted he was involved, and told police substantially \r\n  the same story that he told at trial.Â  Â \r\nWhitehead testified at trial that he, respondent, and Matt Cagle drank beer \r\n  and liquor at respondentâ€™s house and in Cagleâ€™s car on the day of the murder.Â  \r\n  When they needed money to buy more alcohol, the three decided to pawn respondentâ€™s \r\n  .22 rifle.Â  Whitehead testified that while Cagle stayed in the car, he and respondent \r\n  went into Marlerâ€™s pawnshop.Â  When Marler opened his wallet to pay for the rifle, \r\n  he and respondent noticed that Marler had a substantial amount of money.Â  Whitehead \r\n  testified that respondent pushed Marler to the floor and beat him in the head \r\n  and chest with the rifle butt.Â  The two grabbed Marlerâ€™s wallet and fled.Â  The \r\n  next day, after spending the night at respondentâ€™s house, Whitehead, Cagle, \r\n  and respondent went to Cagleâ€™s house and put the gun in Cagleâ€™s fatherâ€™s furnace \r\n  to melt it down. [4] \r\nDuring the presentation of respondentâ€™s case, respondentâ€™s mother testified \r\n  that he was in night school at the time of the murder, and that she picked him \r\n  up after school that evening.Â  However, the school did not have any attendance \r\n  records because respondent was auditing his classes.Â  Respondentâ€™s mother also \r\n  testified that Whitehead and Cagle did not spend the night at her house as Whitehead \r\n  had claimed in his testimony.Â  \r\nCagle testified he was not involved in the murder. Â Cagle testified he went \r\n  to a birthday party in Greenville on the night of January 9, 1992, and spent \r\n  the night there because he was too drunk to drive home.Â  Several other witnesses \r\n  corroborated Cagleâ€™s testimony, including Christopher Thornhill, who testified \r\n  he remembered the date because it was his birthday.Â  \r\nAngela McAlister testified at trial that sometime after the murder, Whitehead \r\n  visited her son, [5]  who was \r\n  ill.Â  She testified that she stood in the hall and overheard Whitehead tell \r\n  her son that he should have killed a man named Bob Holmes and that he â€œ[c]ouldâ€™ve \r\n  gotten away with it because him and his daddy did because of the old fart they \r\n  murdered . . . out in front of the Wal-Mart.â€ [6] Â  \r\nRespondent also presented the testimony of William Anthony Patterson, who stated \r\n  that he operated the furnace Whitehead claimed was used to melt the gun.Â  Patterson \r\n  testified that the furnace was not installed until March 1992.Â  Cagleâ€™s father \r\n  corroborated Pattersonâ€™s testimony, and also added that the furnace did not \r\n  have a propane tank attached until April 1992.Â  An employee with PNG Propane \r\n  testified that he installed a propane tank for an aluminum smelter for Cagleâ€™s \r\n  father on March 17, 1992, and that there were no other gas lines in place on \r\n  that date.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe State also presented testimony from Gary Gleen.Â  Gleen testified at trial \r\n  that respondent confessed to him while the two were incarcerated at the Broad \r\n  River Correctional Facility.Â  Gleen described himself as a â€œparalegal,â€ and \r\n  testified that he and respondent first discussed the charges in the Monticello \r\n  Dormitory in Broad River.Â  Gleen testified that respondent initially denied \r\n  he was involved in the murder.Â  \r\nHowever, Gleen testified that after the two were \r\n  transferred to the Saluda Dormitory, respondent discussed the case with him \r\n  again and admitted he murdered Marler.Â  Gleen testified that he was in cell \r\n  106, and that respondent was in another cell, which was ten feet away, \r\n  when the conversations took place.Â  Gleen testified that respondent told him, \r\n  â€œYeah, well, I killed a man but they ainâ€™t got nothing on me.â€Â  Gleen admitted \r\n  others could overhear the conversations, but claimed he and respondent â€œwould \r\n  pull ourselves closer so that the voice would only carry towards each other,â€ \r\n  and that he and respondent simply stopped talking when guards or inmates would \r\n  pass.Â  \r\nUsing notes, Gleen testified that respondent knew \r\n  Whitehead had given police a statement, but that respondent thought he could \r\n  â€œbeat the crimeâ€ because witnesses would testify he was at school when the murder \r\n  occurred.Â  Gleen testified that respondent told him he did not have any intention \r\n  of killing Marler, but that Marler â€œgot smart and acted like he wouldnâ€™t take \r\n  the gun.â€Â  Gleen testified that respondent showed him how he beat Marler and \r\n  told him how he melted down the gun after the murder.Â  Gleen further testified \r\n  that respondent had a â€œgleam in his eyeâ€ when he talked about he murder.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge err in finding that counsel was ineffective for failing \r\n    to present evidence regarding the distance between Gleen and respondentâ€™s \r\n    cells?\r\n\r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in finding that counsel was ineffective \r\n  for failing to present evidence that respondentâ€™s conversations with Gleen were \r\n  impossible.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction \r\n  proceeding to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, \r\n  286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  In order to establish a claim \r\n  of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, a PCR applicant must prove that: \r\n  (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced \r\n  the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); \r\n  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â  To show \r\n  that counsel was deficient, the applicant must establish that counsel failed \r\n  to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms.Â  \r\n  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.Â  To show prejudice, the applicant must show \r\n  that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability the result \r\n  of the trial would have been different.Â  Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, \r\n  186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  A reasonable probability is a probability \r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.Â  Id. at 186, \r\n  480 S.E.2d at 735.\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings when matters of credibility are involved.Â  Drayton v. Evatt, \r\n  312 S.C. 4, 13, 430 S.E.2d 517, 522 (1993).Â  The existence in the record of \r\n  any evidence of probative value is sufficient to uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\n  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109-10, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  \r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, respondent testified that he and Gleen were both inmates \r\n  in Saluda Dormitory at the Broad River Correctional Facility. Respondent admitted \r\n  that he talked to Gleen about the case.Â  However, respondent maintained that \r\n  he told Gleen he did not commit the crime.Â  Respondent testified that it was \r\n  impossible for the conversation to have taken place as Gleen maintained, and \r\n  that the distance between the cells was approximately thirty-five feet, not \r\n  ten feet.Â  Respondent further testified that there were seventy inmates in Saluda \r\n  Dormitory when he was incarcerated there.Â  Respondent then presented a videotape \r\n  of the prison dormitory to show the noise level in the dormitory and the distance \r\n  between the cells. [7] Â Â  \r\nRicky Higgs testified at the PCR hearing that he \r\n  and respondent were next door to each other in segregated lockup in Saluda Dormitory.Â  \r\n  Higgs stated that respondentâ€™s cell was approximately thirty-five feet from \r\n  Gleenâ€™s cell, and that the noise in Saluda was â€œdeafeningâ€ at times.Â  Higgs \r\n  testified that, while it was possible to have a conversation with someone in \r\n  the next cell because of shared ventilation systems, one would have to yell \r\n  to be heard by someone in another cell.Â  Higgs testified that he heard respondent \r\n  and Gleen yelling across the breezeway about respondentâ€™s case.Â  However, Higgs \r\n  stated that respondent never confessed to Gleen. \r\nTrial counsel testified that Gleen was not listed \r\n  as a witness in the initial discovery response and that he was not aware Gleen \r\n  would testify until a short time before the trial.Â  Trial counsel remembered \r\n  discussing with respondent that it was physically impossible to have the discussion \r\n  Gleen described because of the layout of Saluda Dormitory.Â  However, counsel \r\n  did not cross-examine Gleen about the configuration of the cells, and he failed \r\n  to present any evidence about the setup of Saluda Dormitory.Â  \r\nThe PCR judge found that the videotape showed respondentâ€™s \r\n  cell was one hundred feet away from Gleenâ€™s, and it was therefore impossible \r\n  for the conversation to have taken place as Gleen alleged.Â  The PCR judge found \r\n  that if this evidence had been presented at trial, it would have had a significant \r\n  impact on the credibility of Gleen, who was a key witness for the State.Â  The \r\n  PCR judge also ruled that the evidence would have been available at trial if \r\n  trial counsel had made diligent efforts to obtain it.Â  Finally, the PCR judge \r\n  found there was a reasonable probability the result at trial would have been \r\n  different had trial counsel presented the evidence to the jury.Â  \r\nEven conceding that respondent engaged in some conversations with Gleen, it \r\n  is highly unlikely that respondent confessed to murder across a cellblock from \r\n  a distance of thirty-five to one hundred feet.Â  There was evidence at the PCR \r\n  hearing that numerous other inmates and guards would have overheard respondent, \r\n  as it would have been necessary to shout over the television and other noise.Â  \r\n  Additionally, counsel admitted that he was somewhat unprepared for Gleenâ€™s testimony, \r\n  and counsel failed to refute Gleenâ€™s assertion that the cells were no more than \r\n  ten feet apart at trial.Â  See Davis v. State, 326 S.C. 283, 288, \r\n  486 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1997) (evidence supported PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that counsel \r\n  was deficient, in part because counsel admitted he was unprepared for trial).\r\nWhile we acknowledge that this is a close case, there is at least some probative \r\n  evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  We agree with the PCR judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  that, had counsel presented evidence that the jail cells were more than a mere \r\n  ten feet apart, there is a reasonable probability the result at trial would \r\n  have been different.Â  This evidence was particularly important in light of the \r\n  fact that the case against respondent was far from overwhelming, and consisted \r\n  almost entirely of the testimony of Whitehead, a codefendant who implicated \r\n  an innocent man in three false statements, and Gleen, a jailhouse snitch.Â  Additionally, \r\n  we note that there was evidence presented at trial and at PCR that Whitehead \r\n  told several people that he and his father committed the crime and that respondent \r\n  was not involved.Â  Further, the jury returned during deliberations and actually \r\n  asked the trial judge â€œwho was on trialâ€ in the case. \r\n  [8] Â  The trial judge simply told the jury that respondent was on trial. [9]  \r\nAccordingly, we hold there is probative evidence \r\n  to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that counsel was deficient for failing to \r\n  present evidence of the cell configuration.Â  See Caprood, id. \r\n  at 109-10, 525 S.E.2d at 517; Webb v. State, 281 S.C. 237, 238, 314 S.E.2d \r\n  839, 839 (1984). Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that counsel was \r\n  ineffective for failing to present evidence regarding the configuration of the \r\n  cells.Â  Accordingly, we need not address the Stateâ€™s remaining questions.Â  See \r\n  Futch v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Assistant Deputy \r\n          Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary \r\n          Counsel. \r\n        George H. Oâ€™Kelley, Jr., of Beaufort, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of either an admonition or \r\n  a public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept \r\n  the agreement and impose a public reprimand, the most severe sanction we are \r\n  able to impose under the circumstances.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement \r\n  are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was an associate municipal judge for the City of Beaufort from approximately \r\n  1996 until his resignation in October 2003.Â  Among other things, his duties \r\n  as associate judge required him to adjudicate parking tickets.Â  \r\nIn Beaufort, the recipient of a parking ticket may either pay the fine or appear \r\n  in court to contest the ticket.Â  If the violator chooses to pay the fine, he \r\n  or she may remit payment by mail, take it to City Hall, or place the ticket \r\n  and payment in courtesy boxes located on certain parking meters.Â  Police Officer \r\n  John Oâ€™Neill, who is assigned parking enforcement duties in the downtown district, \r\n  collects the tickets and payments from the courtesy boxes and delivers them \r\n  to City Hall.Â  \r\nODC is informed that violators who appear in court to contest a parking ticket \r\n  are heard last and, unless they are repeat offenders, usually have the charge \r\n  dismissed (i.e., reduced to a warning).Â  This disposition is indicated by the \r\n  presiding judge writing â€œwarningâ€ across the ticket along with his or her signature.\r\nPolice officers have no further contact with a parking ticket after it is issued.Â  \r\n  Police officers do not appear in court against violators who wish to contest \r\n  parking tickets and do not know whether tickets are contested, paid, or dismissed, \r\n  except that Officer Oâ€™Neill has some knowledge which tickets are paid when he \r\n  retrieves tickets from the courtesy boxes. \r\nIn October 2003, while retrieving tickets from the courtesy boxes, Officer \r\n  Oâ€™Neill noticed particular tickets signed by respondent had been marked â€œwarningâ€ \r\n  and placed in a courtesy box.Â  Officer Oâ€™Neill recognized the tickets as those \r\n  he had issued two days in a row to a Volvo bearing South Carolina license 120KMP \r\n  and which he knew was usually driven by respondentâ€™s wife.Â  Officer Oâ€™Neill \r\n  brought this to the attention of the City Manager, who brought it to the attention \r\n  of the Chief Municipal Judge and City Attorney.Â  An inquiry was made as to other \r\n  parking tickets issued to this tag number.Â  It was determined that fourteen \r\n  additional tickets had been issued to the above-referenced vehicle.Â  Thirteen \r\n  of those fourteen tickets also had been dismissed by respondent.Â  The fourteenth \r\n  ticket had been unpaid for over three years.Â  \r\nAn emergency session of the Beaufort City Council was convened to consider \r\n  this matter.Â  Respondent acknowledged having dismissed the above-referenced \r\n  tickets.Â  By a 3-2 vote, the City Council asked respondent to submit his resignation.Â  \r\n  Respondent resigned.\r\nRespondent self-reported this matter to ODC.Â  ODC made an examination of 1) \r\n  parking tickets issued to other vehicles owned by respondent and 2) all parking \r\n  tickets dismissed by respondent during the period of January 2001 until his \r\n  resignation in October 2003.Â  The investigation revealed: \r\n\r\n   \r\n    1.\r\n    \r\n    Five tickets were issued to respondentâ€™s other \r\n      vehicles.Â  Four of these tickets were dismissed by respondent and one was \r\n      marked â€œvoidâ€ by the issuing officer.Â  The voided ticket had been issued \r\n      when respondent blocked-in a vehicle which had parked unlawfully in the \r\n      space respondent reserves from the City.Â  Two of the dismissed tickets were \r\n      tickets issued to respondent while he was parked in his reserved space, \r\n      but in a vehicle which did not have the reserved parking placard affixed \r\n      to the rear view mirror.Â  The remaining two tickets dismissed by respondent \r\n      were for meter violations in the vicinity of his law office.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    2.\r\n    During the period from January 2001 through October \r\n      2003,Â fifty-five additional parking tickets were marked â€œwarningâ€ byÂ Â  respondent.Â  \r\n      Because tickets dismissed in court are marked in the same manner, it is \r\n      impossible to distinguish which of these tickets were marked â€œwarningâ€ prior \r\n      to a court appearance by the violator and which were marked â€œwarningâ€ as \r\n      a result of a court appearance.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n On May 6, 2004, respondent was interviewed about the fifty-five additional \r\n  tickets and he stated the following:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Some of the violators were not known to respondent.Â  \r\n      Respondent assumes these are tickets where the violator appeared in court \r\n      and the tickets were reduced to a warning in accordance with the customary \r\n      practice apparently acceptable to the City Police.Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    \r\n    Some violators were known to respondent, but \r\n      he had noÂ  recollection of having dismissed the tickets outside court and, \r\n      therefore, assumes these violators appeared in court to contest the tickets.\r\n      Â  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n     Ten violators were known to respondent and respondent \r\n      acknowledges he probably marked fifteen tickets issued to these violators \r\n      as â€œwarningsâ€ outside of court.Â  These tickets were issued to respondentâ€™s \r\n      relatives, employees, and his acquaintances. \r\n  \r\n\r\nOf the seventy-six parking tickets examined by ODC, thirty-four were dismissed \r\n  by respondent outside of court.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following Canons of the Code \r\n  of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance \r\n  of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply \r\n  with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence \r\n  in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not \r\n  allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge's \r\n  judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial \r\n  office impartially and diligently); and Canon 3(B)(7) (judge shall not initiate, \r\n  permit, or consider ex partecommunications, or consider other communications \r\n  made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending proceeding).Â  \r\n  By violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has also violated Rule \r\n  7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand. \r\n  [1] Â  Accordingly, respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    As previously noted, a public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court \r\n    can impose when a judge no longer holds judicial office.Â

alleged errors made during a medical malpractice \r\n  trial.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRespondent-Appellant, Nellie Durham (Durham), was \r\n  referred to Appellant-Respondent, Dr. David Vinson (Dr. Vinson), for a surgical \r\n  evaluation after being diagnosed with acid reflux and a hiatal hernia.Â  On October \r\n  26, 1996, Dr. Vinson attempted to repair the hernia by performing a laparoscopic \r\n  Nissen fundoplication (LNF)â€”an advanced form of laparoscopic surgery.Â  During \r\n  the LNF, Dr. Vinson did not â€œtake downâ€ the short gastric vessels, which would \r\n  have prevented the repair from being too tight. \r\nInitially, Durham appeared to respond well to the surgery, but then she began \r\n  to have trouble swallowing and began to vomit.Â  An esophagram, performed on \r\n  October 28, revealed that food particles were dispersed throughout the esophagus \r\n  and that the esophagus was not completely clearing the barium used in the esophagram.Â  \r\n  As a result, Dr. Vinson performed an esophageal gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on \r\n  Durham the next day.Â  During the EGD, Durhamâ€™s gag reflex was suppressed.Â  Whether \r\n  Durham aspirated [1]  during this \r\n  procedure or during the repair surgery conducted the next day became an issue \r\n  at trial.Â  It was clear, however, that Durham aspirated while under the care \r\n  of Dr. Vinson, and that, most likely, this aspiration occurred during the EGD.\r\nOn October 30, Dr. Vinson performed a repair LNF on Durham.Â  During this surgery, \r\n  Dr. Vinson took down the short gastric vessels.Â  Dr. Vinson also instructed \r\n  Diane Hardy, a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, to advance a dilator \r\n  down Durhamâ€™s esophagus during the surgery, even though Hardy protested three \r\n  times that it was too tight.Â  Hardy followed Dr. Vinsonâ€™s orders and, as a result, \r\n  Durhamâ€™s esophagus was perforated.Â  When the perforation occurred, Dr. Vinson \r\n  switched from performing the procedure laparoscopically to performing an open \r\n  procedure in order to repair the perforation.\r\nAfter the repair LNF surgery, Durham could not breathe without mechanical assistance \r\n  and was transferred to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) at Oconee Hospital.Â  Durhamâ€™s \r\n  family did not learn Durham had aspirated and her esophagus had been perforated \r\n  until Durham was later moved to Greenville Memorial Hospital.Â  Dr. Vinson informed \r\n  the family that everything had gone well and that she was only in CCU as a precaution.\r\nWhile Durham was in CCU, her family requested that Dr. Vinson consult a pulmonologist.Â  \r\n  However, he did not do so.Â  Durhamâ€™s family also requested that she be moved \r\n  to Greenville Memorial Hospital, a better-equipped facility, but Dr. Vinson \r\n  advised against the transfer because he believed that she could be properly \r\n  cared for at Oconee Hospital.Â  Finally, after two days, the family obtained \r\n  the transfer order from a nurse.Â  Durham entered Greenville Memorial Hospital \r\n  and remained there for over two months, with her first month being spent in \r\n  the CCU.\r\nAs a result of Dr. Vinsonâ€™s treatment, Durham developed adult respiratory distress \r\n  syndrome and later, due to the complications stemming from her aspiration, developed \r\n  pulmonary fibrosis.Â  At present, Durham can only walk for very short distances \r\n  and requires supplemental oxygen twenty-four hours a day.\r\nDurham brought a medical malpractice action against Dr. Vinson.Â  After the \r\n  liability phase of the bifurcated trial, \r\n  [2]  the jury found Dr. Vinson was liable to Durham for $2,250,000 in actual \r\n  damages, and the jury found his conduct to be willful, wanton, or in reckless \r\n  disregard of Durhamâ€™s rights.Â  The trial then proceeded to the punitive damages \r\n  phase.Â  The jury awarded Durham $15,000,000 in punitive damages.\r\nFollowing post-trial motions, the trial court found the award did not violate \r\n  Dr. Vinsonâ€™s due process rights, but remitted the award to $8,000,000 on the \r\n  basis the award was merely liberal.\r\nDr. Vinson appeals the trial court decision, raising the following \r\n  issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err by allowing testimony during the liabilityÂ Â  \r\n      phase regarding Dr. Vinsonâ€™s hospital privileging file?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err by giving the jury a charge during \r\n      the liability phase that contained an incorrect discussion of the standard \r\n      of care in a medical malpractice action?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err by allowing, in the punitive damages \r\n      phase, the admission of evidence that Dr. Vinson prescribed valium to Durhamâ€™s \r\n      daughter?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hospital Privileging File\r\nDr. Vinson argues Durhamâ€™s counsel should not have \r\n  been allowed to question him about his failure to produce only a portion of \r\n  his hospital privileging file and then further prejudice him by mentioning this \r\n  failure in closing argument.Â  We agree but find the error harmless.Â  \r\nThe hospital privileging file contains information \r\n  related to a doctorâ€™s attempt to acquire certain privileges at the hospital, \r\n  such as the privilege to perform an LNF.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-20 (2001) provides, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  All proceedings of and all data and information acquired by the committee \r\n    referred to in Section 40-71-10 \r\n    [3]  in the exercise of its duties are confidential . . .Â  These proceedings \r\n    and documents are not subject to discovery, subpoena, or introduction into \r\n    evidence in any civil action . . . Information, documents, or records which \r\n    are otherwise available from original sources are not immune from discovery \r\n    or use in a civil action merely because they were presented during the committee \r\n    proceedings nor shall any complainant or witness before the committee be prevented \r\n    from testifying in a civil action as to matters of which he has knowledge \r\n    apart from the committee proceedings . . . .\r\n\r\nThe overriding public policy of the confidentiality statute is to encourage \r\n  health care professionals to monitor the competency and professional conduct \r\n  of their peers to safeguard and improve the quality of patient care.Â  McGee \r\n  v.

Sys., 312 S.C. 58, 61, 439 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1993).Â  The underlying \r\n  purpose behind the confidentiality statute is not to facilitate the prosecution \r\n  of civil actions, but to promote complete candor and open discussion among participants \r\n  in the peer review process.Â  Id.Â  In McGee, we further noted:\r\n\r\n  The policy of encouraging full candor in peer review proceedings is advanced \r\n    only if all documents considered by the committee . . . during the peer review \r\n    or credentialing process are protected.Â  Committee members and those providing \r\n    information to the committee must be able to operate without fear of reprisal.Â  \r\n    Similarly, it is essential that doctors seeking hospital privileges disclose \r\n    all pertinent information to the committee.Â  Physicians who fear that information \r\n    provided in an application might someday be used against them by a third party \r\n    will be reluctant to fully detail matters that the committee should consider.\r\n\r\nId. at 61-62, 439 S.E.2d at 259-260 (quoting \r\n  Cruger v. Love, 599 So.2d 111 (Fla. 1992)).\r\nWe concluded, however, that the outcome of the decision-making process is not \r\n  protected from discovery.Â  Therefore, a plaintiff is entitled to know the clinical \r\n  privileges either granted or denied by the hospital.Â  Id. at 63, 439 \r\n  S.E.2d at 260-261.\r\nDuring Durhamâ€™s direct examination of Dr. Vinson, \r\n  Dr. Vinson was asked about Durhamâ€™s medical records and the fact that they are \r\n  confidential.Â  He was also asked about the fact that Durham complied with his \r\n  request that she disclose her medical records.Â  Dr. Vinson was then asked:Â  \r\n  â€œCorrespondingly we requested that you provide us with the application and supporting \r\n  documents.â€Â  Dr. Vinsonâ€™s counsel objected and a discussion ensued outside the \r\n  hearing of the jury. \r\nDr. Vinson argued that the privileging file was confidential under McGee \r\n  and section 40-71-20 and that Durham was trying to create the impression that \r\n  he had something to hide.\r\nThe trial court found Dr. Vinson could be asked about the privileging file \r\n  but that the questions should be limited to whether Dr. Vinson authorized his \r\n  attorneys to disclose the results of the privileging file. [4] \r\nThe testimony then continued with Durhamâ€™s counsel asking Dr. Vinson whether \r\n  he was aware that his privileging file was confidential and could not be disclosed \r\n  without his consent.Â  Dr. Vinson responded yes to the questions.Â  Then, the \r\n  following exchange occurred:\r\n \r\n  Q:Â  And we on behalf of Mrs. Durham requested that you fully disclose the \r\n    results of your [privileging] file . . . however you only allowed the disclosure \r\n    of part of that file, is that correct?\r\n  \r\n    Mr. Gray:Â  Your Honor -\r\n      The Court:Â  Yes sir.\r\n      Mr. Gray:Â  Again I think thatâ€™s not a correct statement.\r\n      The Court:Â  . . . Iâ€™m going to overrule your objection . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n. . .\r\n \r\n  Q:Â Â  On behalf of . . . Durham we requested your entireâ€”that you fully disclose \r\n    the results of your . . . [privileging] file but you only authorized a portion \r\n    of that file to be produced, is that correct?\r\n  A:Â  Correct.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination by his counsel, Dr. Vinson stated there were no results \r\n  of the privileging process that were adverse to him.\r\nDuring closing argument, Durhamâ€™s counsel stated:\r\n\r\n  Let me mention about privileges.Â  It is true that Dr. Vinson was privileged \r\n    by Oconee Memorial Hospital to perform this surgery.Â  It is also true that \r\n    Dr. Vinson was privileged to perform surgical critical care.Â  Dr. Vinson submitted \r\n    certain information to Oconee Memorial Hospital.Â  One of the things he submitted \r\n    was a resume or what is referred to as a Curriculum Vitae.Â  This was submitted.Â  \r\n    He had a fellowship, surgical critical care.Â  Is there anywhere on that sheet \r\n    that says that critical care fellowship was unaccredited?Â  No.Â  Had it been, \r\n    would that have made a difference?Â  I donâ€™t know.Â  We havenâ€™t seen the \r\n    file but I think thatâ€™s an important deception.Â  The second thing Iâ€™d \r\n    like to point out is I donâ€™t know what Dr. Vinson told them about his training \r\n    in residency.Â  If he told them what was in the sworn statement to you ladies \r\n    and gentlemen of the jury, he did not have proctoring and under the regulations \r\n    he would have to have it or did he tell what he told his expert when he put \r\n    him on the standâ€”Iâ€™ve been trained.Â  I donâ€™t know.Â  If he told them something \r\n    that wasnâ€™t true they would have given privileges.\r\n\r\n(emphases added).Â  Durhamâ€™s counsel also stated, \r\n  â€œHe has tried to deceive everyone throughout this litigation and now heâ€™s trying \r\n  to commit the ultimate sin and thatâ€™s to deceive you ladies and gentlemen of \r\n  the jury.â€\r\nThe trial court erred by allowing Durhamâ€™s counsel to ask Dr. Vinson about \r\n  his failure to fully disclose his privileging file, a file that he was under \r\n  no obligation to disclose pursuant to section 40-71-20.Â  If physicians can be \r\n  questioned before the jury about the refusal to produce this privileged information, \r\n  the effect is to pressure them toward disclosure of the privileging file.Â  As \r\n  occurred here, the exercise of the statutory right not to disclose the information \r\n  would be used against the physician as evidence the physician is hiding something.Â  \r\n  Allowing this to occur does not serve the policy goals of promoting candor and \r\n  open discussion among participants in the peer review process.Â  See McGee, \r\n  312 S.C. at 62, 439 S.E.2d at 259 (participants in the peer review process must \r\n  be able to operate without fear of reprisal).\r\nThis error was exacerbated when counsel effectively argued that Dr. Vinson \r\n  had deceived everyone by failing to disclose the file.Â  The fact that Dr. Vinson \r\n  was able to tell the jury that he had no adverse results during the privileging \r\n  process did not cure the error.Â  The jury was not informed that Dr. Vinson was \r\n  not obligated to produce his privileging file by statute.Â  Instead, the jury \r\n  was allowed to believe Dr. Vinson was not forthcoming for some unstated reason \r\n  and, as a result, the jury may have believed Dr. Vinson was attempting to conceal \r\n  something in the file.\r\nHowever, we find the error harmless.Â  First, there was other properly admitted \r\n  evidence that indicated Dr. Vinson was being deceitful, such as (1) failing \r\n  to indicate his fellowship program was unaccredited on his curriculum vitae, \r\n  (2) telling Durhamâ€™s family that Durham was fine and had only been placed in \r\n  the CCU as a precaution, (3) failing to call a specialist upon the familyâ€™s \r\n  request, (4) misinforming his own expert about the training he had in performing \r\n  a LNF, and (5) attempting to shift the blame for Durhamâ€™s aspiration on another \r\n  doctor.\r\nSecond, the evidence of Dr. Vinsonâ€™s liability is overwhelming.Â  The breach \r\n  of his duty of care to Durham is uncontradicted, especially in light of the \r\n  fact that his own expert believed Dr. Vinsonâ€™s treatment of Durham had deviated \r\n  from the standard of care.\r\nII.Â Â  Jury Charge on Standard of Care\r\nAs to the standard of care, the court charged the \r\n  jury as follows:\r\n\r\n  A physician or surgeon who undertakes to render professional services must \r\n    meet these requirements.Â  The physician must possess the degree of professional \r\n    learning, skill and ability which others similarly situat[ed] ordinarily \r\n    possess at the time.Â  The physician must exercise reasonable care and diligence \r\n    in the application of this knowledge and skill to the patientâ€™s care and the \r\n    physician must use his best judgment in the treatment and care of his patient. \r\n    â€¦ If the physician fails in any of those particulars and such failure is the \r\n    proximate cause of injury and damage the physician is liable. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The court again charged that \r\n  a physician â€œshall possess and exercise that degree of knowledge, care and skill \r\n  ordinarily possessed by members of his profession in good standing under the \r\n  same or similar circumstances.â€ \r\nDr. Vinson argues the knowledge component should not have been included in \r\n  the charge.Â  He contends that Durhamâ€™s repeated emphasis on his education and \r\n  training, combined with the trial judgeâ€™s charge, created the impression the \r\n  jury could find Dr. Vinson liable for malpractice solely on the basis of a lack \r\n  of education or background, that is, if they found he did not â€œpossess the degree \r\n  of professional learningâ€ that he should have, regardless of his conduct in \r\n  treating Durham.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo the extent that the trial courtâ€™s charge suggests that a lack of professional \r\n  learning, by itself, constitutes a breach of the standard of care, the charge \r\n  was erroneous.Â  The standard of care in a medical malpractice action concerns \r\n  both the physicianâ€™s skill and the physicianâ€™s professional learning.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the appropriate standard of care charge is the following:Â  A physician \r\n  is only bound to possess and exercise that degree of skill and learning \r\n  that is ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of his profession in good \r\n  standing acting in the same or similar circumstances.Â  King v. Williams, \r\n  276 S.C. 478, 482, 279 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1981) (degree of care which must be \r\n  observed is that of an average, competent practitioner acting in same or similar \r\n  circumstances); Bessinger v. DeLoach, 230 S.C. 1, 7, 94 S.E.2d 3, 6 (1956) \r\n  (physician has been held to degree of skill and learning which is ordinarily \r\n  possessed and exercised by members of his profession in good standing in the \r\n  same general neighborhood or in similar localities). [5] Â  \r\nProfessional learning is pertinent to a physicianâ€™s \r\n  background and training, particularly when the procedure in questionâ€”such as \r\n  the one performed in the present caseâ€”requires a special kind of learning.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the knowledge component was properly included in the jury charge.Â  \r\n  But the lack of or inadequacy of such knowledge is not, by itself, dispositive \r\n  as to whether a physician is liable for medical malpractice.Â  Therefore, the \r\n  portion of the charge instructing the jury to find the physician liable if he \r\n  â€œfails in any of those particulars and such failure is the proximate \r\n  cause of injury and damage,â€ was erroneous.Â  We note that this is a minor judicial \r\n  error in an otherwise appropriate charge.Â Â Â  \r\nNonetheless, we find the error harmless given that \r\n  Dr. Vinsonâ€™s liability to Durham is so clear.Â  As noted previously, it is uncontradicted \r\n  that Dr. Vinson committed a gross breach of the standard of care in more than \r\n  one instance while treating Durham.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Valium Prescription Evidence\r\nDr. Vinson argues he is entitled to a new trial \r\n  due to the admission of evidence, during the punitive damages phase of the bifurcated \r\n  trial, that he prescribed valium to Durhamâ€™s daughter and that he instructed \r\n  her to give the valium to other family members.Â  We agree.\r\nDurhamâ€™s daughter testified Dr. Vinson told her \r\n  that she and her sisters were upsetting Durham while she was in the CCU.Â  She \r\n  stated that he wrote her a prescription for sixty valiums, and told her to take \r\n  them and pass them around to the other sisters to calm them down.Â  The daughter \r\n  stated that she was never a patient of Dr. Vinsonâ€™s.Â  Another daughter corroborated \r\n  this testimony.Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition, a portion of the deposition of Dr. \r\n  Vincent Russo, an expert for Durham, was admitted during the punitive damages \r\n  phase.Â  Dr. Russo testified regarding the valium prescription incident.Â  The \r\n  court overruled defense counselâ€™s objection on the basis the evidence was relevant \r\n  to the Gamble [6]  factor concerning Dr. Vinsonâ€™s \r\n  awareness or concealment.Â  The court further stated the evidence did not violate \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE. [7] \r\nDr. Russo testified Dr. Vinson attempted to alleviate the familyâ€™s anxiety \r\n  about Durham by prescribing valium to Durhamâ€™s daughter and telling her to distribute \r\n  the valium to the other relatives.Â  Dr. Russo opined that a reasonable surgeon \r\n  does not engage in such conduct and that his actions were incompetent and could \r\n  be criminal and unethical.\r\nWe find that the trial court erroneously allowed the valium prescription evidence.Â  \r\n  The evidence was inappropriate because it concerned Dr. Vinsonâ€™s misconduct \r\n  towards a third party, rather than his misconduct towards Durham.Â  We disagree \r\n  with the trial courtâ€™s finding that the evidence was relevant to the Gamble \r\n  factor of concealment.Â  The finding that the evidence is relevant to whether \r\n  Dr. Vinson attempted to conceal his misconduct towards Durham is attenuated.Â  \r\n  Further, the evidence is inflammatory, especially in light of the fact that \r\n  the valium prescription evidence was the only evidence admitted during the punitive \r\n  damages phase.Â  We find the evidence violates Rule 403, SCRE, because the prejudicial \r\n  effect of the evidence outweighs any probative value it may have had.Â  By allowing \r\n  the evidence, the trial court allowed the jury to punish Dr. Vinson for a bad \r\n  act unrelated to his actions towards Durham.Â  See State Farm Mut. \r\n  Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 409, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 1515 (2003) \r\n  (defendantâ€™s dissimilar acts, independent from acts upon which liability was \r\n  premised, may not serve as basis for punitive damages; defendant should be punished \r\n  for conduct that harmed plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual).\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial court on this ground and remand the case \r\n  for a new punitive damages phase. \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find the trial court committed two errors during the liability phase of \r\n  trial.Â  The trial court erred by allowing Durhamâ€™s counsel to ask Dr. Vinson \r\n  about his failure to fully disclose his privileging file and by giving an inappropriate \r\n  standard of care charge to the jury.Â  But we find the errors harmless given \r\n  that Dr. Vinsonâ€™s liability to Durham is so clear based on the uncontradicted \r\n  evidence that Dr. Vinson committed a gross breach of the standard of care in \r\n  more than one instance while treating Durham.\r\nWe further find the admission of the valium prescription evidence during the \r\n  punitive damages phase violates Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Because this error was not \r\n  harmless, we reverse the trial court and remand the case for a new punitive \r\n  damages phase.\r\nThe following issues raised by Appellants-Respondents are not preserved for \r\n  review:Â  Issues I, V, VII, XI, and XIII.Â  See Bakala v.

Thomas Cooper, Jr., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  An aspiration refers to the accidental sucking in of food particles \r\n    or fluids into the lungs. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Trial judges have discretion as to whether to bifurcate a trial.Â  \r\n    Rule 42(b), SCRCP; Senter v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 341 S.C. 74, \r\n    77, 533 S.E.2d 575, 577 (2000).Â  Although some states require bifurcation \r\n    in every case in which the plaintiff seeks punitive damages, we are unwilling \r\n    to impose such a requirement.Â  We encourage judges, however, to bifurcate \r\n    trials in complex medical malpractice cases such as this one, particularly \r\n    when bifurcation helps to clarify and simplify the issues.Â  Nonetheless, in \r\n    exercising their discretion, trial judges must continue to heed the â€œseparate \r\n    issueâ€ mandate of Rule 42(b); see also Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus \r\n    Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 73, 533 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2000) (trial judges are responsible \r\n    for determining whether trial issues are distinct enough to warrant severability).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-10 (2001) (members of certain professional \r\n    committees exempt from tort liability). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Durham argues and the \r\n    trial court found that Dr. Vinson opened the door to asking questions about \r\n    the privileging file during his opening argument.Â  In opening, counsel stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dr. Vinson was a fully licensed physician, authorized by South \r\n    Carolina law to practice medicine and to practice surgery.Â  Board certification \r\n    was not required for Dr. Vinson to get his privileges to practice surgery \r\n    including doing the [LNF].Â  Dr. Vinson presented his information to the credentials \r\n    accrediting authorities at Oconee Memorial Hospital and was given the authority \r\n    to do the procedures he did on Ms. Durham.Â  He was not required to be Board \r\n    certified.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This did not, however, open the door to the evidence.Â  Because Durhamâ€™s counsel \r\n    emphasized in opening argument that Dr. Vinson was not board certified in \r\n    surgery, Dr. Vinson simply desired to point out in his opening that, although \r\n    he was not board certified, he was in fact privileged by Oconee Hospital to \r\n    perform surgery.Â  Further, the information Dr. Vinson relayed to the jury \r\n    only concerned the results of the privileging process.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] This Court eventually \r\n    eliminated the phrase, known as the locality rule, â€œin the same general neighborhood \r\n    or in similar localitiesâ€ and replaced it with the phrase, â€œacting in same \r\n    or similar circumstances.â€Â  King, 276 S.C. at 482, 279 S.E.2d at 620.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-112, 406 S.E.2d 350, \r\n    354 (1991), set out the factors to be used when conducting a review of a punitive \r\n    damage award.Â  The factors are:Â  (1) defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) \r\n    duration of the conduct; (3) defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the \r\n    existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the \r\n    defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably \r\n    related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendantâ€™s ability \r\n    to pay; and finally, (8) other factors deemed appropriate. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n    [7] Rule 403, SCRE, states:Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded \r\n    if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair \r\n    prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations \r\n    of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25873","title":"McCormick County Council v.

Â§ 4-9-650 (1986) provides that the county administrator \r\n  has no authority over elected officials of the county whose offices are created \r\n  by the Constitution or general law of the State.\r\nAlthough the statutes do not specifically provide who has the authority to \r\n  assign offices and possess the keys thereto in the county courthouse, the provision \r\n  of Â§ 14-17-210 giving the clerk of court charge of the courthouse must include \r\n  the assignment of offices and possession of keys.Â  Further, since Â§ 4-9-650 \r\n  specifically states that the county administrator does not have authority over \r\n  elected officials whose offices are created by the Constitution, the county \r\n  has no authority to control the Clerk of Court.\r\nEssentially, County Council is challenging the Chief Justiceâ€™s June 23rd \r\n  administrative order in this matter.Â  As the administrative head of the unified \r\n  judicial system, [1]  the Chief \r\n  Justice has the authority to issue administrative orders controlling the courts \r\n  in the State.Â  Because authority to control the courthouse is given to the Clerk \r\n  of Court, we hold that the Clerk of Court has the authority to assign offices \r\n  in and possess the keys to the offices in the courthouse.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., not \r\n  participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C.

Ariail, of Greenville, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This Court \r\n  granted certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision reversing the trial \r\n  court, which held that Petitioner Victor Missouri (Missouri) did not have a \r\n  reasonable expectation of privacy in anotherâ€™s apartment and therefore could \r\n  not challenge the search of the apartment under the Fourth Amendment.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn early 1995, Greenville detectives were investigating \r\n  a crack-cocaine ring.Â  The police obtained a warrant to search the apartment \r\n  of Curtis and Laura Sibert (Siberts) for cocaine.Â  Missouri was in the apartment \r\n  at the time, standing near a quantity of crack cocaine.Â  Missouri was arrested \r\n  and charged with trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  \r\nAt trial, lead detective Eric Cureton (Detective \r\n  Cureton) admitted that he lied in the affidavit issued in support of the search \r\n  warrant.Â  In addition, Missouri argued that exculpatory information was omitted \r\n  from the affidavit.Â  Nonetheless, the trial court denied Missouriâ€™s motion to \r\n  suppress the evidence obtained in the search.Â  In an unpublished opinion, the \r\n  court of appeals reversed, ruling that the omitted information was necessary \r\n  for the magistrateâ€™s finding of probable cause, and remanded the matter for \r\n  a hearing to determine whether Missouri had a reasonable expectation of privacy \r\n  in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment.Â  State v. Missouri, Op. No. 97-UP-448 (S.C. \r\n  Ct. App. filed September 15, 1997).Â  This Court affirmed the court of appealsâ€™ \r\n  ruling, holding that the search warrant was invalid because it was not supported \r\n  by probable cause.Â  State v. Missouri, 337 S.C. 548, 556-557, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  394, 398 (1999).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nA hearing was then held to determine, as the court of appeals \r\n  instructed, whether Missouri had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the \r\n  Sibertsâ€™ apartment.Â  Missouri and Curtis Sibert (Curtis) testified that they \r\n  are close friends and have known each other for many years.Â  On occasion, Curtis \r\n  would give Missouri a key to the Sibertsâ€™ apartment, allowing Missouri to come \r\n  and go as he pleased.Â  Even though Missouri lived only a few miles away, he \r\n  would stay at the Sibertsâ€™ apartment whenever he wanted to â€œget away.â€Â  Missouri \r\n  testified that the apartment was a place of comfort and solace for him and that \r\n  he felt a sense of privacy there.Â Â Â  \r\nThe State presented the testimony of the arresting \r\n  officer, Detective Cureton.Â  When Detective Cureton conducted surveillance on \r\n  the Sibertsâ€™ apartment the day of the arrest, he observed Missouri enter the \r\n  apartment between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m.Â  Detective Cureton also observed Curtis \r\n  and his wife Laura purchasing large quantities of baking soda \r\n  [1]  at different locations around town earlier that day. The police searched \r\n  the Sibertsâ€™ apartment between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m.\r\nWhen he entered the apartment, \r\n  Detective Cureton discovered Missouri in the kitchen standing over several dishes \r\n  of cooling crack cocaine, while Curtis and Laura sat on the couch watching television.Â  \r\n  Detective Cureton testified that the police confiscated Missouriâ€™s keys and \r\n  that the key ring held only three keys: two car keys and a key to Missouriâ€™s \r\n  residence.Â  In addition, Detective Cureton recovered a black bag belonging to \r\n  Missouri that contained scales and packaging paper.Â  Detective Cureton testified \r\n  that Missouri had no other items in the apartment.Â  But on cross-examination, \r\n  Detective Cureton admitted that he did not know whether Missouri had a change \r\n  of clothes in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment at the time of the search.Â  \r\nCurtis testified that Missouri \r\n  did not stay over the night before the search took place and could not remember \r\n  the last time Missouri had spent the night.Â  Curtis testified that at the time \r\n  of arrest, (1) Missouri had a key to the apartment; (2) he would not have allowed \r\n  Missouri to use the apartment if he had known Missouri intended to mix drugs \r\n  there; and (3) Missouri was in the apartment for social reasons only.\r\nAfter considering the testimony \r\n  presented at the hearing, the trial judge found Missouri had a reasonable expectation \r\n  of privacy in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment.Â  The court of appeals reversed, holding \r\n  that Missouri did not have â€œstandingâ€ [2]  because he did not have a reasonable expectation \r\n  of privacy in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment.Â  Missouri was merely a permitted guest \r\n  conducting business, the court ruled, not an overnight guest entitled to Fourth \r\n  Amendment protection.Â  State v. Missouri, 572 S.E.2d 467, 471, 352 S.C. \r\n  121, 130 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â \r\nThis Court granted Missouriâ€™s petition for writ \r\n  of certiorari to review the following question:\r\n\r\nDid the court of appeals err in reversing the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s ruling that Missouri had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the \r\n  Sibertsâ€™ apartment?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard \r\n  of Review\r\nWhen reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure \r\n  case, an appellate court must affirm the trial judgeâ€™s ruling if there is any \r\n  evidence to support the ruling.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, \r\n  528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000) (emphasis added).Â  The appellate court will \r\n  reverse only when there is clear error.Â  Id.\r\nReasonable \r\n  Expectation of Privacy\r\nMissouri argues that he had a reasonable \r\n  expectation of privacy in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment at the time the police searched \r\n  the apartment.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees individuals the \r\n  right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const. amend. \r\n  IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  To claim protection under the Fourth Amendment \r\n  of the U.S. Constitution, defendants must show that they have a legitimate expectation \r\n  of privacy in the place searched.Â  Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143, \r\n  99 S. Ct. 421, 430 (1978).Â  A legitimate expectation of privacy is both subjective \r\n  and objective in nature: the defendant must show (1) he had a subjective expectation \r\n  of not being discovered, and (2) the expectation is one that society recognizes \r\n  as reasonable.Â  Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 177, 104 S. Ct. \r\n  1735, 1741 (1984) (citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 \r\n  S. Ct. 507, 516 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)).Â  \r\nAt the â€œvery coreâ€ of the Fourth Amendment is a \r\n  personâ€™s right â€œto retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable \r\n  government intrusions.â€Â  Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 31, 121 \r\n  S. Ct. 2038, 2041 (2001) (citation omitted).Â  What is less clear is whether \r\n  a person has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the home of another.Â  Three \r\n  cases from the United States Supreme Court (USSC) provide guidance in our consideration \r\n  of this question.Â  \r\nWhen first presented with this question, the USSC \r\n  held that a defendant could challenge a search under the Fourth Amendment simply \r\n  by being â€œlegitimately on the premises.â€ Jones v. United States, 362 \r\n  U.S. 257, 267, 80 S. Ct. 725, 734 (1960), overruled in part, United \r\n  States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 89, 100 S. Ct. 2547, 2551 (1980) (rejecting \r\n  the â€œautomatic standingâ€ rule, which conferred standing to any defendant charged \r\n  with crimes of possession). Â The standard of simply being â€œlegitimately on the \r\n  premisesâ€ was eventually repudiated as being â€œtoo broad a gauge for measurement \r\n  of Fourth Amendment rights.â€Â  Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 142, 99 \r\n  S. Ct. 421, 429 (1978).Â  Nonetheless, the Rakas Court did â€œnot question \r\n  the conclusion of Jones that the defendant in that case suffered a violation \r\n  of his personal Fourth Amendment rights.â€Â  Id. at 141, 99 S. Ct. at 429.Â  \r\n  In affirming the ultimate conclusion of Jones, the Court was persuaded \r\n  by the following facts:Â  (1) Jones and the owner of the apartment were friends; \r\n  (2) the owner had given Jones a key to the apartment; (3) Jones had a suit and \r\n  shirt in the apartment;Â  (4) Jones had slept there at least once before; and \r\n  (5) Jones was the sole occupant of the apartment at the time it was searched.Â  \r\n  Id. Â Accordingly, the Court agreed that the defendant was entitled to \r\n  Fourth Amendment protection.Â  Id.\r\nIn a subsequent case, the USSC found that an overnight \r\n  guest had a reasonable expectation of privacy in anotherâ€™s home.Â  Minnesota \r\n  v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 110 S. Ct. 1684 (1990).Â  The defendant in Olson \r\n  was suspected of robbing a gas station and fatally wounding the station manager.Â  \r\n  An investigation led the police to a house where they thought the suspect was \r\n  hiding.Â  When the police confirmed that the defendant was inside the upper unit \r\n  of the home, they drew their weapons, entered the duplex without the ownerâ€™s \r\n  permission, found the defendant hiding in a closet, and arrested him.Â  The Minnesota \r\n  Supreme Court held that the defendant had a â€œsufficient interestâ€ in the home \r\n  such that he could challenge the legality of the warrantless search and arrest.Â  \r\n  Id. at 94, 110 S. Ct. at 1687.Â  \r\nThe USSC affirmed, concluding that the defendantâ€™s \r\n  status as an overnight guest was â€œalone enough to show that he had an expectation \r\n  of privacy in the home that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 96, 110 S. Ct. at 1688.Â  Although the Court noted that the defendant \r\n  had been staying at the home, sleeping on the floor for several days before \r\n  the robbery, and had a change of clothes with him, the Court did not articulate \r\n  what constitutes an â€œovernightâ€ guest.Â  Id. at 97 n. 6, 110 S. Ct. 1688 \r\n  n. 6.Â  Instead, the Court supported its holding by speaking generally about \r\n  the social expectations of privacy recognized by houseguests:Â  \r\n\r\nFrom the overnight guestâ€™s perspective, he seeks shelter in \r\n  anotherâ€™s home precisely because it provides him with privacy, a place where \r\n  he and his possessions will not be disturbed by anyone but his host and those \r\n  his host allows inside.\r\nâ€¦\r\nThe houseguest is there with the permission of his host, who \r\n  is willing to share his house and his privacy with his guest.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 99, 110 S. Ct. at 1690 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the Court concluded that the defendantâ€™s expectation of privacy \r\n  in the home of another â€œwas rooted in â€˜understandings that are recognized and \r\n  permitted by society,â€™â€ and therefore the defendant was permitted to challenge \r\n  the search.Â  Id. at 100, 110 S. Ct. at 1690.Â  \r\nMost recently, the USSC held that the defendants \r\n  did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the home of another when \r\n  the nature of the defendantâ€™s visit was purely commercial, the visit was short, \r\n  and there was no previous connection between the defendants and the lessee.Â  \r\n  Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 90, 119 S. Ct. 469, 473 (1998).Â  The \r\n  defendants in Carter lived out-of-state and used the lesseeâ€™s apartment \r\n  for the sole purpose of packaging cocaine.Â  The defendants had never visited \r\n  the apartment before and stayed for two-and-a-half hours.Â  In exchange for use \r\n  of the apartment, the defendants gave the lessee one-eighth ounce of cocaine.Â  \r\n  The Court concluded that the defendants did not have a legitimate expectation \r\n  of privacy because they were â€œessentially present for a business transaction \r\n  and were only in the home a matter of hours.â€Â  Id. at 90, 119 S. Ct. \r\n  at 473.Â  In addition, the Court was persuaded by the fact that the defendants \r\n  had no â€œprevious relationshipâ€ with the lessee and nothing â€œto suggest a degree \r\n  of acceptance into the household.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, in a 5-4 decision, \r\n  the Court held that the defendants were not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection. \r\n  [3] Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, Missouri \r\n  and Curtis testified that they had grown up together and were â€œgood friends.â€Â  \r\n  Missouri had frequently visited the Sibertsâ€™ apartment in the past and occasionally \r\n  spent the night.Â  Missouri described the Sibert home as a place to â€œget awayâ€ \r\n  and as a place to â€œfind comfort.â€Â  At times, Missouri had a key to the Sibertsâ€™ \r\n  apartment and kept a change of clothes there.Â  He paid nothing to use the apartment \r\n  and was there for at least seven hours on the day of the search. \r\nBy choosing to share the privacy of their home \r\n  with Missouri on several occasions in the past and on the occasion in question, \r\n  both the Siberts and Missouri demonstrated a subjective expectation of privacy, \r\n  and that expectation, we hold, is one that society is prepared to recognize \r\n  as reasonable.Â  See Oliver, 466 U.S. at 177, 104 S. Ct. at 1741 (citing \r\n  Katz, 389 U.S. at 361, 88 S. Ct. at 516 (Harlan, J., concurring) (a reasonable \r\n  expectation of privacy is both subjective and objective in nature)).Â  Moreover, \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact support his ruling that Missouriâ€™s expectation \r\n  of privacy in the Sibert home was reasonable.Â  See Brockman, 339 S.C. \r\n  at 66, 528 S.E.2d at 666 (an appellate court must affirm if there is any \r\n  evidence in the record supporting the trial judgeâ€™s ruling).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor these reasons, we reverse the court \r\n  of appealsâ€™ decision and hold that Missouri had a reasonable expectation of \r\n  privacy in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment.Â  Missouri is therefore entitled to challenge \r\n  the search under the Fourth Amendment.Â  In addition, because we held in a prior \r\n  decision that the search warrant executed in this case was invalid, the evidence \r\n  seized must be suppressed and Missouriâ€™s conviction vacated. \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Baking soda is used in transforming powdered cocaine into crack cocaine.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The United States Supreme Court has expressly rejected the application \r\n    of an analysis based on the standing doctrine; instead, the analysis is based \r\n    on substantive Fourth Amendment law.Â  Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, \r\n    140, 99 S. Ct. 421, 429 (1978).Â  The use of the term â€œstandingâ€ has created \r\n    confusion in this context, and therefore â€œstandingâ€ is no longer appropriate \r\n    to â€œconnote the legitimate expectation of privacy in the evidence seized or \r\n    the premises searched.â€Â  United States v. Bouffard, 917 F.2d 673, 675 \r\n    (1st Cir. 1990).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Although the majority in Carter held that the defendants were \r\n    not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, a â€œdifferent majorityâ€ recognized \r\n    that social guests present for less than an overnight stay may enjoy a reasonable \r\n    expectation of privacy in their hostâ€™s home.Â  In a concurring opinion, Justice \r\n    Breyer explicitly stated that he agreed with the dissentâ€”which concluded that \r\n    all invited guests are entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, whether \r\n    present for a business purpose or notâ€”but he agreed with the majorityâ€™s decision \r\n    because he thought the search itself was lawful.Â  Id. at 104, 119 S. \r\n    Ct. at 480 (Breyer, J., concurring).Â  In another concurrence, Justice Kennedy \r\n    stated that, in his view, â€œalmost all social guests have a legitimate \r\n    expectation of privacy â€¦ in their hostâ€™s home.â€Â  Id. at 99, 119 S. \r\n    Ct. at 478 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added).Â  But because the defendants \r\n    in Carter were not â€œguests,â€ they did not have an expectation of privacy \r\n    in the ownerâ€™s home.Â  Id. at 102, 119 S. Ct. at 479.Â  Accordingly, \r\n    it is apparent that at least five members of the Courtâ€”the three who dissented \r\n    and the two who concurredâ€”would be willing to extend protection to guests \r\n    present for social reasons and present for some time less than an overnight \r\n    stay.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25875","title":"Dorrell v.

(APAC).Â  This case was certified from the court of appeals \r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nDorrell was injured in a one-car accident on April 16, 1996.Â  \r\n  Apparently a gust of wind caused Dorrellâ€™s car to veer to the right and drop \r\n  off the road onto the dirt shoulder, which was eleven to twelve inches below \r\n  the road surface.Â  Due to the drop, Dorrell lost control of her car, the car \r\n  rolled several times, and she was thrown from her car into a ditch twenty-five \r\n  to thirty feet away.Â  Dorrell suffered permanent injuries and incurred significant \r\n  medical bills.\r\nThe road had been recently repaved pursuant to a contract \r\n  between the paving company, APAC, and the South Carolina Department of Transportation \r\n  (SCDOT).Â  On April 22, 1996, six days after the accident, SCDOT issued an inspection \r\n  report, accepting APACâ€™s work and returning the highway to SCDOTâ€™s control.Â  \r\n  In its report, SCDOT stated that it had â€œaccepted the highway back for State \r\n  maintenance as of November 17, 1995.â€\r\nDorrell sued APAC and SCDOT \r\n  [1]  on a negligence theory.Â  As to APAC, Dorrell alleged that APAC was \r\n  negligent for the following: (1) failing to perform the contract according to \r\n  its specifications; (2) creating a dangerous condition by raising the roadway \r\n  to a level of eleven to twelve inches above the shoulder; (3) failing to correct \r\n  the dangerous condition; (4) failing to warn motorists about the dangerous condition; \r\n  (5) failing to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable and prudent road \r\n  contractor would have exercised under the circumstances; (6) failing to inspect \r\n  the road and detect the dangerous condition.Â  As to SCDOT, Dorrell alleged that \r\n  SCDOT was negligent for the following:Â  (1) failing to warn motorists of the \r\n  dangerous condition; (2) failing to correct the dangerous condition; and (3) \r\n  failing to inspect the road upon completion of the resurfacing and detect the \r\n  dangerous condition which actually and proximately caused Dorrellâ€™s injuries.\r\nDorrell eventually settled with SCDOT, leaving APAC as the \r\n  sole defendant.Â  APAC denied liability and subsequently filed a motion for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  In support of its motion, APAC argued that the contract did not authorize \r\n  APAC to rebuild, repair, or maintain the shoulder area.Â  Instead, the contract \r\n  required only that the shoulder area, and particularly areas with surrounding \r\n  vegetation, be left in a â€œneat and presentable condition.â€Â  But because vegetation \r\n  did not exist in the area where the accident occurred, APAC argued that it complied \r\n  with the contractâ€™s mandate.Â  In addition, APAC described the eleven to twelve \r\n  inch resulting drop-off as a â€œpatent and obvious defect,â€ which SCDOT should \r\n  have noticed upon inspecting the completed work.Â  Finally, APAC argued that \r\n  once SCDOT accepted the resurfacing work, APAC was no longer in control of the \r\n  roadway and therefore no longer liable for injuries caused by the drop-off. \r\n\r\nIn response to APACâ€™s motion for summary judgment, Dorrell \r\n  filed the affidavit of her expert, Peter S. Parsonson, Ph.D, P.E. (Parsonson), \r\n  who holds a doctorate in engineering and is a licensed professional engineer.Â  \r\n  In his affidavit, Parsonson directly contravened APACâ€™s interpretation of the \r\n  contract terms and opined that APAC was responsible for the roadway condition \r\n  at the time of the accident.Â  Further, Parsonson described the eleven to twelve \r\n  inch drop as an â€œintolerable and gross defect,â€ which constituted a â€œwell-known, \r\n  clear, immediate, and compelling danger to the motoring public.â€Â  In his opinion, \r\n  by claiming that it was responsible only for one edge of the pavement to the \r\n  other, APAC defined the scope of its responsibility under the contract too narrowly.Â  \r\n  Given the conflicting evidence concerning the scope of APACâ€™s responsibility \r\n  under the contract, the trial judge denied APACâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nTwo months before trial, APAC filed a second summary judgment \r\n  motion, reiterating the arguments in its initial motion and including two additional \r\n  pieces of evidence: the deposition testimony of expert Parsonson and SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  responses to APACâ€™s requests for admission.Â  Based on this new evidence, the \r\n  trial judgeâ€”who was not the same judge who heard APACâ€™s initial motionâ€”granted \r\n  summary judgment to APAC, finding that (1) rebuilding, repairing, or maintaining \r\n  the highway shoulders was not within the scope of APACâ€™s responsibility under \r\n  the contract; (2) APACâ€™s work had been completed and accepted as of November \r\n  17, 1995; and therefore (3) SCDOT was solely responsible for the roadway and \r\n  shoulders at the time of the accident.Â  Additionally, the trial judge found \r\n  that â€œAPAC did not breach any duty to the plaintiffs which proximately caused \r\n  the accident.â€&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDorrell appeals the granting of summary judgment, asking \r\n  this Court to consider the following issues: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the contract between SCDOT and APAC limit APACâ€™s liability for negligent \r\n  injury to third parties?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Was the defense of completion and acceptance a valid legal basis for granting \r\n  summary judgment?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Was it an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to hear APACâ€™s renewed motion \r\n  for summary judgment and use SCDOTâ€™s admissions against APAC?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law/Analysis\r\nIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, this \r\n  Court must find summary judgment proper when there is no genuine issue as to \r\n  any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \r\n  law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Osborne v. Adams, 364 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d 319 \r\n  (2001).Â  In reviewing the record, the evidence must be considered in the light \r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. (citing Summer v. Carpenter, \r\n  328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997)).\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  APACâ€™s Liability to Third Parties\r\nDorrell argues that the APAC-SCDOT contract does not limit \r\n  APACâ€™s liability for negligent injury to third parties.Â  We agree.\r\nA tortfeasor may be liable for injury to a third party arising \r\n  out of the tortfeasorâ€™s contractual relationship with another, despite the absence \r\n  of privity between the tortfeasor and the third party.Â  Barker v. Sauls, \r\n  289 S.C. 121, 122, 345 S.E.2d 244, 244 (1986) (citing Terlinde v. J.F. Neely, \r\n  275 S.C 395, 399, 271 S.E.2d 768, 770 (1980)).Â  The tortfeasorâ€™s liability exists \r\n  independently of the contract and rests upon the tortfeasorâ€™s duty to exercise \r\n  due care.Â  Id. (citing Edwardâ€™s of Byrnes Downs v. Charleston Sheet \r\n  Metal Co., 253 S.C. 537, 542, 172 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1970)).Â  This common \r\n  law duty of due care includes the duty to avoid damage or injury to foreseeable \r\n  plaintiffs.Â  See Terlinde, 275 S.C. at 399, 271 S.E.2d at 770 (stating \r\n  that the â€œkey inquiryâ€ in determining whether to impose liability is â€œforeseeability, \r\n  not privityâ€).Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show that the (1) \r\n  defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) defendant breached the duty \r\n  by a negligent act or omission, (3) defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate \r\n  cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury, and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.Â  \r\n  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Reg., 336 S.C. \r\n  373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999) (citations omitted).Â  The Court must determine, \r\n  as a matter of law, whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.Â Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, we hold that APAC owed a duty \r\n  of care to the plaintiff, Dorrell, based on (1) the contractual relationship \r\n  between APAC and SCDOT and (2) a common law duty of care.Â  \r\nAPACâ€™s broad duty to the traveling public is established \r\n  in at least two separate provisions of the contract.Â  First, the section of \r\n  the contract titled â€œRequired Contract Provisions Federal-Aid Construction Contractsâ€ \r\n  under the heading â€œSafety: Accident Preventionâ€ states, in part, the following:\r\n\r\nThe contractor shall provide all safeguards, safety devices \r\n  and protective equipment and take any other needed actions as it determines \r\n  â€¦ to be reasonably necessary to protect the life and health of employees on \r\n  the job and the safety of the public â€¦.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Red Book, [2]  which is part of the contract, \r\n  includes the following mandate: \r\n\r\n107.09 Public Convenience and Safety.Â  The Contractor \r\n  shall at all times conduct work in such a manner as to provide for and insure \r\n  the safety and convenience of the traveling public â€¦.\r\n\r\nWe also note that under the contract, the work was to â€œbe \r\n  done in accordance with the Specifications and in a good and workmanlike manner.â€Â  \r\n  Therefore, based on the plain language of the contract, APAC had a duty to provide \r\n  for the safety of the traveling public and to perform the work in a â€œworkmanlike \r\n  manner.â€Â  This duty arises out of APACâ€™s contractual relationship with SCDOT, \r\n  and the absence of privity between APAC and motorists such as Dorrell does not \r\n  eliminate this duty.\r\nIn addition to its duties under the contract, APAC \r\n  owed a common law duty to exercise due care, which existed independently of \r\n  the contract with SCDOT.Â  See Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber and Mfg. Co., \r\n  299 S.C. 335, 346, 384 S.E.2d 730, 737 (1989) (finding a homebuilder owes a \r\n  legal duty â€œto refrain from constructing housing that he knows or should know \r\n  will pose serious risks of physical harm to foreseeable partiesâ€); Smith \r\n  v. Fitton and Pittman, Inc., 264 S.C. 129, 133, 212 S.E.2d 925, 926 (1975) \r\n  (finding that an independent contractor had a duty of care to leave the premises \r\n  in a safe condition, free from any hazards to safety that he may have created); \r\n  Rogers v. Scyphers, 251 S.C. 128, 133, 161 S.E.2d 81, 84 (1968) (finding \r\n  a building contractor owed a duty of reasonable care that extended to homebuyers \r\n  and members of the buyerâ€™s family); McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., \r\n  325 S.C. 327, 345, 479 S.E.2d 67, 76 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating that it was proper \r\n  for the trial judge to charge the jury with the elements of common law negligence \r\n  to determine whether a paving company negligently performed its work, indicating \r\n  that the paving company owed a duty of care based in common law); St. Clair \r\n  v. B.L. Paving Co., 411 A.2d 525, 526 (Pa. Super. 1979) (finding that a \r\n  paving company, which left a road surface six inches about the shoulder, â€œowed \r\n  a duty to third persons over and above compliance with the contract provisionsâ€).Â  \r\n  This duty of care included, at minimum, a duty to pave the road in a manner \r\n  that provided for the safety of the traveling public, including Dorrell.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMoreover, at oral argument before this Court, APACâ€™s counsel \r\n  explained that, in the area where the accident occurred, the road surface was \r\n  already nine inches above the shoulder.Â  Knowing this, APAC proceeded to lay \r\n  the asphalt, adding another three inches, and increasing the drop to approximately \r\n  twelve inches.Â  These facts alone create a jury question as to whether APAC \r\n  breached its duty of care.Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the APAC-SCDOT contract did not \r\n  limit APACâ€™s liability for negligent injury to third parties.Â  Like all motorists \r\n  that traveled the stretch of highway recently repaved by APAC, Dorrell was a \r\n  foreseeable plaintiff, and APACâ€™s duties to Dorrell stemmed from both the APAC-SCDOT \r\n  contract and the common law.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Completion and Acceptance\r\nDorrell argues that the completion and acceptance \r\n  defense was not a valid legal basis for granting summary judgment.Â  We agree.\r\nHistorically, this Court has found that a contractor \r\n  is not liable to third parties who have been injured as a result of negligent \r\n  construction after the work has been completed and accepted by the other party \r\n  to the contract or the owner.Â  Clyde v. Sumerel, 233 S.C. 228, 232-33, \r\n  104 S.E.2d 392, 393 (1958); see also Nichols v. Craven, 224 S.C. 244, \r\n  78 S.E.2d 376 (1953) (holding that a paving company was not liable for failing \r\n  to place appropriate signs and barricades at construction site once the paving \r\n  companyâ€™s work was completed and accepted and the highway department regained \r\n  sole responsibility for traffic flow).Â  Under this basic rule of tort law, which \r\n  is commonly referred to as the â€œcompleted and accepted ruleâ€ or â€œacceptance \r\n  rule,â€ a contractorâ€™s liability ceases upon a showing that the completed work \r\n  has been practically, not necessarily formally, accepted.Â  Id.  \r\nBut as early as 1968, the completion and acceptance \r\n  defense began to fall out of favor in South Carolina.Â  In Rogers v. Scyphers, \r\n  this Court refused to allow a building contractor to use the defense to avoid \r\n  liability for an injury caused when the plaintiff fell on a negligently constructed \r\n  stairway.Â  251 S.C. at 133, 161 S.E.2d at 84.Â  The Court stated:Â  \r\n\r\nthe entire weight of modern authority is to the effect that \r\n  building contractors â€¦ are liable for injuries to, or the death of, third persons \r\n  occurring after the completion of the work and acceptance by the owner, where \r\n  the work is reasonably certain to endanger third persons if negligently prepared \r\n  or constructed.\r\n\r\n251 S.C. at 132, 161 S.E.2d at 83.Â  Moreover, the \r\n  Court noted that â€œwe see no rational difference between the duty owed by the \r\n  manufacturer of a chattel and the duty owed by the builder-vendor of a new structure.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 134, 161 S.E.2d at 84.Â  Accordingly, â€œthere was a duty on the \r\n  defendants as builders to use reasonable care in the construction of the home \r\n  to avoid unreasonable risk and danger to those who would normally occupy it \r\n  â€¦.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the Court held that the defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss \r\n  was properly overruled. [3] Â  \r\n  Id. at 137, 161 S.E.2d at 85.\r\nLater, in 1975, this Court affirmed judgment for a \r\n  person injured from falling into a six-foot-deep hole left by a contractor for \r\n  the telephone company, who had removed a telephone pole earlier that day.Â  Smith \r\n  v. Fitton and Pittman, Inc., 264 S.C. 129, 133, 212 S.E.2d 925, 926 (1975).Â  \r\n  Because the contractor had a duty of care to leave the premises in a safe condition, \r\n  the Court held that the issue of negligence was properly submitted to the jury.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nAfter affirming judgment for the injured plaintiff, \r\n  the Court addressed the issue of whether the contractor could be relieved of \r\n  liability based on the theory that the work had been completed and accepted.Â  \r\n  The Court explained that â€œ[t]o the extent that this doctrine has not been eroded \r\n  by Rogers, it is still viable.â€Â  Id. at 134, 212 S.E.2d at 926; \r\n  see also Henderson v. St. Francis Hosp., 295 S.C. 441, 369 S.E.2d 652 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988), reversed on other grounds, 303 S.C. 177, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  767 (1990) (holding that the designer of a parking lot was not liable to a plaintiff \r\n  who fell on a sweetgum ball in the lot, given that the lot was designed sixteen \r\n  years before the fall and the defects were neither latent nor concealed).Â  Though \r\n  viable, the Court found that the doctrine was not available as a defense in \r\n  this case because the person who â€œacceptedâ€ the work did not have the â€œactual \r\n  or apparent authority to do so.â€Â  Id.Â  Apparently the contractors had \r\n  planned to refill the hole, but an employee from the business occupying the \r\n  property told the contractors to straddle the hole with the removed pole instead.Â  \r\n  The Court found the employeeâ€™s instruction did not constitute acceptance, and \r\n  the telephone company, as the contracting party, was the appropriate person \r\n  to accept the completed work.Â  Therefore, the doctrine did not relieve the contractor \r\n  of liability.Â  Id. at 134, 212 S.E.2d at 927.Â  \r\nAlthough Smith suggested that the completion \r\n  and acceptance doctrine, though eroded, remained viable, South Carolina courts \r\n  have continued to limit its application.Â  For example, the South Carolina Court \r\n  of Appeals has explicitly refused to apply the doctrine in products liability \r\n  cases, finding that the application of the doctrine â€œwould undermine the whole \r\n  concept of products liability.â€Â  Stanley v. Montague Co., Inc., 299 S.C. \r\n  51, 54, 382 S.E.2d 246, 248 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In addition to finding that the \r\n  doctrine did not apply in the products context, the court in Stanley \r\n  addressed the doctrineâ€™s overall demise.Â  The court noted that â€œ[p]rinciples \r\n  governing the liability of contractors for injuries to third parties have followed \r\n  principles governing the liability of manufacturers for injuries to persons \r\n  not in privity with the manufacturers.â€Â  Id. at 52, 382 S.E.2d at 247.Â  \r\n  In fact, the court read Rogers v. Scyphers as a case that â€œspecifically \r\n  repudiatedâ€ the doctrine.Â  Id. at 55, 382 S.E.2d at 248.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the Stanley court concluded, â€œthe defense of completion and acceptance, \r\n  like the defense of lack of privity, has fallen into disfavor in South Carolina.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 56, 382 S.E.2d at 249.Â Â Â  \r\nSouth Carolina has not been alone in disfavoring \r\n  the completion and acceptance doctrine.Â  \r\n\r\nAs late as the 1950s, the majority of jurisdictions adhered \r\n  to the â€œcompleted and accepted rule.â€Â  Since then, the â€œcompleted and accepted \r\n  ruleâ€ has been severely criticized and repudiated in most states and is now \r\n  the minority rule while the â€œmodern ruleâ€ has become the majority rule.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel S. Tipon, Modern Status of Rules Regarding \r\n  Tort Liability of Building or Construction Contractor for Injury or Damage to \r\n  Third Person Occurring After Completion and Acceptance of Work; â€œForeseeabilityâ€ \r\n  or â€œModernâ€ Rule, 75 A.L.R.5th 413, 437 (2000). \r\n  [4] Â  The modern rule, or â€œforeseeability doctrine,â€ may be stated in the \r\n  following way:\r\n\r\nA building or construction contractor is liable for injury \r\n  or damage to a third person even after completion of the work and its acceptance \r\n  by the owner where it was reasonably foreseeable that a third person would be \r\n  injured by such work on account of the contractorâ€™s negligence or failure to \r\n  disclose a dangerous condition known to such contractor.\r\n\r\nId. at 436.Â  The rule has been applied in \r\n  multiple contexts, including cases involving the construction of streets and \r\n  highways.Â  Id. at 534-35; see also Louk v. Isuzu Motors, Inc., \r\n  479 S.E.2d 911, 921 (W. Va. 1996) (a highway engineer may be held liable for \r\n  negligence even after the highway plan or design has been accepted and the highway \r\n  constructed according to the plan); McFadden v. Ten-T Corp., 529 So.2d \r\n  192, 200 (Ala. 1988) (paving contractor may be liable for creating a hazardous \r\n  condition during resurfacing and widening of highway several months after project \r\n  completed and accepted by highway department); Johnson v. Oman Constr. Co., \r\n  Inc., 519 S.W.2d 782, 788 (Tenn. 1975) (an independent contractor who left \r\n  a barricadeâ€”which was not striped, painted, or illuminatedâ€”on a highway may \r\n  be held liable for negligence even after project completed and accepted).Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe modern view, rejecting the completion \r\n  and acceptance doctrine, is reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Torts as \r\n  well:\r\n\r\nOne who on behalf of the possessor of land erects a structure \r\n  or creates any other condition thereon is subject to liability to others upon \r\n  or outside of the land for physical harm caused to them by the dangerous character \r\n  of the structure or condition after his work has been accepted by the possessor, \r\n  under the same rules as those determining the liability of one who as manufacturer \r\n  or independent contractor makes a chattel for the use of others.\r\n\r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts, Â§ 385 (1965).Â  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina cases that have considered and rejected \r\n  the application of the completion and acceptance doctrine have incorporated \r\n  foreseeability of harm in the analysis.Â  For example, in Smith v. Fitton, \r\n  the Court explained that given the location of the six-foot-deep hole left by \r\n  the contractor who removed the telephone pole, â€œit was certainly inferable that \r\n  this area would be traversed by invitees as well as the owner.â€Â  264 S.C. at \r\n  133, 212 S.E.2d at 926.Â  Additionally, in Rogers v. Scyphers, the Court \r\n  stated that contractors are liable, even after completion and acceptance of \r\n  the work, â€œwhere the work is reasonably certain to endanger third persons if \r\n  negligently prepared or constructed.â€Â  251 S.C. at 132, 161 S.E.2d at 83; see \r\n  also Prosser and Keeton on Torts Â§ 104A, 723 (5th ed. 1984) (citing \r\n  Rogers v. Scyphers and stating â€œ[i]t is now the almost universal rule \r\n  that the contractor is liable to all those who may foreseeably be injured by \r\n  the structure, not only when he fails to disclose dangerous conditions known \r\n  to him, but also when the work is negligently done.â€). \r\nWe join the majority of jurisdictions in deciding \r\n  that a contractorâ€™s duty of care is not extinguished upon the completion and \r\n  acceptance of the contractorâ€™s work.Â  Liability should be governed by the same \r\n  principles that govern ordinary negligence actions, and we see no reason why \r\n  paving contractors should be treated differently from building contractors and \r\n  product manufacturers.Â  \r\nTherefore, in light of Rogers and its progeny, \r\n  the completion and acceptance defense was an improper legal basis upon which \r\n  to grant summary judgment.Â  APAC cannot escape liability simply by completing \r\n  its work and having it accepted by SCDOT.Â  APAC had a duty of care that extended \r\n  above and beyond compliance with the contract, and whether APAC breached that \r\n  duty of care is a question of fact that must be decided by a jury.Â  Moreover, \r\n  it is for a jury to decide whether Dorrellâ€™s injury was foreseeable.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment is reversed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Abuse of Discretion\r\nDorrell argues that the trial judge abused his \r\n  discretion by (1) hearing APACâ€™s renewed motion for summary judgment and (2) \r\n  using SCDOTâ€™s admissions against APAC.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge had the discretionary authority \r\n  to hear APACâ€™s renewed motion for summary judgment.Â  That a different trial \r\n  judge previously denied the motion did not preclude APAC from renewing its motion \r\n  once new evidence came to light.Â  See Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 \r\n  S.C. 476, 477, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994) (citations omitted) (finding that \r\n  a denial of a motion for summary judgment does not affect the merits of the \r\n  case and simply indicates that the case should proceed to trial).Â  Further, \r\n  â€œif the first motion for summary judgment is unsuccessful the court has the \r\n  power to permit a second motion for summary judgment prior to trial.â€Â  Croswell \r\n  Enter., Inc. v. Arnold, 309 S.C. 276, 279, 422 S.E.2d 157, 159 (Ct. App. \r\n  1992).\r\nAs to SCDOTâ€™s admissions, the trial judge had the \r\n  discretion to consider the impact of these admissions just as he would any other \r\n  evidence.Â  Moreover, the trial judge had the discretion to allow such evidence \r\n  to be admitted outside of the scheduling order.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge \r\n  did not abuse his discretion.&nbsp; \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we reverse \r\n  the order granting summary judgment and remand this case for a jury trial in \r\n  accordance with this opinion.Â Â Â Â  \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  A third defendant, APAC-Georgia, Inc., was dismissed by stipulation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  â€œRed Bookâ€ is the common name for the â€œSouth Carolina State Highway \r\n    Department Standard Specifications for Highway Construction,â€ which is typically \r\n    incorporated into highway construction contracts.

Badger, Op. \r\n  No. 2002-UP-513 (Ct. App., filed August 20, 2002).Â  We granted certiorari and \r\n  affirm the Court of Appeals.\r\nFactual/Procedural BackgroundÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nDuring the 1995-96 school year, \r\n  Frazier was employed to supervise the in-school suspension lab at Clark Middle \r\n  School.Â  At that time, Badger was the assistant principal of Clark Middle School \r\n  and was Frazierâ€™s direct supervisor.Â  Around the beginning of the school year, \r\n  Badger began visiting Frazierâ€™s classroom and making explicit, sexual advances \r\n  towards her.Â  When Frazier refused Badgerâ€™s propositions, he told her that eventually \r\n  he was going to â€œbreak her.â€Â  As the school year progressed, Badgerâ€™s visits \r\n  became more frequent, and his advances became physical.Â  Frazier testified that \r\n  Badger would grab her legs and breasts and that she had to â€œfight him offâ€ of \r\n  her on several occasions.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs part of Badgerâ€™s duties as \r\n  assistant principal, he received requests for building repairs.Â  Frazier repeatedly \r\n  asked Badger to send someone to repair the heating and air conditioning in her \r\n  classroom.Â  Despite Badgerâ€™s promises, the heating and air conditioning were \r\n  never repaired.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the end of the school year, \r\n  Badger told Frazier that if she came back to work in the fall, he would move \r\n  her class into a portion of the basement known as the â€œdungeon.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs a result of Badgerâ€™s behavior, \r\n  Frazier suffered emotionally and physically.Â  She became severely depressed.Â  \r\n  Her weight plummeted below 100 pounds, and she began having anxiety attacks \r\n  and losing her hair.Â  Her physician referred her to a psychiatrist who proscribed \r\n  her medication for depression and insomnia.Â  Frazier also testified that her \r\n  fiancÃ© left her because of her emotional condition.Â Â  \r\nOn August 1, 1996, Frazier \r\n  wrote Priscilla Robinson (â€œRobinsonâ€), Principal of Clark Middle School, about \r\n  Badgerâ€™s conduct, which led to a meeting between Robinson, Badger, and Frazier.Â  \r\n  After the meeting, Robinson wrote Frazier a letter acknowledging that Badger \r\n  had admitted to and apologized for making inappropriate comments.Â  She also \r\n  wrote in her letter that it appeared that Badger had submitted work orders for \r\n  the heating and air conditioning.Â  \r\nFrazier wrote Robinson \r\n  another letter because she was dissatisfied with the investigation.Â  As a result, \r\n  District Superintendent, Dr. Walter Tobin assigned three people to investigate \r\n  the matter further.Â  The investigators found that (1) Badger made inappropriate \r\n  comments to Frazier; (2) Badger sent Frazierâ€™s requests to the maintenance department, \r\n  requesting that the heating and air conditioning be repaired, but the units \r\n  were not repaired in a timely manner; and (3) Robinson, not Badger, decided \r\n  to move Frazier into the â€œdungeon.â€\r\nAt the beginning of the \r\n  next school year, Frazierâ€™s class was relocated to the basement, and she was \r\n  told that her old classroom would be used for a computer lab. \r\n  [1] Â  Robinson also told Frazier that until her downstairs classroom was \r\n  ready for use, her classroom would be located on the cafeteria stage.Â  This \r\n  temporary location made Frazierâ€™s job increasingly difficult.Â  Though the stage \r\n  curtains were drawn, Frazier had a hard time keeping the students in class.Â  \r\n  It was only after Frazier filed a complaint with the Department of Human Affairs \r\n  that Frazier was given a regular classroom. \r\nAt trial, Badger testified \r\n  that he was Frazierâ€™s basketball coach fifteen years ago, and that their relationship \r\n  was â€œplayful.â€Â  He admitted to making inappropriate remarks and inviting her \r\n  to dinner, but he denied making sexually explicit comments or grabbing her.Â  \r\n  He also testified that he did not recall refusing to process any work orders \r\n  to repair the heating and air conditioning in Frazierâ€™s classroom.Â  Finally, \r\n  he denied that he ever threatened to relocate Frazierâ€™s classroom to the basement.\r\nThe jury found that Badgerâ€™s \r\n  sexual advances towards Frazier, combined with his retaliatory conduct, met \r\n  the elements for the tort of outrage.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s ruling in an unpublished opinion.Â  Frazier v. Badger, Op. No. \r\n  2002-UP-513 (Ct. App., filed August 20, 2002).Â  Badger now presents the following \r\n  issues for review on certiorari:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s refusal \r\n  to charge the jury on the law of tort immunity for government employees?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.\r\n        Did the\r\n          Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of the\r\n          motion for mistrial?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Did the\r\n          Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s ruling that\r\n          Frazier was not barred from bringing an outrage action in lieu of an\r\n          action for sexual harassment?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s refusal to submit \r\n  special interrogatories to the jury?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         V.\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the punitive damages award?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law/Analysis\r\nI. Governmental Immunity\r\nBadger argues that he is immune \r\n  from tort actions stemming from conduct within the scope of his official duties \r\n  pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. section 15-78-70 (Supp. 2003), [2]  and therefore the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  when it refused to charge the jury on the law concerning immunity.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. section \r\n  15-78-70 specifically provides that government employees may be liable in tort \r\n  actions:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  This chapter constitutes the exclusive remedy for any tort committed by an employee \r\n  of a governmental entity.Â  An employee of a governmental entity who commits \r\n  a tort while acting within the scope of his official duty is not liable \r\n  therefor except as expressly provided for in subsection (b).\r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to give an employee of a governmental \r\n  entity immunity from suit and liability if it is proved that the employeeâ€™s \r\n  conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that it constituted \r\n  actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.\r\nâ€¦\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nImmunity under the statute is \r\n  an affirmative defense that must be proved by the defendant at trial.Â  Tanner \r\n  v. Florence City-County Bldg. Commâ€™n, 333 S.C. 549, 552, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  369, 371 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe trial judge is required to \r\n  charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. Cohens v. Atkins, \r\n  333 S.C. 345, 509 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The law to be charged to the \r\n  jury is determined by the evidence at trial. State v. Hill, 315 S.C. \r\n  260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, \r\n  appellate courts must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence \r\n  and issues presented at trial.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. \r\n  Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 574 (1999).Â  \r\nThis Court has held that the \r\n  term â€œscope of employmentâ€ as used in an insurance policy is broader than the \r\n  term â€œscope of official dutiesâ€ as used in the Tort Claims Act.Â  South Carolina \r\n  State Budget and Control Bd. v. Prince, 304 S.C. 241, 245, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  643, 646 (1991).Â  IfÂ  â€œscope of employmentâ€ is a broader term than â€œscope of \r\n  official dutiesâ€ - the term used in the governmental immunity statute - it follows \r\n  that acts not within the â€œscope of employmentâ€ are not within the â€œscope of \r\n  official duties.â€\r\nWe recognize that whether an \r\n  act is within the â€œscope of employmentâ€ may be determined by implication from \r\n  the circumstances of a particular case.Â  Hamilton v. Miller, 301 S.C. \r\n  45, 48, 389 S.E.2d 652, 653 (1990); Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. \r\n  311, 319, 498 S.E.2d 684, 688 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In Prince, we held that \r\n  the course of someoneâ€™s employment requires some â€œact in furtherance of the \r\n  employerâ€™s business.â€ 304 S.C. at 246, 403 S.E.2d at 647.\r\nOur jurisprudence includes three \r\n  cases that consider whether sexual advances were within the â€œscope of an employeeâ€™s \r\n  employment.â€Â  Because the cases did not relate to governmental immunity, the \r\n  court of appeals declined to apply them.Â  Nonetheless, we find that â€œscope of \r\n  employmentâ€ is a term of art, and therefore we look to the cases involving insurance \r\n  policies for guidance.\r\nIn the first case, this Court \r\n  held that a police officerâ€™s sexual assaults of women during traffic stops were \r\n  not within the scope of his official duties, and therefore the acts were not \r\n  covered under the stateâ€™s general tort liability policy. Doe v. South Carolina \r\n  State Budget and Control Bd., 337 S.C. 294, 523 S.E.2d 457 (1999).Â  In the \r\n  second case, the court of appeals held that a professor was not acting within \r\n  the scope of his employment when he sexually harassed a student.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the professorâ€™s conduct was not covered under the universityâ€™s liability insurance \r\n  policy.Â  Padgett v. South Carolina Ins. Reserve Fund, 340 S.C. 250, 253, \r\n  531 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In the third case, the court of appeals \r\n  held that a sheriffâ€™s sexual advances toward three of his female officers was \r\n  not within the scope of the sheriffâ€™s official duties.Â  Loadholt v. S.C. \r\n  State Budget and Control Bd., 339 S.C. 165, 528 S.E.2d 670 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nAccording to these cases, sexual \r\n  harassment by a government employee is not within the employeeâ€™s â€œscope of employment.â€Â  \r\n  Therefore, in the present case, we hold that Badgerâ€™s sexual advances toward \r\n  Frazier were outside the scope of his official duties or employment.Â  \r\nThe more difficult question is \r\n  whether Badgerâ€™s retaliatory conduct was within the scope of his official \r\n  duties or employment.Â  Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find \r\n  no evidence that any of Badgerâ€™s retaliatory conduct was done in furtherance \r\n  of his employerâ€™s business.Â  This is not to say that a jury charge on the law \r\n  of governmental immunity is inappropriate in every case where allegations are \r\n  made against a governmental official for retaliatory conduct.Â  What a plaintiff \r\n  may call â€œretaliatory conductâ€ may be justified by some independent employer \r\n  interest, warranting a charge on governmental immunity.Â  We find Badgerâ€™s moving \r\n  Frazierâ€™s class to the schoolâ€™s stage and basement furthered none of the schoolâ€™s \r\n  legitimate interests because Frazierâ€™s old classroom was left unused.Â  In addition, \r\n  none of the schoolâ€™s legitimate interests were furthered by Badgerâ€™s failure \r\n  to repair Frazierâ€™s air and heating unit or Badgerâ€™s repeated threats to fire \r\n  Frazier.Â  \r\nWe find that Badgerâ€™s retaliatory \r\n  conduct was a continuation of his improper sexual advances toward Frazier and \r\n  was a product of personal, not occupational, motives.Â  The principle of governmental \r\n  immunity is not intended to protect a defendant such as Badger who has used \r\n  his authority for nothing more than to personally retaliate against an employee.Â  \r\n  In addition, section 15-78-70(b) denies governmental immunity for defendants \r\n  whose actions involve actual malice and an intent to harm.Â  We find that Badgerâ€™s \r\n  retaliatory conduct involved actual malice and an intention to harm Frazier.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the \r\n  trial judge did not err in rejecting Badgerâ€™s request to charge the jury on \r\n  the defense of governmental immunity because the evidence did not support such \r\n  a charge.\r\nII. Motion For Mistrial\r\nAt pretrial, the trial judge \r\n  granted a motion in limine excluding evidence of Badgerâ€™s alleged attempted \r\n  rape of Frazier approximately fifteen years ago.Â  At trial, Badger testified \r\n  that he and Frazier had a â€œplayfulâ€ relationship when he coached her in basketball.Â  \r\n  When Frazier took the stand, she testified that Badger began making sexual advances \r\n  toward her when he was her high school basketball coach.Â  Badger argues that \r\n  this evidence was inadmissible, and thus the trial judge should have granted \r\n  his motion for mistrial.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nA litigant cannot complain of \r\n  prejudice by reason of an issue he has placed before the court.Â  See State \r\n  v. Brown, 344 S.C. 70, 543 S.E.2d. 552 (2001) (petitioner cannot complain \r\n  of prejudice from evidence he has brought before the jury); State v. Robinson, \r\n  305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d. 404 (1991) (a party will be unsuccessful in opposing \r\n  the admission of evidence if that party was the one who opened the door).Â  \r\nWhether a motion for mistrial \r\n  should be granted is within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion, and the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown.Â  \r\n  Tucker v. Reynolds, 268 S.C. 330, 334, 233 S.E.2d. 402, 404 (1977).\r\nBadger, not Frazier, first testified \r\n  that he and Frazier had a â€œplayfulâ€ relationship when he was her basketball \r\n  coach.Â  Once Badger introduced the nature of the relationship, he opened the \r\n  door, allowing Frazier to testify as to her perspective of the past relationship.Â  \r\n  According to Brown, Frazierâ€™s testimony was admissible and non-prejudicial \r\n  since Badger himself introduced the matter.Â  Therefore, we find that Badgerâ€™s \r\n  motion for mistrial was properly denied.\r\nIII.Â  Outrage in lieu of Sexual HarassmentÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBadger argues that Frazier should \r\n  have brought a claim against Badger for sexual harassment, not the tort of outrage, \r\n  citing Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 283 S.C. 155, \r\n  175, 321 S.E.2d 602, 613 (Ct. App. 1984), quashed on other grounds, 287 \r\n  S.C. 190, 336 S.E.2d 472 (1985), in which this Court held:Â  â€œ[t]he tort of outrage \r\n  was designed not as a replacement for the existing tort actions.Â  Rather, it \r\n  was conceived as a remedy for tortious conduct where no remedy previously existed.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWe recognize that Frazier had \r\n  a statutory right to file a civil rights complaint against Badger for sexual \r\n  harassment.Â  However, because this is a right created by statute and not the \r\n  common law of torts, we find no reason to restrict Frazierâ€™s right to sue Badger \r\n  based upon the common law tort of outrage.\r\nIV. Special Interrogatories\r\nBadger argues that the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred in affirming the trial judgeâ€™s denial of his request to submit \r\n  special interrogatories to the jury.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe trial judge has the discretion \r\n  to determine whether to submit special interrogatories.Â  Rule 49(b) SCRCP; Constant \r\n  v. Spartanburg Steel Products, Inc., 316 S.C. 86, 90, 447 S.E.2d 194, 196 \r\n  (1994).Â  To warrant a reversal, a party must show that he was prejudiced by \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s refusal to submit special interrogatories.Â  Steele v. Dillard, \r\n  327 S.C. 340, 343, 486 S.E.2d 278, 279-80 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In Anderson v. \r\n  West, this Court held â€œthat where a jury returns a general verdict involving \r\n  two or more issues and its verdict is supported as to at least one issue, the \r\n  verdict will not be reversed.â€ 270 S.C. 184, 188, 241 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1978).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHere, Badger requested that the \r\n  trial judge require the jury to make specific findings of fact as to Frazierâ€™s \r\n  allegations of Badgerâ€™s sexual misconduct and retaliation.Â  Instead, the trial \r\n  judge gave a general jury charge on the tort of outrage.Â  \r\nWe agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis on this issue: \r\n\r\n\r\n[t]here was no need to submit \r\n  special interrogatories to the jury for specific findings of fact, as the two \r\n  parts of her claim cannot be compartmentalized.Â  As Frazierâ€™s only claim before \r\n  the jury was that of outrage, the jury would have simply found for Badger if \r\n  the jurors believed the elements of outrage had been met.\r\n\r\nFrazier v. Badger, Op. \r\n  No. 2002-UP-513, page 6 (Ct. App., filed August 20, 2002).\r\nBadger was unable to show that \r\n  he suffered prejudice from the trial judgeâ€™s general jury charge on outrage.Â Â  \r\n  Further, we find no reason to believe that the jury misunderstood the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s charge on outrage and recognize the existence of evidence warranting \r\n  Frazierâ€™s recovery on this claim.Â  Therefore, we hold that the trial judge did \r\n  not abuse his discretion in denying Badgerâ€™s request to submit special interrogatories \r\n  to the jury.\r\nV. Excessive Punitive \r\n  DamagesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBadger argues that the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred in upholding the juryâ€™s punitive damage award because Frazier \r\n  failed to introduce evidence of Badgerâ€™s ability to pay, which he argues is \r\n  the most important factor in a constitutional review of an award of punitive \r\n  damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, a defendantâ€™s inability \r\n  to pay does not prohibit a jury from awarding punitive damages.Â  In Gamble \r\n  v. Stevenson, this Court established eight factors for a trial court to \r\n  apply in a post-verdict review of punitive damages.Â  305 S.C. 104, 111, 406 \r\n  S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991).Â  The ability of the defendant to pay the punitive damages \r\n  awarded is only one of eight factors.Â  As part of its holding in Gamble, \r\n  this Court opined, â€œthe trial court shall conduct a post-trial review \r\n  and may consider the followingâ€¦â€ Id. (emphasis added).Â  The word \r\n  â€œmayâ€ signifies that the Gamble factors are to provide guidance, not \r\n  â€œhard and fastâ€ requirements.Â  Further, â€œpost-trialâ€ signifies that the Gamble \r\n  factors are to be applied after a verdict, by the judge, not the jury.\r\nSecond, this Court has consistently \r\n  held that an award of punitive damages will not be overturned because a defendant \r\n  is unable to pay. While a defendantâ€™s wealth is a relevant factor in assessing \r\n  punitive damages, it is not necessarily controlling.Â  Hicks v. Herring, \r\n  246 S.C. 429, 144 S.E.2d 151 (1965).Â  There is â€œno requirement that the defendant \r\n  be a man of means before the jury is justified in awarding punitive damages.â€Â  \r\n  Norton v. Ewaskio, 241 S.C. 557, 565, 129 S.E.2d 517, 521 (1963).Â  A \r\n  jury may consider a defendantâ€™s financial worth in determining the amount of \r\n  punitive damages to award, but a jury is not required to make this consideration \r\n  before it may award punitive damages.Â  Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., \r\n  233 S.C. 567, 106 S.E.2d 258 (1958).Â  \r\nThird, the United States Supreme \r\n  Court recently refused to include the defendantâ€™s ability to pay in its due \r\n  process analysis of punitive damages.Â  State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.Â  v. Campbell, \r\n  538 U.S. 408, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 155 L. Ed. 2d 585 (2003).Â  Instead, the Campbell \r\n  Court held that â€œthe most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive \r\n  damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s conduct.â€Â  \r\n  Id at __, 123 S. Ct. at 1521 (citing BMW of North America, Inc.Â  v. \r\n  Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 575, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 1598 (1996)).Â  \r\nAccording to the Campbell \r\n  analysis, the award in this case is constitutional:Â  the award fairly reflects \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s reprehensibility; represents a 1 to 1 ratio to actual damages; \r\n  and is comparable to punitive damages awards in other cases involving the tort \r\n  of outrage.Â  See Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 155 L. Ed. \r\n  2d 585 (2003)(In determining the constitutionality of a punitive damages award, \r\n  the reviewing court must look to three guideposts: Â (1) the degree of reprehensibility \r\n  of the defendantâ€™s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual and potential \r\n  harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference \r\n  between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized \r\n  or imposed in comparable cases.) \r\nTherefore, the punitive damages \r\n  award in this case does not offend Badgerâ€™s due process.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the ruling of \r\n  the Court of Appeals, upholding the juryâ€™s award of $200,000 actual damages \r\n  and $200,000 punitive damages for Frazier.\r\n MOORE, \r\n  WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The school never transformed Frazierâ€™s original classroom into a \r\n    computer lab.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Section 15-78-70 is a provision within the South Carolina Tort Claims \r\n    Act titled,Â  â€œLiability for act of government employee; requirement that agency \r\n    or political subdivision be named party defendant; effect of judgment or settlement.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-09-22-01","description":"These amendments were made necessary by the Court's adoption of an amended Lawyer's Oath and a new Judge's oath.","date":"2004-09-27","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina  \r\nRE:Â  Amendments to the South Carolina \r\n  Appellate Court Rules.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n  \r\n\r\nSince the Court has adopted new Lawyerâ€™s \r\n  and Judgeâ€™s Oaths, it has become necessary to amend the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 502, SCACR, and to add a new Rule 502.1 containing the new Judgeâ€™s Oath.Â  \r\n  The attached amendments are effective immediately.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.
