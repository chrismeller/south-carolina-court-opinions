David, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.26778Â Â Â  \r\n  Submitted January 25, 2010 - Filed March\r\n1, 2010\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy\r\n          Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Coming B. Gibbs, Jr., for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand.Â  Respondent\r\n  also agrees to complete the Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program (LEAPP) Trust Account School and Ethics School.Â  We accept the Agreement, issue a public\r\n  reprimand, and require respondent to complete the LEAPP Trust Account School\r\n  and Ethics School.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\nFor more than\r\n  twenty years, respondent maintained a client trust account (the Old Account)\r\n  without keeping accurate records and without proper reconciliation of the\r\n  account.Â  In 2006, following an audit by respondentâ€™s title insurance company,\r\n  respondent opened a new trust account (the New Account) because he was unable\r\n  to sufficiently identify the funds in the Old Account or adequately document\r\n  outstanding disbursements.Â  Although respondent opened and began to use the New\r\n  Account, he continued to use the Old Account for a significant number of his\r\n  clientsâ€™ transactions.Â  \r\nIn August 2008,\r\n  respondent issued approximately twenty-six checks on the New Account when there\r\n  were not sufficient funds in the account to cover them.Â  When those checks were\r\n  presented to the bank, reports were submitted by the bank to the Commission on\r\n  Lawyer Conduct pursuant to Rule 1.15(h), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  In response to\r\n  the reports from the bank, and the resulting disciplinary investigation, respondent\r\n  retained an accountant to assist him in determining the cause of the\r\n  overdrafts.Â  \r\nIn the meantime,\r\n  respondent began making deposits of his own funds into the New Account to cover\r\n  what he thought were the remaining outstanding checks.Â  However, because\r\n  respondent had not adopted appropriate recordkeeping and reconciliation\r\n  practices upon opening the New Account, his estimate of the total amount of\r\n  outstanding checks was incorrect.Â  This inaccuracy, coupled with the fact that\r\n  respondent continued to issue checks on the New Account, resulted in additional\r\n  overdrafts.Â  \r\nBetween August 1,\r\n  2008 and October 31, 2008, respondent issued approximately sixty-one checks on\r\n  the New Account, totaling in excess of $1,147,000, on insufficient funds.Â \r\n  According to the results of the audit, the overdrafts on the New Account were\r\n  caused by several wires of incoming funds being sent erroneously to the Old\r\n  Account rather than to the New Account.Â  Because respondent was not confirming\r\n  that his wires were received in the correct account prior to disbursement, he\r\n  issued checks from the New Account not knowing that the funds were not\r\n  available.\r\nRespondent had\r\n  delegated complete control over the law office accounting, including both trust\r\n  accounts, to a single employee.Â  She was responsible for issuing checks, making\r\n  deposits, reconciling the accounts, reviewing bank statements, and maintaining\r\n  records.Â  Respondent gave her a signature stamp and authorized her use of it on\r\n  trust account checks.Â  She had very little formal accounting education and\r\n  received no instruction or training from respondent regarding ethical\r\n  obligations related to client funds.Â  Respondent did not review his bank\r\n  statements, his financial records, or the employeeâ€™s reconciliation reports.Â \r\n  Over a period of about two years, the employee removed approximately $320,000\r\n  from the Old Account to the firmâ€™s operating account, although the firm was not\r\n  entitled to the funds.Â  Because respondent was not adequately supervising the\r\n  management of the accounts, respondent was unaware of the transfers until the\r\n  audit was conducted.Â  \r\nAs a result of\r\n  the audit, respondent has now identified all outstanding checks and created\r\n  accurate client ledgers.Â  Respondent has confirmed that all outstanding checks\r\n  have either been paid or have sufficient funds on deposit to cover them.Â  The\r\n  incorrect wires into the Old Account in August 2008 covered the funds\r\n  improperly removed from that account to the operating account by respondentâ€™s\r\n  employee.Â  The shortages caused in the New Account by the incorrect wires were\r\n  restored by deposit of respondentâ€™s own funds.Â  Based on the information now\r\n  available, it does not appear that any clients, third parties, or banks have\r\n  suffered any losses.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3\r\n  (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a\r\n  client); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall hold client property\r\n  in the lawyer's possession in connection with a representation separate from\r\n  the lawyer's own property; client property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded, with complete\r\n  records of such account funds and other property kept by the lawyer; a lawyer\r\n  may deposit the lawyer's own funds in a client trust account for the sole\r\n  purpose of paying service charges on that account, but only in an amount\r\n  necessary for that purpose; a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or\r\n  third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is\r\n  entitled to receive); Rule 5.1 (a lawyer who possesses managerial authority in a law\r\n  firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect\r\n  measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 5.3 (a lawyer who possesses managerial authority in a law firm\r\n  shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures\r\n  giving reasonable assurance that a nonlawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible\r\n  with the professional obligations of the lawyer and a lawyer having direct\r\n  supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to\r\n  ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional\r\n  obligations of the lawyer); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct).\r\nRespondent further admits\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) of the\r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct).Â  Finally, respondent admits he failed to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of\r\n  Rule 417, SCACR.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand. Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and\r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  Respondent shall also,\r\n  within one year of the date of this opinion, complete the LEAPP Trust Account\r\n  School and Ethics School.Â  \r\n\r\nFinally, respondent shall, within thirty days of the date of this\r\n  order, pay $502.23, which represents the costs incurred by the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in the investigation\r\n  and prosecution of this matter.Â  \r\nPUBLIC\r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26779","title":"Doe v.

Roe, 379 S.C. 291, 665 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  We reverse.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case\r\n  involves the biological child of petitioner Jane Roe (Mother) and respondent John\r\n  Doe (Father).Â  The child (Daughter) was born on March 6, 2005.Â  In December\r\n  2005, when Daughter was nine months old, Father filed suit seeking\r\n  paternity testing, and primary custody or visitation.Â  Mother answered,\r\n  admitted Father was the biological father, and sought termination of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights.\r\nIn October 2006,\r\n  when daughter was 19 months old, the family court held a hearing.Â  All the\r\n  parties - i.e., Mother, Father, and the guardian ad litem (GAL) for Daughter -\r\n  agreed to proceed on Motherâ€™s termination of parental rights (TPR) counterclaim\r\n  first.Â  The family court issued a final order in December 2006 which found that\r\n  Father had: (1) willfully failed to pay support for Daughter for a period in\r\n  excess of six months, and (2) willfully failed to visit the child for a period\r\n  in excess of six months.Â  Additionally, the family court found that termination\r\n  of Fatherâ€™s parental rights would be in the best interest of Daughter.Â \r\n  Therefore, the family court ordered that Fatherâ€™s rights and obligations to\r\n  Daughter be terminated.Â  \r\nFather appealed,\r\n  and the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.Â  The Court of Appeals held that\r\n  the family court had erred by determining TPR was in Daughterâ€™s best interest.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals stated that TPR â€œis premature at this juncture and is,\r\n  therefore, not in [Daughterâ€™s] best interest.â€[1]Â  Doe v. Roe, 379 S.C. at 300, 665\r\n  S.E.2d at 187.Â  Furthermore, the Court of Appeals remanded to the family court\r\n  â€œto issue an order of visitation and to establish Fatherâ€™s duty of support.â€Â  Id.Â \r\n  We thereafter granted Motherâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 2004,\r\n  Mother found out she was pregnant and informed both Father and another man she\r\n  was dating about the pregnancy.Â  Mother told both men that either one could be\r\n  the biological father.Â  Mother and the other man (FiancÃ©) resumed an exclusive\r\n  relationship in December 2004 when Mother was six months pregnant; they became\r\n  engaged in May 2005.\r\nWhen Mother was\r\n  about three or four months pregnant, she, Father, and FiancÃ© had lunch together\r\n  and discussed the costs of paternity testing.Â  They decided to split the cost\r\n  of the test.Â  At Fatherâ€™s suggestion, they agreed to only test FiancÃ© because\r\n  it was cheaper than doing two tests.Â  Mother explained that because they were\r\n  all college students, money was an issue.[2]Â  FiancÃ© ordered the paternity test.\r\nAlthough Father attended one prenatal appointment when Mother had\r\n  a sonogram, it was FiancÃ© who went to almost all the other prenatal\r\n  appointments with Mother.Â  FiancÃ© also became Motherâ€™s birthing coach.Â \r\n  Although Father did arrive at the hospital on the day of Daughterâ€™s birth,\r\n  FiancÃ© was present in the delivery room.Â  FiancÃ© testified that when Father was\r\n  at the hospital, he asked Father about paying his share of the paternity test,\r\n  but Father did not have the money. \r\nThe day after Daughter was born, Father and FiancÃ© were both in\r\n  Motherâ€™s hospital room.Â  In the afternoon, shortly after Motherâ€™s own father\r\n  (Grandfather) arrived, Mother asked Grandfather to get Father to leave.Â \r\n  Grandfather spoke to Father outside the room and asked him to leave because\r\n  Mother no longer wanted him in the room.Â  Grandfather stated that Father was not\r\n  receptive to leaving; according to Grandfather, he explained that if Father did\r\n  not leave, hospital security would be called.\r\nLater that week, Father went to Grandfatherâ€™s apartment to talk.Â \r\n  Grandfather testified that he tried to explain how parenthood meant both rights\r\n  and responsibilities, and if Father was not ready for the responsibility then\r\n  he needed to give up his parental rights.Â  According to Father, however,\r\n  Grandfather used a threatening tone during this conversation.Â  Father\r\n  acknowledged that Grandfather brought up the subject of child support and later\r\n  emailed him the DSS website link for the child support calculator. \r\nFiancÃ© did the paternity test at the hospital, and on March 15,\r\n  2005, the results came back that FiancÃ© was excluded as the biological\r\n  father of Daughter.Â  At Motherâ€™s request, Grandfather called Father and\r\n  informed him of the results of the paternity test.Â  That same day, Mother sent\r\n  Father an email with photos of the baby.Â  Two days later, Fatherâ€™s own mother\r\n  visited Mother and the baby; Mother emailed Father with photos of that visit\r\n  and asked him to forward them to his mother.Â  \r\nFather testified\r\n  at the family court hearing that since Daughterâ€™s birth he had not paid one\r\n  penny of financial support and had not had any visitation with Daughter.Â \r\n  Approximately one year after she was born, he opened a bank account for\r\n  Daughter but in his own name.Â  At the time of the hearing there was\r\n  $1,655.81 in the account.Â  He admitted, however, that he had â€œborrowedâ€ from\r\n  this bank account more than once.Â  He stated he had been told that Mother did\r\n  not want his money or to be contacted by him. Â \r\nFather testified\r\n  extensively about his spotty work history and criminal record.Â  He has\r\n  convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) in September 2003 and driving\r\n  under suspension (DUS) in March 2005.[3]Â  In October 2003, Father was charged with contributing to the\r\n  delinquency of a minor after he was caught in a car, partially dressed, with an\r\n  underage girl.Â  Eventually this charge was dismissed in January 2006.[4] Â Â Â \r\nAt the time of\r\n  the hearing, Father was living with his mother.Â  He has never paid for his own\r\n  health or car insurance, and he stated that his mother had paid the retainer\r\n  fee for his attorney in this lawsuit.[5]Â  Father does not work in the graphic design field which is what\r\n  he studied at Clemson.Â  In October 2006, Father was working a job for $10 per\r\n  hour and no benefits.Â  When asked about his income, he stated he had - in\r\n  October - â€œalready surpassed 10,000â€ dollars of taxable income for that year.Â \r\n  Father also acknowledged that he frequently has been in arrears on both his\r\n  student loans and other debt obligations.\r\nMother, on the\r\n  other hand, has worked a steady, full-time job with benefits since graduating\r\n  from Clemson; at the time of the hearing in October 2006, Mother owned a\r\n  townhouse.[6]Â  FiancÃ©, a 26-year-old full-time member of the South Carolina\r\n  National Guard, had just returned from 13 months of active military service in\r\n  Afghanistan.Â  Both Mother and FiancÃ© testified that FiancÃ© was actively\r\n  involved in Daughterâ€™s life prior to his deployment, and had kept up\r\n  communications while overseas; additionally, FiancÃ© stated he loves Daughter\r\n  and would like to adopt her.Â  \r\nFinally, the GAL\r\n  expressed her opinion to the family court that it would be in Daughterâ€™s best\r\n  interest for Fatherâ€™s parental rights to be terminated.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family courtâ€™s\r\n    decision to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights to Daughter?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGrounds for termination of\r\n  parental rights must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  E.g., S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419,\r\n  423&nbsp;(2003).Â  Upon appellate review, this Court may make its own conclusion\r\n  from the record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the\r\n  termination.Â  Id.Â  The appellate court, however, is not required to\r\n  ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in\r\n  a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight\r\n  to their testimony.Â  E.g., S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars,\r\n  367 S.C. 623, 627 S.E.2d 718 (2006).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe TPR procedures are governed by statute. See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2510 et seq. (Supp. 2008);[7] Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King,\r\n  369 S.C. 96, 104, 631 S.E.2d 239, 243&nbsp;(2006).Â  The purpose of the TPR statute is:\r\n\r\n  [T]o establish procedures for the reasonable and\r\n    compassionate termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of these\r\n    children and make them eligible for adoption by persons who will provide a\r\n    suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a happy,\r\n    healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2510\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nMoreover, the TPR statutes â€œmust\r\n  be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for\r\n  freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by\r\n  terminating the parent-child relationship. Â The interests of the child shall\r\n    prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  Â§\r\n  63-7-2620 (emphasis added); see also Joiner v. Rivas, 342\r\n  S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (overruling prior cases calling for strict\r\n  construction of the TPR statutes).\r\nThe family court may order TPR\r\n  upon a finding of one or more delineated grounds and a finding that\r\n  termination is in the best interest of the child. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570.Â \r\n  The two statutory grounds asserted in this case are the willful failure to\r\n  support and the willful failure to visit, defined statutorily as follows:\r\n\r\n  (3) The child has lived outside the home of either\r\n    parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully\r\n    failed to visit the child. Â The court may attach little or no weight to\r\n    incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented\r\n    from visiting by the party having custody or by court order. Â The distance of the\r\n    childâ€™s placement from the parentâ€™s home must be taken into consideration when\r\n    determining the ability to visit.\r\n  (4) The child has lived outside the home of either\r\n    parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully\r\n    failed to support the child. Â Failure to support means that the parent has\r\n    failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care. Â A material\r\n    contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s\r\n    means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the\r\n    care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means. Â The court may consider all\r\n    relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully\r\n    failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian\r\n    and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nWe find the evidence clearly\r\n  and convincingly supports that Father willfully failed to visit and support\r\n  Daughter for over six months.Â  Father was definitively on notice that he was\r\n  the biological father from March 15, 2005 (when FiancÃ© was excluded by the DNA\r\n  test), yet Father failed to take legal action until nine months later.Â  In the\r\n  interim, his brief and few contacts were with Mother only, and he never\r\n  requested visitation with Daughter and never sent any financial support.[8]Â  Accordingly, we hold the family court properly found\r\n  that these statutory grounds were met.\r\nThus, the dispositive issue\r\n  is whether it is within Daughterâ€™s best interest to have Fatherâ€™s parental\r\n  rights terminated.Â  \r\nFatherâ€™s behavior as it\r\n  relates to the statutory grounds for termination is appropriately reviewed for\r\n  purposes of the best interest analysis because such conduct â€œevinces a settled\r\n  purpose to forego parental duties.â€ Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden,\r\n  354 S.C. at 610, 582 S.E.2d at 423 (citation omitted).Â  Here, Father without a\r\n  doubt did not even attempt to fulfill his parental duties of support and\r\n  visitation. Â Although we recognize Father filed this action and sought\r\n  visitation when Daughter was nine months old, we nonetheless hold that this\r\n  action simply â€œcame too lateâ€ for it to have any significant import.Â  Id. at 611, 582 S.E.2d at 423.\r\nIn addition to the evidence\r\n  which supports the statutory grounds of failing to visit and failing to\r\n  support, we note the following facts and their impact on the best interest\r\n  analysis.\r\nFirst, we find Fatherâ€™s work history reflects an inability to keep a job\r\n  and several instances of being fired for cause.Â  The testimony at the hearing\r\n  shows he is not financially independent.Â  Moreover, Fatherâ€™s criminal record is\r\n  cause for concern.Â  Collectively, this evidence not only indicates that he\r\n  would likely continue to have trouble meeting his financial obligations toward\r\n  the child, but more importantly, it also evinces a high level of both\r\n  instability and immaturity that is inherently contrary to the best interest of\r\n  Daughter.\r\nSecond, Father\r\n  could produce no evidence that he ever asked for visitation with Daughter prior\r\n  to filing the lawsuit.Â  Yet, the testimony showed Mother generally responded to\r\n  Fatherâ€™s attempts to communicate with her; moreover, his own mother had visited\r\n  with Daughter after she came home from the hospital.Â  Thus, there was no\r\n  apparent roadblock to Father visiting Daughter.Â  What this signifies is that\r\n  Father was consciously indifferent to the rights - and emotional needs - of his\r\n  infant daughter for at least nine months.Â  Cf. Abernathy v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 31, 437 S.E.2d 25, 28&nbsp;(1993)\r\n  (â€œ[P]arental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection\r\n  between parent and child. They require relationships more enduring.â€)\r\n  (citations omitted).\r\nWe now turn briefly to the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion which found that the family court erred in ordering\r\n  TPR.Â  The Court of Appeals stated the following:\r\n\r\n  [T]here\r\n    is no indication that terminating Fatherâ€™s rights will ensure future stability\r\n    for [Daughter] or that keeping Fatherâ€™s parental rights intact will disrupt\r\n    [Daughterâ€™s] current living situation.Â  Instead, keeping Fatherâ€™s parental\r\n    rights intact simply allows Father to establish a relationship with [Daughter]\r\n    and to provide emotional and financial support for [Daughter].Â  While we\r\n    acknowledge that there is some evidence to suggest that Mother had plans to\r\n    marry and that FiancÃ© may adopt [Daughter], these plans have not been\r\n    finalized.Â  Further, at oral argument, nearly three years after Motherâ€™s\r\n    engagement, counsel was unable to confirm such plans. Â Thus,\r\n      while we recognize that a stable family relationship may be in a childâ€™s best\r\n      interest, we find the request herein to be premature based on the record\r\n      presented.Â  If anything, given Motherâ€™s situation and Fatherâ€™s demonstrated\r\n      desire to establish a relationship with [Daughter], we find that keeping Fatherâ€™s\r\n      rights intact under these circumstances will only serve to benefit [Daughter]\r\n      by allowing the familial bond between Father and [Daughter] to be furthered.\r\n\r\nDoe\r\n  v. Roe, 379 S.C. at 298-99, 665\r\n  S.E.2d at 186.\r\nMother argues the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in concluding there is â€œno indication that terminating Fatherâ€™s\r\n  rights will ensure future stability for [Daughter] or that keeping Fatherâ€™s\r\n  parental rights intact will disrupt [Daughterâ€™s] current living situation.â€Â  We\r\n  agree with Mother.Â  At the time of the hearing, Mother and FiancÃ© had\r\n  established a solid relationship with Daughter, who was at that time 19 months\r\n  old.Â  In stark contrast, Father had no relationship with her whatsoever.Â \r\n  FiancÃ© testified he loves Daughter and wants to adopt her.Â  Overturning the\r\n  family courtâ€™s decision to terminate Fatherâ€™s rights clearly conflicts with the\r\n  TPR statuteâ€™s purpose to make a child eligible for adoption by someone â€œwho\r\n  will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a\r\n  happy, healthful, and productive life.â€Â  Â§ 63-7-2510.\r\nMoreover, we find Mother has\r\n  consistently and appropriately fostered stability for Daughter since her birth.Â \r\n  It appears the Court of Appeals inappropriately placed Fatherâ€™s belated\r\n  interest in fostering a relationship with Daughter above Daughterâ€™s significant\r\n  interest in stability.Â  We reiterate the TPR statute makes clear that if the\r\n  parentâ€™s interests conflict with those of the child, it is the childâ€™s\r\n    interests that shall prevail.Â  Â§ 63-7-2620.Â  In the instant case, it is\r\n  more important that Daughterâ€™s stability be maintained.Â  We note that the TPR\r\n  statute clearly states that six months is the appropriate time period\r\n  for parental action.Â  Â§ 63-7-2570; see also Arscott v. Bacon,\r\n  351 S.C. 44, 54, 567 S.E.2d 898, 903&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (â€œdoubt as to\r\n  paternity does not totally absolve a putative father of his responsibility to\r\n  take steps to protect his rightsâ€).Â  Father was put on notice by Mother in July\r\n  2004 that he could be the father of her unborn child, and was definitively put\r\n  on notice in March 2005 that he was the likely biological father.Â  Father\r\n  failed to take any actions - legal or otherwise -Â  for nine months with no\r\n  justifiable reason for this delay.\r\nFinally, we disagree with the\r\n  Court of Appeals that any TPR decision is â€œpremature.â€Â  On the contrary, this\r\n  case was fully ripe for a TPR decision.Â  The statutory requirements for grounds\r\n  had been met, a GAL had been appointed, extensive discovery had been done, and\r\n  a full adversarial hearing was held.Â  The record is sufficient for a best\r\n  interest determination.Â  We hold the family court correctly ruled it was in\r\n  Daughterâ€™s best interest to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in reversing the family courtâ€™s decision to order TPR.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, J. and\r\n  Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  Because I believe the Court of Appeals correctly decided the case I would\r\n  dismiss as improvidently granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Because of its ruling on best interest, the Court of\r\n  Appeals did not address Fatherâ€™s argument that the family court erred in\r\n  finding there was clear and convincing evidence proving the statutory grounds\r\n  of willful failure to visit and willful failure to support.\r\n[2] Mother and Father both attended Clemson University.Â \r\n  Mother graduated cum laude in December 2004.Â  Father attended Clemson\r\n  â€œoff and onâ€ for over seven years, starting in 1997 and last attending in Fall semester\r\n  2004.Â  Father testified that when he left Clemson, he did not have a high\r\n  enough grade point average to continue as a Clemson student.Â  At the time of\r\n  the family court hearing, Father was 27 years old, had not completed his\r\n  college education, and had approximately $30,000 in student loans, several of\r\n  which had been co-signed and serviced by his mother and his sister.Â  \r\n[3]Â  On the day Daughter was born, Father drove to the\r\n  hospital even though his license was suspended.Â  Indeed, Father admitted to\r\n  driving during the entire time period his license was suspended, from June 2003\r\n  until June 2005.Â  Moreover, although Fatherâ€™s 30-day jail sentence on the DUI\r\n  was suspended upon 48 hours of community service, he failed to perform the\r\n  community service and spent three weeks in jail.Â  \r\n[4] Father was under bond restrictions while the\r\n  contributing to the delinquency of a minor charge was pending.Â  One of the\r\n  restrictions was that Father could not leave the state of South Carolina.Â \r\n  Father did, however, live in both Georgia and Florida during this time period. \r\n[5] According to Father, he pays his mother $100 per\r\n  month toward expenses.\r\n[6] Mother took three months maternity leave, but\r\n  otherwise has maintained full-time employment at one company.Â  She lived with\r\n  her mother prior to buying her own home.\r\n[7] The TPR statute was previously codified at Â§Â§\r\n  20-7-1560 et seq.\r\n[8] The family court recognized that Father claimed he\r\n  did not ask to visit Daughter because Grandfather told him not to make contact\r\n  and had threatened him.Â  There was a factual dispute about Fatherâ€™s discussions\r\n  with Grandfather, and the family court specifically found Grandfatherâ€™s\r\n  testimony â€œmore credibleâ€ than Fatherâ€™s.Â  Significantly, the family court also\r\n  noted that â€œwhether the alleged conversation took place is not material to the\r\n  outcome of the case.Â  The alleged conversation would not have been a\r\n    sufficient excuse for failing to visit or to ask to visit [Daughter].â€Â  We\r\n  agree with the family court.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26780","title":"Verenes v.

Alvanos (Appellant), as trustee.Â  At the time the\r\n  Trust was established, third-party defendant Robert C. Penland (Penland) was\r\n  President of HCC and signed the Trust documents in that capacity.Â  Penland was\r\n  also a beneficiary of the Trust.Â  On May 3, 2005, HCC petitioned the Aiken\r\n  County Probate Court for an order removing Appellant as trustee and naming\r\n  Penland as successor trustee.Â  Appellant was removed as trustee and Penland was\r\n  appointed successor trustee by order dated August 3, 2005.Â  \r\nOn October 27, 2006, HCC\r\n  filed suit in probate court against Appellant individually and as former\r\n  trustee of the Trust.Â  HCC captioned the action as one for &quot;Breach of\r\n  Trust,&quot; triable &quot;Non-Jury.&quot;Â  HCC's causes of action included\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty of care, breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, and one\r\n  for an accounting.Â  The relief sought for the alleged breach of fiduciary duty\r\n  of care was the restoration to the Trust any lost income, lost capital gain,\r\n  and lost appreciation in value caused by the alleged breach.Â  The relief sought\r\n  for the alleged breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty was disgorging all commissions\r\n  and profits received on the Trust's purchases of annuities and returning those commissions\r\n  to the Trust.[2]Â \r\n  The third cause of action is a classic cause of action for an accounting.Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant asserted a\r\n  third-party claim against Penland, alleging that Penland's actions caused\r\n  damages to the Trust, not any actions of Appellant.Â  Appellant's single cause\r\n  of action against Penland alleges entitlement under the alternate remedies of\r\n  equitable indemnity and contribution.Â Â Â  \r\nPursuant to an order by the\r\n  Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court, Judge Daniel R. Eckstrom was\r\n  appointed as special probate court judge for the present action and the case\r\n  was transferred to the Lexington County Probate Court.Â  Ultimately, Penland was\r\n  removed as successor trustee and James L. Verenes (Respondent) was substituted\r\n  as the named plaintiff as successor trustee of the Trust.Â  \r\nOn June 19, 2007, Appellant\r\n  timely filed a notice of removal and demand for trial by jury, requesting the\r\n  action be removed to the circuit court and the case tried by a jury.Â  On July\r\n  24, 2007, Appellant withdrew his request to have the matter transferred to the\r\n  circuit court, but renewed his demand for a jury trial.Â  By order filed\r\n  November 5, 2007, the probate judge denied Appellant's demand.Â  Appellant\r\n  appealed the probate court's denial to the circuit court pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 62-1-308 (2009).Â  The circuit court affirmed the probate court's denial\r\n  of Appellant's demand for a jury trial.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nIs Appellant entitled to a jury trial?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether a party is entitled\r\n  to a jury trial is a question of law.Â  See Mims Amusement Co. v. S.C.\r\n    Law Enforcement Div., 366 S.C. 141, 145, 621 S.E.2d 344, 345-46&nbsp;(2005).\r\n  Â An appellate court may decide questions of law with no particular deference to\r\n  the trial court. Â In re Campbell, 379 S.C. 593, 599, 666 S.E.2d 908,\r\n  911&nbsp;(2008) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the present\r\n  action is primarily a legal action for money damages such that he is entitled\r\n  to a jury trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Constitution provides &quot;[t]he right of trial by jury shall be preserved\r\n  inviolate.&quot; Â S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  &quot;The right to a trial by jury\r\n  is guaranteed in every case in which the right to a jury was secured at the\r\n  time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1868.&quot;Â  Mims Amusement Co.,&nbsp;366\r\n  S.C. at 149, 621 S.E.2d at 348 (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Generally, the\r\n  relevant question in determining the right to trial by jury is whether an\r\n  action is legal or equitable; there is no right to trial by jury for equitable\r\n  actions.&quot;Â  Lester v. Dawson,&nbsp;327 S.C. 263, 267, 491 S.E.2d\r\n  240, 242&nbsp;(1997).Â  A proceeding in probate court may either be an action at\r\n  law or in equity.Â  In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 278, 539 S.E.2d\r\n  703, 709&nbsp;(2000) (citation omitted). \r\nCharacterization of an &quot;action\r\n  as equitable or legal depends on the appellant's 'main purpose' in bringing the\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Ins. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. S.C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289,\r\n  293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318&nbsp;(1978) (citations omitted).[3] Â &quot;The main purpose of the action should generally be ascertained from the\r\n  body of the complaint.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted). Â &quot;However, if\r\n  necessary, resort may also be had to the prayer for relief and any other facts\r\n  and circumstances which throw light upon the main purpose of the action.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  The nature of the issues raised by the\r\n  pleadings and character of relief sought under them determines the character of\r\n  an action as legal or equitable.Â  Bell v. Mackey, 191 S.C 105, 119-20, 3\r\n  S.E.2d 816, 822&nbsp;(1939) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n&quot;Trusts have long and\r\n  broadly been a field for the jurisdiction of equity.&quot;Â  Epworth\r\n    Orphanage v. Long, 199 S.C. 385, 389, 19 S.E.2d 481, 482&nbsp;(1942).Â \r\n  &quot;A violation by a trustee of a duty the trustee owes to a beneficiary is a\r\n  breach of trust.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-1001(a) (2009).[4]Â \r\n  To remedy a breach of trust the court may compel the trustee to redress the\r\n  breach of trust by &quot;paying money, restoring property, or other\r\n  means.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 62-7-1001(b)(3).Â  The Comment to section 62-7-1001\r\n  states, &quot;The reference to payment of money in subsection (b)(3) includes\r\n  liability that might be characterized as damages, restitution, or\r\n  surcharge.&quot;Â  \r\nThis Court has held that an\r\n  action alleging a breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law.Â  See Corley\r\n    v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92 n.1, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 n.1&nbsp;(1997).Â  However, a\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty may sound in equity if the relief sought is equitable.[5]Â  See Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228, 230 n.3, 437 S.E.2d 132, 133\r\n  n.3&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  Restitution and disgorgement are equitable\r\n  remedies.Â  See Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\r\n  534 U.S. 204, 215-16&nbsp;(2002); see also Key Corporate\r\n    Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort,&nbsp;373 S.C. 55, 63, 644 S.E.2d 675,\r\n  679&nbsp;(2007) (Toal, C.J. dissenting) (noting disgorgement results from the equitable\r\n  remedy of restitution); Wallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 305 S.C. 118,\r\n  120, 406 S.E.2d 358, 359&nbsp;(1991) (stating restitution is an equitable\r\n  remedy).\r\nIn this case, Appellant\r\n  contends that Respondent's causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty of\r\n  care and breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty are actions at law that entitle\r\n  him to a jury trial.[6]Â \r\n  The remedy sought for the alleged breach of the fiduciary duty of care is\r\n  essentially the remedy of restitution.[7]Â \r\n  As noted above, the remedy sought by Respondent for the alleged breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty of care is restoring to the Trust the lost income, lost capital\r\n  gain, and lost appreciation in value as a result of the alleged breach.Â  Hence,\r\n  the remedy sought by Respondent is more akin to restitution than money damages,\r\n  particularly in light of the main purpose of the action.[8]Â \r\n  Because the nature of the issues raised by the pleadings and character of\r\n  relief sought for the alleged breach of the fiduciary duty of care is\r\n  equitable, Appellant does not have the right to a jury trial on that issue.\r\nThe remedy sought for the\r\n  alleged breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty is disgorgement.Â  As outlined\r\n  above, the relief sought for the alleged breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty is\r\n  disgorging all commissions and profits Appellant received on the Trust's\r\n  purchases of annuities and returning those commissions to the Trust.Â \r\n  Disgorgement is an equitable remedy, thus Appellant does not have the right to\r\n  a jury trial for the alleged breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty.Â  \r\nWhile Appellant will have to\r\n  pay money to the trust if the allegations are proven, that does not mean\r\n  Respondent's causes of action are legal in nature.Â  Upon looking at the body of\r\n  the complaint, the main purpose in bringing this action is equitable, not legal.Â \r\n  Respondent's breach of fiduciary duty claims seek equitable remedies, not\r\n  damages at law.Â  Thus, Appellant does not have the right to a jury trial. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn light of the nature of the\r\n  relief sought, Respondent's breach of fiduciary duty claims are equitable.Â \r\n  Because there is no right to trial by jury for equitable actions, the circuit\r\n  court did not err in denying Appellant a jury trial.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Formerly known as Houndslake Country Club, Inc.\r\n[2] Respondent never requested damages as a result of Appellant's alleged breach.\r\n[3] &quot;[T]he 'main purpose' rule evolved from a\r\n  determination that where a plaintiff has prayed for money damages in addition\r\n  to equitable relief, characterization of the action as equitable or legal\r\n  depends on the plaintiff's 'main purpose' in bringing the action.&quot;Â  Floyd\r\n    v. Floyd,&nbsp;306 S.C. 376, 380, 412 S.E.2d 397, 399&nbsp;(1991)\r\n  (citations omitted). \r\n[4] A trustee owes a trust a duty of loyalty.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-802\r\n  (2009).Â Â  Moreover, a trustee owes a trust a duty of reasonable care, skill,\r\n  and caution.Â  See id. Â§ 62-7-804.Â  \r\n[5] Dating back to our holding in O'Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 416 S.E.2d\r\n  629&nbsp;(1992), this Court has stated in several opinions that a breach of a\r\n  fiduciary duty is an action at law.Â  We now take this opportunity to stress\r\n  that an action for a breach of a fiduciary duty may sound in law or equity\r\n  depending on the nature of the relief sought.\r\n[6] Appellant does not dispute that an action for an accounting is an action\r\n  sounding in equity.Â  See Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon,&nbsp;381\r\n  S.C. 417, 427, 673 S.E.2d 448, 453&nbsp;(2009) (holding an action for\r\n  accounting sounds in equity).Â  Also, Appellant brought a claim against Penland\r\n  under the alternate remedies of equitable indemnity and contribution; both of\r\n  which are equitable remedies.Â  See RIM Assocs. v. Blackwell, 359\r\n  S.C. 170, 179 n.3, 597 S.E.2d 152, 157 n.3&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (stating an\r\n  action for contribution lies in equity);Â  Loyola Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thomasson\r\n    Props., 318 S.C. 92, 93, 456 S.E.2d 423, 424&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (citation\r\n  omitted) (noting a cause of action for equitable indemnity is necessarily\r\n  equitable in nature).\r\n[7] The remedy sought for the alleged breach of the\r\n  fiduciary duty of care is similar to the remedy for a constructive trust which\r\n  can arise from a breach of a fiduciary duty giving rise to the obligation in\r\n  equity to make restitution.Â  See Lollis v. Lollis,&nbsp;291 S.C.\r\n  525, 529, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561&nbsp;(1987).Â  In this case, there was an alleged\r\n  breach of a fiduciary duty and the plaintiff is asking that funds be restored\r\n  back into the Trust.Â Â  \r\n[8] This action was brought as a &quot;Breach of Trust.&quot;Â  As outlined above,\r\n  trusts have long been a field for the jurisdiction of equity.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26781","title":"Youmans v.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-175 (Supp. 2008).Â  Bracken\r\n  testified in camera that she reported to the hospital and met with\r\n  Victim.Â  Bracken stated she did not have recording equipment with her because\r\n  it was in the middle of the night and the hospital did not have recording\r\n  equipment in the room.Â  Bracken testified she did not conduct a follow-up\r\n  interview because she received a very clear disclosure from Victim and did not\r\n  want Victim to have to perform a second interview.Â  Bracken noted that getting\r\n  the statement from Victim was an emergency-type situation.Â  Bracken took notes\r\n  of Victim's statements and specifically noted direct quotations from Victim.Â \r\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel moved to exclude Victim's\r\n  statement to Bracken.Â  Defense counsel argued section 17-23-175 violated the ex\r\n    post facto laws and Appellant's right to confrontation.Â  The trial judge\r\n  denied the motion to suppress Victim's statement to Bracken.Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Bracken testified\r\n  Victim told her that when her mother left that afternoon, Appellant called her\r\n  to come upstairs, and when she went into the bedroom Appellant was naked on the\r\n  bed.Â  Bracken then stated Victim said Appellant kissed her vagina with his\r\n  mouth and touched under her panties with his penis.Â  Lastly, Bracken testified\r\n  Victim told her this was not the first time this happened.\r\nAt trial, the State called\r\n  Victim's guardian ad litem (GAL) as a witness.Â  Prior to the GAL's\r\n  testimony, defense counsel asked for a ruling from the court as to whether the\r\n  GAL could testify as to any incriminating statements made by Appellant to the\r\n  GAL during the GAL's interview of Appellant.Â  Defense counsel argued the GAL\r\n  was a state actor and allowing the GAL to testify against Appellant violated\r\n  his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  The trial court allowed the GAL to\r\n  testify.Â  The GAL testified Appellant admitted to her the police reports of the\r\n  incident were accurate and Victim initiated the incident.[1]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did\r\n  the trial court err in admitting the unrecorded out-of-court statement of\r\n  Victim to Bracken under section 17-23-175? \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did\r\n  the trial court err in admitting Appellant's admission to the GAL?\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did\r\n  the trial court err in admitting the testimony of Victim's mother concerning\r\n  Victim's statements to her mother regarding the sexual assault?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the\r\n  appellate court sits to review\r\n  errors of law only. We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless\r\n  they are clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the\r\n  trial judge's ruling is supported by any evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 6, 545\r\n  S.E.2d at 829.Â  &quot;The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Saltz,&nbsp;346\r\n  S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244&nbsp;(2001).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Investigator\r\n  Bracken's Testimony\r\nAppellant argues the trial\r\n  court erred in admitting the out-of-court statement of Victim to Bracken under\r\n  section 17-23-175 because it violated the ex post facto laws, violated\r\n  the rule against hearsay, and was prejudicial to Appellant.Â  Â Â We find that\r\n  Appellant's hearsay and prejudice arguments are not preserved for review.Â  We\r\n  also find that section 17-23-175 does not violate the ex post facto laws. \r\nA. Issue\r\n  Preservation\r\nAn objection must be made on\r\n  a specific ground.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120, 481 S.E.2d 118,\r\n  123 (1997).Â  For an issue to be properly preserved it has to be raised to and\r\n  ruled on by the trial court.Â  State v. Wise,&nbsp;359 S.C. 14, 21, 596\r\n  S.E.2d 475, 478&nbsp;(2004).Â  A party need not use the exact name of a legal\r\n  doctrine in order for the issue to be preserved, but it must be clear the\r\n  argument has been presented on that ground.Â  State v. Russell, 345 S.C.\r\n  128, 132, 546 S.E.2d 202, 204&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nAt trial, defense counsel\r\n  argued Victim's statement to Bracken was inadmissible because application of\r\n  section 17-23-175 violated the ex post facto laws and his right to\r\n  confrontation.Â  However, defense counsel did not contend Victim's statement\r\n  constituted impermissible hearsay, that it was unduly prejudicial because it\r\n  was inconsistent with Victim's trial testimony, or that the State failed to\r\n  comply with section 17-23-175.Â  Hence, the only issue preserved on appeal is\r\n  whether section 17-23-175 violated the ex post facto laws.[2]Â Â  \r\n\r\nB. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-175\r\n&quot;[T]he reason the Ex\r\n  Post Facto Clauses were included in the Constitution was to assure that\r\n  federal and state legislatures were restrained from enacting arbitrary or\r\n  vindictive legislation.&quot;Â  Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 429\r\n  (1987).Â  An ex post facto law &quot;imposes a punishment for an act\r\n  which was not punishable at the time it was committed; or imposes additional\r\n  punishment to that then prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by which\r\n  less or different testimony is sufficient to convict than was then\r\n  required.&quot;Â  Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277, 278 (1866).Â  &quot;[I]n\r\n  order for a law to fall within the ex post facto prohibition, two\r\n  critical elements must be present: (1) the law must be retrospective so as to\r\n  apply to events occurring before its enactment, and (2) the law must disadvantage\r\n  the offender affected by it.&quot;Â  State v. Huiett, 302 S.C. 169, 171,\r\n  394 S.E.2d 486, 487&nbsp;(1990) (citation omitted).\r\nThe United States Supreme\r\n  Court has set forth four general categories of law that are violative of the\r\n  United States Constitution's ex post facto clause:\r\n\r\n  1st.\r\n    Every law that makes an action, done before the passing of the law, and which\r\n    was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. Â 2nd. Every law\r\n    that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. Â 3rd.\r\n    Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than\r\n    the law annexed to the crime, when committed. Â 4th. Every law that alters the\r\n    legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the\r\n    law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict\r\n    the offender.\r\n\r\nCalder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390 (1798).\r\n&quot;[I]n order for the ex\r\n  post facto clause to be applicable, the statute or the provision in\r\n  question must be criminal or penal in purpose and nature.&quot;Â  Huiett,\r\n  302 S.C. at 172, 394 S.E.2d at 487.Â  A change in the law does not violate the ex\r\n    post facto clause if it merely affects a mode of procedure and does not\r\n  alter substantial personal rights.Â  Id. at 171, 394 S.E.2d at 487\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Even though a procedural change\r\n  may have a detrimental impact on a defendant, a mere procedural change which\r\n  does not affect substantial rights is not ex post facto.&quot;Â  Id. at 171-72, 394 S.E.2d at 487. \r\nThe United States Supreme\r\n  Court has held changes in laws that made previously inadmissible evidence\r\n  admissible did not violate the ex post facto clause.Â  See Thompson\r\n    v. Missouri, 171 U.S. 380 (1898) (holding a law admitting previously\r\n  inadmissible handwriting samples did not violate ex post facto clause); Hopt\r\n    v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574 (1884) (holding admission of convicted felon's\r\n  testimony, which was inadmissible at the time the crime was committed, did not\r\n  violate ex post facto clause).Â  Furthermore, other jurisdictions that\r\n  have considered the admission of hearsay statements of child victims have\r\n  reached the same conclusion.Â  See State v. Stevens, 757 S.W.2d\r\n  229, 232 (Mo. Ct. App. 1988) (&quot;[A] change in a statute after the alleged\r\n  crime which allowed the hearsay statements of a child victim of sexual abuse to\r\n  be admitted against an accused at trial when previously such a statement was\r\n  inadmissible was not a prohibited ex post facto law because it simply\r\n  authorized the introduction of additional evidence of guilt.&quot;); accord Cogburn v. State, 732 S.W.2d 807 (Ark. 1987); People v. Koon, 724\r\n  P.2d 1367 (Colo. Ct. App. 1986). \r\nSection 17-23-175 allows an\r\n  out-of-court statement of a child under twelve to be admissible under certain\r\n  circumstances.[3]Â \r\n  In interpreting section 17-23-175, the court of appeals concluded the section\r\n  was not penal in nature but rather &quot;deals with procedural, evidentiary\r\n  matters.&quot;Â  State v. Bryant, 382 S.C. 505, 512, 675 S.E.2d 816,\r\n  820&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  Furthermore, section 17-23-175 does not fall into\r\n  one of the four categories set forth in Calder.Â  See id.Â \r\n  The amount or type of evidence required at the time of the commission of the\r\n  offense in order to convict the offender is not altered by section 17-23-175.Â  Because\r\n  section 17-23-175 merely authorizes the introduction of new evidence and does\r\n  not alter substantial personal rights, it does not violate the ex post facto laws.Â  Therefore, the trial court committed no error in allowing Brackenâ€™s\r\n  testimony pursuant to section 17-23-175.Â  \r\nII. Appellant's Admission to the GAL\r\nAppellant argues the trial\r\n  court erred in allowing the admission of Appellantâ€™s statement to the GAL\r\n  because it violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  counsel &quot;attaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial\r\n  proceedings against the defendant.&quot;Â  U.S. v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180,\r\n  187 (1984).Â  &quot;[A] criminal defendant's initial appearance before a\r\n  judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is\r\n  subject to restriction, marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that\r\n  trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.&quot;Â  Rothgery\r\n    v. Gillespie County, Tex.,&nbsp;__ U.S. __, 128 S. Ct. 2578, 2592, 171 L.\r\n  Ed. 2d 366, 383&nbsp;(2008).Â  In Massiah v. U.S., 377 U.S. 201,\r\n  206&nbsp;(1964) the United States Supreme Court held &quot;that the petitioner\r\n  was denied the basic protections of that guarantee when there was used against\r\n  him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents\r\n  had deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the\r\n  absence of his counsel.&quot;Â  That language has given rise to a two-part test\r\n  to determine whether a violation of the Sixth Amendment has occurred: &quot;[t]o find a Sixth Amendment violation, the statements in question must have been (1) deliberately elicited (2) by a government agent.&quot;Â  U.S. v.\r\n    Li,&nbsp;55 F.3d 325, 328&nbsp;(7th Cir. 1995); see alsoCreel v. Johnson, 162 F.3d 385, 393&nbsp;(5th Cir. 1998); Depree v. Thomas, 946 F.2d 784, 793 (11th Cir. 1991).Â  \r\n&quot;There is, by necessity,\r\n  no bright-line rule for determining whether an individual is a\r\n  government agent for purposes of the sixth amendment right to counsel.&quot;Â  Dupree,\r\n  946 F.2d at 793-94.&nbsp; Â Whether someone is a government agent for purposes\r\n  of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence depends on the facts and circumstances of each\r\n  case.Â  Id. at 794 (citation omitted).Â  However, &quot;[a]t a minimum . .\r\n  . there must be some evidence that an agreement, express or implied, between\r\n  the individual and a government official existed at the time the elicitation\r\n  takes place.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  Regarding the â€œdeliberate\r\n  elicitationâ€ prong, the Supreme Court has explained that &quot;the defendant\r\n  must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond\r\n  merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating\r\n  remarks.&quot;Â  Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 459&nbsp;(1986).\r\nIn the present case,\r\n  Appellant contends the GAL was a state actor because she was appointed by the\r\n  court.Â  However, the record clearly indicates the GAL was not acting as a\r\n  government agent for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  There\r\n  was no express or implied agreement between the GAL and a government official\r\n  involved in the prosecution of Appellant's case.Â  The GAL was meeting with\r\n  Appellant to see that Victim received the social services she needed.Â  In State\r\n    v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 284, 478 S.E.2d 871, 876&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996),\r\n  the court of appeals found that a case manager for the Department of Social Services\r\n  (DSS) was not acting as an agent of law enforcement and, therefore, the\r\n  requirements of Miranda did not apply.Â  Similarly, the GAL in this case\r\n  was an employee of DSS appointed by the family court and in no way a government\r\n  agent for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\r\nAdditionally, the GAL did not\r\n  deliberately elicit Appellant's incriminating remarks.Â  When the GAL met with\r\n  Appellant, she told him that she did not want to discuss the details of the\r\n  sexual assault.Â  However, Appellant voluntarily made incriminating statements\r\n  to the GAL during the interview.Â  In no way did the GAL take any action designed\r\n  to deliberately elicit incriminating statements.Â  Hence, the statements made to\r\n  the GAL were not deliberately elicited and the GAL was not a government agent\r\n  for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in\r\n  allowing Appellant's admission to the GAL.Â  Â Â \r\nVictim's Statement to her Mother\r\nAppellant argues the trial\r\n  court erred in admitting the testimony of Victim's mother concerning the\r\n  statements of Victim to her about the sexual assault because they violated the\r\n  rule against hearsay and Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE as the statements went beyond\r\n  the time and place of the assault.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA. Issue\r\n  Preservation\r\nAt trial, defense counsel\r\n  objected to the introduction of Victim's statement as hearsay in general.Â  The\r\n  trial judge overruled the objection.Â  Defense counsel never argued that Victim's\r\n  statement went beyond the time and place of the assault as provided in Rule\r\n  801(d)(1)(D).Â  Because this issue was not raised below, it is not preserved for\r\n  appellate review.\r\n\r\nB. Hearsay\r\n&quot;'Hearsay' is a\r\n  statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial\r\n  or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.&quot;Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  &quot;Hearsay is not admissible except as\r\n  provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of\r\n  this State or by statute.&quot;Â  Rule 802, SCRE.Â  An excited utterance is a\r\n  &quot;statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant\r\n  was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 803(2), SCRE.Â  &quot;A statement that is admissible because it falls\r\n  within an exception in Rule 803, SCRE, such as the excited utterance exception,\r\n  may be used substantively, that is, to prove the truth of the matter asserted.&quot;Â  State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 20, 558 S.E.2d 518, 520-21&nbsp;(2002)\r\n  (citation omitted). \r\nThree elements must be met\r\n  for a statement to be an excited utterance: (1) the statement must relate to a\r\n  startling event or condition; (2) the statement must have been made while the\r\n  declarant was under the stress of excitement; and (3) the stress of excitement\r\n  must be caused by the startling event or condition.Â  Id. at 21, 558\r\n  S.E.2d at 521.Â  A court must consider the totality of the circumstances in\r\n  determining whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception.Â  State\r\n    v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 94, 544 S.E.2d 30, 34&nbsp;(2001).Â  The passage of\r\n  time between the startling event and the statement is one factor to consider,\r\n  but it is not the dispositive factor.Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 21, 558 S.E.2d\r\n  at 521.Â  &quot;Other factors useful in determining whether a statement\r\n  qualifies as an excited utterance include the declarant's demeanor, the\r\n  declarant's age, and the severity of the startling event.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Victim's\r\n  statement to her mother related to the startling event of being sexually\r\n  assaulted by Appellant immediately before her mother returned home.Â  Victim was\r\n  lying in a fetal position when her mother came to check on her minutes after\r\n  arriving home.Â  Victim was upset and crying when she told her mother about the\r\n  abuse; thus, Victim made the statement while under the stress of excitement.Â \r\n  Finally, this stress was obviously caused by the sexual assault.Â  The\r\n  requirements of Rule 803(2), SCRE were satisfied in this case.Â  Victim's\r\n  statement to her mother was an excited utterance and the trial judge did not\r\n  err in allowing Mother's testimony.[4]Â  See also State v. Ladner, 373 S.C. 103, 644 S.E.2d 684\r\n  (2007) (holding a trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting a\r\n  hearsay statement under the excited utterance exception when the statement was\r\n  made by a two-and-a-half year old girl to her caretakers after they discovered\r\n  blood coming from her vaginal area and the statement related to the startling\r\n  event of a sexual assault).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned\r\n  reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\r\nWALLER, BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The following evidence was also admitted at trial: (a) Deputy Dustin Woodall\r\n  testified Victim's mother told him Appellant sexually assaulted Victim in their\r\n  home; (b) Deputy Matthew Owens testified Appellant was read his warrant at the\r\n  detention center and Appellant admitted that he did what the warrant stated he\r\n  did; (c) the crotch of Victimâ€™s panties tested positive for saliva; (d) a\r\n  signed statement of Appellant admitting he performed the acts on Victim was\r\n  admitted for impeachment evidence; and (e) a letter from Appellant to Victim's\r\n  mother apologizing and asking for forgiveness.Â  \r\n[2] While defense counsel argued below the application of section 17-23-175\r\n  violated his right to confrontation, Appellant failed to raise that issue on\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\n[3] The pertinent part of section 17-23-175 provides:\r\n\r\n  (F) Out-of-court statements made by\r\n    a child in response to questioning during an investigative interview that is\r\n    visually and auditorily recorded will always be given preference. Â If, however,\r\n    an electronically unrecorded statement is made to a professional in his\r\n    professional capacity by a child victim or witness regarding an act of sexual\r\n    assault or physical abuse, the court may consider the statement in a hearing\r\n    outside the presence of the jury to determine:\r\n  \r\n    (1) the necessary visual and audio recording equipment\r\n      was unavailable; \r\n      (2) the circumstances surrounding the making of the\r\n      statement; \r\n      (3) the relationship\r\n      of the professional and the child; and \r\n      (4) if the statement possesses particularized\r\n      guarantees of trustworthiness. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  considering these factors and additional factors the court deems important, the\r\n  court will make a determination as to whether the statement is admissible\r\n  pursuant to the provisions of this section.\r\n[4] Even if the statement was not an excited utterance, the admission of this evidence\r\n  at trial was harmless considering the evidence noted in footnote 1.Â  See State v.

Jacobsen, of West Columbia, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This is an attorney disciplinary matter involving multiple allegations of\r\n  misconduct arising out of Karl P. Jacobsen's (Respondent's) operation of his bankruptcy\r\n  practice.Â  After a full investigation, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC)\r\n  filed formal charges against Respondent with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the\r\n  Commission).Â  Respondent did not file an Answer and, as a result, was found to\r\n  be in default.Â  After a hearing,[1] a Hearing Panel of the Commission (the Panel) recommended that Respondent be\r\n  disbarred and ordered to pay costs in the amount of $552.37.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  Panel recommended that Respondent be ordered to reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for\r\n  Client Protection for any amount paid to clients as a result of Respondent's misconduct.Â \r\n  Respondent did not file a brief with this Court.Â  We agree with the Panel's\r\n  recommended sanction.Â  Accordingly, we disbar Respondent effective the date of\r\n  this opinion.[2]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent was licensed to\r\n  practice law in South Carolina on November 16, 1998.Â  Respondent was a member\r\n  of a statewide bankruptcy firm (the Firm).Â  Respondent and another member of\r\n  the Firm worked in the Columbia office while the other member of the Firm operated\r\n  the Greenville office.Â  Respondent's practice was so extensive that it was\r\n  estimated that he filed between 700 and 800 bankruptcy cases per year. \r\nIn the fall of 2003, one of\r\n  the Firm's members reported to the Bankruptcy Court and to the Commission that\r\n  Respondent had committed numerous ethical and rule violations.[3]Â \r\n  As a result of Respondent's errors, numerous client matters were dismissed by\r\n  the Bankruptcy Court.Â  In turn, the Office of the United States Trustee filed\r\n  an action against Respondent in October 2003, seeking for Respondent to be indefinitely\r\n  suspended from practicing before the Bankruptcy Court.Â  By consent order dated\r\n  November 7, 2003, the United States Trustee's complaint was resolved and\r\n  Respondent was required to:Â  (1) withdraw from practicing before the Bankruptcy\r\n  Court for a period of one year; (2) consult with Lawyers Helping Lawyers and\r\n  cooperate with any recommendations thereof for medical or other treatment; (3)\r\n  complete 8.0 hours of approved legal ethics training and 25.0 hours of approved\r\n  bankruptcy training; and (4) complete an office review by the Practice\r\n  Management Assistance Program of the South Carolina Bar.Â  In addition,\r\n  Respondent was prohibited from resuming practice before the Bankruptcy Court,\r\n  even after one year from the date of the order, unless Respondent provided the\r\n  United States Trustee with an affidavit summarizing his compliance with the terms\r\n  of the consent order.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to comply\r\n  with the provisions of the consent order and, in fact, continued to accept new\r\n  bankruptcy clients. \r\nIn October 2003, one of\r\n  Respondent's partners terminated her relationship with the Firm.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Respondent hired an associate attorney to handle the Firm's Columbia bankruptcy\r\n  practice. Â Â Â Between December 2003 and February 2004, Respondent continued to\r\n  accept bankruptcy clients with the intention that the new associate would file\r\n  these clients' petitions.Â  Apparently unable to manage the Firm's caseload, this\r\n  associate submitted her resignation on February 27, 2004, which became\r\n  effective on March 5, 2004.Â  \r\nIn March 2004, with over 2000\r\n  cases pending before the Columbia Division of the Bankruptcy Court, Respondent\r\n  informed the Firm's employees that the office would be closing.Â  Respondent\r\n  took no further action to close his practice or notify his clients.Â  \r\nDue to the numerous\r\n  grievances filed against Respondent and concerns over the management of his\r\n  trust account, this Court placed Respondent on interim suspension on March 18,\r\n  2004. Â Â On February 4, 2005, the Commission on CLE suspended Respondent for\r\n  failure to comply.Â  In turn, this Court suspended Respondent on April 12, 2005.[4]Â  \r\nSubsequently, the ODC went\r\n  forward with formal charges on the grievance matters.[5]Â \r\n  With respect to each of these matters, Respondent failed to file the requisite\r\n  bankruptcy documents, failed to communicate with his clients regarding the\r\n  status of their cases, and failed to inform his clients of his decision to\r\n  discontinue his bankruptcy practice.Â  Respondent also failed to refund the fees\r\n  paid by these clients and did not take reasonable steps to protect his clients'\r\n  interests. Â Respondent did not respond to the notice of full investigation on any\r\n  of these matters.Â  \r\nIn addition to the\r\n  above-listed client matters, an investigation also revealed that in 2003 the\r\n  Firm's trust account was &quot;out of balance.&quot;Â Â Â  Specifically, there was\r\n  evidence that a $15,000 shortfall existed in July 2003 and that client funds\r\n  had been commingled with the Firm's operating account funds.Â  According to the\r\n  investigation, the Firm had failed to maintain journals, ledgers, checkbook\r\n  registers, reconciliations, and other required records prior to July 2003.\r\nBased on its investigation,\r\n  the ODC filed formal charges against Respondent on April 14, 2009 with the\r\n  Commission.Â  By certified mail, the ODC sent notification of these charges to a\r\n  West Columbia address on file with the South Carolina Bar as well as Respondent's\r\n  last known address in Atlanta and a San Francisco address that was obtained by\r\n  an ODC investigator.[6]Â \r\n  Because Respondent failed to respond or file an Answer to the formal charges, the\r\n  Commission found Respondent in default and the charges were deemed admitted by\r\n  order dated July 16, 2009.Â  Â Â \r\nOn August 27, 2009, the Panel\r\n  conducted a hearing for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction to\r\n  recommend to this Court.Â  Respondent did not appear for this hearing.\r\nIn prefacing her case,\r\n  disciplinary counsel outlined her office's failed attempts to contact\r\n  Respondent via certified mail and electronic mail.Â  In support of her claim,\r\n  counsel offered into evidence four exhibits that documented this\r\n  correspondence.Â  Counsel testified her office had not heard from Respondent\r\n  since an e-mail exchange in February 2006.Â  \r\nAfter summarizing the formal\r\n  charges, counsel called Olean Murray, one of Respondent's former bankruptcy\r\n  clients to testify regarding the basis of her grievance against Respondent. Â Murray\r\n  testified that she paid Respondent to file a bankruptcy petition on her\r\n  behalf.Â  Under the impression that the petition had been filed, Murray went to\r\n  the Bankruptcy Court to resolve the matter, but instead discovered that the\r\n  petition had not been filed.Â  On a second occasion, Respondent failed to appear\r\n  at a hearing in the Bankruptcy Court on behalf of Murray.Â  Concerned about her\r\n  case, Murray repeatedly attempted to contact Respondent.Â  According to Murray,\r\n  Respondent could never be reached at his office.Â  Ultimately, Murray discovered\r\n  that Respondent was no longer handling bankruptcy cases.Â  Although her case was\r\n  &quot;discharged&quot; after several years of bankruptcy proceedings, Murray\r\n  stated that her credit had been &quot;ruined.&quot;Â  She further testified that\r\n  as a result of her bankruptcy and resultant credit problems, she had to\r\n  refinance her $20,000 home for $60,000.Â  \r\nCounsel then relayed to the\r\n  Panel the following aggravating circumstances:Â  (1) Respondent's demonstrated pattern\r\n  of misconduct; (2) Respondent's failure to respond to the formal charges and\r\n  disciplinary proceedings; and (3) Respondent's prior disciplinary history,\r\n  which included a letter of caution issued on June 21, 2002 regarding his\r\n  failure to supervise associates and non-lawyer employees in the Firm.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of her\r\n  case, counsel requested that the Panel issue a report in which it recommended\r\n  that Respondent be disbarred and ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings\r\n  and restitution to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection. \r\nThe Panel issued a report on\r\n  August 27, 2009 that was filed with the Commission on the same day. Â As a\r\n  threshold matter, the Panel clarified that Respondent had been found in default\r\n  and had failed to appear for the hearing despite attempts by the ODC and the Commission\r\n  to contact him.Â  Specifically, the Panel noted that the ODC had complied with\r\n  Rule 14(c) of the South Carolina Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement\r\n  (RLDE)[7] in that it had sent by certified mail a copy of the formal charges to\r\n  Respondent's last known address in Atlanta and to an alternate address in San\r\n  Francisco.Â  Additionally, the Panel concluded Respondent was provided\r\n  sufficient notice of the Panel hearing given the Commission served Respondent\r\n  with notice of the hearing by certified mail to the Atlanta and San Francisco\r\n  addresses.\r\nHaving found Respondent in\r\n  default, the Panel reiterated that the Formal Charges were deemed admitted.[8]Â \r\n  Based on the admitted allegations of misconduct, the Panel concluded that\r\n  Respondent violated the following South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct\r\n  (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule 1.2 (scope of\r\n  representation); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.4 (communication); Rule 1.5\r\n  (fees); Rule 1.15 (safekeeping of property); Rule 1.16 (terminating\r\n  representation); Rule 3.2 (expediting litigation); Rule 5.1 (responsibilities\r\n  of partners); Rule 5.3 (responsibilities regarding non-lawyer assistants); Rule\r\n  5.5 (unauthorized practice of law); and Rule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â  Based on this misconduct, the Panel found\r\n  Respondent was subject to discipline pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1), (5), and (6) of\r\n  the RLDE.[9]\r\nAdditionally, the Panel found\r\n  Respondent &quot;exacerbated his misconduct by failing to respond to\r\n  disciplinary inquiries.&quot;Â  In reaching this conclusion, the Panel pointed\r\n  to Respondent's failure to communicate with the ODC regarding the\r\n  investigation, noting his last communication was on February 21, 2006.Â  Due to\r\n  Respondent's lack of cooperation, the Panel determined Respondent had violated\r\n  Rule 8.1 of the RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, and, thus, subject to discipline for this\r\n  misconduct pursuant to Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE.[10]\r\nThe Panel found the following\r\n  aggravating circumstances:Â  (1) Respondent demonstrated a significant pattern\r\n  of misconduct; (2) Respondent failed to fully cooperate in the disciplinary\r\n  investigations; (3) Respondent's prior disciplinary history includes a letter\r\n  of caution with a finding of minor misconduct; and (4) Respondent did not\r\n  answer the Formal Charges or appear at the hearing.\r\nIn view of these findings,\r\n  the Panel recommended Respondent be disbarred &quot;given Respondent's failure\r\n  to answer the formal charges and appear at the hearing, coupled with his\r\n  multiple instances of client neglect, repeated sanctions imposed upon him by\r\n  the Bankruptcy Court, his trust account mismanagement, and his failure to\r\n  respond to Disciplinary Counsel.&quot;Â  Additionally, the Panel recommended\r\n  that Respondent be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings and to reimburse\r\n  the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any amount paid to clients as a\r\n  result of his misconduct.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBecause Respondent has been\r\n  found in default and, thus, is deemed to have admitted to all of the factual allegations,\r\n  the sole question before the Court is whether to accept the Panel's recommended\r\n  sanction.Â  See In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190, 652 S.E.2d 395 (2007)\r\n  (recognizing that the Court need only determine the appropriate disciplinary\r\n  sanction where attorney was found in default and, thus, deemed to have admitted\r\n  all factual allegations of the formal charges).\r\n&quot;This\r\n  Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the\r\n  appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.&quot;Â  In re\r\n    Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  &quot;Although this\r\n  Court is not bound by the findings of the Panel and Committee, these findings\r\n  are entitled to great weight.&quot;Â  In re Marshall, 331 S.C. 514, 519,\r\n  498 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998).Â Â  &quot;However, this Court may make its own\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, a\r\n  disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  In\r\n    re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see Rule 8,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall be\r\n  established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).\r\nWe find the Panel's\r\n  recommended sanction of disbarment is warranted.Â  By his default, Respondent\r\n  has admitted to committing multiple acts of serious misconduct.Â  Respondent's\r\n  conduct also indicates an obvious disinterest and indifference to the practice\r\n  of law given he has left this jurisdiction and has not responded to this\r\n  disciplinary action.Â  Furthermore, Respondent has an extensive disciplinary\r\n  history involving:Â  a suspension from practicing in the Bankruptcy Court, a\r\n  letter of caution from the Commission, a suspension by the Commission on CLE\r\n  for failure to comply, and a suspension from this Court for failure to comply\r\n  with CLE.Â Â  \r\nIn cases involving similar\r\n  instances of attorney misconduct, this Court has found disbarment to be the\r\n  appropriate sanction.Â  See In re Okpalaeke, 374 S.C. 186, 194, 648\r\n  S.E.2d 593, 597-98 (2007) (holding disbarment was appropriate sanction where\r\n  evidence established that attorney had committed &quot;several different acts\r\n  of serious misconduct,&quot; had left &quot;this jurisdiction with the\r\n  knowledge that disciplinary action against him was imminent,&quot; and had\r\n  failed to answer formal charges or appear at hearings before the Panel or this\r\n  Court); In re Tullis, 375 S.C. at 193, 652 S.E.2d at 395 (concluding\r\n  disbarment was warranted where attorney:Â  failed to adequately communicate with\r\n  his clients; failed to act with diligence and competence; misused and\r\n  mismanaged trust account funds; failed to respond to Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  inquiries and notices of full investigation regarding these matters; and had an\r\n  &quot;extensive disciplinary history&quot;); In re Murph, 350 S.C. 1, 4,\r\n  564 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002) (holding disbarment was warranted where attorney:Â \r\n  failed to answer the formal charges and appear at the hearing before the\r\n  sub-panel; admitted that he committed criminal acts; failed to respond to\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel; practiced law on two occasions while on suspension;\r\n  failed to earn or return over $7,000 in fees; and failed to represent clients\r\n  competently and diligently in several cases; stating &quot;[a]n attorney's\r\n  failure to answer charges or appear to defend or explain alleged misconduct\r\n  indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice of law.Â  Such an attorney is likely\r\n  to face the most severe sanctions because a central purpose of the disciplinary\r\n  process is to protect the public from unscrupulous or indifferent\r\n  lawyers.&quot;); In re Hall, 341 S.C. 98, 533 S.E.2d 588 (2000)\r\n  (concluding disbarment was warranted where evidence established that attorney\r\n  neglected legal matters, practiced law while under suspension, and failed to\r\n  respond to disciplinary authority); In re Wofford, 330 S.C. 522, 500\r\n  S.E.2d 486 (1998) (finding disbarment was justified where attorney:Â  failed to\r\n  answer formal charges or appear at Panel Hearing or hearing before this Court;\r\n  failed to provide competent representation, to keep clients reasonably\r\n  informed, and to promptly deliver funds to third person; and attorney\r\n  misappropriated client funds and committed criminal acts); In re Meeder,\r\n  327 S.C. 169, 488 S.E.2d 875 (1997) (determining disbarment was justified where\r\n  attorney, who responded initially, failed to answer formal charges or ask for\r\n  panel hearing and continued to represent client after he was suspended for\r\n  multiple counts of misconduct); In re Edwards, 323 S.C. 3, 448 S.E.2d\r\n  547 (1994) (holding disbarment was appropriate sanction where attorney failed\r\n  to keep clients informed, misappropriated or improperly used client funds,\r\n  knowingly presented false testimony, and failed to cooperate in the\r\n  investigation of disciplinary charges against him); In re Sifly, 279\r\n  S.C. 113, 302 S.E.2d 858 (1983) (concluding disbarment was appropriate sanction\r\n  where attorney failed to appear before the disciplinary panel or the Court and\r\n  attorney mishandled two cases and wrote &quot;bad&quot; checks).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we disbar Respondent effective\r\n  the date of this opinion.Â  We further order Respondent to pay the costs of these\r\n  disciplinary proceedings in the amount of $552.37 and to reimburse the Lawyers'\r\n  Fund for Client Protection for any amount paid to clients as a result of\r\n  Respondent's misconduct.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and shall surrender his\r\n  Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent did not appear at the hearing.\r\n[2] Respondent did not appear at the argument before\r\n  this Court despite efforts to contact him via certified mail at the West\r\n  Columbia address on file with the South Carolina Bar as well as an Atlanta\r\n  address and a San Francisco address.\r\n[3] Specifically, it was alleged that Respondent:Â \r\n  failed to devote sufficient time and attention to client matters; failed to\r\n  file complete and accurate bankruptcy schedules and statements of debtors'\r\n  affairs with the Bankruptcy Court; allowed non-lawyer assistants to execute\r\n  legal documents on behalf of clients and Respondent without the supervision of\r\n  a lawyer; allowed non-lawyer assistants to negotiate with adverse parties on\r\n  behalf of clients without the supervision of a lawyer; failed to meet deadlines\r\n  imposed by the Bankruptcy Court and the bankruptcy trustees for the provision of\r\n  information to the court; failed to file or to advise clients regarding the\r\n  filing of motions to reconsider when such motions would be appropriate; failed\r\n  to timely correct mistakes in documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court; failed\r\n  to present meritorious claims of clients to the Bankruptcy Court or to timely\r\n  object to relief sought against debtor clients by creditors; refused to\r\n  communicate with clients; negotiated with creditors and settled matters on\r\n  behalf of debtor clients without appropriate client authority and without\r\n  informing clients of such action; failed to adequately advise clients regarding\r\n  the ramifications of certain decisions in their bankruptcy matters; refused to\r\n  communicate with the Bankruptcy Court and the bankruptcy trustees; and allowed\r\n  bankruptcy cases to be dismissed in order to avoid confronting the Bankruptcy\r\n  Court to resolve Respondent's own mistakes through appropriate motions.\r\n[4] During the pendency of these complaints, Respondent\r\n  was represented by counsel.Â  Subsequently, counsel withdrew and was relieved from\r\n  representation.Â  \r\n[5] These eight complaints involved the following:Â  (1) the\r\n  Murray Matter, in which Respondent's failure to file the required\r\n  bankruptcy documents resulted in the dismissal of Murray's case; (2) the Cagle\r\n    Matter, in which Respondent's failure to file adequate documentation and\r\n  appear on Cagle's behalf at a hearing resulted in the dismissal of her case;\r\n  (3) the Kinard Matter, in which Respondent failed to file a bankruptcy\r\n  petition on behalf of the Kinards despite the Firm's representation that the\r\n  petition had been filed and a hearing was scheduled; (4) the Price Matter,\r\n  in which Respondent failed to file a bankruptcy petition for Price; (5) the\r\n    Moseley Matter, in which Respondent failed to file a bankruptcy petition\r\n  despite the Firm's representation that a petition had been filed and that a\r\n  hearing would be scheduled;

Austin (Austin) filed suit against Stokes-Craven\r\n  Holding Corporation d/b/a Stokes-Craven Ford (Stokes-Craven), an automobile\r\n  dealership, after he experienced problems with his used vehicle and discovered\r\n  the vehicle had sustained extensive damage prior to the sale.Â  A jury found in favor\r\n  of Austin and awarded him $26,371.10 in actual damages and $216,600 in punitive\r\n  damages.\r\nStokes-Craven challenges the\r\n  verdict alleging the trial judge committed several errors which warrant a new\r\n  trial. Â In his appeal, Austin contends the trial judge erred in requiring him\r\n  to elect between his verdict for common law fraud and the violation of the\r\n  South Carolina Dealer's Act.[1]Â \r\n  Additionally, Austin claims the trial judge erred in declining to award him\r\n  prejudgment interest.Â  This Court certified this case from the Court of Appeals\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand\r\n  for entry of judgment consistent with our decision.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn December 1, 1999, Gary\r\n  Bailey purchased for $32,000 a 2000 Ford F-250 Super Duty Lariat 4X4, extended\r\n  cab, eight-cylinder, turbo-diesel truck from Stokes-Craven, a Manning\r\n  automobile dealership. Because Bailey maintained a business relationship with\r\n  Kenny Craven (Kenny), the brother and employee of one of the owners of\r\n  Stokes-Craven, Bailey dealt solely with him. \r\nAfter the purchase, Bailey\r\n  and his son, Kerry, used the truck primarily for their construction business. Â On\r\n  the night of September 28, 2001, Kerry was involved in a single-vehicle\r\n  accident during which &quot;something broke in the front end, the truck flipped\r\n  over, spun around the road, and slammed into a guardrail.&quot; Â As a result of\r\n  this accident, the truck, which had logged approximately 30,000 miles,\r\n  underwent repairs from October 1, 2001 to March 27, 2002.Â  According to Bailey,\r\n  his insurance company paid William Norton, an owner of the Norton and\r\n  Richardson Body Shop, $20,309.38 to repair the vehicle. \r\nAfter the repairs were\r\n  completed, Bailey continued to drive the truck until he noticed an oil leak in\r\n  the front axle. Â Because he needed a dependable truck for his business\r\n  operation, Bailey made the decision to trade in the truck and purchase a new\r\n  one from Stokes-Craven. Â In April 2002, Bailey contacted Kenny Craven and asked\r\n  him to locate another truck. Â During this conversation, Bailey informed Kenny\r\n  that his original truck had been &quot;wrecked&quot; and repaired by Norton and\r\n  Richardson's Body Shop, a body shop for which Kenny knew had a good reputation.Â \r\n  Bailey also told Kenny of the oil leak in the front axle. \r\nOn April 17, 2002, Bailey\r\n  traded in his old truck for $28,714.50 and purchased a new truck from\r\n  Stokes-Craven.Â  At the time of the trade in, the truck had an odometer reading\r\n  of approximately 57,000 miles. \r\nOn June 1, 2002, Austin and\r\n  his girlfriend went to the Stokes-Craven dealership in search of a truck.Â \r\n  After circling the dealership lot, Austin focused his attention on the truck\r\n  that had been traded in by Bailey.Â  Because this truck appeared to meet Austin's\r\n  desired specifications, he used his training as a mechanic to examine the\r\n  outside and the underside. Â When he emerged from underneath the vehicle, Austin was met by William Frierson, a salesman for Stokes-Craven.Â  Austin then asked\r\n  Frierson a series of questions about the vehicle including the truck's warranty,\r\n  whether the truck had been &quot;wrecked,&quot; and information regarding the\r\n  prior owner.Â  According to Austin, Frierson informed him the warranty was a &quot;5-year,\r\n  100,000 miles powertrain warranty.&quot;Â  Austin also claimed Frierson denied\r\n  that the truck had been &quot;wrecked.&quot;Â  In terms of the prior owner,\r\n  Frierson indicated it was someone who operated a construction company in\r\n  Summerville.Â  When Austin inquired whether this previous owner was Bud Knight,\r\n  someone whom Austin knew had the reputation of taking &quot;immaculate&quot;\r\n  care of his vehicles, Frierson apparently responded &quot;Yeah, I believe that\r\n  is his truck.&quot; Â Austin was never shown the title to the truck. \r\nUltimately, Austin agreed to\r\n  purchase the truck for $26,371.10.Â  During the process of signing the purchase\r\n  agreement, Austin questioned one of the forms indicating that he was buying the\r\n  truck &quot;as is.&quot;Â  According to Austin, Frierson indicated this was a\r\n  formality and that the truck had a &quot;5-year, 100,000 mile powertrain\r\n  warranty.&quot; Â Austin also claimed the finance manager confirmed the\r\n  existence of the warranty and &quot;talked [him] out of&quot; purchasing an\r\n  extended warranty.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAlthough the truck operated\r\n  without incident initially, Austin discovered an oil leak in August 2002.Â  Upon\r\n  discovering the leak, Austin contacted another Ford dealership located near his\r\n  residence in Moncks Corner to see if the rear-seal leak could be repaired under\r\n  warranty. Â This dealership informed Austin that the repair was not covered by\r\n  the truck's warranty and that he should contact Stokes-Craven regarding the\r\n  repair.\r\nAccording to Austin, he spoke\r\n  with &quot;Jim,&quot; an assistant service manager at Stokes-Craven, who told\r\n  him that the repair was under warranty.Â  When Austin inquired further about the\r\n  warranty, Jim told him that he would check on it and call him with an answer.Â \r\n  Subsequently, Jim informed Austin that the repair was not covered by the\r\n  warranty and advised him to contact Dennis Craven, one of the owners of\r\n  Stokes-Craven. Â \r\nThe next day, Austin called\r\n  Dennis and explained the problem.Â  Because he was unfamiliar with the specifics\r\n  of Austin's purchase, Dennis spoke with his staff and called Austin several\r\n  days later.Â  According to Austin, Dennis told him that his staff denied they\r\n  had represented that the truck was covered under a five-year, 100,000 mile power\r\n  train warranty. Â Dennis, however, offered to fix the leak with the stipulation\r\n  that any additional repairs would have to be paid by Austin.Â  Hearing this\r\n  response, Austin asked to return the truck for the purchase price and rejected\r\n  Dennisâ€™s offer to &quot;trade [him] out of the truck.&quot;Â  Â When Dennis\r\n  denied his request, Austin indicated that he was not satisfied with this offer\r\n  but still intended to have the oil leak fixed by Stokes-Craven.Â  Following this\r\n  conversation, Austin scheduled the repair for September 13, 2002.\r\nPrior to his scheduled appointment,\r\n  Austin discovered a warranty book in the truck which indicated that the truck\r\n  was only covered by a five-year, 100,000 mile warranty limited to the engine.Â  Austin also discovered that the truck had been registered to Gary Bailey and had sustained\r\n  extensive damage prior to his purchase.Â  Austin inadvertently discovered the &quot;wreck&quot;\r\n  damage when he came in contact with William Norton, the owner of the repair\r\n  shop where Bailey had taken the vehicle following his son's accident. Â During\r\n  this discussion, Norton gave Austin the list of repairs made to the truck.\r\nOn September 13, 2002, Austin\r\n  brought his truck to Stokes-Craven for the scheduled repair.Â  After he dropped\r\n  off his truck, Austin met with Dennis Craven and Barry Thornall, a used car\r\n  manager at Stokes-Craven.Â  Austin again requested that he be allowed to return\r\n  the truck for the purchase price given his new discoveries regarding the prior\r\n  ownership, the &quot;wreck&quot; damage, and the lack of a power train warranty.Â \r\n  During the course of the conversation, Austin found out that Thornall, a\r\n  neighbor of Bailey's, most likely was aware of the truckâ€™s history.Â  Several\r\n  minutes later, Dennis produced a &quot;Buyerâ€™s Guide&quot; document purportedly\r\n  containing Austin's signature which stated that the truck was covered by a\r\n  warranty &quot;up to 100,000 on diesel engine.&quot;Â  Austin denied that he had\r\n  signed the document and informed Dennis and Thornall that he had not received\r\n  this document at the time of purchase.\r\nAustin returned to\r\n  Stokes-Craven approximately a week later to retrieve his truck which had been\r\n  repaired. Â Austin then met with Dennis Craven to discuss the situation with his\r\n  truck.Â  During this meeting, Austin again denied he had signed the warranty\r\n  document and requested the return of the purchase price in exchange for the\r\n  truck.Â  In response, Dennis compared the signed document with Austinâ€™s driver's\r\n  license and then denied Austin's request.Â  \r\nOn March 15, 2004, Austin\r\n  filed suit against Stokes-Craven alleging the following causes of action:Â \r\n  revocation of acceptance, breach of contract, negligence, constructive fraud,\r\n  common law fraud, violation of the South Carolina Motor Vehicle Dealer's Act\r\n  (the &quot;Dealer's Act&quot;), violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade\r\n  Practices Act (UTPA), and violation of the Federal Odometer Act.[2]Â \r\n  Based on these claims, Austin sought actual damages, punitive damages,\r\n  prejudgment interest, and attorney's fees and costs.Â  Stokes-Craven answered\r\n  and denied each of Austin's allegations. \r\nAt the conclusion of a\r\n  three-day trial, the jury found in favor of Austin and awarded damages on the\r\n  following causes of action:Â  (1) negligence with an award of $26,371.10 actual\r\n  damages and $144,000 punitive damages; (2) fraud with an award of $26,371.10\r\n  actual damages and $216,600 punitive damages; (3) constructive fraud with an\r\n  award of $26,371.10 actual damages; and (4) a violation of the Dealer's Act\r\n  with an award of $26,371.10 actual damages.Â  The jury also found Stokes-Craven\r\n  had violated the Federal Odometer Act.Â  Additionally, the jury found in favor\r\n  of Stokes-Craven regarding Austin's claim under the UTPA.[3]\r\nSubsequently, both parties\r\n  filed timely post-trial motions.Â  Specifically, Stokes-Craven moved for\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), a new trial, and a new trial nisi\r\n    remittitur.Â  Stokes-Craven filed a detailed memorandum in support of these\r\n  motions.Â  By order dated August 30, 2006, the trial judge denied each of\r\n  Stokes-Craven's motions with the exception of the challenge to the jury's award\r\n  of punitive damages.Â  In a separate order, the trial judge affirmed the award\r\n  of punitive damages finding evidence to support each of the requisite factors\r\n  outlined in Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991). Â \r\nAustin filed post-trial\r\n  motions in which he sought the following relief:Â  (1) an award of damages under\r\n  the Federal Odometer Act given the jury found a violation but was not\r\n  instructed to award damages under this cause of action; (2) an award of attorney's\r\n  fees and costs under the Dealer's Act and the Federal Odometer Act; and (3) an\r\n  award of prejudgment interest.Â  Additionally, Austin challenged the trial judge's\r\n  decision requiring him to elect between the jury's award of damages under his\r\n  claims for fraud, negligence, and the violation of the Dealer's Act. \r\nBy order dated September 14,\r\n  2006, the trial judge granted in part and denied in part Austin's post-trial\r\n  requests.Â  In this order, the trial judge ruled that:Â  (1) Austin was required\r\n  to elect between his remedies; (2) the jury's finding that Stokes-Craven\r\n  violated the Federal Odometer Act entitled Austin to a statutorily-authorized\r\n  award of $1,500 plus attorney's fees and costs limited to those incurred in\r\n  presenting the claim under the Federal Odometer Act; (3) Austin was entitled to\r\n  recover $4,500 in attorney's fees, as opposed to the requested $49,936.50,\r\n  based on the violation of the Federal Odometer Act; (4) Austin was entitled to\r\n  taxable costs in the amount of $602.26; and (5) Austin was not entitled to\r\n  prejudgment interest.\r\nBoth parties appeal from the\r\n  trial judge's orders.Â  Pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, this Court certified\r\n  this case from the Court of Appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, on\r\n  appeal of a case tried by a jury, this Court may only correct errors of law.Â  Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976).Â  The factual findings of the jury will not be disturbed unless no\r\n  evidence reasonably supports the jury's findings.Â  Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Stokes-Craven's Appeal\r\nA.Â  Expert Witnesses\r\nStokes-Craven argues the\r\n  trial judge erred in qualifying John Disher and Ray Morris as expert witnesses.\r\nReversal of a\r\n  trial judge's qualification of an expert witness requires\r\n  the complaining party to prove both an abuse of discretion and prejudice. Â See Jenkins v. E.L. Long Motor Lines, Inc., 233 S.C. 87, 94, 103 S.E.2d 523,\r\n  527 (1958) (recognizing that the trial judge's ruling on the qualification of\r\n  an expert would not be disturbed in the absence of an abuse of discretion); Ellis\r\n    v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 526, 595 S.E.2d 817, 826 (Ct. App. 2004) (demonstrating\r\n  that there must be both error on the part of the trial judge, as well as\r\n  prejudice to the complaining party to warrant reversal). Â An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the decision of the trial judge is unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or controlled by an error of law. Â Ledford v. Pa. Life Ins. Co.,\r\n  267 S.C. 671, 675, 230 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976).Â  In order to demonstrate\r\n  prejudice, there must be a &quot;reasonable probability the jury's verdict was\r\n  influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.&quot; Â Fields v.\r\n    Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).\r\n&quot;All expert\r\n  testimony must satisfy the Rule 702 criteria, and that includes the trial court's\r\n  gatekeeping function in ensuring the proposed expert testimony meets a\r\n  reliability threshold for the jury's ultimate consideration.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    White, 382 S.C. 265, 270, 676 S.E.2d 684, 686 (2009).Â  Rule 702 provides:\r\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will\r\n  assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\r\n  issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\r\n  training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or\r\n  otherwise.\r\nRule 702, SCRE.Â  \r\n&quot;The test\r\n  for qualification of an expert is a relative one that is dependent on the\r\n  particular witness's reference to the subject.&quot; Â Wilson v.\r\n    Rivers, 357 S.C. 447, 452, 593 S.E.2d 603, 605 (2004). Â To be competent to\r\n  testify as an expert, a witness must have acquired by reason of study or\r\n  experience or both such knowledge and skill in a profession or science that he or\r\n  she is better qualified than the\r\n  jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of his or her testimony.Â  Gooding\r\n    v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598\r\n  (1997); see State v. Goode, 305 S.C. 176, 178, 406 S.E.2d 391,\r\n  393 (Ct. App. 1991) (&quot;There is no abuse of discretion as long as the\r\n  witness has acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the\r\n  subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and\r\n  assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope\r\n  of the jury's good judgment and common knowledge.&quot;).Â  \r\nAustin presented Disher, the\r\n  owner and general manager of an auto body shop, as an expert in the field of\r\n  auto body repair.Â  Disher, who had thirty-five years' experience in auto-body\r\n  repair, testified Austin's counsel hired him to inspect Austin's truck. Â After\r\n  his inspection, Disher confirmed that the truck had been in an accident and had\r\n  sustained &quot;extensive mechanical and body repairs&quot; to correct the\r\n  damage.Â  Due to the condition of the vehicle, Disher opined that &quot;in the\r\n  right circumstances that could very definitely be a safety issue.&quot;Â  When\r\n  Disher explained his safety concerns, Stokes-Craven's counsel requested the\r\n  trial judge &quot;clarify&quot; the scope of Disher's qualifications.Â  The\r\n  trial judge asked Austin's counsel to rephrase his question and limited\r\n  Disherâ€™s testimony to any safety issues that resulted from &quot;body collision\r\n  repair&quot; or &quot;body repair.&quot;Â  Disher then testified that the &quot;only\r\n  big issue that I would have would be the frame alignment issue and the wheel\r\n  alignment.&quot;Â  Disher believed that &quot;anybody that had their eyes open\r\n  and was looking . . . could tell that there'd been a massive amount of repairs\r\n  done to the vehicle.&quot; Â Counsel for Stokes-Craven objected to Disher's\r\n  testimony regarding the ease with which someone could have assessed the damage\r\n  on the ground such testimony constituted speculation.Â  The trial judge\r\n  sustained the objection and counsel then began his cross-examination of Disher.\r\nOn appeal, Stokes-Craven\r\n  contends Disher was not qualified to:Â  (1) give an opinion as to any potential\r\n  safety issues that may have been created by the prior accident, and (2) testify\r\n  as to how &quot;anyone&quot; could tell the vehicle had been repaired.Â  Â Â \r\nInitially, we find\r\n  Stokes-Craven failed to preserve any challenge to the admissibility of Disher's\r\n  testimony.Â  First, when Austin moved to qualify Disher as an expert witness in\r\n  the field of auto body repair, counsel for Stokes-Craven did not question\r\n  Disher and made no objection to his qualifications.Â  Secondly, the trial judge\r\n  sustained the objection interposed by counsel during Disher's testimony.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold this argument was not properly preserved for appellate\r\n  review.Â  See Cogdill v. Watson, 289 S.C. 531, 537, 347 S.E.2d\r\n  126, 130 (Ct. App. 1986) (&quot;The\r\n  failure to make an objection at the time evidence is offered constitutes a\r\n  waiver of the right to object.&quot;); see also State v. Sinclair,\r\n  275 S.C. 608, 610, 274 S.E.2d 411, 412 (1981) (recognizing that when a trial judge\r\n  sustains an objection there is no issue for the appellate court to decide given\r\n  the objecting party received the relief he sought).\r\nEven if properly preserved, we\r\n  find Stokes-Craven cannot establish that it was prejudiced by the admission of\r\n  Disher's testimony.Â  First, the testimony was innocuous given it was extremely\r\n  limited in duration and general in nature.Â  Secondly, Stokes-Craven extensively\r\n  cross-examined Disher regarding his qualifications and the fact that only\r\n  someone with significant training or experience in the auto body repair\r\n  industry would have discovered the extent of the repairs to the truck.Â  Through\r\n  cross-examination, Stokes-Craven's counsel also established Disher could not\r\n  say &quot;with a reasonable degree of certainty&quot; that the prior damage\r\n  would create a safety issue. \r\nAs his second expert witness,\r\n  Austin sought to introduce Ray Morris as an expert in the automotive industry\r\n  who would testify to the appraisal and valuation process regarding Austin's\r\n  truck.Â  In terms of his training, Morris testified that he began in the\r\n  automotive industry in 1973 when he was hired at a Honda motorcycle dealership.Â \r\n  After a year, Morris became employed as a salesman at another automotive\r\n  dealership.Â  Subsequently, Morris then worked at Champion Spark Plug Company\r\n  for six years during which time he worked directly with automobile\r\n  dealerships.Â  After Champion's sales dropped, Morris was forced to change jobs.Â \r\n  At that point, Morris became employed with Rick Hendrick Honda where he worked\r\n  as a salesperson as well as a finance and insurance manager. Â After he left\r\n  Rick Hendrick Honda, Morris remained in the automotive industry in different\r\n  capacities, primarily in sales of accessories, within Isuzu motors.Â  For the\r\n  next ten years, Morris worked at his family's business which was not within the\r\n  automotive industry.Â  When Morris and his wife retired to Charleston, Morris\r\n  resumed his automotive interests through employment with the Rick Hendrick\r\n  Jeep/Chrysler dealership. Â Due to health reasons, Morris left this position for\r\n  a year.Â  In 2000, Morris established a consulting business in which he &quot;provid[ed]\r\n  assistance with buying cars and understanding the process.&quot;Â  \r\nFollowing his\r\n  cross-examination, Stokes-Craven's counsel objected to Morris being qualified\r\n  as an expert.Â  Over the objection of counsel, the trial judge found Morris\r\n  qualified to testify regarding the value of Austin's truck. \r\nIn terms of assessing the\r\n  value of Austin's truck, Morris testified that he inspected the truck and\r\n  identified parts on the truck that had evidently been damaged and repaired.Â  He\r\n  characterized the damage as &quot;extensive.&quot;Â  Following his inspection,\r\n  Morris discussed his assessment with Disher.Â  Based on these data points,\r\n  Morris ultimately testified to a reasonable degree of certainty that Austin's\r\n  truck had a &quot;zero retail value&quot; on June 1, 2002, the day that Austin\r\n  purchased the vehicle. Â Morris explained that this value was based on the\r\n  damage that had been done to the vehicle plus potential safety issues that were\r\n  created by this damage.[4]Â  \r\nAfter this testimony, Austin\r\n  sought to question Morris regarding his opinion as to whether a used car\r\n  manager could have easily seen the &quot;wreck&quot; damage.Â  The trial judge\r\n  sustained Stokes-Craven's counsel's objection to this testimony.Â  \r\nWhen questioned on\r\n  cross-examination as to how he determined the retail value of Austin's truck,\r\n  Morris testified that Austin, as the retail buyer, would not have purchased the\r\n  vehicle had he known it had been &quot;wrecked.&quot;Â  Based on this\r\n  assessment, Morris stated that the vehicle &quot;was worth nothing&quot; to\r\n  Austin.Â  Although Morris acknowledged the truck had a salvage value, he\r\n  discounted this value as to Austin given he would not have purchased a damaged\r\n  vehicle. \r\nOn appeal, Stokes-Craven contends\r\n  Morris was not qualified to testify as to the &quot;concept of retail value&quot;\r\n  and his testimony did &quot;nothing&quot; to assist the jury.Â  Thus,\r\n  Stokes-Craven claims the trial judge abused his discretion in qualifying Morris\r\n  and that this error warrants a new trial.\r\nWe find the trial judge did\r\n  not abuse his discretion in qualifying Morris as an expert witness.Â  As his\r\n  direct examination testimony revealed, Morris had extensive experience in several\r\n  sectors of the automotive industry which included the appraisal of vehicles.Â \r\n  Notably, Morris had also been qualified as an expert witness on four or five\r\n  other occasions.Â  Thus, any defects in Morris's experience regarding the\r\n  valuation of automobiles went to the weight and not the admissibility of his\r\n  testimony.Â  See Peterson\r\n    v. Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005) (&quot;Defects in\r\n  an expert witness' education and experience go to the weight, not the\r\n  admissibility, of the expertâ€™s testimony.&quot;). Â \r\nHowever, even if the trial\r\n  judge erred in qualifying Morris as an expert witness, we find Stokes-Craven\r\n  was not prejudiced by the admission of his testimony.Â  As previously stated,\r\n  Stokes-Craven thoroughly cross-examined Morris regarding his lack of experience\r\n  and qualifications.Â  Furthermore, it appears that the testimony that\r\n  Stokes-Craven primarily challenges on appeal was that produced by its own\r\n  cross-examination of Morris.Â  Finally, the testimony provided by Morris\r\n  regarding the retail value was cumulative to other testimony.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Austin testified he believed the truck was &quot;worth nothing&quot; given he\r\n  would not have bought it had he known that it had been &quot;wrecked.&quot; Â Additionally,\r\n  Disher testified regarding the extensive damage to the vehicle and the\r\n  potential safety issues created by this damage. \r\nB.Â Fair Market Value\r\nStokes-Craven asserts the\r\n  trial judge erred in failing to grant its motions for a directed verdict, JNOV,\r\n  or new trial given Austin offered no evidence as to the fair market value of\r\n  the actual condition of the truck.Â  Stokes-Craven contends Austin's\r\n  testimony that the truck was not worth anything to him and Morris's testimony\r\n  that the truck had a &quot;zero retail value&quot; was insufficient to satisfy\r\n  Austin's burden of proving his entitlement to actual damages.\r\nWhen we review a\r\n  trial judge's grant or denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, we\r\n  reverse only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling\r\n  is governed by an error of law. Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp;\r\n    Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997). \r\nAs a preliminary matter,\r\n  Austin contends this issue was not preserved for appellate review for several\r\n  reasons, including the fact that Stokes-Craven never used the term &quot;fair\r\n  market value&quot; during its presentation of its directed verdict motion or\r\n  JNOV motion.Â  Admittedly, Stokes-Craven only used the term &quot;fair market\r\n  value&quot; on one occasion during Austin's testimony. Â However, we believe the\r\n  lack of reference to this term is not fatal to Stokes-Craven's appellate\r\n  argument.Â  Given Stokes-Craven's counsel moved for a directed verdict and filed\r\n  a detailed memorandum on its post-trial motions, we find this argument was\r\n  sufficiently preserved for this Court's review.

Toyota of Florence,\r\n    Inc., 302 S.C. 418, 421-22, 396 S.E.2d 645, 647 (Ct. App. 1990) (&quot;In an action for fraud in the sale of\r\n  goods, the plaintiff may elect to return the goods and recover the\r\n  consideration paid or retain the goods and sue for damages. Â If he retains the\r\n  goods, the measure of actual damages is the difference between the value the\r\n  purchaser would have received if the facts were as represented\r\n  and the value the purchaser actually received.&quot;).Â  \r\nHere, Austin repeatedly\r\n  offered to return the truck to Stokes-Craven in exchange for the purchase\r\n  price.Â  Given Stokes-Craven adamantly declined Austin's offers, we do not\r\n  believe Austin should be penalized or limited in his ability to recover damages\r\n  due to the fact that he has retained the vehicle.Â  Thus, the question becomes\r\n  whether Austin offered sufficient proof to establish the fair market value of\r\n  the truck to support the jury's award of actual damages in the amount of\r\n  $26,371.10.\r\nAustin, who was indisputably\r\n  familiar with the truck, testified that the value of the vehicle was worth &quot;nothing&quot;\r\n  on the date of sale given he would not have bought it had he known that it had\r\n  been &quot;wrecked.&quot;Â  Morris similarly testified that the vehicle had a &quot;zero\r\n  retail value&quot; on June 1, 2002, the date of sale. Â In light of this\r\n  testimony, it is evident the jury accepted Austin's and Morris's valuations and\r\n  assessed the fair market value of the truck when it awarded Austin actual\r\n  damages in the amount of $26,371.10, the differential of the purchase price\r\n  less the &quot;zero&quot; retail value.Â  See South Carolina State Highway Dep't v. Grant, 265 S.C. 28, 32, 216 S.E.2d 758, 759-60 (1975) (&quot;The basis\r\n  for allowing a landowner to testify as to the value of his property is that he\r\n  should not be deprived of his property without an opportunity of expressing his\r\n  own view to the jury. . . The jury is the tribunal to determine the weight to\r\n  be accorded to the testimony of the witnesses and accept or reject the\r\n  valuations placed thereupon.&quot;); Dixon v. Besco Eng'g, Inc., 320\r\n  S.C. 174, 181, 463 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct. App. 1995) (affirming trial judge's\r\n  award of actual damages for fair market value of plaintiff's lost tools where\r\n  plaintiff testified to the amount it would cost to replace them and the amount\r\n  awarded was comparable to the testimony).Â  Based on the foregoing, we find the\r\n  amount of actual damages awarded by the jury was supported by the testimony.Â  \r\nBecause Austin offered\r\n  sufficient evidence to support the award of actual damages through his own\r\n  testimony and expert witness testimony, we find the cases cited by\r\n  Stokes-Craven to be distinguishable in that in those cases the plaintiff failed\r\n  to offer specific evidence as to the value of the vehicle.Â  \r\nC. Federal Odometer Act\r\nStokes-Craven contends the\r\n  trial judge erred in failing to grant its motion for a directed verdict or JNOV\r\n  as to Austin's claim under the Federal Odometer Act.Â  Initially, Stokes-Craven\r\n  asserts there was no &quot;technical&quot; violation of the Federal Odometer\r\n  Act because:Â  (1) the truck was not titled in Stokes-Craven's name, and (2) the\r\n  odometer disclosure was properly made on a document used to reassign the truck's\r\n  title to Austin.Â  Even if its failure to disclose the odometer reading to\r\n  Austin constituted a violation of the Act, Stokes-Craven claims this violation\r\n  was not sufficient to support a recoverable claim given there was no specific &quot;intent\r\n  to defraud&quot; Austin with respect to the truck's mileage.Â Â Â  \r\nAs a preliminary matter, we\r\n  question whether Stokes-Craven's first argument was properly preserved for this\r\n  Court's review.Â  At trial, Stokes-Craven's counsel appears to admit that the\r\n  truck was titled in Stokes-Craven's name at the time Austin purchased the\r\n  vehicle.Â  Secondly, Frierson, the Stokes-Craven salesman involved in Austin's\r\n  purchase, admitted that he had never shown a title to a customer in his\r\n  twenty-five years of experience.Â  Thus, any argument regarding the lack of\r\n  title in Stokes-Craven's name or its failure to disclose the title to Austin would\r\n  not be preserved for appellate review. Â See TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina\r\n    Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d\r\n    471, 474 (1998) (&quot;An issue conceded in a lower court may not be argued on appeal.&quot;).\r\nHowever, even if\r\n  Stokes-Craven's failure to disclose the truck title to Austin constituted a violation\r\n  of the Act,[5] we find Austin did not prove Stokes-Craven violated the Act with the requisite\r\n  intent to defraud.Â  \r\nThe Federal Odometer Act (&quot;the Act&quot;)\r\n  provides for a private cause of action where a defendant violates the Act with\r\n  intent to defraud. Â 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 32710.[6] Â Thus, the question becomes whether Austin proved Stokes-Craven violated the Act with the requisite intent to defraud.Â  \r\nTo satisfy this\r\n  burden, Stokes-Craven claims Austin was required to establish that it violated\r\n  the Act with a specific intent to defraud regarding the truck's mileage.Â  In\r\n  contrast, Austin construes the Act broadly and believes that a general intent\r\n  to defraud is sufficient to satisfy this element in a civil action.Â  In order\r\n  to answer this question, we believe a review of the legislative history of the\r\n  Act is instructive.Â  Â \r\nThe purpose of\r\n  this Act has been explained as follows:Â  \r\nIn passing the Odometer Act, and its\r\n  predecessor, Congress sought &quot;(1) to prohibit tampering with motor vehicle\r\n  odometers; and (2) to provide safeguards to protect purchasers in the sale of\r\n  motor vehicles with altered or reset odometers.&quot; Â 49 U.S.C. Â§ 32701(b). Â To\r\n  accomplish these express goals, the Act imposes various requirements on persons\r\n  transferring motor vehicles. Â In addition to flat prohibitions on tampering\r\n  with odometers, a transferor &quot;of a motor vehicle [must] give the\r\n  transferee a written disclosure (A) of the cumulative mileage registered by the\r\n  odometer; or (B) that the mileage is unknown if the transferor knows that the\r\n  mileage registered by the odometer is incorrect.&quot; Â 49 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  32705(a)(1). Transferors are prohibited from making false statements in these\r\n  disclosures. Â See 49 U.S.C. Â§ 32705(a)(2). Furthermore, Congress\r\n  provided for criminal and civil penalties for violations of the Act, including\r\n  a private civil action. Â See 49 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 32709-32710. Â Section 32710\r\n  states: &quot;A person that violates this chapter or a regulation prescribed or\r\n  order issued under this chapter, with intent to defraud, is liable for 3\r\n  times the actual damages or $1,500, which ever is\r\n  greater.&quot; Â 49 U.S.C. Â§ 32710(a).\r\nBased on a Congressional delegation of authority in Â§ 32705, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (&quot;NHTSA&quot;)\r\n  promulgated regulations which &quot;provide the way in which information is\r\n  disclosed and retained under&quot; the Act. Â 49 U.S.C. Â§ 32705.Â  The scope of\r\n  these regulations is limited to &quot;rules requiring transferors . . . of\r\n  motor vehicles to make written disclosure to transferees . . . concerning the\r\n  odometer mileage and its accuracy as directed by [the Act].&quot; Â 49 C.F.R. Â§\r\n  580.1. Â Further, the purpose of the regulations &quot;is to provide purchasers\r\n  of motor vehicles with odometer information to assist them in determining a\r\n  vehicle's condition and value by making the disclosure of a vehicle's mileage a\r\n  condition of title . . . .&quot; 49 C.F.R. Â§ 580.2. Â Accordingly, &quot;each\r\n  title, at the time it is issued to the transferee, must contain the mileage\r\n  disclosed by the transferor when ownership of the vehicle was transferred . . .\r\n  .&quot; Â 49 C.F.R. Â§ 580.5(a). Â Additionally, transferors are required to\r\n  disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title. Â See 49\r\n  C.F.R. Â§ 580.5(c).\r\nNabors v. Auto Sports Unlimited, Inc., 475 F. Supp. 2d 646, 649-50 (E.D. Mich. 2007).Â  \r\nWith respect to the question\r\n  of whether the &quot;intent to defraud&quot; requirement for a civil action\r\n  involves a specific intent to defraud as to mileage of the vehicle or a general\r\n  intent to defraud, &quot;[t]here is a split of authority on this issue, with\r\n  the vast majority of courts concluding that the intent to defraud for the\r\n  purposes of the Odometer Act is a specific intent to defraud as to mileage.&quot;Â  Nabors, 475 F. Supp. 2d at 650; see Ioffe v. Skokie Motor\r\n    Sales, Inc., 414 F.3d 708, 711 (7th Cir. 2005) (analyzing the Federal\r\n  Odometer Act and concluding &quot;[s]ection 32710 does not create a private\r\n  right of action for all violations of the Act and regulations that are\r\n  accompanied by any 'intent to defraud.'Â  Rather, where a plaintiff alleges a\r\n  violation of 49 C.F.R. Â§580.5(c), he must prove intent to defraud as to a\r\n  vehicle mileage.&quot;); see generally Ann K. Wooster, Annotation, Validity,\r\n    Construction, and Application of Odometer Requirement Provisions of Motor\r\n    Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (49 U.S.C.A.

Fed. 255 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2009) (analyzing cases involving the\r\n  Federal Odometer Act and discussing requisite elements including the &quot;intent\r\n  to defraud&quot;).Â  \r\nApplying the foregoing to the\r\n  facts of the instant case, we hold the trial judge erred in failing to grant Stokes-Craven's\r\n  motion for a directed verdict or post-trial motion for JNOV.Â  At trial, Austin's\r\n  counsel conceded the claim under the Act did not arise out of a dispute\r\n  regarding the mileage.Â  Significantly, Austin never asserted that Stokes-Craven\r\n  misrepresented the mileage of the truck or tampered with its odometer.Â  Instead,\r\n  Austin's claim under the Act was essentially based on Stokes-Craven's failure\r\n  to disclose the title to the truck prior to Austin's purchase.Â  Throughout the\r\n  trial, Austin maintained that he would not have purchased the truck had he seen\r\n  the title listing Bailey, not Bud Knight, as the previous owner. Â Had he been\r\n  aware that Bailey was the previous owner, Austin claimed he would have been\r\n  able to discover the extensive &quot;wreck&quot; damage.Â  \r\nIn view of this evidence and\r\n  Austin's arguments, we find his claim under the Act failed as a matter of law\r\n  because he did not establish that Stokes-Craven's violation of the Act was\r\n  coupled with a specific intent to defraud him regarding the truck's mileage.Â  Thus,\r\n  we find the trial judge should have granted Stokes-Craven's motions for a\r\n  directed verdict or JNOV with respect to this cause of action.Â  See Bodine\r\n    v. Graco, Inc., 533 F.3d 1145 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding purchaser of used\r\n  vehicle failed to state a claim under the Act when she alleged that the vehicle's\r\n  sellers violated the Act by deliberately withholding the vehicle's title to\r\n  conceal that the vehicle had been severely damaged in an earlier collision\r\n  given the absence of the requisite allegation that the sellers intended to\r\n  defraud her as to the vehicle's mileage); Nabors, 475 F. Supp. 2d at\r\n  653-54 (finding used automobile dealer was entitled to summary judgment on\r\n  purchaser's claim under the Act where purchaser failed to present evidence\r\n  indicating the dealer intended to defraud purchaser as to the vehicle's mileage\r\n  even though there was evidence that purchaser may not have been notified that\r\n  the vehicle was &quot;salvaged&quot; or that dealer may have used fabricated\r\n  documents for the purposes of the lawsuit); Ioffe, 414 F.3d at 713-14\r\n  (recognizing that the Odometer Act &quot;is concerned specifically with fraud\r\n  related to the vehicle's mileage rather than with all types of fraud that might\r\n  involve the withholding of a vehicle's title&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  the trial judge's award of $1,500 in actual damages and $4,500 in attorney's fees\r\n  to Austin under this cause of action.Â  \r\nD. Inconsistent Verdicts\r\nStokes-Craven asserts the\r\n  trial judge erred in failing to grant it a new trial on the ground the jury\r\n  verdicts were inconsistent.Â  Given the jury found in favor of Austin as to his claims for fraud and in favor of Stokes-Craven as to the UTPA claim,\r\n  Stokes-Craven contends these verdicts are irreconcilable and, thus, warrant a\r\n  new trial.Â  \r\nWhether to grant a new trial is a matter within the discretion of\r\n  the trial judge, and this decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or is controlled by an error of law.

Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to -560 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â Â  \r\n\r\n  In contrast, &quot;[t]o\r\n    establish a cause of action for fraud, the following Â elements must be proven by clear,\r\n    cogent, and convincing evidence: Â (1) a representation of fact; (2) its\r\n    falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or a reckless\r\n    disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted\r\n    upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance on\r\n    its truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's\r\n    consequent and proximate injury.&quot; Â Schnellmann v.\r\n      Roettger, 373 S.C. 379, 382, 645 S.E.2d 239, 241 (2007).Â  &quot;The\r\n    failure to prove any element of fraud or misrepresentation is fatal to the\r\n    claim.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A review of the elements of\r\n  these two claims reveals that different proof is required to recover under each\r\n  cause of action.Â  For example, the jury could have found the elements of fraud\r\n  were sufficient to satisfy the deceptive act prong of an UTPA claim; however, it\r\n  may have concluded the deceptive act was confined to Austin's transaction and\r\n  did not affect the public interest, i.e., satisfy the public interest\r\n  prong of the UTPA claim.Â  Thus, we find the verdicts of the jury were not\r\n  necessarily inconsistent. \r\nE.Â  Punitive Damages\r\nStokes-Craven asserts the\r\n  judge erred in affirming the jury's award of $216,600 in punitive damages. Â In\r\n  support of this assertion, it contends the award:Â  (1) cannot stand because the\r\n  award of actual damages was improper; (2) was based upon the improper closing\r\n  arguments of Austin's counsel; and (3) is excessive and unconstitutional. \r\nHaving found there was\r\n  evidence to support the jury's award of actual damages to Austin in the amount\r\n  of $26,371.10, we focus our analysis on Stokes-Craven's two remaining arguments\r\n  regarding the award of punitive damages.\r\n In the instant case, Stokes-Craven\r\n  challenged the award of punitive damages during trial and in its post-trial\r\n  motions.Â  Prior to the jury's deliberations, a sealed statement regarding\r\n  Stokes-Craven's net worth was submitted to the jury with the instruction that\r\n  they only open it in the event punitive damages were awarded.Â  In the course of\r\n  his closing argument, Austin's counsel indicated that he had not seen this net\r\n  worth statement and, thus, could only rely on the testimony at trial to\r\n  estimate the profits of Stokes-Craven.Â  Specifically, counsel referenced the testimony\r\n  of Dennis Craven wherein he testified regarding the average number of vehicles\r\n  sold per year and the average profit per vehicle.Â  Extrapolating from this\r\n  testimony, Austin's counsel stated &quot;[t]he total profit for 2005, based on\r\n  Mr. Craven's testimony is one million three hundred and sixty-five thousand\r\n  dollars profit.&quot;Â Â  Throughout this portion of Austin's counsel's closing\r\n  argument, counsel for Stokes-Craven interposed objections which were partially\r\n  sustained by the trial judge. \r\nIn its post-trial motion, Stokes-Craven\r\n  challenged the award of punitive damages on several grounds which included the\r\n  alleged improper closing remarks of Austin's counsel and the excessiveness of\r\n  the award.Â  \r\nIn his order affirming the\r\n  jury's award of punitive damages, the trial judge specifically identified and\r\n  found evidence in the record to support each of the factors outlined in Gamble.Â  \r\nTurning to Stokes-Craven's\r\n  remaining two arguments, we find any complaint regarding improper closing\r\n  arguments is inconsequential given both the jury and the trial judge relied\r\n  upon the sealed statement of Stokes-Craven's net worth in assessing whether\r\n  Stokes-Craven had the ability to pay.[7]Â \r\n  This statement reflected that Stokes-Craven's net worth was $1,444,561 as of\r\n  December 31, 2005.Â  Accordingly, Stokes-Craven's second argument is without\r\n  merit. \r\nWe now turn to Stokes-Craven's final argument in which it\r\n  challenges the amount of the award of punitive damages.\r\n&quot;Because\r\n  punitive damages are quasi-criminal in nature, the process of assessing\r\n  punitive damages is subject to the protections of the Due Process Clause of the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.&quot;Â  James v.\r\n    Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 194, 638 S.E.2d 667, 670 (2006).Â  \r\nRecently, this Court articulated\r\n  the guideposts to be applied in conducting a post-judgment review of punitive\r\n  damages awards.Â  Mitchell v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 686 S.E.2d\r\n  176 (2009).[8]Â \r\n  In Mitchell, we explained that a trial judge shall review the constitutionality of a punitive\r\n  damages award by determining whether the award was reasonable under the\r\n  following guideposts: Â (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's\r\n  misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual and potential harm suffered by\r\n  the plaintiff and the amount of the punitive damages award; and (3) the\r\n  difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil\r\n  penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Â Id. at 587-88, 686\r\n  S.E.2d at 185-86 (citing BMW of North America v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559\r\n  (1996)).Â  We further emphasized that an appellate court reviews de novo the\r\n  trial judge's application of these guideposts.Â  Id.\r\nBased on our review of the\r\n  record in the context of the Mitchell test, we find the amount of\r\n  punitive damages awarded to Austin was not grossly excessive.Â  In reaching this\r\n  conclusion, we address each of the factors enunciated in Mitchell.\r\nIn terms of reprehensibility,\r\n  we should consider whether:Â  (1) the harm caused was physical as opposed to\r\n  economic; (2) the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless\r\n  disregard for the health or safety of others; (3) the target of the conduct had\r\n  financial vulnerability; (4) the conduct involved repeated actions or was an\r\n  isolated incident; and (5) the harm was the result of intentional malice,\r\n  trickery, or deceit, rather than mere accident.Â  Id. at 587, 686 S.E.2d\r\n  at 185 (citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408\r\n  (2003)). \r\nConsidering the\r\n  above-outlined factors, we find Stokes-Craven's conduct can only be construed\r\n  as exhibiting an extremely high degree of reprehensibility.Â  Admittedly, the\r\n  harm caused to Austin was economic.Â  However, this factor alone does not minimize\r\n  the reprehensibility of Stokes-Craven's conduct given the dealership procured\r\n  Austin's purchase of the truck through its employees' affirmative misrepresentations\r\n  regarding the condition of the vehicle.Â  Significantly, Stokes-Craven employees\r\n  failed to disclose that the truck had been &quot;wrecked&quot; and the lack of\r\n  a power train warranty.Â  There is also evidence that Stokes-Craven forged\r\n  Austin's signature on the &quot;Buyerâ€™s Guide&quot; in an effort to legitimize\r\n  the lack of a power train warranty.Â  We believe these misrepresentations,\r\n  particularly as to whether the vehicle had been wrecked, evinced an\r\n  indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health and safety of Austin and\r\n  the general public that would share the road with the potentially unsafe\r\n  vehicle.Â  Finally, there is evidence that Stokes-Craven's mistreatment of\r\n  Austin, a financially vulnerable customer, was not an isolated incident as Frierson\r\n  testified that he had not shown a title to a customer in his twenty-five years\r\n  of experience.Â  \r\nNext, we find the ratio of\r\n  punitive damages to actual damages does not warrant reversal.Â  In determining\r\n  the reasonableness of the ratio we may consider:Â  the likelihood that that the\r\n  award will deter the defendant from like conduct; whether the award is\r\n  reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; and the\r\n  defendant's ability to pay.Â  Id. at 588, 686 S.E.2d at 185.\r\nAdmittedly, an 8.21 ratio is\r\n  high considering the type of &quot;injury&quot; underlying Austinâ€™s claims.Â  However,\r\n  it is a single-digit ratio and there is evidence of Stokes-Craven's ability to\r\n  pay.Â  Furthermore, given the extent of the wreck damage and the resultant\r\n  safety issues, we believe there was a potential for Austin or his passengers to\r\n  be subjected to serious injury.Â  We also find the amount of the award of\r\n  punitive damages will inevitably serve as a deterrent to Stokes-Craven from\r\n  engaging in future misconduct.Â  See Gore, 517 U.S. at 582\r\n  (stating &quot;low awards of compensatory damages may properly support a higher\r\n  ratio than high compensatory awards, if, for example, a particularly egregious\r\n  act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages&quot;); Mitchell,\r\n  385 S.C. at 594, 686 S.E.2d at 188 (concluding a 9.2 to 1 ratio satisfied due\r\n  process and comported with South Carolina law); Atkinson v. Orkin\r\n    Exterminating Co., 361 S.C. 156, 170, 604 S.E.2d 385, 392-93 (2004) (stating\r\n  &quot;'few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and\r\n  compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process'&quot;\r\n  (quoting Campbell, 538 U.S. at 425)); cf. James, 371 S.C.\r\n  at 196, 638 S.E.2d at 672 (concluding, in a case involving an insured's bad\r\n  faith claim against his insurer, punitive damage award of $1,000,00 which was\r\n  6.82 times the amount of actual damages was reasonably related to the actual\r\n  harm suffered).\r\nFinally, we must consider the\r\n  difference between the punitive damages awarded to Austin and the civil\r\n  penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.Â  Because the jury awarded\r\n  punitive damages pursuant to Austin's fraud cause of action, we are compelled\r\n  to review factually-similar cases.[9]Â \r\n  Based on our review of these cases, we conclude the award of punitive damages\r\n  in the instant case is consistent with those of comparable cases.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Krysa v. Payne, 176 S.W.3d 150 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005) (affirming\r\n  jury verdict of $18,449.53 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive\r\n  damages awarded to purchasers of a used vehicle against dealership where\r\n  dealership:Â  did not provide title to purchasers at the time of purchase; failed\r\n  to disclose that the vehicle had thirteen prior owners; affirmatively\r\n  misrepresented the condition of the vehicle; and failed to disclose that the\r\n  vehicle had sustained significant wreck damage); Parrott v. Carr Chevrolet,\r\n    Inc., 17 P.3d 473 (Or. 2001) (affirming award of $11,496 in compensatory\r\n  damages and $1 million in punitive damages where the defendant car dealership\r\n  sold the plaintiff a vehicle that had been previously involved in a serious\r\n  accident and was missing several pieces of emission control equipment).\r\nIn conclusion, having\r\n  carefully considered the Mitchell guideposts, we hold the jury's award\r\n  of punitive damages was not grossly excessive in violation of the Due Process\r\n  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nI.Â  Austin's Appeal\r\nA.Â  Election\r\n  of Remedies\r\nAustin essentially contends\r\n  the trial judge erred in failing to award his request for attorney's fees and\r\n  costs in its entirety for the amount of $49,936.50. \r\nIn his post-trial motion,\r\n  Austin requested to recover damages under all of the juryâ€™s verdicts in\r\n  addition to attorney's fees and costs as statutorily-authorized under the\r\n  Dealer's Act and the Federal Odometer Act.Â  In his order addressing this\r\n  request, the trial judge held Austin was required to elect one verdict as\r\n  between the negligence, fraud, constructive fraud, and the Dealer's Act given\r\n  Austin experienced one loss based on four different theories.\r\nIn view of this holding, the\r\n  trial judge implicitly denied Austin's request for attorney's fees and costs\r\n  under the Dealer's Act.Â  Given Austin's recovery under the Federal Odometer Act\r\n  represented a separate cause of action, the trial judge awarded Austin $1,500\r\n  in actual damages and a &quot;reasonable attorney fee&quot; in the amount of\r\n  $4,500, which represented the time spent on recovering under the Federal\r\n  Odometer Act.[10]Â Â Â  \r\nBecause Austin was ordered to\r\n  elect between the jury's verdicts of negligence, constructive fraud, fraud, and\r\n  the violation of the Dealer's Act, Austin claims he was denied the\r\n  statutorily-authorized attorney's fees and costs under the Dealer's Act[11] given he chose to recover for his fraud claim which yielded only actual and\r\n  punitive damages.Â  \r\n&quot;Election of\r\n  remedies involves a choice between different forms of redress afforded by law\r\n  for the same injury or different forms of proceeding on the same cause of\r\n  action.&quot; Â Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 218, 479 S.E.2d\r\n  35, 44 (1996).Â  The basic purpose of election of remedies is to prevent double recovery for a single wrong. Â Save\r\n    Charleston Found. v. Murray, 286 S.C. 170, 333 S.E.2d 60 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985).Â  &quot;When an identical set of facts entitle the plaintiff to alternative\r\n  remedies, he may plead and prove his entitlement to either or both; however,\r\n  the plaintiff may not recover both.&quot; Â Id. at 175, 333 S.E.2d at 64.\r\nAlthough novel in this state,\r\n  we find Austin's contention is supported by case law from other jurisdictions.Â \r\n  As we interpret these cases, they stand for the proposition that a plaintiff\r\n  may recover attorney fees under a statutory claim in addition to punitive\r\n  damages under a common law claim.Â  The rationale for this position is that an\r\n  award for both does not amount to double recovery for a single wrong given\r\n  attorney's fees are intended to make such claims economically viable for\r\n  private citizens whereas an award of punitive damages is designed to punish\r\n  wrongful conduct and deter future misconduct.Â  See, e.g., Miller v.\r\n    United Automax, 166 S.W.3d 692, 697-98 (Tenn. 2005) (holding, in suit\r\n  involving buyers of a used car, election of remedies doctrine did not bar\r\n  buyers from recovering attorney fees under the Tennessee Consumer Protection\r\n  Act after having elected to receive punitive damages on their common law\r\n  misrepresentation claim in lieu of statutory treble damages); Wilkins v.\r\n    Peninsula Motor Cars, Inc., 587 S.E.2d 581, 583-84 (Va. 2003) (concluding,\r\n  in a case involving a buyer of used car, election of remedies doctrine did not\r\n  require the buyer to elect between verdicts of fraud and violation of the\r\n  Virginia Consumer Protection Act where recovery of attorney fees under the Act\r\n  was not duplicative of punitive damages awarded on the common law fraud claim). \r\nBecause costly attorney fees\r\n  may deter private citizens from bringing a claim under the Dealer's Act, a\r\n  decision in favor of Austin facilitates the purpose of the Act which is to\r\n  provide buyers a private right of action against dealers who engage in deceptive\r\n  practices.Â  Furthermore, given the recovery of attorney's fees under the Dealer's\r\n  Act is not duplicative of the award of punitive damages, we do not believe a\r\n  decision in favor of Austin would violate the election of remedies doctrine's\r\n  prevention of double redress for a single wrong.Â  As its name states, the\r\n  doctrine applies to the election of &quot;remedies&quot; not the election of &quot;verdicts.&quot;Â \r\n  Thus, an award of attorney's fees and costs would merely serve to fully\r\n  compensate Austin for pursuing his statutorily-authorized private right of\r\n  action under the Dealer's Act, which we believe epitomizes the definition of a\r\n  remedy.Â  See Black's Law Dictionary 1163 (5th ed. 1979) (defining\r\n  &quot;remedy&quot; as &quot;[t]he means by which a right is enforced or the\r\n  violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated&quot;). \r\nGiven our conclusion that Austin\r\n  can recover attorney's fees and costs under the Dealer's Act, the question\r\n  becomes whether he should be awarded the entire amount of his request or should\r\n  the amount be limited to the fees incurred in establishing his claim under the\r\n  Dealer's Act.Â  \r\nUnder the specific facts of\r\n  this case, we find it would be difficult to dissect Austin's counsel's fee\r\n  affidavit to ascertain how much time was spent on this particular claim given\r\n  the violation of the Act was based on the same facts and circumstances\r\n  underlying his claims for fraud and constructive fraud.Â  Furthermore, to award Austin his claim in its entirety would be consistent with the precedent of this Court.Â  Cf. Taylor v. Nix, 307 S.C. 551, 557, 416 S.E.2d 619, 622 (1992) (finding\r\n  award of attorney fees under the Dealer's Act was warranted even though fee\r\n  affidavit was not itemized for time spent for claim under the Act and that\r\n  spent for the nonstatutory cause of action).\r\nB.Â  Prejudgment Interest\r\nAustin contends the trial\r\n  judge erred in declining to award him prejudgment interest. Â Because\r\n  Stokes-Craven rejected Austin's &quot;demand&quot; to return the truck in\r\n  exchange for the purchase price, Austin claims his actual damages were &quot;capable\r\n  of ascertainment.&quot;Â  In support of these assertions, Austin notes the jury\r\n  awarded actual damages in the amount of $26,371.10 which equaled the purchase\r\n  price of $25,981.10 plus $390.00 for the taxes and tags.\r\n&quot;The law permits the award of prejudgment\r\n  interest when a monetary obligation is a sum certain, or is capable of being\r\n  reduced to certainty, accruing from the time payment may be demanded either by\r\n  the agreement of the parties or the operation of law.&quot; Â Historic Charleston\r\n    Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, LLC, 381 S.C. 417, 435, 673 S.E.2d 448, 457\r\n  (2009); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;In\r\n  all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money\r\n  shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the\r\n  legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per\r\n  annum.&quot;).Â  &quot;Generally, prejudgment interest may not be recovered on\r\n  an unliquidated claim in the absence of agreement or statute.&quot; Charleston Holdings, LLC, 381 S.C. at 435, 673 S.E.2d at 457.Â  &quot;The fact\r\n  that the amount due is disputed does not render the claim unliquidated for\r\n  purposes of awarding prejudgment interest.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;Rather, the\r\n  proper test is 'whether [or not] the measure of recovery, not necessarily the\r\n  amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.'&quot;\r\n  Â Id. (quoting Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC, 369\r\n  S.C. 121, 133, 631 S.E.2d 252, 259 (2006)). Â Â \r\nAlthough Austin is correct\r\n  that prejudgment interest is statutorily authorized by the provisions of section\r\n  34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code, we find Austin's damages were not liquidated\r\n  at the time his claim arose.Â  Austin's lawsuit arose out of his dissatisfaction\r\n  with the purchase of a used vehicle.Â  Because Austin alleged claims of fraud,\r\n  constructive fraud, negligence, and violations of state and federal motor\r\n  vehicle acts his prospective damages were unliquidated and could not have been\r\n  ascertained without evidence of the retail value of the truck.Â  Given Austin's\r\n  monetary recovery could not have been reduced to certainty, the trial judge\r\n  correctly denied Austin's request for prejudgment interest.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs to Stokes-Craven's appeal,\r\n  we hold:Â  (1) there was no prejudicial abuse of discretion in admitting the\r\n  testimony of Disher and Morris; (2) Austin offered proof of actual damages in\r\n  the amount of $26,371.10; (3) Austin failed to prove that Stokes-Craven\r\n  violated the Federal Odometer Act with the requisite intent to defraud him as\r\n  to the mileage of the truck; (4) the verdicts for fraud and violation of the\r\n  UTPA were not inconsistent; and (5) there was evidence to support the jury's\r\n  award of $216,000 in punitive damages.\r\nIn terms of Austin's\r\n  cross-appeal, we hold:Â  (1) he is entitled to the entire amount of his request\r\n  for attorney's fees and costs under the South Carolina Dealer's Act; and (2) he\r\n  is not entitled to prejudgment interest.\r\nAccordingly, we remand this\r\n  case to the circuit court for entry of judgment consistent with our decision.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWALLER, J., concurs.\r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion in\r\n  which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.Â \r\n  Specifically, I agree that Stokes-Craven has not shown an abuse of discretion\r\n  in the trial courtâ€™s decision to qualify Morris as an expert, State v. White,\r\n  382 S.C. 265, 676 S.E.2d 684 (2009), although I would give no weight to the fact\r\n  that Morris had been qualified as an expert on several other occasions.Â  Cf. State v. Jones, 383 S.C. 535, 681 S.E.2d 580 (2009) (despite fact that\r\n  other jurisdictions had permitted same witness to testify as expert in area,\r\n  trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence).Â  I also agree\r\n  with the majority that Stokes-Craven was entitled to a directed verdict on the\r\n  Federal Odometer Act claim, and that it cannot prevail on its new trial\r\n  argument.Â  See Camden v. Hilton, 360 S.C. 164, 600 S.E.2d 88 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005) (inconsistent verdict allegation waived if not raised before jury is\r\n  dismissed).Â  Finally, I agree with the majority that the trial judge properly\r\n  denied Austinâ€™s request for prejudgment interest.\r\nI agree with Austin that the\r\n  issue whether Stokes-Craven was entitled to a directed verdict because Austin\r\n  offered no evidence of fair market value is not preserved for appeal as this\r\n  failure of proof was not raised as a ground for a directed verdict.Â \r\n  Consequently, whether it was raised in the judgment non obstante veredicto (JNOV) motion and/or is discussed in the detailed post-trial memorandum is\r\n  irrelevant.Â  E.g., In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235\r\n  (2001) (only issues raised at directed verdict can properly be raised a JNOV).Â \r\n  Moreover, since there was no contemporaneous objection either to the expertâ€™s\r\n  or to the ownerâ€™s testimony that the truck had a value of $0, I agree that\r\n  there was evidence of value for the juryâ€™s consideration.Â  E.g., Cantrell\r\n    v. Carruth, 250 S.C. 415, 158 S.E.2d 208 (1967) (evidence received without\r\n  objection becomes competent and cannot be disregarded when considering directed\r\n  verdict motion).Â  Had the issue been properly preserved, however, I would agree\r\n  that Austin failed to present any competent evidence of the truckâ€™s fair market\r\n  value, which clearly is more than $0.\r\nStokes-Craven also contends\r\n  that it was entitled to a new trial as there is no evidence in the record to\r\n  support the juryâ€™s verdict valuing the truck at $26,371.10, that is, the amount\r\n  Austin paid for it.Â  Since there was no objection to Austinâ€™s or Morrisâ€™ $0\r\n  value testimony, there is evidence in the record to support this verdict.[12]Â \r\n  I therefore agree with the majority that Stokes-Craven has not shown an abuse\r\n  of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial of a new trial.Â  E.g., Dillon\r\n    v. Frazer, 383 S.C. 59, 678 S.E.2d 251 (2009).\r\nOn appeal, Stokes-Craven\r\n  contends the trial judge erred in allowing Disher to testify to safety issues.Â \r\n  In my view, this issue is not preserved for appellate review since the judge\r\n  sustained both of Stokes-Cravenâ€™s objections to Disherâ€™s answers which exceeded\r\n  the scope of Disherâ€™s expertise.Â  See State v. Thompson, 304 S.C.\r\n  85, 403 S.E.2d 139 (Ct. App. 1991) (where objection sustained and no further\r\n  relief is sought, no issue is preserved for appeal as appellant received all\r\n  relief requested from trial judge).Â  As I do not view the issue as preserved, I\r\n  do not join the majorityâ€™s discussion of prejudice.\r\nUnlike the majority, I would\r\n  reduce the punitive damages award here.Â  Stokes-Craven challenges the punitive\r\n  damages award on three grounds arguing that:\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since the actual damage award of\r\n    $26,371.10 must be reversed, the punitive damage award cannot stand;\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â the punitive award is based on an\r\n    inappropriate closing argument; and\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â the award is unconstitutionally\r\n    excessive.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, no issue\r\n  relating to the actual damage award is preserved for appellate review, and thus\r\n  Stokes-Cravenâ€™s first argument fails.\r\nThe question of improper\r\n  closing argument is also not preserved.Â  Austinâ€™s counsel argued that,\r\n  extrapolating from other testimony, Stokes-Cravenâ€™s total profit for\r\n  2005 was $1,365,000.Â  Stokes-Craven did not object to this argument.Â  In its\r\n  order reviewing punitive damages, the trial judge wrote that the witness had\r\n  testified to this â€œtotal profit,â€ which is incorrect.Â  However, Stokes-Craven\r\n  never called this misstatement to the trial judgeâ€™s attention.Â  Given that\r\n  there was no objection to the extrapolation of total profit in Austinâ€™s closing\r\n  argument, its alleged impropriety cannot be the basis for reversal here.Â  E.g., Ligon v. Norris, 371 S.C. 625, 640 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Further,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s unobjected-to misstatement in its order reversing punitive\r\n  damages is not a basis for reversal.Â  E.g., State v. Covert, 382\r\n  S.C. 205, 675 S.E.2d 740 (2009) (error must cause sufficient prejudice to\r\n  warrant reversal).Â  \r\nThe third ground urged for\r\n  reversal is Stokes-Cravenâ€™s argument that the punitive damages verdict of\r\n  $216,600 is unconstitutionally excessive.Â  In Mitchell v. Fortis Ins. Co.,\r\n  385 S.C. 570, 686 S.E.2d 176 (2009), we articulated a reformulated three-part\r\n  test to be used in conducting a post-judgment review of a punitive damages\r\n  award: the reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s conduct; the ratio between the\r\n  actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the amount of the\r\n  punitive damages award; and the difference between the punitive damages verdict\r\n  and civil penalties authorized in comparable cases.Â  I have reviewed each part\r\n  below.\r\n\r\n  1. Â Reprehensibility\r\n\r\nIn my view, it is\r\n  reprehensible to misrepresent a warranty, and to deny that the vehicle had been\r\n  wrecked when asked directly.Â  I do not find it reprehensible, however, to\r\n  vaguely confirm the buyerâ€™s guess as to the identity of the truckâ€™s prior\r\n  owner.Â  I find the warranty issue was mitigated since, when the\r\n  misrepresentation/misunderstanding was discovered about two months after the\r\n  purchase, Stokes-Cravenâ€™s offered to â€œtrade [Austin] out of the truck.â€Â  As to\r\n  the vague confirmation by Stokes-Craven as to the truckâ€™s prior owner, i.e.,\r\n  â€œYeah, I believe that is his truck,â€ I do not find the action particularly\r\n  despicable.Â  I am, however, deeply troubled by Stokes-Cravenâ€™s\r\n  misrepresentation that the truck had not been wrecked.Â  My concern is tempered\r\n  somewhat by the testimony of Austinâ€™s own expert Disher that â€œanybody that\r\n  [sic] had their eyes open and was lookingâ€¦could tell that thereâ€™d been a\r\n  massive amount of repairs done to that vehicleâ€ in light of Austinâ€™s testimony\r\n  that he â€œused his training as a mechanic to examine the [truckâ€™s] outside and\r\n  its underside.â€Â  The misrepresentation is reprehensible: whether Austin was\r\n  misled is questionable.\r\nIn short, I find the conduct\r\n  mildly reprehensible.Â  Unlike the majority, I find no evidence that\r\n  Stokes-Craven â€œforgedâ€ Austinâ€™s signature on the â€œBuyers Guide,â€ only evidence\r\n  that Austin denied signing it.Â  Finally, given that we have held the trial\r\n  judge should have granted a directed verdict on the Federal Odometer Act claim,\r\n  I do not agree that we should rely on evidence of Stokes-Cravenâ€™s practice of\r\n  not showing titles to customers, evidence admitted only in an attempt to prove\r\n  the Odometer Act claim, as probative of reprehensibility.\r\n\r\n  2. Ratio\r\n\r\nAlthough I find that\r\n  Stokes-Craven did not preserve its objections to the testimony that the fair\r\n  market value of the truck was $0, in viewing this ratio guidepost Fortis instructs we need not always compare the punitive award to the actual damages.Â  \r\nHere, the truck obviously had\r\n  residual value, either as scrap or for its intended purpose in light of the\r\n  evidence that Austin continued to drive the truck at the time of the trial,\r\n  more than four years after it was purchased.Â  In my view, the actual damage\r\n  award far exceeds the true value of any harm or potential harm suffered by\r\n  Austin. \r\nOn a pure ratio basis, the\r\n  relationship between the actual/punitive awards is 1:8.21.Â  In my view, this\r\n  ratio is, as the majority acknowledges, â€œhigh,â€ especially since I view the\r\n  actual damages award as unreliable.Â  Looking at the ratio in light of the other\r\n  factors to be considered under Fortis, I find the punitive damages\r\n  awarded here will deter Stokes-Craven from making misrepresentations in the\r\n  future; that the $216,000 awarded is reasonably related to the harm likely to\r\n  result from such conduct; and that Stokes-Craven has the ability to pay.Â  I\r\n  therefore reluctantly conclude that ratio does not provide a basis to reverse\r\n  or reduce the punitive damage award.\r\nThe final guidepost under Fortis is a comparison of the $216,000 to civil penalties authorized in comparable\r\n  cases.Â  In my view, the closest comparable statutory scheme is the Motor\r\n  Vehicles Dealers Act, which admittedly does not provide for civil penalties.Â \r\n  While the jury found a violation of that statute here, it found no punitive\r\n  damages were warranted.Â  Under this Act, punitive damages can be awarded if the\r\n  defendant acted â€œmaliciously,â€ but any such award is capped at three times the\r\n  actual damages awarded.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-110(3) (2006).Â  Here, the maximum\r\n  â€œstatutory penaltyâ€ would have been $79,113.30 in light of the actual damages\r\n  award of $26,371.10.\r\nIn short, the\r\n  reprehensibility is mild, the ratio is high, and the comparable penalty less.Â \r\n  Viewing these three guideposts, I find the verdict here constitutionally\r\n  excessive, and would remit the punitive award to $100,000.Â  Compare Fortis, supra (partially remitting punitive damages award after appellate\r\n  review).\r\nI agree with the majority\r\n  that a plaintiff who elects to receive damages awarded under a common law\r\n  theory may also be entitled to recover statutory costs and attorneys fees to\r\n  which he is entitled under a separate verdict, without running afoul of the\r\n  public policies underlying the doctrine of election of remedies.Â  See, e.g., United Labs, Inc. v. Kuykendall, 437 S.E.2d 374 (N.C. 1993).Â  As\r\n  explained below, however, I do not believe this issue is preserved for our\r\n  consideration.\r\nHere, Austin sought\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the Dealers Act and also sought reasonable attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees under the Odometer Act.Â  The trial judge awarded him attorneysâ€™ fees under\r\n  the Odometer Act, restricting the amount to fees and costs reasonably and\r\n  necessarily incurred in prosecuting that cause of action.Â  The majority has\r\n  concluded that Austinâ€™s Odometer Act claim must fail.Â  In my view, his claim\r\n  for attorneysâ€™ fees and costs dies with it.\r\nOn appeal, Austin maintains\r\n  the trial court erred in requiring him to elect between punitive damages under\r\n  the fraud or negligence verdict and his costs and fees under the Dealers Act.Â \r\n  In my view, this issue is not preserved.Â  After the court ruled that Austin\r\n  must elect between the Dealers Act verdict, the fraud verdict, and the\r\n  negligence verdict, but did not rule on this issue involving an election\r\n  between punitive damages and statutory fees, Austin filed no motion to alter or\r\n  amend.Â  Since this issue was not ruled on below and no motion to alter or amend\r\n  was made, no issue regarding the availability of Dealers Act fees and costs is\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  E.g., Metts v. Mims, 384 S.C. 491, 682\r\n  S.E.2d 813 (2009).Â  \r\nI also disagree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s holding that, pursuant to Taylor v. Nix, 307 S.C. 551, 416\r\n  S.E.2d 619 (1992), a plaintiff entitled to fees under the Dealers Act need not\r\n  segregate the amount of attorney time and costs attributable to that claim and\r\n  recover only these sums.Â  That opinion holds:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    defendantâ€™s attorney argued fees related to the [non-Dealers Act] cause of\r\n    action should have been excluded.Â  We agree.Â  However, precisely what fees were\r\n    unrelated to the statutory action were not presented to the lower courtâ€¦[T]he\r\n    party asserting the right to attorneys fees [must] produce an itemized\r\n    affidavit of their fees that they believe are related to the\r\n  statutory claim.Â  The opposing party then has the burden of showing which of\r\nthe fees are clearly unrelated.\r\n  Taylor\r\n    v. Nix, 307 S.C. at 557, 416 S.E.2d\r\n    at 622.\r\n\r\nThe only attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  affidavit in this record was submitted by Austinâ€™s counsel prior to the courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling on the election of remedies issues, and makes no pretense of separating\r\n  fees incurred only in pursuit of the Dealers Act or the Odometer Act.Â  He\r\n  therefore did not meet even the threshold requirement of Taylor v. Nix, supra. \r\nOverlooking for the moment\r\n  that the issue is not preserved, I disagree with the majority that we may award\r\n  all fees and costs sought on this record, given the applicable law.Â  This is\r\n  especially so since in making the fees and costs award Austin sought under the\r\n  Odometer Act, the trial judge honored Taylor v. Nix: he required Austin\r\n  to submit a new affidavit identifying fees and costs attributable to that cause\r\n  of action, and gave Stokes-Craven the opportunity for â€œinputâ€ following\r\n  submission of that affidavit.Â  Presumably, the trial judge would have followed\r\n  this same procedure had he made an award under the Dealers Act.\r\nAustin sought attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  and costs under two separate statutes.Â  The judge awarded them under one, and\r\n  Austin did not object.Â  Nowhere below did Austin specify he sought to recover\r\n  fees and costs incurred in prosecuting the Odometer Act claim in addition to\r\n  fees and costs incurred in pursuing the Dealers Act claim.\r\nI concur in part and dissent\r\n  in part.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I join the\r\n  well-written majority opinion of Justice Beatty save two exceptions.Â \r\n  Concerning the trial courtâ€™s failure to grant a directed verdict due to the\r\n  lack of evidence of fair market value and the election of remedies issue, I\r\n  join the dissent of Justice Pleicones.Â  Additionally, regarding the\r\n  reprehensibility prong of the punitive damages analysis, I believe Justice\r\n  Pleicones is correct in rejecting any reliance on Stokes-Cravenâ€™s practice of\r\n  not showing titles to customers because the Federal Odometer Act claim fails as\r\n  a matter of law.Â Â  I nevertheless join the majority in affirming the punitive\r\n  damages award.Â  I believe there was ample evidence of Stokes-Cravenâ€™s\r\n  reprehensibility (which I do not view as â€œmildâ€) beyond its failure to show\r\n  titles to customers.Â  I otherwise concur with the majority opinionâ€™s analysis\r\n  regarding the punitive damages award.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â The South Carolina Regulation of Manufacturers,\r\n  Distributors, and Dealers Act (the &quot;Dealerâ€™s Act&quot;) is codified at\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-15-10 to -600 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2009). Â Section 56-15-40\r\n  provides in relevant part, &quot;It shall be deemed a violation of paragraph\r\n  (a) of Â§ 56-15-30 for any manufacturer . . . distributor, wholesaler . . . or\r\n  motor vehicle dealer to engage in any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith,\r\n  or unconscionable and which causes damage to any of the parties or to the\r\n  public.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-40(1) (2006).\r\n[2]Â  The Federal Odometer Act, specifically titled &quot;Motor\r\n  Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act,&quot; is codified at 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 32701\r\n  to Â§ 32711 (West 2009).\r\n[3] During the trial, Austin withdrew his causes of\r\n  action for revocation of acceptance and breach of contract. \r\n[4]Â  Morris testified that he initially assigned a\r\n  $14,000 value to the truck.Â  However, he clarified that this value was based on\r\n  incomplete information.Â  After he received information from Disher regarding\r\n  the truck's potential &quot;safety issues,&quot; he concluded the retail value\r\n  of the truck was &quot;zero.&quot;Â  \r\n[5] Â It would appear that Stokes-Craven technically violated the Act by failing to\r\n  disclose the truck's title to Austin prior to his purchase.Â  See Tuckish\r\n    v. Pompano Motor Co., 337 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1318 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (&quot;Failure\r\n  to provide a purchaser with a copy of the certificate of title, when such title\r\n  is available, technically violates the Odometer Act.&quot;).Â  However, because\r\n  the purpose of the Act is to inform a car buyer of a vehicle's actual odometer\r\n  reading prior to purchase, we believe this purpose could be effectuated by a\r\n  seller disclosing the mileage on any document that is part of the\r\n  purchase transaction.Â  Thus, we do not interpret the Act as restricting the\r\n  mileage disclosure solely to the title of the vehicle.Â  \r\n[6]Â  We note the statute provides for concurrent\r\n  jurisdiction, stating &quot;A person may bring a civil action to enforce a\r\n  claim under this section in an appropriate United States district court or in\r\n  another court of competent jurisdiction.&quot;Â  49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 32710(b).Â  The\r\n  Act also does not preempt state law regarding the same subject matter.Â  49\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 32711.\r\n[7]Â  Although we do not think it was prejudicial to\r\n  Stokes-Craven, we note the trial judge in his written order referenced Dennis\r\n  Craven's testimony to conclusively establish the dealership's net profit as $ 1,365,000.Â \r\n  The only reference in the record to this figure is in Austin's counselâ€™s\r\n  closing argument. \r\n[8]Â  Because Mitchell was decided after the\r\n  trial in the instant case, we note the trial judge did not have the benefit of\r\n  our opinion.Â  The judge did, however, properly apply the eight-factor post-verdict\r\n  review standard of Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991), which was in effect\r\n  at the time of the trial.\r\n[9]Â  We disagree with the dissent's analysis of this\r\n  prong of the Mitchell test.Â  We find the dissent's reliance on the Motor\r\n  Vehicle Dealers Act is misplaced given this Act does not provide for civil\r\n  penalties and, thus, is inapposite.\r\n[10] Â As previously discussed, we find the trial judge\r\n  erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of Stokes-Craven as to Austin's\r\n  claim under the Federal Odometer Act.Â  Thus, we must necessarily reverse Austin's\r\n  recovery of attorney's fees under the Federal Odometer Act.\r\n[11]Â  The applicable provision of the South Carolina\r\n  Dealer's Act provides:\r\nIn\r\n  addition to temporary or permanent injunctive relief as provided in Â§\r\n  56-15-40(3)(c), any person who shall be injured in his business or property by\r\n  reason of anything forbidden in this chapter may sue therefor in the court of\r\n  common pleas and shall recover double the actual damages by him sustained, and\r\n  the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-15-110(1) (2006) (emphasis added).\r\n[12] I do not agree, however, with the suggestion\r\n  that Stokes-Cravenâ€™s refusal to allow Austinâ€™s request to return the truck for\r\n  a full refund permits Austin to seek rescission damages in a breach of contract\r\n  suit.Â  In my view, Stokes-Craven was under no obligation to honor Austinâ€™s\r\n  request. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of E.

Â We\r\n  affirm as modified.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn June 2002, appellant/respondent Spartanburg Regional Medical\r\n  Center (SRMC) filed a CON application with respondent South Carolina Department\r\n  of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).[1]Â  The CON was for a regional cancer center\r\n  with a linear accelerator[2] to be located on the campus of Upstate Carolina Medical Center,\r\n  an acute care hospital in Gaffney, Cherokee County.Â  In October 2002,\r\n  respondent/appellant Oncology Hematology Associates of South Carolina, LLC,\r\n  d/b/a Cancer Centers of the Carolinas (CCC) applied for a CON with DHEC for a\r\n  radiation oncology center with a linear accelerator to be located near the\r\n  campus of Mary Black Hospital (Mary Black) in Spartanburg.[3]Â  CCCâ€™s planned linear accelerator at Mary\r\n  Black would be approximately three miles from the Gibbs Regional Cancer Center\r\n  (Gibbs Center), which is affiliated with SRMC and where the only other three\r\n  linear accelerators in the service\r\n  area are located.[4]\r\nDHEC staff deemed the two CON applications competing.[5]&nbsp; DHEC held a project review\r\n  meeting in February 2003 where both SRMC and CCC presented their proposed\r\n  projects.Â  On March 31, 2003, DHEC issued its decision letters which granted a\r\n  CON for SRMC, but denied the CCC application. \r\nThereafter, CCC sought a contested case hearing before\r\n  the ALC on both of DHECâ€™s decisions.Â  After months of discovery, the ALC held a\r\n  five-day hearing in December 2003.Â  In June 2005, the ALC issued its order\r\n  upholding DHECâ€™s decision to grant SRMC a CON, but reversing the DHEC decision\r\n  to deny CCCâ€™s CON application.Â  The ALC found the two CON applications were not competing \"because granting both Applications will not exceed the need for\r\n  linear accelerator facilities and the services which they provide.\"Â  The ALC\r\n  further found that both applications were consistent with the 2001 State Health\r\n  Plan.Â  Accordingly, the ALC ordered DHEC to issue a CON for each proposed\r\n  project.\r\nDHEC, SRMC and CCC all petitioned the South Carolina Board of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (the Board) for review of the ALCâ€™s decision.Â  After a\r\n  hearing in January 2006, the Board decided neither petitioner had proved the\r\n  ALC had erred; therefore, the Board affirmed the ALCâ€™s decision. Â \r\nSRMC and CCC petitioned the circuit court for judicial\r\n  review of the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  A hearing was held in December 2007, and in\r\n  January 2008, the circuit court affirmed the Board and ALC orders in result.Â \r\n  SRMC and CCC filed cross-appeals, and the case was subsequently certified to\r\n  this Court, pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.[6]\r\nFACTS\r\nPursuant to the CON Act,[7] DHEC is designated as the sole state agency for control and administration\r\n  of the granting of CONs which includes the\r\n  preparation of the State Health Plan. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  44-7-130(8) &amp; -140 (2002).Â  The purpose of the\r\n  Health Plan is to outline the need for medical facilities and services in the\r\n  State.Â  The Health Plan is used as one of the criteria for reviewing projects\r\n  under the CON program.Â  \r\nThe parties agree that the 2001 Health\r\n  Plan governs the instant case because it was the plan in effect when the CON\r\n  applications were filed in 2002. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 504 (Supp. 2008). Â The\r\n  2001 State Health Plan set the capacity of each linear accelerator at\r\n  7,000 treatments per year, with a realistic load being 80 percent of capacity,\r\n  or 5,600 treatments per year.[8]Â  Under the 2001 Health Plan, new linear accelerators would only\r\n  be approved if the following conditions were met:\r\n\r\n\tA.&nbsp;&nbsp; All existing units in the service\r\n  area have performed at a combined use rate of 80 percent of capacity (5,600\r\n  treatments per unit) for the year immediately preceding the filing of the\r\n  applicantâ€™s CON application; and\r\n\tB. an applicant must project that the proposed service will\r\n  perform a minimum of 3,500 treatments annually within three years of initiation\r\n  of services, without reducing the utilization of existing [linear accelerators]\r\n  in the service area below the 80 percent threshold.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  Consequently, an application for a linear\r\n  accelerator CON in the tri-county service area at issue must establish that in\r\n  its third-year of operations, the projected number of treatments for the new\r\n  accelerator exceeds 3,500 treatments, and the existing accelerators will provide\r\n  at least 16,800 treatments.\r\nThe\r\n  2001 State Health Plan outlined the following criteria under which a linear\r\n  accelerator project would be reviewed:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\ta. \r\n\t\t\tCompliance with the Need Outlined in this Plan;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tb. \r\n\t\t\tCommunity Need Documentation;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tc. \r\n\t\t\tDistribution (Accessibility);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\td. \r\n\t\t\tProjected Revenues;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\te.\r\n\t\t\tProjected Expenses; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tf. \r\n\t\t\tFinancial Feasibility; and\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tg.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tCost Containment.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSee S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 802.\r\nThe Health Plan also specifically states that when evaluating CON\r\n  applications for linear accelerators, \"[t]he benefits of improved accessibility\r\n  will be equally weighted with the adverse affects [sic] of\r\n  duplication.\"Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Furthermore, the regulations clarify that\r\n  while a project \"does not have to satisfy every criterion\" to be approved, \"no\r\n  project may be approved unless it is consistent with the State Health Plan.\" Â S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 801(3).Â  DHEC assigns\r\n  the relative importance of the project review criteria for the specific project\r\n  applied for, and the relative importance \"must be consistent for competing\r\n  projects.\"[9]Â  Regs. 61-15 Â§ 801(2).\r\nSRMC filed its CON in June 2002 after determining that its three\r\n  existing linear accelerators at the Gibbs Center had\r\n  exceeded the 80 percent threshold for the 12-month time period of mid-May 2001\r\n  through mid-May 2002.[10]Â  The portion of SRMCâ€™s CON application dealing with Need focused\r\n  on the growing population of Cherokee County.Â  In determining the cancer\r\n  incidence rate for Cherokee County, SRMC utilized data from both the South\r\n  Carolina Central Cancer Registry (the SC Registry) and Claritas Corporation\r\n  (Claritas).[11]Â  SRMC projected over 3,500 treatments in the third year for the\r\n  Cherokee facility without reducing the existing Spartanburg linear\r\n  acceleratorsâ€™ utilization below the 80 percent threshold.Â  \r\nIn the Need portion of CCCâ€™s CON application, CCC asserted that\r\n  the tri-county area had a projected need for two additional linear accelerators\r\n  - its own proposed project and SRMCâ€™s Cherokee County proposal.Â  Using\r\n  Claritas population data along with age-specific cancer incidence data\r\n  from the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\r\n  (SEER) program, CCC predicted that its proposed Spartanburg facility would\r\n  perform 6,325 treatments in the third year without reducing SRMCâ€™s existing\r\n  linear acceleratorsâ€™ utilization below the 80 percent threshold.Â  \r\nDHEC found that SRMCâ€™s application \"better\" met the following\r\n  criteria than CCCâ€™s \"competing\" application:Â  \r\n\r\n\tCriterion 1.Â  Need - Compliance with the State Health Plan;Â  \r\n\tCriterion 3b. Distribution (Accessibility) - The proposed service\r\n  should be located so that it may serve medical underserved areas (or an\r\n  underserved population segment) and should not unnecessarily duplicate existing service or facilities\r\n  in the proposed service area; and \r\n\tCriterion 22.Â  Distribution - The existing distribution of the\r\n  health service(s) should be indentified and the effect of the proposed project\r\n  upon that distribution should be carefully considered to functionally balance\r\n  the distribution to the target population.\r\n\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 802.\r\nCCC\r\n  thereafter filed for a contested case hearing before the ALC.Â  The five-day\r\n  hearing was extensive in terms of both witness testimony and exhibits.Â  The\r\n  parties took issue with many aspects of each otherâ€™s proposed project,\r\n  specifically targeting assertions regarding, inter alia, financial\r\n  feasibility studies, service to indigent populations, desirability of the\r\n  project from the community perspective, and expert qualifications of witnesses.\r\nWithout a doubt, however, the issue of need was central to the\r\n  case because CCC argued that DHEC had erred at the outset by characterizing the\r\n  applications as competing.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-130(5) (defining \"competing applicants\" as two health care\r\n  facilities who apply for CONs \"to provide similar services or facilities in the\r\n  same service area within a time frame as established by departmental\r\n  regulations and whose applications, if approved, would exceed the need for\r\n  services or facilities\") (emphasis added). Â CCC contended that because the\r\n  addition of two linear accelerators would not exceed the need for radiation\r\n  therapy in the tri-county service area, both applications could be approved.Â \r\n  CCC further argued that if only one application should be approved, its own\r\n  better met the project criteria.\r\nAt the contested case hearing, both SRMC and CCC changed their third\r\n  year projections from what they originally had proposed in their applications,\r\n  although the methodology used was identical.[12]Â  The projection methodology utilized was\r\n  the following:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\tCalculate the anticipated number of new cancer \r\n\t\t\tcases in the service area by applying a cancer incidence rate to the \r\n\t\t\tprojected population;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tAssume that 60 percent of the new cancer cases \r\n\t\t\twould require radiation therapy with a linear accelerator; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\tAssume that each case, i.e., patient, would receive \r\n\t\t\t25 radiation treatments.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nUsing state-specific data from the SC Registry,[13] SRMC projected that the total treatments in\r\n  2006 for the entire tri-county service area would be 22,346.[14]Â  Using Claritas data and age-adjusted\r\n  SEER data, CCC projected that the total treatments in 2006 for the entire\r\n  tri-county service area would be 27,172. \r\nAccording to SRMC, its projection of 22,346 treatments would\r\n  support its existing three linear accelerators in Spartanburg, plus the\r\n  additional new one in Cherokee; however, SRMCâ€™s projections would not support a fourth accelerator because that would require a projection of at\r\n  least 23,800 treatments.[15]\r\nCCC argued that its projection of 27,172 treatments would support\r\n  SRMCâ€™s existing three linear accelerators in Spartanburg, plus the addition of both a new SRMC accelerator in Cherokee and a new CCC accelerator in Spartanburg,\r\n  because its projection exceeded 23,800 treatments.\r\nCCC further\r\n  argued that the Claritas and age-adjusted SEER data were more appropriate data\r\n  sources for the projections because cancer incidence rises as a person ages.Â \r\n  One of CCCâ€™s witnesses, Dr. Mark Oâ€™Rourke, a medical oncologist, explained that\r\n  \"to estimate how many cancers are expected from a population, we need to know\r\n  what proportion is in the different age groups.\"Â  Because SRMC did not use\r\n  age-specific data for its projections, Dr. Oâ€™Rourke opined that those\r\n  projections were underestimated.Â  On the other hand, SRMC argued that a\r\n  historical review of SEER data compared with actual South Carolina cancer\r\n  incidence indicated that SEER overestimated cancer incidence by approximately 5\r\n  percent.\r\nIn the written ALC decision, the ALC phrased the dispositive issue\r\n  in the case as follows:\r\n\r\n\tDid the Petitioner, CCC, prove by a preponderance of the evidence\r\n  that [DHEC] erred in its determination that CCCâ€™s and SRMCâ€™s applications were\r\n  competing, so that only one additional linear accelerator was needed in the\r\n  service area composed of Cherokee, Spartanburg and Union Counties and only one\r\n  application could be approved, or is it feasible and within the guidelines\r\n  established in the statute, regulations and State Health Plan that both\r\n  facilities could be approved?\r\n\r\nIn the numerous findings of facts, the ALC specifically noted Dr.\r\n  Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s testimony and found him to be \"a very credible witness.\"Â  The ALC\r\n  further found his testimony supported the conclusion that the two CON\r\n  applications were not competing.Â  \r\nIn addition to the findings of fact and conclusions of law\r\n  sections, the ALCâ€™s written order included an \"Analysis\" section.Â  In this\r\n  section, the ALC found the two CON applications were not competing and\r\n  that both were consistent with the requirements of the State Health Plan.Â  The\r\n  following is an excerpt from the order:\r\n\r\n\tAfter reviewing the voluminous exhibits, extensive testimony, and\r\n  taking into account the totality of circumstances in the tri-county service\r\n  area in this case, I find that the two applications are not competing because\r\n  granting both Applications will not exceed the need for linear accelerator\r\n  facilities and the services which they provideâ€¦.\r\n\tThe record is replete with evidence that both the aging population\r\n  and the general class of cancer patients in the tri-county service area -\r\n  particularly those in the more rural areas - need easier access to radiation\r\n  treatments.Â  Moreover, the rapidly expanding population in the urban areas of\r\n  the tri-county region establishes the need for the additional Spartanburg\r\n  facility.\r\n\tI find that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that the\r\n  projected population growth in the service area justifies granting both [CONs],\r\n  and that the projected growth will enable both facilities to meet the\r\n  requirement of 3,600[16] treatments per year for each linear accelerator by their third\r\n  year of operation.Â  Moreover, I find that the preponderance of the evidence\r\n  supports the conclusion that each facility is financially feasible.\r\n\r\nAs\r\n  stated above, both the Board and the circuit court affirmed the ALCâ€™s order\r\n  that both CONs be issued.[17]Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tIs there substantial evidence to support the ALCâ€™s findings that the CON applications are not\r\n  competing and both CONs should be issued? (SRMCâ€™s appeal)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court, Board, and ALC err in granting SRMCâ€™s CON application? (CCCâ€™s appeal)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe ALC presides over the hearing of a contested case\r\n  from DHECâ€™s decision on a CON application and serves as the finder of fact.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-600; 44-7-210; Marlboro Park Hosp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 573, 577, 595 S.E.2d 851,\r\n  853&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nOn appeal from a contested CON case, the reviewing court \"may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of\r\n  the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\"Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-380(5).Â  Judicial review of administrative agency decisions\r\n  is therefore \"limited to a determination of whether they are supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.\"Â  Roper Hosp. v. Board of S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and\r\n    Envtl. Control, 306 S.C. 138, 140, 410 S.E.2d 558, 559&nbsp;(1991).Â  After considering\r\n  the entire record, this Court \"need only find â€¦ evidence that would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency\r\n  reached.\"Â  Grant v.

S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 379 S.C. 1, 6, 664 S.E.2d 471, 473-74&nbsp;(2008) (citing S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)). \r\nSRMCâ€™s Appeal\r\nIn its brief, SRMC argues six separate issues on\r\n  appeal related to the ALCâ€™s order.Â  Given our scope of review, however, the\r\n  determinative issue in this case is whether there is substantial evidence to\r\n  support the ALCâ€™s findings and/or whether the ALC made an error of law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5).Â  More specifically, we must decide whether the\r\n  ALCâ€™s conclusion that the two applications are not competing is legally\r\n  correct.Â  We hold it is.Â  \r\nWe note initially that the purpose of the CON Act \"is\r\n  to promote cost containment, prevent unnecessary duplication of health care\r\n  facilities and services, guide the establishment of health facilities and\r\n  services which will best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality\r\n  services are provided in health facilities in this State.\" Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-7-120(2002).\r\nAs noted above, the CON Act defines \"competing\r\n  applicants\" as two health care facilities who apply for CONs \"to provide\r\n  similar services or facilities in the same service area within a time frame as\r\n  established by departmental regulations and whose applications, if approved,\r\n    would exceed the need for services or facilities.\" Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-7-130(5) (emphasis added).Â  It is well-settled that \"[t]he construction of a\r\n  statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most\r\n  respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.\"Â  Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examiners in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353\r\n  S.E.2d 132, 133&nbsp;(1987).\r\nThe ALC found that granting both CON applications\r\n  would not exceed the need, and therefore, the applications were not competing.Â  From a factual perspective, there is abundant evidence in the\r\n  record to support this based on CCCâ€™s data projections.Â  Moreover, it is hard\r\n  to interpret the plain language of section 44-7-130(5) any other way than the\r\n  manner in which the ALC interpreted it: Â If granting both applications would\r\n  not exceed the need, then the applications are not competing and both may be\r\n  granted (provided all other relevant criteria are met). Â See Brown v.\r\n    S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410,\r\n  414&nbsp;(2002) (\"Where the terms of the statute are clear, the court must\r\n  apply those terms according to their literal meaning.\").Â  \r\nThe ALC also specifically found that both SRMC and CCC\r\n  met the relevant project criteria.Â  Again, there is an abundance of evidence to\r\n  support this finding.Â  While the ALC correctly noted that each proposed project\r\n  has its strengths and advantages, this does not mean the other completely lacks\r\n  merit.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the decision to grant both\r\n  CONs.Â  We find the evidence substantially supports the legal conclusion that\r\n  the two applications were not competing.Â Â  Moreover, based on the evidence\r\n  presented, the granting of both CONs does not violate the State Health Plan and\r\n  will further the overall purpose of the statute.Â  See Â§ 44-7-120.\r\nWe have reviewed SRMCâ€™s individual arguments raised on\r\n  appeal and find that two merit brief discussion.Â  First, SRMC argues the ALC\r\n  failed to make specific findings of fact.\r\nThis\r\n  Court has made clear that \"[t]he findings of fact of an administrative body\r\n  must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine\r\n  whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been\r\n  properly applied to those findings.\"Â  Able Communications, Inc. v. S.C. Pub.\r\n    Serv. Commâ€™n,&nbsp;290 S.C. 409, 411, 351 S.E.2d 151, 152 (1986).Â  To\r\n  simply recite conflicting testimony is insufficient.Â  Id.Â  In Able,\r\n  the Public Service Commissionâ€™s order contained no findings of fact at all and\r\n  a conclusory finding that the proposed paging service rates were reasonable.Â \r\n  The Able Court held that appellate review was\r\n  \"impossible\" because all it could do was speculate as to \"the reasons\r\n  underlying the decision.\"Â  Id.\r\nSRMC\r\n  argues the ALC failed to \"choose\" one set of data projections over another and\r\n  therefore ran afoul of the Able holding.Â  We disagree.Â  The ALCâ€™s order\r\n  was far from conclusory.Â  There are findings of fact, credibility\r\n  determinations, conclusions of law, and legal analysis in the written order. Although\r\n  SRMC correctly notes that in the findings of fact section the ALC lists both\r\n  sets of data projections, the legal analysis outlined in the ALC order\r\n  demonstrates an acceptance of CCCâ€™s predictions and specifically reflects that\r\n  the ALC took into account the aging population.Â  Only CCCâ€™s data projections\r\n  separated the data by age cohorts.Â  Therefore, we need not speculate about why\r\n  the ALC reached the decision it did because the written order makes the reasons\r\n  manifest.Â  In other words, the rule outlined in Able and its progeny has\r\n  not been breached.\r\nSRMC also argues the circuit court order must be vacated because\r\n  it included improper findings of fact and credibility determinations.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  Because the circuit court was sitting in an appellate capacity, it was\r\n  bound by the same scope of review discussed above.Â  It was error for the\r\n  circuit court to go beyond that scope and make additional findings.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm as modified and vacate\r\n  the circuit court order.Â  The Boardâ€™s decision which affirmed the ALCâ€™s ruling\r\n  to issue both CONs stands.\r\nCCCâ€™s Appeal\r\nAlthough CCC acknowledges in its brief that: (1) the\r\n  appropriate standard of review is the substantial evidence test, and (2) it\r\n  offered evidenceÂ  there was sufficient need in the tri-county area for two\r\n  linear accelerators, CCC nevertheless argues it was error to grant SRMCâ€™s CON\r\n  application.Â  However, because CCC does not challenge the ALCâ€™s ruling that the\r\n  applications are non-competing, its argument about which application is\r\n  \"better\" is irrelevant.Â  We find CCCâ€™s argument wholly meritless.Â  As discussed\r\n  at length above, the ALC order which granted both CON applications is\r\n  well supported by substantial evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe vacate the circuit courtâ€™s order but affirm\r\n  the Boardâ€™s decision which in turn affirmed the ALCâ€™s written order to grant\r\n  both CONs.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nPLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting\r\n  Justice James E.

Owners Group, 338 S.C. 92, 525 S.E.2d 863\r\n  (finding it impossible for this Court to review public service commission\r\n  orders that merely recite each party's general position on the issue and then\r\n  announce the one it chooses to follow);Â  Porter v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,\r\n  333 S.C. 12, 507 S.E.2d 328&nbsp;(1998) (reversing public service commission's\r\n  decision on the rate of return on common equity because that decision was not\r\n  adequately documented in the findings of fact).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the majority points out that the ALC's order lists both sets of data\r\n  projections in the findings of fact section.Â  However, the ALC's order never\r\n  explicitly makes a finding of fact indicating which data projections were\r\n  ultimately relied upon in making its decision.Â  The lack of explicit findings\r\n  of fact clearly does not meet the standards set forth in Able and its\r\n  progeny.Â  The only way to arrive at a finding of fact concerning data projections\r\n  is to imply that the ALC relied on CCC's data projections.Â  However, Able states that implicit findings of fact are not sufficient.Â  Able Comm'ns,\r\n    Inc., 290 S.C. at 411, 351 S.E.2d at 152.Â  Thus, it is impossible for this\r\n  Court to review the order for error because the reasons underlying the decision\r\n  are left to speculation.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court sits as a reviewing court that must determine if the ALC's\r\n  decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record. See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 1998).[18] While the circuit court attempted to salvage the ALC order, the circuit court's\r\n  determinations are also speculative at best. The circuit court should have remanded\r\n  the order so that the ALC could have fulfilled its responsibilities to the\r\n  parties.Â  It is not the circuit court's responsibility to create an acceptable\r\n  order when the ALC fails to do so.Â  See Kiawah Prop. Owners Group,\r\n  338 S.C. at 97, 525 S.E.2d at 865. \r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, because the ALC's order does not meet the standards set forth in Able and its progeny by not expressly finding facts indicating which data\r\n  projections were ultimately relied upon in making its decision, I would reverse\r\n  the circuit court's decision affirming in result the decisions of the DHEC\r\n  board and the ALC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] SRMC is a public hospital that is part of the\r\n  Spartanburg Regional Health Services District, which is a political subdivision\r\n  of South Carolina.\r\n[2] A linear accelerator is used by radiation oncologists\r\n  to provide external radiation treatments to cancer patients. Â The CON Act defines \"radiation therapy facility\" as \"a\r\n  health care facility which provides or seeks to provide mega-voltage\r\n  therapeutic services to patients through the use of high energy radiation.\" Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-130(23) (2002).\r\n[3] CCC is a private oncology practice established in\r\n  1976 with eight Upstate locations.Â  \r\n[4] SRMC described its proposal for the linear\r\n  accelerator in Cherokee County as a \"Gibbs Center satellite.\"Â  The proposed\r\n  Gaffney location is over 20 miles from the Gibbs Center in Spartanburg.Â  If\r\n  SRMCâ€™s CON was solely approved, it would retain its status as the exclusive\r\n  provider of radiation therapy in the tri-county service area of Spartanburg,\r\n  Cherokee and Union.Â  Conversely, if only CCCâ€™s application was approved, there\r\n  would be four linear accelerators in the service area, all in\r\n  Spartanburg County.Â  If both CONs got approval, the service area would go from\r\n  three to five linear accelerators.Â  \r\n[5] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-130(5) (2002) (defining\r\n  \"competing applicants\" as two health care facilities who apply for CONs \"to\r\n  provide similar services or facilities in the same service area within a time\r\n  frame as established by departmental regulations and whose applications, if\r\n  approved, would exceed the need for services or facilities\").\r\n[6] The orders in this case have been stayed and\r\n  therefore no additional linear accelerators have been added in the tri-county\r\n  service area. Â \r\n[7] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-110 et\r\n  seq. (2002).Â  \r\n[8] Thus, the aggregate 80 percent threshold for the\r\n  three linear accelerators in the\r\n  Spartanburg/Union/Cherokee service area is 16,800 (5,600 * 3).\r\n[9] DHEC originally assigned slightly different relative\r\n  importance of project criteria for the two projects at issue in the instant\r\n  case.Â  By the time of the project review meeting, however, the project criteria\r\n  and their relative importance had been aligned for both projects.\r\n[10] From May 2001 through May 2002, SRMCâ€™s three linear accelerators performed 18,278\r\n  treatments.\r\n[11] Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 202(11),\r\n  population statistics provided in the CON application must be \"consistent with\r\n  those generated by the State Demographer, State Budget and Control Board.\" Â Claritas\r\n  is a national company specializing in population and demographics data.\r\n[12] Both SRMC and CCC focused on the entire tri-county\r\n  service area at the contested case hearing.Â  In contrast, in the original CON applications,\r\n  SRMC focused its projections on only Cherokee County, while CCC focused on\r\n  Spartanburg and Union counties.Â  \r\n[13] Data from the SC Registry is based upon the actual\r\n  number of reported cancer cases in South Carolina.\r\n[14] Because the State Health Planâ€™s provides that a\r\n  linear accelerator would only be approved if the third year projections for\r\n  utilization are met, the parties focused on 2006 as the expected third year.Â  There\r\n  were indications that, due to the delays involved with litigation, 2006 would\r\n  not be the actual third year of utilization.\r\n[15] The 23,800 figure is arrived at by adding 16,800 (the minimum number of treatments needed to reach\r\n  the 80% threshold for the three existing accelerators), plus 3,500 (the minimum\r\n  number of treatments needed for SRMCâ€™s new accelerator in the third year), plus\r\n  another 3,500 (the minimum number of treatments needed for CCCâ€™s new\r\n  accelerator in the third year).\r\n[16] This is apparently a scrivenerâ€™s error and should be\r\n  3,500.\r\n[17] The circuit court affirmed in result only; in addition to affirming the ALCâ€™s\r\n  decision, the circuit court also found that CCCâ€™s application \"better\" met the\r\n  requirements of the State Health Plan than SRMCâ€™s application.\r\n[18] The procedure for reviewing decisions by the ALC under section 1-23-380 has\r\n  changed to allow for appeals to the court of appeals instead of the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See S.C.

Walpole (collectively, Respondents) challenging an\r\n  ordinance rezoning the Walpoles' property, Anchorage Plantation, from\r\n  agricultural to a Planned Development (PD) district.Â  Upon review, the circuit\r\n  court ruled the ordinance was invalid and that the property should retain its\r\n  agricultural classification.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the\r\n  rezoning to a PD was proper.Â  Sinkler v. County of Charleston, Op. No.\r\n  2008-UP-297 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 5, 2008).Â  We granted a petition for a\r\n  writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals and now\r\n  reverse.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Background of\r\n  Dispute.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of 1994\r\n  (the Enabling Act) granted local governments the authority to create planning\r\n  commissions to implement comprehensive plans governing development in their\r\n  communities.[1]Â  In 1999, Charleston\r\n  County Council enacted the County of Charleston Comprehensive Plan.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Comprehensive Plan designated Wadmalaw Island part of the Agricultural Area of\r\n  Charleston County, where the preferred land uses included farming and resource\r\n  management, along with &quot;preservation of the rural community character.&quot;Â \r\n  The Comprehensive Plan further provided that development in areas classified as\r\n  Agricultural Preservation within the Agricultural Area &quot;should primarily\r\n  support the needs of the farming industry, secondarily allowing for compatible\r\n  residential development.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  Enabling Act permits the governing body of a county to adopt zoning ordinances\r\n  to help implement a comprehensive plan.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-720 (2004 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2009).Â  Charleston County Council enacted the Charleston County Zoning\r\n  and Land Development Regulations (ZLDR) in 2001 to implement its Comprehensive\r\n  Plan.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  separately own properties on Wadmalaw Island that are adjacent to a tract of\r\n  land (roughly 750 acres) owned by the Walpoles. The Walpoles' property was used\r\n  as a tomato farm and was zoned AG-15, an Agricultural Preservation\r\n  classification.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nUnder the ZLDR, the\r\n  AG-15 classification allows a &quot;maximum density&quot; of one dwelling unit\r\n  per fifteen acres on interior land, with a &quot;minimum lot area&quot; of\r\n  three acres.Â  ZLDR Â§ 4.4.3(A).Â  For land within one thousand feet of the OCRM[2] critical line, the AG-15 zoning classification allows a maximum density of one\r\n  dwelling unit for every three acres.Â  ZLDR Â§ 4.4.3(B).Â  The configuration of\r\n  the Walpoles' land limited it to a maximum of 107 dwellings under the AG-15\r\n  zoning restrictions.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 20, 2003, the Walpoles applied to have their property rezoned to a PD district.Â \r\n  Charleston County Council adopted an ordinance rezoning the Walpoles' property\r\n  from AG-15 to a PD district on February 17, 2004.Â  Under the ordinance, the\r\n  minimum lot size was reduced to one acre, although the allowed uses remained\r\n  the same as those under the AG-15 classification.Â  The maximum number of\r\n  dwellings on the property remained unchanged at 107.Â  \r\nPetitioners brought\r\n  this declaratory judgment action in 2004, asserting the ordinance rezoning the Walpoles' property was invalid because Charleston County Council exceeded its\r\n  authority and violated provisions of the Enabling Act and the ZLDR in approving\r\n  the change.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Circuit\r\n  Court's Ruling.\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found the ordinance rezoning the Walpoles' property from AG-15 to a PD district\r\n  was invalid and that the property remained zoned AG-15.Â  The circuit court\r\n  concluded Charleston County Council exceeded its authority and violated the\r\n  provisions of both (1) the Enabling Act and (2) the ZLDR.Â  \r\n(1)Â \r\n  The Enabling Act.Â  The circuit court\r\n  first found the ordinance did not meet the essential standards for establishing\r\n  a PD as provided by sections 6-29-720 and -740 of the Enabling Act.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court stated the ordinance violated section 6-29-720, governing zoning\r\n  methods, because the proposed PD plan that was approved failed to meet the\r\n  statute's definition of a PD.Â  Section 6-29-720 defines a PD as follows:\r\n\r\n\t[A] development project comprised of housing of\r\n  different types and densities and of compatible commercial uses, or shopping\r\n  centers, office parks, and mixed-use developments.Â  A planned development\r\n  district is established by rezoning prior to development and is characterized\r\n  by a unified site design for a mixed use development[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  6-29-720(C)(4) (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court noted the development in the proposed area is residential, the\r\n  same type of development that is already authorized under its current zoning of\r\n  AG-15.Â  The court stated, &quot;Distilling the PD Ordinance to its essence, its\r\n  primary effect was simply to reduce the minimum lot size for the up-to-107\r\n  residential dwelling units.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court found the PD plan submitted to Charleston County does not call for\r\n  &quot;housing of different types and densities and of compatible commercial\r\n  uses, or shopping centers, office parks, and mixed-use developments,&quot; nor\r\n  is it &quot;characterized by a unified site design for a mixed use\r\n  development&quot; as required by section 6-29-720(C)(4).Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  had alternatively argued that County Council could implement its own zoning\r\n  districts and did not have to meet the requirements of a PD district provided\r\n  in the Enabling Act, based on the portion of section 6-29-720(C) that reads as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe zoning ordinance may utilize the following\r\n  [listing cluster developments, floating zones, performance zoning, and planned\r\n  development districts, among others] or any other zoning and planning\r\n  techniques for implementation of the goals specified above.Â  Failure to specify\r\n  a particular technique does not cause use of that technique to be viewed as\r\n  beyond the power of the local government choosing to use it[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-720(C).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court observed that, &quot;[w]hile the County is correct that the\r\n  legislature did not confine it to the categories of zoning districts listed in\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-720(C), in this instance the County actually employed one\r\n  of the enabling statute's specifically defined categories, 'planned development\r\n  district,' and specifically referred to the Enabling Act as the basis for its\r\n  authority in Â§ 3.5.1, ZLDR.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the circuit court concluded the\r\n  ordinance was intended to implement a PD as described in section 6-29-720(C)\r\n  rather than &quot;some new, alternative . . . zoning category.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court further found the ordinance violated section 6-29-740 of the Enabling\r\n  Act, entitled &quot;Planned development districts,&quot; which allows variances\r\n  from lot size, use, and density requirements contained in other ordinances and\r\n  regulations through establishment of a PD.Â  Section 6-29-740 provides in\r\n  relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tIn order to achieve the objectives of the\r\n  comprehensive plan of the locality and to allow flexibility in development that \r\n\twill result in improved design, character, and quality of new mixed use\r\n    developments and preserve natural and scenic features of open spaces, the\r\n  local governing authority may provide for the establishment of planned\r\n  development districts as amendments to a locally adopted zoning ordinance and\r\n  official zoning map.Â  The adopted planned development map is the zoning\r\n  district map for the property. The planned development provisions must\r\n    encourage innovative site planning for residential, commercial, institutional,\r\n    and industrial developments within planned development districts. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-740\r\n  (2004) (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  court found that, in comparison to the AG-15 zoning, the proposed PD plan\r\n  simply reduces the required lot size from three acres to one acre, but it\r\n  includes &quot;no elements that result in improved design, character, and\r\n  quality of a new mixed use development.&quot;Â  The court stated the proposed\r\n  plan calls for up to 107 residential dwellings, but the AG-15 zoning already\r\n  allows this residential use, so &quot;the proposed plan cannot . . . be\r\n  considered to be a 'new mixed use development.'&quot;Â  The court also noted the\r\n  proposed plan does not specifically identify any particular land as open space\r\n  or impose any requirement that the owners preserve open space; moreover, &quot;the\r\n  proposed plan does not result in more open space than AG-15 zoning, since each\r\n  would allow up to 107 single family houses.&quot;Â  \r\n(2)Â  The ZLDR. Â As an additional ground for\r\n  invalidating the ordinance, the circuit court found the ordinance violated the\r\n  ZLDR.Â  The court noted the ZLDR sections defining the AG-10 and AG-8 zoning\r\n  districts include the provision that an owner may reach maximum density only through\r\n  the PD process, citing Â§ 4.5.3(B), ZLDR (for AG-10) and Â§ 4.6.3(B), ZLDR (for\r\n  AG-8).Â  &quot;On the other hand, the ZLDR sections governing the more\r\n  restrictive AG-25 and AG-15 districts have no parallel provision allowing any\r\n  adjustment to any of the standards through a planned development district or\r\n  the 'Planned Development process.'&quot;Â  The court concluded County Council\r\n  did not intend for a property owner to be able to reduce the residential\r\n  standards of property zoned AG-15 through a PD process and that the ZLDR do not\r\n  allow the use of a PD to modify the restrictions of the AG-15 district for\r\n  residential development.Â  \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Review by the\r\n  Court of Appeals.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed, finding the Walpoles' property was properly rezoned to a PD\r\n  based on &quot;the deference provided local governing bodies and the\r\n  flexibility created through the Enabling Act.&quot;Â  Sinkler v. County of\r\n    Charleston, Op. No. 2008-UP-297 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 5, 2008), slip\r\n  op. at 2.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals found &quot;the circuit court exceeded the applicable scope of review\r\n  because a reviewing court should practice judicial restraint and not supplant\r\n  its judgment for the local governing authority's judgment.&quot;Â  Id. (citing Bob Jones Univ. v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351, 133 S.E.2d\r\n  843 (1963)).Â  In addition, citing Lenardis v. City of Greenville, 316\r\n  S.C. 471, 472, 450 S.E.2d 597, 598 (Ct. App. 1994), the Court of Appeals stated\r\n  the appellate court &quot;must leave [the disputed] decision undisturbed if the\r\n  propriety of that decision is even 'fairly debatable.'&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the Enabling Act, the Court of Appeals cited the prefatory language in\r\n  section 6-29-720(C), which states &quot;[t]he zoning ordinance may utilize the\r\n  following or any other zoning and planning techniques for implementation of the\r\n  goals specified above.Â  Failure to specify a particular technique does not\r\n    cause use of that technique to be viewed as beyond the power of the local\r\n    government choosing to use it.&quot;Â  Id. at 3 (quoting S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-720(C)) (alteration and emphasis in original).Â  The court stated &quot;Sinkler\r\n  [Petitioners] [had] argued the County Council did not avail itself of this\r\n  curative language because County Council utilized one of the definitions,&quot;\r\n  but that it &quot;need not explore Sinkler's argument as this court defers to\r\n  the County Council's judgment regarding the plan.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;In\r\n  the ordinance, the County Council found that the plan met Article 3.5 of the\r\n  ZLDR . . . .&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals also found County Council's decision was not arbitrary or\r\n  capricious, citing Bear Enterprises v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C.\r\n  137, 459 S.E.2d 883 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Id.Â  &quot;County Council reviewed\r\n  the plan for the property multiple times and the county staff recommended\r\n  rezoning the property.Â  Accordingly, County Council's decision was neither\r\n  arbitrary nor capricious.&quot;Â  Id. at 3-4.\r\nAs to the circuit court's\r\n  finding that the ordinance conflicted with the provisions of the ZLDR, the\r\n  Court of Appeals held there was no conflict and nothing to suggest that County\r\n  Council could not change an ordinance that it created.Â  Id. at 4.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals concluded that, since Petitioners had failed to show that the\r\n  enacted ordinance conflicted with state law or the ZLDR, that County Council's\r\n  decision was arbitrary and unreasonable, or that the rezoning violated\r\n  Petitioners' constitutional rights, it would not substitute its judgment for\r\n  that of County Council, and it held the circuit court erred in concluding\r\n  County Council exceeded its lawfully delegated authority.Â  Id. This\r\n  Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals.\r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioners\r\n  assert the Court of Appeals erred in (1) applying the wrong standard of review,\r\n  (2) reversing the circuit court's invalidation of the ordinance on the basis it\r\n  violates the provisions of the Enabling Act, and (3)&nbsp;reversing the circuit\r\n  court's invalidation of the ordinance on the basis it conflicts with the ZLDR.\r\nBecause\r\n  we find it dispositive, we direct our attention to Petitioners' argument that it\r\n  was error to reverse the circuit court's determination that the rezoning\r\n  ordinance was invalid because it violated the Enabling Act.\r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the circuit court ruled the ordinance did not meet the\r\n  qualifications for a PD as contained in sections 6-29-720 and -740 of the\r\n  Enabling Act.Â  The circuit court first found a PD requires &quot;housing of\r\n  different types and densities&quot; and mixed use, as expressed by section\r\n  6-29-720.Â  The court found the only change effected by the zoning ordinance in\r\n  this case was to reduce the lot sizes so as to allow the property owners to avoid\r\n  the density restriction mandated by the AG-15 category; all other factors\r\n  remained the same as the AG-15 category.Â  \r\n\r\n\tSection 6-29-720 of the Enabling Act defines a PD\r\n  as follows:\r\n\t[A] development project comprised of housing of\r\n  different types and densities and of compatible commercial uses, or\r\n  shopping centers, office parks, and mixed-use developments.Â  A planned\r\n  development district is established by rezoning prior to development and is\r\n    characterized by a unified site design for a mixed use development[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-720(C)(4) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court also found the ordinance violated section 6-29-740 of the\r\n  Enabling Act, governing &quot;Planned development districts,&quot; because it\r\n  includes &quot;no elements that result in improved design, character, and\r\n  quality of a new mixed use development&quot; as required by the statute.Â \r\n  Section 6-29-740 states in relevant part that a PD should &quot;result in\r\n  improved design, character, and quality of new mixed use developments&quot;\r\n  and, moreover:\r\n\r\n\tThe planned\r\n  development provisions must encourage innovative site planning for residential,\r\n  commercial, institutional, and industrial developments within planned\r\n  development districts.\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 6-29-740.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals found the ordinance did not violate the Enabling Act, stating it would\r\n  defer to County Council's recitation in the ordinance that it satisfied the\r\n  requirements for a PD and accord County Council the flexibility and authority contemplated\r\n  in the Enabling Act.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the circuit court properly concluded the ordinance did not meet the\r\n  parameters for a PD.Â  As found by that court, the only effect of the\r\n  ordinance in this instance was to allow the Walpoles to reduce the lot sizes\r\n  for the property, thus avoiding the restrictions mandated by AG-15 zoning.Â  The\r\n  ordinance did not provide for housing of different types and densities and\r\n  compatible commercial use, and it did not create a new mixed use development as\r\n  contemplated in the statutes of the Enabling Act.Â  The property continued to\r\n  have only residential dwellings and the ordinance did not plan for future\r\n  diversity of development.Â  As noted in the excerpt quoted from section 6-29-740\r\n  above, PD plans &quot;must encourage innovative site planning for residential,\r\n  commercial, institutional, and industrial developments within&quot; the PD\r\n  districts.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-740.\r\nAs\r\n  one treatise has observed, a PD is a zoning method that is used to create a\r\n  planned mix of residential and commercial uses for the benefit of the\r\n  community, as opposed to having only a single-use district:\r\n\r\n\tThe planned unit development, in contrast to Euclidean\r\n  zoning which divides a community into districts and explicitly mandates certain\r\n  uses, . . . is a district in which a planned mix of residential, commercial,\r\n  and even industrial uses is sanctioned subject to restrictions calculated to\r\n  achieve compatible and efficient use of the land.\r\n\r\n83 Am. Jur. 2d Zoning and\r\n  Planning Â§ 396 (2003).Â  The goal of a PD district is to have\r\n  diversification of use and to create, in essence, a self-contained, planned\r\n  community:\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to facilitating flexibility in zoning, the\r\n  planned unit development also seeks to grant diversification in the location of\r\n  structures and other site qualities.Â  Thus, the goal of planned unit\r\n  development is achieved when an entire self-contained little community is\r\n  permitted to be built within a zoning district, with the rules of density\r\n  controlling not only the relation of private dwellings to open space, but also\r\n  the relation of homes to commercial establishments such as theaters, hotels,\r\n  restaurants, and quasi-commercial uses such as schools and churches.\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 398 (footnotes omitted).\r\nThe definitions of\r\n  commentators and courts vary with the kind of planned unit development under\r\n  discussion, but the description set forth above has been cited by several\r\n  commentators.Â  See, e.g., 3 Patricia E. Salkin, American Law of\r\n    Zoning Â§ 24:8 (5th ed. 2009) (citing the description and its source, the\r\n  Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which applied this definition in Cheney v.\r\n    Village 2 at New Hope, Inc., 241 A.2d 81 (1968)).Â  Accordingly, the essence\r\n  of a PD under the Enabling Act is that the property will provide for mixed use.Â  See id. at Â§ 24:9 (&quot;Unlike Euclidian zoning which\r\n  forces land development into a preconceived pattern, planned unit development\r\n  permits the inclusion of a variety of housing types, lot sizes, and even\r\n  nonresidential uses on a single tract.&quot;); Palmer/Sixth St. Props., L.P.\r\n    v.

County of Richland, South Carolina, 379 S.C. 314, 665 S.E.2d 194 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008), in which the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part\r\n  the grant of summary judgment in favor of County as to Quail Hill, LLC's (Quail\r\n  Hill's) claims stemming from the issuance of inaccurate zoning information by\r\n  County employees.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn late 2002, Quail Hill sought to acquire a 72.5 acre\r\n  parcel of property in Richland County to develop a manufactured-home\r\n  subdivision.Â  To assist in procuring this property, Quail Hill contacted\r\n  Phillip Aylan Brown, Jr., a licensed real estate broker, and authorized him to\r\n  act as its agent.Â  In January 2003, Brown met with Carl Gosline, the Richland\r\n  County Subdivision Coordinator, to determine whether the parcel was suitable\r\n  for the development of manufactured housing.Â Â Â  According to Brown, Gosline\r\n  told him the parcel was zoned RU (rural) based on information obtained from\r\n  Gosline's computer.Â  Brown also testified the tax bill from the Tax Assessor's\r\n  office listed the parcel's zoning as RU. A zoning classification of RU allows\r\n  the property to be developed as a manufactured-home subdivision.Â  \r\nOn March 13, 2003, Quail Hill purchased the property\r\n  and then surveyed, platted, and prepared it for development.Â  In September\r\n  2003, Quail Hill filed an application with the Richland County Planning\r\n  Commission (&quot;Planning Commission&quot;) for site plan approval for the\r\n  development of the subject property as a twenty-lot, manufactured-housing\r\n  subdivision.Â  On October 6, 2003, the Richland County Development Services\r\n  Department issued a report for the Planning Commission in which it recommended\r\n  approval of Quail Hill's subdivision plan.Â  Subsequently, the Planning\r\n  Commission voted unanimously to approve Quail Hill's site plan for the\r\n  property.Â  In turn, Quail Hill began marketing and selling lots for the\r\n  subdivision.Â Â  According to Quail Hill, five lots were then sold, with\r\n  manufactured homes being installed on two of the lots.Â  \r\nIn November 2004, neighboring landowners contacted\r\n  their County Council representative and asked him to attend a meeting regarding\r\n  Quail Hill's subdivision.Â  Geonard Price, the County's Zoning Administrator,[1] accompanied the County Council member to the meeting, where the neighbors\r\n  inquired about zoning restrictions and expressed opposition to Quail Hill's\r\n  development.Â  Following this meeting, Price consulted the County's Official Zoning\r\n  Map[2] and found the subject property was zoned RS-1, a residential classification\r\n  that prohibits manufactured homes.Â  \r\nBased on the RS-1 zoning classification, County staff\r\n  informed Quail Hill on November 4, 2004, that it was prohibited from developing\r\n  manufactured housing on the property.Â  On November 17, 2004, Price issued an\r\n  order requiring Quail Hill to cease development of the subdivision except for\r\n  those uses permitted under the RS-1 zoning district.Â  \r\nFollowing this order, Quail Hill representatives met\r\n  with County staff who revealed that Gosline had erroneously advised Quail Hill\r\n  the property was zoned RU, and that records from the Planning Development\r\n  Services Division and the Tax Assessor's office differed from the Official Zoning\r\n  Map. Â According to Quail Hill, County staff advised it to apply for a zoning\r\n  map change.Â  However, after Quail Hill applied for the zoning map change, the\r\n  Planning Commission's report recommended the change be denied.Â  Ultimately,\r\n  County Council denied Quail Hill's request.Â  \r\nQuail Hill did not appeal County Council's finding,\r\n  but instead filed suit against County.Â  In its Complaint, Quail Hill requested\r\n  an injunction and asserted causes of action against County for equitable\r\n  estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, and inverse condemnation.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Quail Hill sought an order requiring County to change zoning of the subject\r\n  property from RS-1 to RU.Â Â Â  Alternatively, Quail Hill sought actual damages\r\n  and attorney's fees and costs.Â  \r\nAfter filing an Answer to Quail Hill's allegations,\r\n  County moved for summary judgment as to all causes of action.Â  In opposition to\r\n  this motion, Quail Hill introduced a printout of the website for the Richland\r\n  County Development Services Division, where Gosline worked.Â  The website stated\r\n  in part:\r\n\r\n\tSince 1997 the department has performed the planning,\r\n  zoning and land use management staff functions of county government.Â  The\r\n  department provides principal staff support to the Planning Commission, and\r\n  Board of Zoning Appeals.Â  Subdivisions, site plans, map amendments, variances,\r\n  special exceptions and sign permit applications are filed at the Development\r\n  Services Counter.Â  The Development Services counter is the key point of public\r\n  contact for the planning and zoning functions of the County.Â  It is the primary\r\n  information resource of property owners and land use professionals who often\r\n  need to know &quot;What can and can not [sic] be done with a piece of property.&quot;Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe site also contained a\r\n  section of &quot;Frequently Asked Questions.&quot; Amongst these questions was the\r\n  following:Â  &quot;How do I find out how my property is zoned?&quot;Â  The answer\r\n  states:Â  \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  request for zoning verification of any parcel within the unincorporated area of\r\n  Richland County can be obtained from:Â  Richland County Planning Development . .\r\n  . . Please include the current Tax Parcel Number, Street Address, if available,\r\n  size of tract, or any information that will assist us in locating the correct\r\n  parcel. \r\n\r\nAnother question on the site\r\n  is:Â  &quot;Who should I talk to about Zoning Issues?&quot; Â The answer lists\r\n  the Development Services Manager and the Zoning Administrator, and provides a\r\n  brief explanation that the &quot;staff can informally respond to any concerns\r\n  or requirements that must be complied with and also inform you of anything that\r\n  may impact your project.&quot; \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing on the summary\r\n  judgment motion, the circuit court judge ruled in favor of County as to all of\r\n  Quail Hill's causes of action.[3] Â In a subsequent written order, the circuit court judge explained his ruling.Â  \r\nIn terms of equitable estoppel, the judge prefaced his\r\n  discussion with the fact that the &quot;Richland County Zoning Ordinances provide\r\n  that the official zoning map of Richland County constitutes the only official\r\n  description of the location of zoning district boundaries, and that the zoning\r\n  administrator is the only representative on behalf of Richland County that can\r\n  interpret the official zoning map.&quot;Â  The judge further noted that zoning\r\n  ordinances and state law authorize County Council as the only entity that can\r\n  adopt or amend zoning designations in the County.Â  Additionally, the judge\r\n  found that neither Gosline nor the Tax Assessor's office had the authority to\r\n  interpret, alter, or amend the zoning classifications of property, and any such\r\n  act would clearly be outside the scope of their authority. \r\nAs a result, the judge concluded that &quot;equitable\r\n  estoppel cannot be applied to frustrate Richland County's attempts to enforce\r\n  its zoning ordinances.&quot;Â  The judge further found Quail Hill had the means\r\n  to acquire knowledge of the zoning designation of the property because the\r\n  Official Zoning Map and County ordinances are public record; thus, Quail Hill\r\n  could not claim to have been misled.Â  \r\nAs to Quail Hill's causes of action for negligence and\r\n  negligent misrepresentation, the trial judge found it was well settled that the\r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Act)[4] governs all tort claims against governmental entities and that the Act is the\r\n  exclusive civil remedy available in an action against a governmental entity or\r\n  its employees. Â Based on the Act, the judge concluded that a governmental\r\n  entity is liable for its torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a\r\n  private individual under like circumstances.Â  \r\nIn view of these rules, the judge concluded that\r\n  County could be liable for negligence and negligent misrepresentation in\r\n  enforcing and administering zoning &quot;only if a private person can also be\r\n  held liable for breach of that same duty under South Carolina law.&quot;Â  The\r\n  judge found the duty of care regarding zoning is a uniquely governmental\r\n  function with no analogous private counterpart.\r\nThe judge further held that sections 15-78-40 and\r\n  15-78-50(b) of the Act, by their express language, &quot;do not allow for tort\r\n  liability in this action.&quot;Â  Based on this reasoning, the judge concluded\r\n  that to allow Quail Hill to recover would hold County liable for the negligence\r\n  of its employees where a private person could not be held liable under state\r\n  law.Â  Accordingly, the judge found County's sovereign immunity had not been\r\n  waived.Â Â Â  \r\nAs an additional basis for granting summary judgment,\r\n  the judge found that County would be immune from liability under section\r\n  15-78-60(4) of the Act &quot;for any compliance, enforcement or failure to\r\n  enforce&quot; the applicable zoning ordinances.Â  Based on the language of the\r\n  statute, the judge concluded that County was entitled to absolute sovereign immunity\r\n  for its compliance or enforcement of its zoning ordinances, which included the\r\n  designations on the Official Zoning Map.Â  The judge also found County could not\r\n  be liable for failing to adopt or enforce an RU zoning classification on the\r\n  property. \r\nFinally, the judge found Quail Hill's claims for\r\n  negligence and negligent misrepresentation failed because Quail Hill &quot;with\r\n  the exercise of reasonable diligence could have acquired knowledge as to the\r\n  zoning of the subject property from the public record and cannot claim to have\r\n  been misled.&quot;Â  \r\nQuail Hill appealed the circuit court judge's order to\r\n  the Court of Appeals.Â  In a divided opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in\r\n  part[5] and reversed in part the decision of the circuit court judge.Â  Quail Hill,\r\n    LLC v. County of Richland, South Carolina, 379 S.C. 314, 665 S.E.2d 194\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nWith\r\n  respect to Quail Hill's causes of action for negligence and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, the majority of the Court of Appeals concluded that the circuit\r\n  court judge erred in granting summary judgment.Â  Id. at 323, 665 S.E.2d\r\n  at 199.Â  Although the majority acknowledged there is federal authority to\r\n  support the circuit court judge's resolution of this issue,[6] it noted that the Court of Appeals' decision relied on by the circuit court\r\n  judge had recently been reversed.[7]Â \r\n  Thus, the majority found there was no South Carolina precedent to support the\r\n  circuit court's determination that &quot;it is necessary to have a private\r\n  analogue in order for liability to exist against a governmental entity under\r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.&quot;Â  Id. at 323, 665 S.E.2d at\r\n  198.Â  The Court of Appeals declined, &quot;at this premature stage of the\r\n  litigation,&quot; to hold that Quail Hill could not pursue its claims for\r\n  negligence and negligent misrepresentation based on the provisions of the South\r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Id.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Court of Appeals viewed Quail Hill's claims for negligence and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation as arising from County's actions in mistakenly advising Quail\r\n  Hill regarding the applicable zoning restriction on the subject property, not\r\n  as emanating from the adoption or the enforcement of County's zoning\r\n  ordinances.Â  Based on this reasoning, the Court of Appeals held the circuit\r\n  court judge erred in finding section 15-78-60(4) of the Act, which grants a\r\n  municipal entity sovereign immunity for the adoption or enforcement of an\r\n  ordinance, barred Quail Hill's claims.Â  Id. at 323, 665 S.E.2d at 199. \r\nIn\r\n  terms of Quail Hill's equitable estoppel claim, the Court of Appeals found the\r\n  circuit court judge erred in granting summary judgment to County.Â  In reaching\r\n  this conclusion, the Court of Appeals cited and analyzed the three elements of\r\n  estoppel.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  the Court of Appeals addressed whether Quail Hill lacked the knowledge to\r\n  discover the correct zoning classification of the property.Â  Id. at\r\n  324-25, 665 S.E.2d at 199.Â  The Court of Appeals held the circuit court judge's\r\n  finding as to whether Price, the Zoning Administrator, was the only person who\r\n  could interpret the official zoning map &quot;ignores the clear import of the\r\n  County's website which directs the public to the Development Services Counter\r\n  as 'the primary information resource of property owners and land use\r\n  professionals'&quot; to determine &quot;'[w]hat can and can not [sic] be done\r\n  with a piece of property.'&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court also referenced the &quot;Frequently\r\n  Asked Questions&quot; portion of the website that advised the public to check\r\n  the zoning of a parcel prior to its development by consulting with the\r\n  Department of Development Services, and suggested that it is advisable to meet\r\n  with the Planning Staff to discuss any upcoming projects.Â  The court further\r\n  emphasized that nowhere on the website did it state that the Official Zoning Map\r\n  must be consulted to determine a property's correct zoning designation.Â  Id.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on this reasoning, the court concluded a genuine issue of material fact existed\r\n  as to whether Quail Hill possessed the knowledge or the means to acquire the\r\n  knowledge concerning the true zoning of this property.Â  Id. at 325, 665\r\n  S.E.2d at 199. Â The court also instructed that both parties would have the\r\n  opportunity to develop evidence on the issue of whether or not the Official Zoning\r\n  Map in Richland County is the exclusive means for acquiring zoning\r\n  information.Â  Id. at 325, 665 S.E.2d at 199-200.\r\nIn\r\n  terms of justifiable reliance, the court noted that Quail Hill purchased the\r\n  parcel, then surveyed, platted and prepared it for development based on information\r\n  conveyed by County's staff.Â  Id. at 326, 665 S.E.2d at 200.Â  In view of\r\n  this evidence, the court held a genuine issue of material fact existed as to\r\n  whether Quail Hill's reliance on the representations of County officers and\r\n  staff, acting within their proper scope of authority, was justified.Â  Id.\r\nISSUES\r\nWe\r\n  granted County's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the following\r\n  issues:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in failing to apply \r\n\t\t\tprior precedent from the Supreme Court and in concluding that the \r\n\t\t\tgovernment cannot be estopped for mistaken statements of law?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in failing to apply \r\n\t\t\tlong-standing principles in this state limiting the use of equitable \r\n\t\t\testoppel to thwart the police power where an unauthorized person \r\n\t\t\tprovides erroneous information?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment on the negligence and negligent misrepresentation causes of \r\n\t\t\taction where those claims are premised entirely on misstatements of \r\n\t\t\tlaw upon which Quail Hill had no justifiable right to rely?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in declining to rule \r\n\t\t\ton County's sovereign immunity defense based upon the application of \r\n\t\t\tsections 15-78-40 and 15-78-50(b) of the Act and also in failing to \r\n\t\t\taffirm summary judgment on the basis of sovereign immunity? \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Standard of Review\r\nRule 56(c) of the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court\r\n  may grant a motion for summary judgment &quot;if\r\n  the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP. \r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006).Â  An appellate court reviews the\r\n  granting of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP. Brockbank v. Best Capital\r\n    Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000). Â &quot;Summary\r\n  judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary\r\n  facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.&quot;\r\n  Â Id. at 378, 534 S.E.2d at 692. \r\nII.&nbsp; Equitable\r\n  Estoppel\r\nCounty\r\n  generally argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding there existed any\r\n  genuine questions of material fact with respect to Quail Hill's cause of action\r\n  for equitable estoppel.Â  In support of this argument, County raises two claims.\r\nFirst,\r\n  relying on this Court's decision in Greenville County v. Kenwood\r\n    Enterprises, Inc., 353 S.C. 157, 577 S.E.2d 428 (2003), overruled on\r\n      other grounds by Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 620\r\n  S.E.2d 76 (2005), and the Court of Appeals' decision in Morgan v. South\r\n    Carolina Budget and Control Board, 377 S.C. 313, 659 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008), County avers that administrative officers of a governmental entity\r\n  cannot estop that entity through mistaken statements of law.Â  Because the zoning\r\n  designation of a particular piece of property is established by ordinance and\r\n  governed by the Official Zoning Map, it constitutes a matter of law.Â  In turn,\r\n  a zoning designation may be changed only through legislative action by the\r\n  Richland County Council.Â  Thus, any misrepresentation by a County official is a\r\n  mistaken statement of law that cannot subject the governmental entity to\r\n  estoppel.Â  Furthermore, given Quail Hill could have consulted the Official Zoning\r\n  Map and related ordinances, but failed to do so, it cannot establish estoppel. \r\nSecondly,\r\n  County asserts equitable estoppel does not apply given the incorrect zoning\r\n  information was provided by Gosline and the Tax Assessor's Office, neither of\r\n  which were authorized to provide zoning information.Â  Because the County Zoning\r\n  Administrator was the only authorized person to provide this information,\r\n  County contends Quail Hill was not justified in its reliance on information\r\n  furnished by unauthorized staff members. Â Additionally, given Quail Hill could\r\n  have with reasonable diligence acquired the correct zoning of the property by\r\n  consulting the Official Zoning Map or contacting the Zoning Administrator, it\r\n  cannot assert estoppel against County.Â  Â Â \r\n&quot;As\r\n  a general rule, estoppel does not lie against the government to prevent the due\r\n  exercise of its police power or to thwart the application of public\r\n  policy.&quot;Â  Kenwood Enters., 353 S.C. at 171, 577 S.E.2d at 435.Â  This\r\n  Court has explained:\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n  estoppel can grow out of dealings with public officers of limited authority,\r\n  and the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot ordinarily be invoked to defeat a\r\n  municipality in the prosecution of its public affairs because of an error or\r\n  mistake of . . . one of its officers or agents . . . .\r\n\t. .\r\n  . .\r\n\tA\r\n  governmental body is not immune from the application of the doctrine of\r\n  estoppel where its officers or agents act within the proper scope of their\r\n    authority . . . The public cannot be estopped, however, by the\r\n      unauthorized or erroneous conduct or statements of its officers or\r\n      agents which have been relied on by a third party to his detriment.\r\n\r\nDeStefano v. City of\r\n  Charleston, 304 S.C. 250, 257-58, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 648, 653 (1991) (citations omitted)(emphasis added). Â Furthermore,\r\n  &quot;'administrative officers of the state cannot estop the state through\r\n  mistaken statements of law.'&quot;Â  Kenwood Enters., 353 S.C. at 172,\r\n  577 S.E.2d at 436 (quoting Kelso &amp; Irwin, P.A., v. State Ins. Fund,\r\n  997 P.2d 591, 599 (Idaho 2000)).Â  Specifically, &quot;[e]stoppel will not lie\r\n  against a government entity where a government employee gives erroneous\r\n  information in contradiction of statute.Â  Simply stated, equity follows the\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Morgan, 377 S.C. at 319, 659 S.E.2d at 267 (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nIf estoppel is\r\n  applicable against a government agency, a relying party must prove:Â  (1) lack\r\n  of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in\r\n  question, (2) justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct, and (3) a\r\n  prejudicial change in position.Â  Grant v. City of Folly Beach, 346 S.C.\r\n  74, 80, 551 S.E.2d 229, 232 (2001).Â  \r\nFor reasons that\r\n  will be discussed, we believe the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the\r\n  circuit court's grant of summary judgment to County as to Quail Hill's claim of\r\n  equitable estoppel.\r\nInitially, to estop\r\n  County from enforcing the RS-1 zoning classification would be in direct\r\n  contravention of the general rule that a governmental entity may not be\r\n  estopped by the unauthorized or erroneous conduct or statements of its officers\r\n  or agents.Â  Here, neither Gosline nor the Tax Assessor's office was authorized\r\n  to interpret or alter the zoning classification designated on the Official Zoning\r\n  Map.Â  Notably, Gosline did not work for the Zoning Administrator, and his\r\n  zoning information was &quot;fed&quot; through the Tax Assessor's office and\r\n  not that of the Zoning Administrator.Â  Pursuant to the Richland County\r\n  ordinances, the only authorized County employee was the Zoning Administrator.[8]Â \r\n  There is no evidence that Quail Hill consulted the Zoning Administrator prior\r\n  to its purchase and subsequent development of the property at issue.Â  Because\r\n  the erroneous zoning information relied on by Quail Hill was conveyed by\r\n  unauthorized individuals, the doctrine of equitable estoppel may not, as a\r\n  matter of law, be invoked against County. \r\nFurthermore, we\r\n  disagree with the Court of Appeals' finding that the statements on the Richland\r\n  County website created a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Although the website\r\n  language states that the Development Services counter is the &quot;primary information\r\n  resource of property owners and land use professionals,&quot; there is no\r\n  evidence that Quail Hill relied on these statements.Â  More importantly, the\r\n  statements cannot supersede what is authorized by the Richland County\r\n  ordinances.Â  Significantly, the website states that Planning Staff can &quot;informally respond to any concerns or requirements that must be complied with and also\r\n  inform you of anything that may impact your project.&quot;Â  (Emphasis added). Â The\r\n  site also directs interested persons to the online Richland County zoning\r\n  code.Â  \r\nA\r\n  decision to affirm the circuit court judge's grant of summary judgment to\r\n  County on this claim is consistent with our state's jurisprudence regarding the\r\n  applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel to a government entity.Â  See DeStefano, 304 S.C. at 257-58, 403 S.E.2d at 653 (finding City was not\r\n  estopped from refusing to issue building permits even though Deputy City\r\n  Engineer and Zoning Administrator made errors which led to the recording of\r\n  citizen's plat); McCrowey v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of the City of Rock\r\n    Hill, 360 S.C. 301, 306, 599 S.E.2d 617, 620 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding\r\n  doctrine of equitable estoppel was not applicable to City where Zoning Administrator\r\n  erroneously issued a certificate of zoning compliance given Zoning Administrator\r\n  &quot;did not have the authority to alter or waive the zoning ordinance in\r\n  question&quot; and &quot;equitable estoppel could not be applied to frustrate the\r\n  attempts by [City] to enforce its zoning code as written&quot;); see also Am. Legion Post 15 v. Horry County, 381 S.C. 576, 674 S.E.2d 181 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009) (concluding County was not estopped from raising statute of\r\n  limitations against non-profit corporations seeking refunds of fees where\r\n  corporations paid fees based on County employee's conduct that was in contradiction\r\n  of a statute); Morgan, 377 S.C. at 319-22, 659 S.E.2d at 267-68 (holding\r\n  Retirement Systems was not estopped from calculating the cost of plaintiff's\r\n  service credit using his current, career-high salary even though Retirement\r\n  Systems' misinformation and delays prevented plaintiff from completing his\r\n  purchase before his salary increase given eligibility to purchase service\r\n  credit is purely statutory and, thus, Retirement Systems lacked authority to\r\n  contradict the statute).Â  \r\nMore importantly,\r\n  we agree with County's argument that the RU zoning classification was a mistaken\r\n  statement of law and, thus, could not be used to estop County from enforcing it.Â  Cf. Kenwood Enters., 353 S.C. at 173, 577 S.E.2d at 436\r\n  (concluding County was not estopped from enforcing zoning ordinance where County\r\n  official's representations regarding the constitutionality of the subject\r\n  ordinance was an &quot;erroneous statement of the law&quot;); see Meyer\r\n    v. Santema, 559 N.W.2d 251, 255 (S.D. 1997) (recognizing that misrepresentations\r\n  regarding interpretation and implementation of a zoning ordinance constitute\r\n  misrepresentations of matters of law).\r\nAlternatively,\r\n  even if the doctrine of estoppel were applicable to County in the instant case,\r\n  we find Quail Hill failed to establish the requisite elements.Â  Â \r\nAdmittedly,\r\n  Quail Hill experienced a prejudicial change of position due to the erroneous\r\n  zoning information.Â  However, Quail Hill had the &quot;means of knowledge&quot;\r\n  to determine the correct zoning classification and could not justifiably rely\r\n  solely on information provided by staff members.Â  There is no evidence that Brown,\r\n  an experienced real estate broker,[9] ever examined the publicly-accessible zoning map or consulted with anyone other\r\n  than Gosline to determine the zoning classification.Â  See Grant,\r\n  346 S.C. at 82, 551 S.E.2d at 233 (holding City, which had issued erroneous\r\n  building permits, was not estopped from enforcing zoning ordinance where\r\n  building owner could have easily ascertained flood limitations on his building\r\n  by reviewing the zoning/flood ordinance); cf. Abbeville Arms v. City\r\n    of Abbeville, 273 S.C. 491, 257 S.E.2d 716 (1979) (holding City was\r\n  estopped from denying building permit on basis of corrected zoning after\r\n  discovering the zoning map had been made up defectively given developer checked\r\n  the zoning ordinance, including the Official Zoning Map, and received written\r\n  confirmation from the City Zoning Administrator).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Negligence/Negligent\r\n  Misrepresentation\r\nFor several\r\n  reasons, County contends the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the grant of\r\n  summary judgment as to Quail Hill's claims for negligence and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation. Â We agree with each of County's arguments. \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, County claims the negligence claim should be treated solely\r\n  as a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation because the crux of Quail\r\n  Hill's complaint is that County furnished erroneous information regarding the\r\n  subject property's zoning.Â  \r\nNext,\r\n  County asserts the Court of Appeals failed to address the fact that Quail Hill\r\n  did not present any evidence to support its negligent misrepresentation claim.Â \r\n  Specifically, County contends Quail Hill could not have justifiably relied on a\r\n  mistaken representation regarding the proper zoning classification.Â  County\r\n  avers that a misrepresentation as to the correct zoning status is not actionable\r\n  given the zoning of the property was a legal issue, not a factual issue, and\r\n  claims for negligent misrepresentation cannot be based on mistaken statements\r\n  of law.Â  Finally, County contends Quail Hill could have discovered the proper\r\n  zoning classification had it exercised reasonable diligence.\r\nWe\r\n  agree with County that Quail Hill's claims of negligence and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation should be treated as solely one for negligent\r\n  misrepresentation.Â  Notably, the circuit court judge and the Court of Appeals did\r\n  not address these two claims in seriatim, but instead merely ruled on the\r\n  negligent misrepresentation cause of action.Â  Although pled separately, we find\r\n  Quail Hill's claim for negligence is essentially subsumed in the negligent\r\n  misrepresentation cause of action.\r\nTo\r\n  prove a claim for the common law tort of negligent misrepresentation, Quail\r\n  Hill was required to establish the following elements:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(1) the\r\n  defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a\r\n  pecuniary interest in making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of\r\n  care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the\r\n  defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff\r\n  justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a\r\n  pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance on the representation.\r\n\r\nWest v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 134, 533 S.E.2d 334, 337Â  (Ct. App.\r\n  2000).\r\n&quot;There\r\n  is no liability for casual statements, representations as to matters of law, or\r\n  matters which plaintiff could ascertain on his own in the exercise of due\r\n  diligence.&quot;Â  AMA Mgt. Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 223, 420\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992). Â &quot;[W]hile issues of reliance are\r\n  ordinarily resolved by the finder of fact, 'there can be no reasonable reliance\r\n  on a misstatement if the plaintiff knows the truth of the matter.'&quot;Â  McLaughlin\r\n    v. Williams, 379 S.C. 451, 457-58, 665 S.E.2d 667, 671 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (quoting Gruber v. Santee Frozen Foods, Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 20, 419\r\n  S.E.2d 795, 800 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â Â  &quot;Thus, if the undisputed evidence\r\n  clearly shows the party asserting reliance has knowledge of the truth of the\r\n  matter, there is no genuine issue of material fact.&quot;Â  Id. at 458,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 671.Â  A determination of justifiable reliance involves the\r\n  evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, which includes the positions\r\n  and relations of the parties.Â  West, 341 S.C. at 134, 533 S.E.2d at 337.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of the instant case, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that\r\n  there exists a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Quail Hill's\r\n  claim for negligent misrepresentation.Â  We find this claim is controlled by the\r\n  question of whether Quail Hill could have justifiably relied on the\r\n  representations of County staff.Â  As previously stated, Quail Hill could have\r\n  reviewed the Official Zoning Map to ascertain the correct zoning classification.Â \r\n  Moreover, given the fact that Brown, as the agent of Quail Hill, was an\r\n  experienced real estate broker, it would be difficult to conclude that his\r\n  reliance solely on the statements of Gosline and the Tax Assessor's records was\r\n  reasonable. \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  there is authority to support County's contention that misrepresentations as to\r\n  matters of law are not actionable.Â  See, e.g., Meyer v.\r\n    Santema, 559 N.W.2d 251, 255 (S.D. 1997) (affirming grant of summary\r\n  judgment to City as to purchasers' cause of action for negligent misrepresentation\r\n  stemming from erroneous representations regarding zoning given the\r\n  misrepresentation involved a matter of law and &quot;county officials may not\r\n  be held liable in damages when they negligently misrepresent the legal requirements\r\n  of their zoning ordinance to members of the public who rely on that\r\n  misrepresentation&quot;).Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  view of our conclusion that Quail Hill's negligence/negligent misrepresentation\r\n  claim fails as a matter law, we need not address County's remaining argument\r\n  regarding immunity under the Tort Claims Act.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause there is no challenge to the Court of Appeals'\r\n  decision affirming the grant of summary judgment regarding Quail Hill's claim\r\n  of inverse condemnation and the validity of the County's zoning ordinances, we\r\n  affirm those portions of the opinion.Â  We reverse, however, the Court of\r\n  Appeals' decision regarding Quail Hill's claims of equitable estoppel,\r\n  negligence, and negligent misrepresentation.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART\r\n  AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justice James E.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n    37-10-107 (2002), commonly referred to as the lender statute of frauds, which\r\n    prohibits certain legal and equitable actions arising out of the loan of money where\r\n    there is no writing evidencing the parties' alleged agreement. Sea Cove\r\n  appeals, challenging the constitutionality of section 37-10-107 and its\r\n  application here.Â  We affirm.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nThe\r\n  facts, in the light most favorable to Sea Cove, are as follows.[2]Â \r\n  Sea Cove is a limited liability company formed by Robert J. Lohman and Grant P.\r\n  Evans in December 2003.Â  On or about February 17, 2006, Sea Cove entered into a\r\n  contract to purchase property at 21 Jacana Street on Hilton Head Island for\r\n  $1.45 million.Â  Sea Cove intended to replace the existing home on the property\r\n  with a beach house that it hoped to sell for over $3 million.Â  The closing date\r\n  for the purchase was set for May 17, 2006.Â  \r\nLoan Application Process\r\nIn February 2006, Sea\r\n  Cove (with Lohman and Evans acting as personal guarantors) applied for a $2.4\r\n  million, twelve-month, speculative construction loan from Harbourside to\r\n  finance the purchase of the property and the anticipated construction.Â \r\n  Harbourside was already the lender for Sea Cove on another project on Hilton\r\n  Head Island.Â  Harbourside was aware of the proposed closing date for the\r\n  property.Â  \r\nBy identical\r\n  letters dated February 24, 2006, Harbourside wrote separately to Lohman and to\r\n  Evans, advising them that they were &quot;conditionally qualified for the\r\n  mortgage loan&quot; and that &quot;[t]his prequalification will expire on May\r\n  15, 2005 [sic] and your interest rate will float until closing documents are\r\n  prepared or you contact your Loan Officer to lock your interest rate by\r\n  executing a Rate Lock Agreement.&quot;Â  \r\nHarbourside\r\n  further advised that the prequalification was subject to (1)&nbsp;receipt of all\r\n  necessary documentation verifying the information upon which the conditional\r\n  qualification was based, (2) a satisfactory appraisal, and (3)&nbsp;clear title.Â \r\n  Harbourside noted that additional information could be required before final\r\n  approval.Â  The letters were signed by Ed Brown, who identified himself as\r\n  Harbourside's president.Â  \r\nA loan processor\r\n  with Harbourside, Kristen Toho, subsequently sent Lohman a &quot;Conventional\r\n  Loan Pre-Approval Needs List&quot; on March 7, 2006, which listed specific\r\n  items that needed to be submitted or verified, such as documents verifying\r\n  income.Â  The notice included the following statement:Â  &quot;These Verification\r\n  Requirements are needed to complete the full approval process for this loan.Â \r\n  Any delays in returning the requested documents in their entirety may delay\r\n  your loan closing.&quot;Â  Lohman sent the requested information to Harbourside\r\n  the same day.Â  Â Â \r\nOn March 12, 2006,\r\n  Evans signed a one-page &quot;Application Disclosure&quot; provided by Harbourside, which informed him of an &quot;appraisal and credit report\r\n  fee&quot; and noted:Â  &quot;Any responses to the applicant's inquiries DO NOT\r\n  constitute a commitment to make a mortgage nor do they constitute guarantee of\r\n  any terms of the mortgage loan.&quot;Â  \r\nAccording to Evans,\r\n  on the day before the scheduled closing date for purchase of the property, he contacted Harbourside to determine the status of the loan and was informed that the loan\r\n  application had been denied.Â  Approximately a week later, Lohman and Evans each\r\n  received a separate &quot;Statement of Credit Denial, Termination, or\r\n  Change&quot; from Harbourside dated May 22, 2006, which stated the loan was\r\n  being denied for the following reasons:Â  (1) &quot;[i]ncome insufficient for\r\n  amount of credit requested,&quot; and (2)&nbsp;&quot;[e]xcessive obligations in\r\n  relation to income.&quot;Â  \r\nSandy\r\n  Harp, formerly the Quality Control and Loan Compliance Manager for Harbourside,\r\n  confirmed in her affidavit that the loan application was denied due to\r\n  insufficient income and unfavorable debt to income ratios; further, she stated\r\n  the loan also would have been denied based on an unsatisfactory appraisal value\r\n  for the property (consisting of the site plus construction), which was found to\r\n  be $2.5 million, some $700,000 less than Sea Cove's projected value of $3.2\r\n  million.Â  \r\nSea Cove's Complaint\r\nSea\r\n  Cove filed this action for breach of contract and promissory estoppel against\r\n  Harbourside on November 8, 2007 as a result of Harbourside's denial of the loan\r\n  application.Â  Sea Cove asserted that it had a loan agreement with Harbourside\r\n  and that it had forfeited its deposits and incurred expenses based on\r\n  assurances from Harbourside personnel that the loan had been approved.Â Â Â  \r\nHarbourside\r\n  denied the allegations and moved for summary judgment on three grounds:Â  (1)\r\n  Sea Cove's claims are barred by section 37-10-107 because there is no required\r\n  writing evidencing a promise, undertaking, accepted offer, commitment, or\r\n  agreement between the parties; (2) there is no genuine issue of material fact\r\n  supporting Sea Cove's claim of a loan commitment by Harbourside; and (3) there\r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact by which Sea Cove can establish that\r\n  Harbourside's authority to approve the loan could come from anyone or anything\r\n  other than the organization's loan committee.Â  \r\nBy order filed\r\n  October 9, 2008, the circuit court granted summary judgment to Harbourside\r\n  based solely on the first ground, finding as a matter of law that Sea Cove's\r\n  claims were barred by the provisions of section 37-10-107.Â  The circuit court\r\n  specifically stated there was no need for it to look beyond the first ground in\r\n  granting the motion.Â  Sea Cove filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment, which the circuit court denied.Â  Sea Cove appeals.\r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nRule\r\n  56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides a motion for summary\r\n  judgment shall be granted â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;An\r\n  appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&quot;Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Servs. &amp;\r\n    Rehab. Ctr., 386 S.C. 108, 114, 687 S.E.2d 29, 32 (2009) (citing Brockbank\r\n      v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000)). \r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp; Constitutionality of Section 37-10-107\r\nSea\r\n  Cove first asserts the circuit court erred in concluding section 37-10-107 is\r\n  constitutional, arguing the statute violates Article III, section 17 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution.\r\nArticle III, section\r\n  17 (entitled &quot;One subject&quot;) provides that &quot;[e]very Act or\r\n  resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject, and that\r\n  shall be expressed in the title.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. Art. III, Â§&nbsp;17.Â  The\r\n  objectives of Article III, section 17 are &quot;(1) to apprise the members of\r\n  the General Assembly of the contents of an act by reading the title; (2) to\r\n  prevent legislative 'log-rolling'; and (3) to inform the people of the State of\r\n  the matters with which the General Assembly concerns itself.&quot;Â  Am.\r\n    Petroleum Inst. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 382 S.C. 572, 576, 677\r\n  S.E.2d 16, 18&nbsp;(2009).[3]Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  mandate of the Constitution is complied with if the title states the general\r\n  subject of [the] legislation, and the provisions in the body of the act are\r\n  germane thereto as means to accomplish the objects expressed in the\r\n  title.&quot;Â  Poulnot v. Cantwell, 129 S.C. 171, 177, 123 S.E. 651, 653\r\n  (1924) (citation omitted).\r\n&quot;Article\r\n  III, Â§ 17 does not preclude the legislature from dealing with several branches\r\n  of one general subject in a single act.&quot;Â  Keyserling v. Beasley,&nbsp;322\r\n  S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.E.2d 100, 102&nbsp;(1996).Â  &quot;It is complied with if the\r\n  title of an act expresses a general subject and the body provides the means to\r\n  facilitate accomplishment of the general purpose.&quot;Â  Id. at 87, 470\r\n  S.E.2d at 102.\r\nArticle\r\n  III, section 17 is to be liberally construed so as to uphold an act if\r\n  practicable, and doubtful or close cases are to be resolved in favor of\r\n  upholding the act's validity.Â  Giannini v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp.,\r\n  378 S.C. 573, 585, 664 S.E.2d 450, 456&nbsp;(2008).Â  However, it should not be\r\n  construed so liberally as to foster the abuses that its provisions are designed\r\n  to prevent.Â  Maner v. Maner, 278 S.C. 377, 382, 296 S.E.2d 533, 536\r\n  (1982).\r\nIn this case, Sea\r\n  Cove contended section 37-10-107 violates Article III, section 17 because,\r\n  although the statute is in the Consumer Protection Code, it has no relation to\r\n  protecting consumers and is really a statute of frauds provision that protects\r\n  banks.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  37-10-107 precludes certain actions regarding loans for money where there is no\r\n  writing evidencing the alleged promise or agreement.Â  It provides in relevant\r\n  part: \r\n\r\n\t(1) No person may maintain an action for legal or equitable\r\n  relief or a defense based upon a failure to perform an alleged promise,\r\n  undertaking, accepted offer, commitment, or agreement:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) to lend or borrow money; \r\n\t\t(b) to defer or forbear in the repayment\r\n  of money; or \r\n\t\t(c) to renew, modify, amend, or cancel a\r\n  loan of money or any provision with respect to a loan of money, involving in\r\n    any such case a principal amount in excess of fifty thousand dollars, unless\r\n    the party seeking to maintain the action or defense has received a writing from\r\n    the party to be charged containing the material terms and conditions of the\r\n    promise, undertaking, accepted offer, commitment, or agreement and the party to\r\n    be charged, or its duly authorized agent, has signed the writing. \r\n\t\r\n\t(2) Failure to comply with subsection (1)\r\n  precludes an action or defense based on any of the following legal or equitable\r\n  theories:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) an implied agreement based on course\r\n  of dealing or performance or on a fiduciary relationship; \r\n\t\t(b) promissory or equitable estoppel; \r\n\t\t(c) part performance, except to the extent\r\n  that the part performance may be explained only by reference to the alleged\r\n  promise, undertaking, accepted offer, commitment, or agreement; or \r\n\t\t(d) negligent misrepresentation.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-107 (2002) (emphasis added).Â \r\n  Subsection (3) of the statute further provides for certain exclusions, stating\r\n  the statute does not apply to, among other things, personal loans and lines of\r\n  consumer credit:\r\n\r\n\t(3)Â \r\n  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) a\r\n  loan of money used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes;\r\n\t\t(b) an\r\n  agreement or change in the terms of an agreement relating to a line of consumer\r\n  credit, lender credit card, or similar arrangement;\r\n\t\t(c) an\r\n  overdraft on a demand deposit or other bank account; or\r\n\t\t(d)\r\n  promissory notes, real estate mortgages, security agreements, guaranty and\r\n  surety agreements, and letters of credit.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 37-10-107(3).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found section 37-10-107 is not constitutionally defective, explaining the\r\n  statute protects consumers seeking personal loans as well as small commercial\r\n  borrowers because they are exempted from its provisions:\r\n\r\n\tThe writing requirement of the statute applies in\r\n  situations involving larger commercial loans and subsection (3) clearly\r\n  excludes loans for personal, family or household use.Â  Subsection (1) (c) even\r\n  protects commercial borrowers of less than $50,000.00 as it protects\r\n  consumers.Â  The topic or body of this statute has a legitimate and direct\r\n  association with the title 'Consumer Protection' and the provisions are germane\r\n  to one subject.Â  Additionally, the contents comport with the liberally\r\n  construed purposes, rules of construction and underlying policies of the South\r\n  Carolina Consumer Protection Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-1-102.Â  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Sea Cove\r\n  argues the exclusion of consumer loans from the statute is not related to the\r\n  subject of consumer law and therefore the statute should not be located in the\r\n  Consumer Protection Code.Â  Sea Cove asserts the present case involves a\r\n  business and a bank so there are no consumers, and if it or other business\r\n  owners &quot;wished to apprise themselves of the legal rights or equitable\r\n  rights they were relinquishing by doing business with a bank in the state of\r\n  South Carolina, they could not look to the S.C. Code section on Banks or\r\n  Banking or the S.C. Code section on the statute of frauds.&quot; Therefore, the\r\n  statute is unconstitutional as violative of Article III, section 17.Â  \r\nIn contrast, Harbourside maintains the &quot;statute has a legitimate and direct association\r\n  with the Consumer Protection Code and the provisions are closely akin to one\r\n  subject.&quot;Â  Harbourside notes &quot;[t]he words 'consumer credit' are even\r\n  used in subsection (3) of the statute&quot; and &quot;the statute is closely\r\n  related to the subject of consumer protection in credit transactions.&quot;Â  \r\nAs noted above,\r\n  Article III, section 17 is to be liberally construed so as to uphold a\r\n  challenged provision if at all possible, and the constitutional requirement\r\n  &quot;is complied with if the title of an act expresses a general subject and\r\n  the body provides the means to facilitate accomplishment of the general\r\n  purpose.&quot;Â  Keyserling,&nbsp;322 S.C. at 87, 470 S.E.2d at 102.\r\nMoreover, &quot;Article\r\n  III, section 17 requires that an act must relate to but one subject, with\r\n  topics in the body of the act being kindred in nature and having a legitimate and natural\r\n  association with the subject of the title and that the title of an act convey\r\n  reasonable notice of the subject matter to the legislature and the public.&quot;Â  Westvaco Corp. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 321 S.C. 59, 64, 467\r\n  S.E.2d 739, 741&nbsp;(1995).\r\nSection 37-10-107\r\n  is entitled, &quot;Certain legal or equitable actions prohibited.&quot;Â  This\r\n  gives reasonable notice of the subject matter of the actâ€”the prohibition of\r\n  certain causes of action, and the text of the statute goes on to specify the\r\n  instances where a writing is required to litigate an action regarding a loan of\r\n  money.Â  Although Sea Cove raises a valid concern about the placement of the\r\n  statute in the Consumer Protection Code, we agree with the circuit court's\r\n  reasoning that the statute touches upon consumer issues and, applying a liberal\r\n  construction, it should be upheld. Â \r\nThe\r\n  statute protects consumers because it excludes from its ambit personal and\r\n  household loans, as well as small commercial borrowers with loans of less than\r\n  $50,000.Â  In addition, subsection (3) of the statute further references\r\n  &quot;consumer credit&quot; in the portion stating the statute does not apply\r\n  to &quot;an agreement or change in the terms of an agreement relating to a line\r\n  of consumer credit, lender credit card, or similar arrangement[.]&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-107(3)(b).Â  Thus, consumers are properly made aware of this\r\n  provision by its inclusion in the Consumer Protection Code.Â  \r\nMany states have\r\n  now enacted such lender liability limitation provisions, either as amendments\r\n  to their existing statutes of frauds or as a new statute barring the\r\n  enforcement of oral lending agreements in the absence of a signed writing.Â  See John L. Culhane, Jr., Lender Liability Limitation Amendments to State\r\n    Statutes of Frauds, 45 Bus. Law. 1779 (1990) (discussing the implementation\r\n  of lender statutes of frauds).Â  The language in South Carolina's statute is\r\n  based directly on the Model Lender Liability Limitation Statute prepared by the\r\n  Joint Task Force of the Committees on Consumer and Commercial Financial\r\n  Services.Â  See id. at 1792 (reviewing the provisions of the model\r\n  statute).\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina's statute, section 37-10-107, is essentially a statute of frauds.Â \r\n  Although the legislature did not choose to make this provision an amendment to\r\n  an existing statute of frauds, this so-called lender statute of frauds is\r\n  within an area, the Consumer Protection Code, that is calculated to apprise\r\n  those who are seeking loans of the effects of the writing requirement, and its\r\n  inclusion in this area is not aberrational.Â  It touches upon consumer issues as\r\n  it protects consumers seeking personal loans as well as small commercial\r\n  borrowers by exempting these classes of borrowers from having to meet the\r\n  statutory requirement.Â  Further, the title gives reasonable notice of its\r\n  contents, and any reasonable doubts as to its constitutionality should be\r\n  resolved in favor of upholding the provision.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's determination on this point and hold that Sea Cove has not clearly\r\n  established that section 37-10-107 violates Article III, section&nbsp;17.Â  See Westvaco Corp., 321 S.C. at 62-63, 467 S.E.2d at 741 (stating &quot;[a]\r\n  legislative enactment will be declared unconstitutional only when its\r\n  invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it\r\n  violates some provision of the constitution&quot;).\r\nB.&nbsp; Application of Section\r\n  37-10-107\r\nSea\r\n  Cove next asserts that, even if section 37-10-107 is deemed constitutional, the\r\n  circuit court erred in applying it here to preclude its claims.Â  Sea Cove\r\n  maintains Harbourside's February 24, 2006 letters, which advised Sea Cove's\r\n  members that they were &quot;prequalified&quot; for a loan, contain all of the\r\n  material terms of the loan agreement and they were signed by Harbourside's\r\n  president; therefore, the letters should be deemed to comply with the writing\r\n  requirement of section 37-10-107 or should, &quot;[a]t the very least,&quot; create\r\n  a jury question on this issue.\r\nHarbourside\r\n  argues that none of the documents or writings submitted to the circuit court in\r\n  this matter, including the February 24, 2006 letters, &quot;contain any\r\n  indication of a promise . . . or agreement between the parties as required by\r\n  the legislature under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-107&quot;; therefore, the circuit\r\n  court's order granting summary judgment was proper.\r\nSection\r\n  37-10-107 provides in relevant part that no person may maintain an action for\r\n  failure to perform an alleged promise or agreement to loan money in excess of\r\n  $50,000 unless the party bringing the action &quot;has received a writing from\r\n  the party to be charged containing the material terms and conditions of the\r\n  promise, undertaking, accepted offer, commitment, or agreement and the party to\r\n  be charged, or its duly authorized agent, has signed the writing.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-107(1)(c).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found Sea Cove's claims were subject to the writing requirement\r\n  of section 37-10-107 because its members sought a loan from Harbourside for an\r\n  amount in excess of $50,000.Â  The circuit court observed that, except for the\r\n  constitutionality challenge made by Sea Cove, the applicability of section 37-10-107\r\n  to the alleged agreement was not an issue before the court.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court observed that none of the documents, writings, and exhibits\r\n  submitted to the court &quot;contain any indication of a promise, undertaking,\r\n  accepted offer, commitment or agreement between the parties as contemplated by\r\n  the legislature within Â§ 37-10-107.&quot;Â  The circuit court also found that\r\n  any alleged oral assurances could not be used to alter the requirement for a writing.Â \r\n  The circuit court concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact\r\n  regarding Sea Cove's causes of action for breach of contract and promissory\r\n  estoppel, even when the evidence and its inferences were viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to Sea Cove.Â  \r\nSpecifically\r\n  as to the February 24, 2006 prequalification letter, the circuit court found\r\n  &quot;[t]he letter . . . relied upon by [Sea Cove] clearly states that [Sea\r\n  Cove] is 'conditionally qualified' for the loan and mortgage.Â  It further\r\n  provides that 'this prequalification' is 'subject to' verification and\r\n  validation of previously supplied information, along with an appraisal and site\r\n  work.Â  It also expresses that 'additional information' may be needed for final\r\n  approval.&quot;Â  (Citing letter of Brown to Evans dated February 24, 2006).Â \r\n  The circuit court noted that &quot;[t]he documents[4] clearly establish that [Sea Cove's] right to receive the loan's proceeds had\r\n  not vested&quot; and that &quot;this is not the requisite foundation as\r\n  contemplated by the legislature.&quot;Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the circuit court that the February 24, 2006 letters indicated that the\r\n  loan was not guaranteed and, further, none of the documents submitted to the\r\n  circuit court show that Sea Cove had obtained Harbourside's final approval for\r\n  the loan.Â  For example, in the February 24, 2006 letters, Harbourside\r\n  specifically stated the loan was &quot;subject to&quot; additional verification\r\n  and had not yet been finally approved:\r\n\r\n\tThis prequalification, which is based on the\r\n  information you have provided to us, is subject to receipt of all\r\n  necessary documentation to verify and validate the information upon which this\r\n  conditional qualification was based, satisfactory appraisal, and clear title.Â \r\n  There may be additional information needed for final approval, and you will be\r\n  contacted by your Loan Officer or Loan Processor.Â  \r\n\r\nWe hold Sea Cove\r\n  has not shown that the documents satisfy the writing requirement of section\r\n  37-10-107 or that they create a genuine issue of material fact in this regard.\r\nIV.&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\nAlthough\r\n  it is unfortunate for Sea Cove that its loan application was denied, it was Sea\r\n  Cove's responsibility to secure final approval for the loan before attempting\r\n  to proceed with a closing date on the property.Â  The fact that the seller or\r\n  any other party might have imposed deadlines for closing upon Sea Cove created\r\n  no legal obligation on the part of Harbourside to accelerate the time it needed\r\n  for completing the loan evaluation process.Â  Sea Cove has not shown that section 37-10-107 is unconstitutional, nor\r\n  has it presented a genuine issue of material fact that would indicate application\r\n  of the statute was inappropriate in this case.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's order granting summary judgment to Harbourside.\r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Code Ann. Â§ 37-101-107 were met for invoking judicial\r\n  involvement over the two alleged causes of action.&quot;Â  To the extent Sea\r\n  Cove's brief can be read to challenge this finding, we find no error and agree\r\n  with the circuit court that none of the documents submitted by Sea Cove satisfy\r\n  the requirement for a writing under the statute.Â  \r\n[5]Â  To the extent Sea Cove additionally asserts the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to find section 37-10-107 does not apply to an\r\n  action for breach of contract and in failing to find genuine issues of material\r\n  fact existed regarding whether an agreement to loan money was reached between\r\n  the parties and whether Harbourside's president and loan officers had the\r\n  authority to enter into a loan agreement, we find these issues are not properly\r\n  before us because they were not preserved.Â  The circuit court ruled solely on\r\n  Harbourside's first ground for summary judgment, the application of section\r\n  37-10-107 and the lack of any writings evidencing a promise or agreement to\r\n  make a loan and, having affirmed, we agree with the circuit court that its\r\n  ruling on this ground is dispositive of the matter.Â  See, e.g., Johnson\r\n    v.

Foti, Pro Se, of North Charleston.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to a confidential admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the\r\n  Agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to complete and report the required Continuing Legal Education hours for\r\n  the 2008 reporting year.Â  He was administratively suspended by the Commission\r\n  on Continuing Legal Education on April 2, 2009.Â  See Rule 419(c), SCACR.Â \r\n  On or about April 9, 2009, a CLE report was filed with the Commission on\r\n  respondentâ€™s behalf.Â  Respondent resumed the practice of law on April 14,\r\n  2009.Â  However, on April 29, 2009, respondent read an email notice from the\r\n  Commission, which had been sent some days earlier, informing him that he had\r\n  not completed the required number of CLE hours.Â  Respondent did not complete\r\n  and submit the required number of CLE hours until April 29, 2009.Â  Respondent\r\n  conducted at least twenty-two real estate closings from April 14, 2009 through\r\n  April 29, 2009, while he was administratively suspended from the practice of\r\n  law.Â  Respondent was reinstated on April 30, 2009.\r\nWe\r\n  note that in 2006 and 2008, respondent was placed on administrative suspension pursuant\r\n  to Rule 419, SCACR, for failing to comply with CLE requirements.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 5.5(a) (â€œA lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in\r\n  violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction or\r\n  assist another in doing so.â€); Rule 8.4(a)(it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); and Rule\r\n  8.4(d)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\r\n  or misrepresentation).\r\nRespondent\r\n  further admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (it\r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand. Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and\r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  Respondent shall, within thirty days of the date of this\r\n  order, pay $5.71, which represents the costs incurred by the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in the investigation\r\n  and prosecution of this matter.Â  \r\nPUBLIC\r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2010-03-22-01","description":"","date":"2010-03-22","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn re: Amendments to the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe  Office of Commission Counsel has proposed several amendments to the Rules for  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement and the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary  Enforcement.&nbsp; First, Commission Counsel  seeks amendments to Rule 14(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and Rule 14(c), RJDE,  Rule 502, SCACR, to provide a default method for service of formal charges  where an attorney or judge cannot be located.&nbsp;  Provided the lawyer or judge is served by registered or certified mail  at his or her last known address and at the address the lawyer or judge  provided to the South Carolina Bar in accordance with Rule 410(e), SCACR, if those  addresses differ, we agree this method of service is proper.&nbsp; We also remind the Bench and Bar that,  pursuant to Rule 410(e), all members are required to provide the South Carolina  Bar with any change of address within ten days of such change.\r\nSecond, Commission Counsel  seeks amendments to Rule 26(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and Rule 26(d), RJDE,  Rule 502, SCACR, to extend the time a hearing panel has to forward formal  charges to the Court from thirty to sixty days.&nbsp;  Commission Counsel states this amendment is necessary so that parties  have an opportunity to provide a hearing panel with proposed findings and/or  legal memoranda to aid the panel in making a decision.\r\nFinally, Commission Counsel  seeks an amendment to Rule 31(b)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; This amendment permits the Chair or Vice  Chair of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct to issue orders compelling suspended  or disbarred lawyers to cooperate with attorneys appointed to protect clients'  interests.&nbsp; Currently, only an  investigative panel has the power to issue such orders; however, investigative  panels only meet once per month. The failure to promptly act in some cases  could result in harm to clients.\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect; 4,  of the South Carolina Constitution, we hereby amend the South Carolina  Appellate Court Rules as set forth in the attachment to this Order.&nbsp; The amendments are effective  immediately.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.

The Judicial\r\n  Merit Selection Commission (JMSC) is&nbsp;constitutionally and statutorily\r\n  charged with evaluating the qualifications and fitness of all judicial\r\n  candidates for election and re-election. Only those candidates found qualified\r\n  by the JMSC may be submitted to and considered by the Legislature.Â  \r\nJudge Segars-Andrews (Petitioner) was elected by the General\r\n  Assembly to the family court bench in 1993.&nbsp; Petitioner has served ably\r\n  and with honor as a family court judge.Â  The South Carolina House of\r\n  Representatives honored Petitioner for her many years of volunteer service to\r\n  the Charleston County Juvenile Drug Court.Â  Since her election in 1994, Petitioner\r\n  has been re-elected for successive six-year terms in 1998 and 2004.\r\nPetitioner's\r\n  current term expires on June 30, 2010.&nbsp; She applied for re-election with\r\n  the JMSC in the normal course.&nbsp; No other individual filed for the\r\n  judgeship.&nbsp; William R. Simpson, Jr., a disgruntled family court litigant,\r\n  opposed Petitioner's re-election.&nbsp; After considering the litigant's\r\n  complaint concerning Petitioner's failure to recuse in his divorce case, a\r\n  majority of the JMSC found Petitioner unqualified, thereby foreclosing the\r\n  Legislature's consideration of her re-election bid.Â  The JMSC's\r\n  finding was based solely on its determination, in the category of &quot;ethical\r\n  fitness,&quot; that Petitioner violated Canons 2 and 2A of the Code of Judicial\r\n  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR, when she refused to recuse in a divorce action.[1]\r\nPetitioner filed\r\n  an action challenging the decision of the JMSC on multiple grounds, an action we\r\n  accepted in our original jurisdiction.&nbsp; Petitioner raises several\r\n  constitutional challenges, including separation of powers and a claim that\r\n  legislative membership on the JMSC violates the constitutional prohibition\r\n  against &quot;dual office&quot; holding.&nbsp; Respondents assert Petitioner's\r\n  action should be summarily dismissed as a nonjusticiable political question.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  The Complaint raises legal issues, which satisfy threshold\r\n  justiciability requirements.Â  Those legal challenges must be addressed and resolved.Â \r\n  It is the duty of this Court to do so, and we have carefully considered\r\n  Petitioner's legal challenges.Â  While the complaint of Petitioner raises\r\n  substantial and concerning judicial independence issues, it is our firm\r\n  judgment that the law provides her no relief.&nbsp;Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nA. The Constitutionality of the JMSC and Separation of\r\n  Powers\r\n\r\n  Article I, Â§ 8 of the South Carolina Constitution provides:\r\n  In the government of this\r\n    State, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the government shall\r\n    be forever separate and distinct from each other, and no person or persons\r\n    exercising the functions of one of said departments shall assume or discharge\r\n    the duties of any other.\r\n\r\nThe constitution vests in the Legislature the sole authority\r\n  for the election and re-election of judges, specifically supreme court\r\n  justices, court of appeals judges and circuit court judges. S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 3, 8 and 13.Â  By statute, the Legislature is similarly charged with the\r\n  election and re-election of family court judges. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-30(B)\r\n  (2008).[2]\r\nThe constitution was amended by the people of South\r\n  Carolina in 1997 to establish the JMSC.Â  The JMSC was constitutionally\r\n  established to mandate that all judgeships &quot;which are filled by election\r\n  of the General Assembly&quot; be considered by the JMSC.Â  Article V, Â§ 27 provides in\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  In addition to the\r\n    qualifications for circuit court and court of appeals judges and Supreme Court\r\n    justices contained in this article, the General Assembly by law shall establish\r\n    a Judicial Merit Selection Commission to consider the qualifications and\r\n    fitness of candidates for all judicial positions on these courts and on other\r\n    courts of this State which are filled by election of the General Assembly.Â  The\r\n    General Assembly must elect the judges and justices from among the nominees of\r\n    the commission to fill a vacancy on these courts.Â  No person may be elected to\r\n    these judicial positions unless he or she has been found qualified by the\r\n    commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Legislature\r\n  established the JMSC, providing for its membership, powers, duties, functions\r\n  and procedures.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-19-10 (2008).Â  The provision regarding\r\n  membership provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (B) Notwithstanding\r\n      any other provision of law, the Judicial Merit Selection Commission shall\r\n      consist of the following individuals:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1) five members\r\n        appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and of these\r\n        appointments:\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          (a) three\r\n          members must be serving members of the General Assembly; and\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            (b) two\r\n            members must be selected from the general public;\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        (2) three members\r\n        appointed by the ChairmanÂ  of the Senate Judiciary Committee and two members\r\n        appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and of these appointments:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          (a) three\r\n          members must be serving members of the General Assembly; and\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          (b) two\r\n          members must be selected from the general public.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Petitioner states &quot;[c]oncern\r\n  has long been expressed that having the entire power and process of selecting\r\n  judges vested in the legislature may tend to make the process too political.&quot;Â \r\n  Accordingly, Petitioner asserts the &quot;evident\r\n  purpose of the people in adopting S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 27 was to create a\r\n  requirement beyond the power of the General Assembly, in the form of an\r\n  independent body whose concurrence was a condition precedent to the General\r\n  Assembly's selection of a judge.&quot;Â  She argues the composition of the JMSC,\r\n  established by the Legislature in Section 2-19-10(B), frustrates the very\r\n  reason for its creation.\r\n  \r\n    More\r\n    specifically, Petitioner contends that the constitutional amendment precludes\r\n    the presence of legislators on the JMSC.Â  The use of the term &quot;establish&quot;\r\n    in the constitutional amendment, she asserts, means the JMSC &quot;was to be\r\n    something new, not simply a remade version of the [earlier] Joint Legislative\r\n    Committee for Judicial Screening.&quot;Â  Citing opinions of this Court defining\r\n    the term &quot;establish,&quot; Petitioner maintains the intent of the\r\n  amendment was to bring into being something that did not previously exist.Â   \r\n  \r\n    The\r\n    structure of the South Carolina Constitution provides the analytical framework\r\n    for resolving Petitioner's challenge.Â  The provisions of the state constitution\r\n    are not a grant but a limitation of legislative power, so that the Legislature\r\n    may enact any law not expressly, or by clear implication, prohibited by the\r\n    state or federal constitution. Â Moseley v. Welch, 209 S.C. 19, 39 S.E.2d 133 (1946).Â \r\n    State constitutional provisions\r\n    will not be construed to impose limitations beyond their clear meaning.Â  State\r\n      v. Broad River Power Co., 177 S.C. 240, 181 S.E. 41 (1935).Â  Moreover, when\r\n    the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, every presumption will be\r\n    made in favor of its validity.Â  A statute will not be declared unconstitutional\r\n    unless its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no doubt that it violates\r\n    some provision of the constitution.Â  Gold v. S.C. Bd. of Chiropractic Exam'rs,\r\n    271 S.C. 74, 245 S.E.2d 117 (1978).Â  A &quot;legislative act will not be\r\n    declared unconstitutional unless its repugnance to the constitution is clear\r\n    and beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;Â  Joytime Distribs. and Amusement Co. v.\r\n  State, 338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999).Â   \r\n  \r\n    The\r\n    question, then, is whether the language in article V, Â§ 27 expressly or by\r\n    clear implication precludes (as violative of separation of powers) legislative\r\n    membership on the JMSC.Â  Because the constitutional amendment contains no\r\n    express reference to legislative service on the JMSC, we are left with only the\r\n    &quot;clear implication&quot; criteria.Â  Here, Petitioner seeks to bolster her\r\n    argument by blending judicial independence concerns with the constitutional\r\n    prohibition against dual-office holding.Â  As Petitioner's excellent counsel\r\n    urged at oral argument, we should broadly construe our constitution because it\r\n    does not expressly provide for the laudable goal of judicial independence. Â This\r\n    argument is not without appeal, but it is irreconcilably at odds with the settled\r\n    principle that the provisions of the state constitution are not a grant but a\r\n    limitation of legislative power.Â  Article V, Â§ 27 simply\r\n    contains no prohibition against legislative membership on the JMSC.\r\n  \r\n    In\r\n    making this determination, we are not persuaded by Respondents' argument that\r\n    Act No. 391, 1996 S.C. Acts 2393, which added Chapter 19 to Title 2, including\r\n    Section 2-19-10(B), was ratified on the same date as the joint resolution\r\n    proposing the article V, Â§ 27 amendment to the constitution.Â  Respondents\r\n    invite us to glean the meaning of the constitutional amendment from enabling\r\n    legislation prepared prior to the vote on the constitutional amendment.Â  We\r\n    decline the invitation.Â  While\r\n    Respondents' argument may be technically correct, it is simply not realistic to\r\n    give legal weight to the fiction that the electorate is sufficiently aware of\r\n    enabling legislation at the time it votes on a constitutional amendment.Â \r\n    The Constitution belongs to the people of South Carolina, not the Legislature.Â \r\n    Our decision rests solely on the unambiguous language in article V, Â§ 27, which\r\n    contains no indication that the people intended to foreclose legislative\r\n    membership on the JMSC.\r\n  The separation of powers argument that the Legislature\r\n    is &quot;both creating and executing&quot; law must be rejected.Â  In enacting\r\n    Section 2-19-10 pursuant to the constitutional mandate of article V, Â§ 27, the\r\n    Legislature was acting within its constitutional role.\r\n  In exercising a political judgment in assessing the\r\n    fitness of a judicial candidate, the JMSC is not constitutionally foreclosed\r\n    from addressing in a political context a matter concomitantly determined by the\r\n    judicial branch.Â  To be sure, judicial independence considerations are\r\n    implicated.Â  Yet this Court may not, under the allure of separation of powers,\r\n    intervene in what is a political question.Â  As the JMSC correctly observes in\r\n    its brief, &quot;the Court is being asked to delve into the subjective decision\r\n    making process of the JMSC which is political in nature.&quot;Â  \r\n  As noted, the complainant against Petitioner appealed\r\n    the recusal issue to the court of appeals and filed a grievance with Commission\r\n    on Judicial Conduct.Â  The court of appeals affirmed Petitioner's decision not\r\n    to recuse.Â  The judicial grievance was dismissed.[3]Â  Petitioner\r\n    argues that in revisiting the recusal issue, the JMSC &quot;usurped the power\r\n    of the judicial branch by super-reviewing final legal determinations of the\r\n    judicial branch.&quot;Â  We find Petitioner's argument without merit.Â  Simply\r\n    stated, the Legislature has plenary authority over the political aspects of its\r\n    constitutional authority in the election of judges.Â  Beyond the legal /\r\n    political distinction discussed above, we add the following observations.\r\n  Petitioner's notion of &quot;super-reviewing&quot; an\r\n    action of the judicial branch would have merit but for the express\r\n    constitutional delegation of authority to the legislative branch for the\r\n    election and re-election of judges.Â  It seems to us that this point is most\r\n    easily understood by applying the converse of Petitioner's argument.Â  Assume\r\n    the court of appeals reversed Petitioner's decision not to recuse or that the\r\n    Commission on Judicial Conduct had made a finding adverse to Petitioner: would\r\n    the JMSC be bound by that determination and be required to find Petitioner\r\n    unqualified?Â  Absolutely not. \r\n  What if Mr. Simpson had decided not to appeal\r\n    Petitioner's recusal decision, due to lack of resources or otherwise?Â  In that\r\n    case, in the absence of an appellate court determination, would the JMSC be\r\n    free to consider the matter?Â  Or would Petitioner's &quot;super-reviewing&quot;\r\n    position only apply in the presence of an appellate court determination?Â  The\r\n    implications are obvious, for we cannot place limitations on the ability of the\r\n    JMSC to fully vet a judicial candidate based on the presence or absence of an\r\n    appellate court determination.Â  The same reasoning would apply with respect to\r\n    a judicial grievance complaint.Â  An individual wishing to file a complaint\r\n    against a judge is not required to choose between the Commission on Judicial\r\n    Conduct (a legal forum) and the JMSC (a political forum).Â Â  \r\n  \r\nConsider also\r\n  the case of Sloan v. Hardee, 371\r\n  S.C. 495, 640 S.E.2d 457 (2007).Â  This Court was presented with a legal challenge to appointments approved by the Legislature.Â  Because\r\n  the case presented a justiciable controversy, we reached the merits and\r\n  declared as unlawful legislative appointments beyond the term prescribed by\r\n  law.Â  Hardee illustrates the fundamental distinction between a legal\r\n  question and a political question.Â  In the separation of powers context, the\r\n  JMSC has acted in its political capacity.Â  As a result, there has been no\r\n  showing of an article I, Â§ 8 separation of powers violation concerning the JMSC.\r\n  This returns us\r\n    to Respondents' claim that Petitioner's complaint presents a nonjusticiable\r\n    political question.Â  &quot;The nonjusticiability of a political question is\r\n    primarily a function of the separation of powers.&quot;Â  S.C. Pub. Interest\r\n      Found. v. Judicial Merit Selection Comm'n, 369 S.C. 139, 142, 632 S.E.2d\r\n    277, 278 (2006) (SCPIF) (citing Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186,\r\n    (1962).Â  &quot;The fundamental characteristic of a nonjusticiable 'political\r\n    question' is that its adjudication would place a court in conflict with a\r\n    coequal branch of government.&quot;Â  SCPIF, 369 S.C. at 142-43, 632\r\n    S.E.2d at 278 (citing U.S. v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385, 393-94,\r\n    (1990)). Â Â Therefore,\r\n    the courts will not rule on questions that are exclusively or predominantly\r\n    political in nature rather than judicial.Â  SCPIF, 369 S.C. at 143, 632\r\n    S.E.2d at 278 (citing Chicago &amp; S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp.\r\n      Civil Aeronautics Bd., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948)).Â  This Court,\r\n    specifically, has declined to opine on issues where the constitution delegates\r\n    authority to the Legislature.Â  See SCPIF (holding the question of\r\n    whether the JMSC properly determined residence of judicial candidate or gave\r\n    proper weight to concerns regarding residency presented a nonjusticiable\r\n    political question the Court should decline to answer because the power to\r\n    determine if a person is qualified to hold judicial office is vested with the Legislature\r\n    by the state constitution); cf. Stone v. Leatherman, 343 S.C. 484, 541\r\n    S.E.2d 241 (2001) (holding state constitution provides Senate with authority to\r\n    judge election returns and qualifications of its members).\r\n  &quot;In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the\r\n    cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry\r\n    necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be\r\n    judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether\r\n    protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded.&quot;Â  Baker,\r\n    369 U.S. at 198. Â In determining whether a\r\n    question is political and nonjusticiable, &quot;the appropriateness under our\r\n    system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political\r\n    departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination\r\n    are dominant considerations.&quot;Â  Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433,\r\n    454-55 (1939).Â  &quot;Much confusion results from the capacity of the 'political\r\n    question' label to obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry.Â  Deciding whether a matter has in any\r\n    measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or\r\n    whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been\r\n    committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and\r\n    is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.Â \r\n    To demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that\r\n    make up the political question doctrine.&quot;Â  Baker, 369 U.S. at\r\n    210-11.Â  The political question doctrine &quot;is one of 'political questions,'\r\n    not one of 'political cases.'Â  The courts cannot reject as 'no law suit' a bona\r\n    fide controversy as to whether some action denominated 'political' exceeds\r\n    constitutional authority.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n  Indeed, this\r\n    Court is duty bound to review the actions of the Legislature when it is alleged\r\n    in a properly filed suit that such actions are unconstitutional, as the above\r\n    reference to Sloan v. Hardee illustrates.Â  While\r\n    &quot;[a]ll considerations involving the wisdom, policy, or expediency of an\r\n    act are addressed exclusively to the General Assembly[,] . . . when the\r\n    unconstitutionality of an act is clear to this court, beyond a reasonable\r\n    doubt, then it is its plain duty to say so.&quot;Â  Elliott v. Sligh, 233\r\n    S.C. 161, 103 S.E.2d 923 (1958); see Japan Whaling Ass'n v. Am. Cetacean\r\n      Soc., 478 U.S. 221 (1986) (stating the political question doctrine, which\r\n    derives from the separation of powers doctrine, excludes from judicial review\r\n    those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value\r\n    determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of state\r\n    legislatures or to the confines of the executive branch).Â  It is the duty of this Court to interpret and declare the\r\n    meaning of the constitution.Â  Abbeville County Sch. Dist. v. State, 335\r\n    S.C. 58, 515 S.E.2d 535 (1999).\r\n  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  because of Petitioner's separation of powers argument, this Court must analyze\r\n  the claim, which it has done.Â  At the end of the day, Petitioner's separation\r\n  of powers challenge presents not a legal question, but a nonjusticiable\r\n  political question.Â   \r\n  B. JMSC and Dual-Office\r\n    Holding \r\n  \r\nPetitioner's dual-office argument presents a bona\r\n  fide legal challenge.Â  Article III, Â§ 24 of the South Carolina Constitution\r\n  provides:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      No person is\r\n      eligible to a seat in the General Assembly while he holds any office or\r\n      position of profit or trust under this State, the United States of America, or\r\n      any of them, or under any other power, except officers in the militia, members\r\n      of lawfully and regularly organized fire departments, constables, and notaries\r\n      public.Â  If any member accepts or exercises any of the disqualifying offices or\r\n      positions he shall vacate his seat.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Article VI, Â§ 3 of the South Carolina\r\n    Constitution provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n      No person may hold\r\n      two offices of honor or profit at the same time.Â  This limitation does not\r\n      apply to officers in the militia, notaries public, members of lawfully and\r\n      regularly organized fire departments, constables, or delegates to a\r\n      constitutional convention.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Petitioner\r\n    asserts service on the JMSC is a constitutional office, a contention\r\n    Respondents deny.Â  A careful review of our jurisprudence compels a finding that\r\n    the JMSC is an office in the constitutional sense.\r\n  \r\n  Â &quot;One who\r\n    is charged by law with duties involving an exercise of some part of the\r\n    sovereign power, either small or great, in the performance of which the public\r\n    is concerned, and which are continuing, and not occasional or intermittent, is\r\n    a public officer.&quot;Â  Sanders v. Belue, 78 S.C. 171, 174, 58 S.E. 762, 763 (1907).Â  In\r\n    considering whether a particular position is an office in the constitutional\r\n    sense, it must be demonstrated that &quot;[t]he power of appointment comes from\r\n    the state, the authority is derived from the law, and the duties are exercised\r\n    for the benefit of the public.&quot; Willis v. Aiken County, 203 S.C. 96, 103 26 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1943).Â  &quot;The\r\n    powers conferred and the duties to be discharged with regard to a public office\r\n    must be defined, directly or impliedly, by the legislature or through legislative\r\n    authority.Â  The duties must be performed independently and without control of a\r\n    superior officer, other than the law, unless they are those of an inferior or\r\n    subordinate officer, created or authorized by the legislature and by it placed\r\n    under the general control of a superior officer of body.&quot;Â  63C Am Jur. 2d Public\r\n      Officers and Employees Â§ 5 (2009).\r\n  The JMSC asserts it exercises no part of the sovereign\r\n    and merely serves in an advisory capacity because the Legislature may reject\r\n    the candidates approved by the JMSC.Â  The JMSC misapprehends its power.Â  The\r\n    exercise of power of the sovereign by the JMSC is seen not only in its ability\r\n    to favorably submit judicial candidates to the Legislature for consideration,\r\n    but more importantly in its power to exclude candidates.Â  The\r\n    Legislature lacks any authority to consider a judicial candidate whose name is\r\n    not favorably submitted by the JMSC.Â  See S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 27\r\n    (&quot;No person may be elected to these\r\n    judicial positions unless he or she has been found qualified by the\r\n    commission.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    2-19-80(B) and (C)(1) (2008) (providing that &quot;the General Assembly â€¦ shall\r\n    not elect a person not nominated by the commission [and] [i]f the commission\r\n    does not find the incumbent justice or judge qualified for the judicial office\r\n    held and sought, his name shall not be submitted to the General Assembly for\r\n    re-election and upon expiration of his then current term of office, he shall\r\n    cease serving in that judicial position&quot;).Â  The JMSC exercises the power\r\n    of the sovereign.\r\n  There can be no serious contention that the JMSC is\r\n    not a constitutional office, for it exercises part of the sovereign and it\r\n    possesses essentially all the additional characteristics, and more, commonly\r\n    associated with an office in the constitutional sense. The features and powers of the JMSC include the authority to administer oaths; take depositions;\r\n    issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of\r\n    records; petition the circuit court in the case of &quot;contumacy;&quot; and\r\n    most importantly, absolute control over which judicial candidates will, and\r\n    will not, be submitted to the Legislature for a vote. See Â§ 2-19-80(B).\r\n  A finding of an &quot;office,&quot; for\r\n    constitutional purposes does not end the inquiry.Â  Our jurisprudence has a\r\n    narrow, yet firmly established, exception which provides that &quot;double or\r\n    dual office holding in violation of the constitution is not applicable to\r\n      those officers upon whom other duties relating to their respective offices are\r\n      placed by law.&quot; Ashmore v. Greater Greenville Sewer District,\r\n    211 S.C. 77, 92, 44 S.E.2d 88, 95 (1947) (emphasis added).Â  This exception is\r\n    commonly referred to as the &quot;ex officio&quot; or &quot;incidental duties&quot;\r\n    exception.Â  \r\n  As\r\n    applied here, service on the JMSC by members of the General Assembly is\r\n    properly characterized as incidental to their legislative duties.Â  This is so\r\n    because the Legislature is impressed by our constitution with sole\r\n    responsibility for the election and re-election of judges.Â  Conversely, service\r\n    on the JMSC by one who holds an office in the executive or judicial branch\r\n    would violate the constitutional ban on dual-office holding.Â  The &quot;ex\r\n    officio&quot; or &quot;incidental duties&quot; exception may be properly\r\n    invoked only where there is a constitutional nexus in terms of power and\r\n    responsibilities between the first office and the &quot;ex officio&quot;\r\n    office.Â  This narrow construction of the &quot;ex officio&quot; or &quot;incidental\r\n    duties&quot; exception preserves inviolate the central feature of separation of\r\n    powers in our constitution.Â  S.C. Const. art I, Â§ 8.\r\n  The case of Ashmore v. Greater Greenville Sewer\r\n    District is instructive.Â  In Ashmore, the General Assembly passed\r\n    legislation calling for the building of an &quot;Auditorium.&quot;Â  The\r\n    legislation provided for a &quot;Board of Trustees&quot; to oversee the\r\n    issuance of bonds to finance the project.Â  By law, the Board included many\r\n    persons, including &quot;the Senator and a Representative of [Greenville]\r\n    County.&quot;Â  Membership on the Board by legislators was successfully\r\n    challenged as a violation of separation of powers and dual-office holding.Â  \r\n  The Ashmore Court analyzed the constitutional\r\n    issues: \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      An enlightening discussion of the quoted\r\n      provision is found in Spartanburg County v. Miller, 135 S.C. 348, 132\r\n      S.E. 673, 677, where it was said: 'As a general\r\n      rule the Legislature of the state may not, consistently\r\n      with the constitutional requirement here involved, undertake both to pass laws\r\n      and to execute them by setting its own members to the task of discharging such\r\n      functions by virtue of their offices as legislators, would seem to be\r\n      self-evident. The principle, as we apprehend, upon the correct application of\r\n      which depends the solution of any such problem as to the exercise by the\r\n      Legislature of nonlegislative functions, is that the Legislature may properly\r\n      engage in the discharge of such functions to the extent, and to the extent\r\n      only, that their performance is reasonably incidental to the full and effective\r\n      exercise of its legislative powers.' Paraphrasing the sentence which procedes\r\n      [sic] this quotation from the opinion, it may be said that the members of the\r\n      Legislature from Greenville County were elected for the purpose of making laws,\r\n      not administering them.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The principle\r\n      stated in Spartanburg County v. Miller, supra, was applied in Bramlette v.\r\n        Stringer, 186 S.C. 134, 195 S.E. 257, and a county bond issue act was held\r\n      invalid for attempting to leave the execution of the law to the members of the\r\n      legislature from the county. The authority of that decision cannot be\r\n      consistently avoided in this. It requires similar holding of invalidity of the\r\n      challenged provisions.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The\r\n      qualifications of members of the General Assembly are carefully set out in\r\n      Article III of the constitution. Section 24 thereof forbids the holding of\r\n      other public office or position, and provides that upon the acceptance of any\r\n      such by a member he shall vacate his seat. The proposition seems to us to prove\r\n      itself, that a member cannot sit upon the board of auditorium trustees\r\n      established in the act under review and at the same time retain his membership\r\n      in the General Assembly. The language of the fundamental law is plain and\r\n      unambiguous. It admits of no doubt of its meaning.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Â Id. at 89-90, 44 S.E.2d at 94.\r\n\r\n  Service by members of\r\n  the legislative branch in an office charged with the execution of the law\r\n  violates separation of powers and dual-office holding.Â  That was the case in Ashmore.Â  Ashmore referenced the &quot;ex officio&quot; or &quot;incidental\r\n  duties&quot; exception: &quot;A common example is ex officio membership upon a\r\n  board or commission of the unit of government which the officer serves in his\r\n  official capacity, and the functions of the board or commission are related\r\n    to the duties of the office.&quot; Id. at 92, 44 S.E.2d at 95 (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n\r\n  Paraphrasing\r\n    from Spartanburg County v. Miller, as approvingly referenced in Ashmore,\r\n    members of the General Assembly may properly serve on the JMSC as such service is\r\n    reasonably incidental to the full and effective exercise of their legislative\r\n    powers.Â  Accordingly, we dismiss Petitioner's dual-office claim against the\r\n    members of the General Assembly who serve on the JMSC.\r\n  III.  \r\n\r\nJudicial Independence\r\nThe elephant\r\n  in the room is judicial independence. Â A central feature of Petitioner's\r\n  case concerns judicial independence.Â  Echoing those same concerns, amici curiae\r\n  briefs in support of Petitioner have been filed by the South Carolina Chapter\r\n  of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and the League of Women Voters\r\n  of South Carolina.Â  It is argued that the actions of the JMSC in finding\r\n  Petitioner not qualified undermine the independence of the judiciary.Â  More to\r\n  the point, we are reminded that it is a chilling threat to judicial\r\n  independence for judges to approach decision making knowing that the difficult\r\n  and sometimes unpopular decisions they must make will be resurrected&nbsp;in\r\n  the re-election process through a political lens.\r\n\r\n  All but three states impose some sort of re-election process, from public elections, to retention\r\n    elections, to reappointment by the executive or the legislature.Â  &quot;Thus,\r\n    in 47 states, incumbent judges know that their ability to keep their jobs\r\n    depends on gaining the approval of others. This is hardly a scheme calculated\r\n    to ensure that judges will apply the law. Reappointments and reelections are\r\n    instituted precisely so that the incumbent judges do not stray too far from the\r\n    preferences of the reappointing authorities. From an independence perspective,\r\n    it makes no difference whether the re-selection is done by popular election or\r\n    reappointment; in both cases judges are made answerable--accountable--for their\r\n    decisions to an institution that is concerned with political results far more\r\n    than with legal principle.&quot; Michael R.

Pol'y 451 (2008).\r\n  Judicial independence is not for the protection of\r\n    judges, although it is often thought of in that context today.Â  The principle\r\n    of judicial independence is designed to protect our system of justice and the\r\n    rule of law, and thus maintain public trust and confidence in the courts.Â  With\r\n    judicial independence, the winners are everyone.Â Â Â  \r\n  We acknowledge the importance of judicial independence\r\n    and our ethical mandate to uphold the integrity and independence of the\r\n    judiciary.Â  Indeed, this Court emphasized\r\n    the cornerstone importance of judicial independence as support for its decision\r\n    in Grimball v Beattie, 174\r\n    S.C. 422, 177 S.E. 668 (1934).Â  In the\r\n    depression years of the 1930s, the Legislature sought to allocate scarce\r\n    revenues by reducing judicial salaries.Â  Because the constitution provided that\r\n    a judge's &quot;compensation â€¦ shall not be diminished during the term [of office],&quot;[4] Grimball, a\r\n    circuit judge, filed an action to declare the offending legislation\r\n    unconstitutional and to recover the unpaid balance of his compensation.\r\n  This\r\n    Court declared unconstitutional the legislative effort to reduce judicial pay.Â \r\n    After reviewing the applicable constitutional provisions, the Court\r\n    acknowledged the judicial independence concerns and found &quot;convincing&quot;\r\n    the following language from the Oklahoma Supreme Court:\r\n  \r\n    If it be assumed that the\r\n      only reason for the placing of this provision in our Constitution was to make\r\n      secure to the public officials of this state the receipt of the salary fixed at\r\n      the time of their election, then the suggestion of the withholding of the writ\r\n      by this court would be entitled to the serious consideration of this court, but\r\n      this assumption overlooks the history of the reasons for the insertion of this\r\n      and similar provisions in the constitutions of practically all of the states\r\n      and the Constitution of the United States.Â  As applied to the judicial\r\n      department, the history of such provisions shows clearly that they were\r\n      inserted in the various constitutions for the purpose of making absolutely\r\n      independent the judicial branch of the government, â€¦ the evident purpose\r\n      expressed in each is the continuation of separate and independent branches of\r\n      government.\r\n  \r\nId. at 438, 177 S.E. at 675 (citing Riley v. Carter,\r\n    25 P.2d 666 (1933))\r\n  Grimball further quoted approvingly from a letter by former United States Supreme\r\n    Court Chief Justice Taney to the Secretary of the Treasury:\r\n  \r\n    The Judiciary is one of\r\n      the three great departments of the government, created and established by the\r\n      Constitution.Â  Its duties and powers are specifically set forth, and are of a\r\n      character that requires it to be perfectly independent of the two other\r\n      departments, and in order to place it beyond the reach and above even the\r\n      suspicion of any such influence, the power to reduce their compensation is\r\n      expressly withheld from Congress, and excepted from their powers of\r\n      legislation.\r\n  \r\nId. at 441, 177 S.E. at 676.\r\n  The\r\n    Court concluded by &quot;quot[ing] the all-important language of the\r\n    Declaration of Independence of the United States, wherein great citizens of\r\n    South Carolina joined in declaring 'he, (the King) has made judges dependent on\r\n    his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of\r\n    their salaries.' &quot;Â  Id.\r\n  Judicial\r\n    independence served as an important adjunct to the Grimball decision.Â \r\n    Yet the legal basis for the Court's ruling was the constitutional provision\r\n    requiring that a judge's compensation not be diminished during his term of\r\n    office.Â  There is no such legal foundation to Petitioner's claim.\r\n   We\r\n    are left with Petitioner's stand-alone judicial independence claim.Â \r\n    Notwithstanding the undeniable significance of judicial independence, a judge's\r\n    ethical duty to uphold judicial\r\n    independence is not a grant of judicial\r\n    power.Â  We may not under some thinly veiled guise of law assert judicial power\r\n    to an action taken by another branch that lies within its exclusive constitutional\r\n    authority.Â  The South Carolina Constitution expressly vests in the JMSC the\r\n    sole determination of a judicial candidate's qualifications, and the General\r\n    Assembly is constitutionally charged with the election and re-election of\r\n    judges found qualified by the JMSC.Â  Absent an unconstitutional exercise of\r\n    those powers, the Court may not intervene in these political determinations.Â \r\n    To judicially intervene in the purely political determination of the JMSC would\r\n    itself violate separation of powers.\r\n  COMPLAINT\r\n    DISMISSED.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., BEATTY,\r\n    KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The court\r\n  of appeals affirmed Petitioner's denial of the plaintiff's motion for recusal\r\n  in the divorce action.Â  Simpson v. Simpson, 377 S.C. 519, 660 S.E.2d 274\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008).Â  The plaintiff also filed a complaint against Petitioner with\r\n  the Commission on Judicial Conduct, alleging Petitioner had acted unethically.Â \r\n  The Commission on Judicial Conduct dismissed the complaint, finding there was\r\n  no evidence Petitioner had violated any ethical rules.Â  The same allegations that were before the Commission\r\n  on Judicial Conduct formed the basis for the JMSC's finding that Petitioner was\r\n  unqualified.Â  The\r\n  JMSC's finding with regard to Petitioner's ethical fitness states the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  The Commission's investigation revealed evidence\r\n    that [Petitioner]'s conduct caused an appearance of impropriety that led a litigant\r\n    not only to question [Petitioner]'s ability to render a fair and impartial\r\n    decision, but also to lose faith in the integrity of this state's judicial\r\n    system.\r\n  . . .\r\n  It is the Commission's finding that [Petitioner]\r\n    demonstrated an understanding of how the Canons of Judicial Conduct have been\r\n    interpreted; however, in abruptly reversing her decision about recusal, based\r\n    upon a submission from opposing counsel who had a financial and continuing\r\n    relationship with her husband's law firm, she raised suspicions about her\r\n    impartiality that were compounded by connections between opposing counsel and\r\n    her husband's law firm and by her service on the board of the Office of\r\n    Judicial Conduct.Â  At the Family Court hearing on April 14, 2006, where she\r\n    revealed the six-figure financial connection between her husband's law firm and\r\n    opposing counsel, [Petitioner] vehemently insisted that she could not set the\r\n    situation right for [plaintiff] and that her only alternative was to let him\r\n    have a new trial.Â  When she failed to provide him with that alternative and\r\n    gave only a perfunctory explanation that she was relying on opposing counsel's\r\n    submission, she created an atmosphere of distrust that made [plaintiff]\r\n    construe both her ruling and the system that authorized and sanctioned it as\r\n    corruptible and capable of manipulation by persons with connections to a judge\r\n    or a judge's spouse.\r\n  For this reason, the Commission must find [Petitioner]\r\n    unqualified.\r\n\r\n[2] The\r\n  Legislature is also charged statutorily with the election and re-election of administrative\r\n  law judges.\r\n[3] Petitioner\r\n  relies on Rule 20 of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502,\r\n  SCACR, which states the following: &quot;If a complaint has been dismissed, the\r\n  allegations made in that complaint shall not be used for any purpose unless the\r\n  complaint is re-opened by the Commission.&quot;Â  Petitioner argues Rule 20 was\r\n  promulgated by this Court pursuant to article V, Â§ 4 of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution and is binding on all state officials, including judges,\r\n  legislators and the JMSC.Â  Petitioner contends the JMSC violated Rule 20 when\r\n  it took up the identical complaint previously dismissed by the Commission on\r\n  Judicial Conduct and decided for itself that Petitioner had violated the Code\r\n  of Judicial Conduct.Â  Petitioner is correct as to the preclusive effect of a\r\n  dismissal by the Commission on Judicial Conduct in a subsequent judicial\r\n  proceeding.Â  The JMSC is a political proceeding.Â  We further observe the\r\n  Commission on Judicial Conduct did not &quot;re-open&quot; the complaint; Petitioner\r\n  signed a waiver authorizing the JMSC to have access to Commission on Judicial\r\n  Conduct records.Â  And finally, the JMSC was not responding to a Commission on\r\n  Judicial Conduct finding, but to a direct complaint filed by Simpson in the\r\n  JMSC.Â  The JMSC had the authority to consider Simpson's complaint,\r\n  notwithstanding the Commission on Judicial Conduct's prior consideration of the\r\n  same complaint.Â  \r\n[4] S.C.

Cromartie resigned his District\r\n  2 City Council seat on March 9, 2010.Â  The next day, City adopted a resolution\r\n  requiring an election to be held on April 6, 2010, the same date as the general\r\n  municipal election in Columbia,[1] to fill Cromartie's unexpired term.Â  The resolution stated a notice of election\r\n  must be published in The State Newspaper on or before March 14, 2010,\r\n  and that the filing period for a person to file as a candidate would run from\r\n  March 15th to March 19th.Â  \r\nThe notice of election, which was published on March 14th,\r\n  announced a general election for the City to be held on April 6.Â  The notice\r\n  stated the offices up for election were: (1) Mayor for term ending 2014; (2)\r\n  Council Member for District 1 for term ending 2014; (3) Council Member for District\r\n  4 for term ending 2014; (4) Council Member for at-large seat for term ending\r\n  2014; and (5) Council Member for District 2 for term ending in 2012.Â  The\r\n  notice provided that people desiring to vote must have registered with the\r\n  County Board of Voter Registration by March 5, 2010. \r\nPaul\r\n  Denman, a resident of District 2, filed a complaint in the circuit court on\r\n  March 15th, arguing the action to hold the election to fill the\r\n  District 2 seat was ultra vires.Â  Denman sought an injunction to prevent\r\n  City from conducting a special election on April 6th to fill the\r\n  seat.Â  Denman maintained he contemplated running for the seat to fill the\r\n  unexpired term, but declined to do so because of the short time period between\r\n  the announcement of the election and April 6th.Â  \r\nAppellant,\r\n  who on March 16th filed his own complaint for an injunction, in\r\n  which he maintained the election must be held on April 6th,\r\n  sought to intervene in the instant action.Â  \r\n In the\r\n  meantime, South Carolina House Representative James E. Smith sought an opinion\r\n  from the Office of the Attorney General concerning the proper date for the\r\n  election.Â  On March 16th, the Attorney General issued an opinion in\r\n  which he concluded it was permissible for City to hold the election to fill\r\n  Cromartie's seat on April 6th, but that some constitutional\r\n  questions as to the adequacy of notice existed.Â  The Attorney General opined\r\n  that any determination of constitutionality should be addressed by a court as\r\n  quickly as possible.Â  Based on this opinion, it appears, City elected to\r\n  proceed with the election. \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court heard this matter on March 18th.Â  The next day, the\r\n  court issued an order granting appellant's motion to intervene.Â  Later that same\r\n  day, the court granted an injunction in favor of Denman and ruled City could\r\n  not hold the election to fill the vacant seat on April 6th, and the\r\n  earliest date such election could occur is June 15, 2010.Â  Appellant filed a\r\n  notice of appeal and moved to expedite case.Â  The Court granted the motion to\r\n  expedite.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the\r\n  circuit court err in granting an injunction and finding that City may not hold\r\n  a special election to fill the District 2 seat the same day as the general\r\n  election?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe legislature permits a municipality to hold its elections,\r\n  primary or otherwise, whenever it wishes.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-50 (2004); Willis\r\n    v. Wukela, 379 S.C 126, 665 S.E.2d 171 (2008).Â  City has chosen to hold its\r\n  general elections on the first Tuesday in April, rather than the first Tuesday\r\n  following the first Monday in November.Â  Columbia,\r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 6-6(a) (1998).Â  The\r\n  mayor and city council members are elected for terms of four years, and the\r\n  terms for those offices are staggered, meaning one-half of the membership of\r\n  the city council is elected every two years.Â  Columbia,\r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 6-1(a) and (b) (1998).Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the heart of the instant dispute are three statutes.Â  The first\r\n  statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-200 (2004) governs the grounds for forfeiture of\r\n  office of mayor or council member, and the method to fill vacancies in those\r\n  offices.Â  Section 5-7-200(b) provides, &quot;[a] vacancy in the office of mayor\r\n  or council shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at\r\n    the next regular election or at a special election if the vacancy occurs\r\n  one hundred eighty days or more prior to the next general election.&quot;Â \r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, Cromartie resigned less than 180 days before April 6, 2010, the\r\n  date of the next general election.Â  Therefore, Â§ 5-7-200(b) appears to require\r\n  that an election to elect a council member to replace Cromartie and fill his\r\n  unexpired term take place on April 6th, provided the term\r\n  &quot;regular election&quot; means the general election scheduled for the first\r\n  Tuesday in April.[2]Â \r\n  Otherwise, the position must be filled by a special election, though the\r\n  section does not specify precisely when such special election must occur.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  second statute, Â§ 5-15-50 provides, &quot;[e]ach municipal governing body may\r\n  by ordinance establish municipal ward lines and the time for general and\r\n    special elections within the municipality.Â  Public notice of the\r\n      elections shall be given at least sixty days prior to such elections.&quot;Â \r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  third statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-35 (2009), which is titled &quot;Notice of\r\n  general, municipal, special, and primary elections,&quot; provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  The authority charged by law with conducting an election must\r\n    publish two notices of general, municipal, special, and primary elections held in the county in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or\r\n    municipality, as appropriate.Â  . . .Â  The first notice must appear not later\r\n      than sixty days before the election and the second notice must appear not\r\n    later than two weeks after the first notice.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Both of these general election statutes seem to require that, since\r\n  Cromartie resigned on March 9th, sixty days notice is required prior\r\n  to an election to fill the vacant seat.[3]\r\nIn\r\n  granting the injunction, the circuit court found notice of the District 2\r\n  election was not published until March 14, 2010, twenty-three days prior to the\r\n  general election date.Â  He also found the period to campaign after the close of\r\n  candidate filing was only eighteen days.\r\nAs to the issue of statutory conflict, the circuit court found\r\n  that, where statutes cannot be read in harmony, the court must focus on\r\n  constitutional policy considerations to resolve the dispute, and such focus\r\n  necessarily involves an inquiry into the nature of an election.Â  The court noted\r\n  the United States Supreme Court has held voting is of the most fundamental\r\n  significance under our constitutional structure, and that full and effective\r\n  participation in the political process means a citizen can choose to become a\r\n  candidate or participate as a voter.Â  \r\nConcerning the District 2 vacancy, the circuit court found\r\n  Cromartie resigned unexpectedly after holding his position for more than\r\n  twenty-five years.Â  As a result of City's decision to hold the District 2\r\n  election on April 6th, it found citizens of District 2 only had\r\n  approximately nine-and-a-half days to decide whether to file the documents\r\n  necessary to effectuate a candidacy.Â  The court found this time period was\r\n  short for possible candidates, but that it had a much more profound effect on\r\n  citizens of District 2 because voter registration books close thirty days prior\r\n  to an election.[4]Â \r\n  The court also found that, unless a District 2 resident was already registered\r\n  to vote prior to the surprise resignation of Cromartie, whose seat was not set\r\n  to expire until 2012, that voter could not vote in the April 6th election.\r\nThe circuit court also found registered voters who wish to vote,\r\n  but are unavailable or unable to get to the ballot box, may be deprived of the\r\n  opportunity to vote.Â  The circuit court appeared to rule that absentee ballots,\r\n  if made available only days before the election to voters who are in the\r\n  military, overseas, or who are students, could disenfranchise voters. \r\nI. Statutory Construction\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting the injunction because Â§ 5-7-200(b)\r\n  is the more specific statute in that it deals precisely and exclusively with\r\n  elections to fill vacancies in municipal offices, while Â§Â§ 5-15-50 and 7-13-35\r\n  deal generally with notice of elections.Â  Based on our rules of statutory\r\n  interpretation, we agree. \r\nThe\r\n  primary purpose in interpreting statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the legislature.Â  Cain v. Nationwide Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co.,\r\n  378 S.C. 25, 29, 661 S.E.2d 349, 351 (2008).Â  Under the plain meaning rule, it\r\n  is not the Court's place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous\r\n  statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n  (2000).Â  &quot;It is well settled that statutes dealing with the same subject\r\n  matter are in pari materia and must be construed together, if possible,\r\n  to produce a single, harmonious result.&quot;Â  Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas,\r\n  342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).Â  However, where two statutes are\r\n  in conflict, the more recent and specific statute should prevail so as to\r\n  repeal the earlier, general statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, id. at\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d at 581; Stone v. City of Orangeburg, 313 S.C. 533, 535,\r\n  443 S.E.2d 544, 545 (1994).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  &quot;[w]here\r\n  there is one statute addressing an issue in general terms and another statute\r\n  dealing with the identical issue in a more specific and definite manner, the\r\n  more specific statute will be considered an exception to, or a qualifier of,\r\n  the general statute and given such effect.&quot;Â  Spectre, LLC v. S.C. Dept.\r\n    of Health and Envtl. Control, __ S.C. __, 688 S.E.2d 844, 853 (2010).Â \r\n  Specific statutes are not to be considered repealed by a later general statute\r\n  unless there is a direct reference to the earlier statute or the intent of the\r\n  legislature to do so is explicitly implied.Â  Atlas Food Systems and Serv.,\r\n    Inc. v. Crane National Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556,\r\n  558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995); City of Rock Hill, v. S.C. Dept. of Health\r\n    and Envtl. Control, 302 S.C. 161, 167, 394 S.E.2d 327, 331 (1990); Sharpe\r\n      v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Health, 281 S.C. 242, 245, 315 S.E.2d 112, 113\r\n  (1984).Â  &quot;Repeal by implication is disfavored, and is found only when two\r\n  statutes are incapable of any reasonable reconcilement.&quot;Â  Capco of\r\n    Summerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Const. Co., Inc., 368 S.C. 137, 141-42, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 38, 41 (2006).Â Â  \r\nWe hold\r\n  Â§ 5-7-200(b) is the more specific statute and Â§Â§ 5-15-50 and 7-13-35 are\r\n  general statutes.Â  The plain language of Â§ 5-7-200(b) requires that a vacancy\r\n  in a municipal office shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term\r\n  at the next regular election if the vacancy occurs less than 180 days prior the\r\n  next general election.Â  In the instant case, Cromartie resigned less than 180\r\n  days prior to the April 6th election, which is the precise scenario\r\n  envisioned by the legislature when it adopted Â§ 5-7-200(b).Â  Sections 5-15-50\r\n  and 7-13-35 are more general in nature.Â  \r\n While\r\n  we acknowledge Â§ 7-13-35 has a somewhat tortured procedural history concerning\r\n  whether it applies to municipal elections, we believe this statute is general as\r\n  to notice of all elections, and it cannot prevail over a specific statutory\r\n  provision concerning the timing for elections to fill vacancies.Â  The legislative\r\n  history of Â§ 7-13-35, while interesting, does not evidence a specific intent\r\n  to repeal any portion of Â§ 5-7-200.Â  As such, we are constrained by the rules\r\n  of statutory construction that a statute of specific nature is not to be\r\n  considered as repealed in whole or in part by a later general statute, unless\r\n  there is a direct reference to the former or the intent of the legislature to\r\n  repeal is explicitly implied therein.Â  Spartanburg County Dept. of Soc.\r\n    Serv's v. Little, 309 S.C. 122, 125, 420 S.E.2d 499, 501 (1992).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  while the circuit court found the issue of sufficient notice essentially\r\n  controlled which statute applied, that finding was in error.Â  First, although Denman\r\n  argues permitting an election without sixty days notice creates an absurd\r\n  result, we are not faced with an absurd result in the instant case.Â  See e.g. Lancaster\r\n    County Bar Assoc. v. S.C. Comm. on Indigent Defense, 380 S.C. 219, 670 S.E.2d 371 (2008) (holding the Court should avoid construing a statute so as to lead to an\r\n  absurd result, and it will reject an interpretation which leads to an absurd\r\n  result that could not have been intended by the legislature).Â  Here, the rules of statutory construction\r\n  provide that the specific statute must prevail over a general statute.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  while Denman has raised the issue of an election with substantially less notice\r\n  than the one at issue in the present case,[5] such a situation is not before the Court. \r\nAdditionally, while Â§Â§ 5-15-50 and 7-13-35 require sixty days notice of elections\r\n  generally, a number of statutes permit elections with less notice.Â  For\r\n  example, special elections relating to a change in the form of government,\r\n  arguably a very significant decision for voters, require only three weeks\r\n  notice pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-5-50 (2004).Â  As noted by appellant,\r\n  other issues such as bond referenda often call for shorter periods of time than\r\n  the sixty days notice at issue in the instant matter.Â  Yonce v. Lybrand,\r\n  254 S.C. 14, 173 S.E.2d 148 (1970) (noting a vote on a bond referendum required\r\n  fifteen days notice to the public); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  4-11-265(D)(1) (1986) (requiring not less than five nor more than fifteen days\r\n  notice of a referendum involving the budgetary powers and election of the\r\n  governing bodies of special purpose districts).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nII. Injunction\r\nAppellant\r\n  also argues the judge erred in enjoining City from conducting the election on\r\n  April 6th.Â  We hold that Denman has failed to satisfy his burden of\r\n  showing he was entitled to an injunction.Â  \r\nActions\r\n  for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.Â  See Grosshuesch v.\r\n    Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834 (2005).Â  In equitable actions, an\r\n  appellate court may review the record and make findings of fact in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id. at 4, 623\r\n  S.E.2d at 834.Â  To obtain an injunction, a party must demonstrate irreparable\r\n  harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and the absence of an adequate\r\n  remedy at law.Â  Id. at 4, 623 S.E.2d at 834; Sanford v. S.C. State\r\n    Ethics Com'n, 385 S.C. 483, 496, 685 S.E.2d 600, 607 (2009).Â  &quot;An\r\n  injunction is a drastic remedy issued by the court in its discretion to prevent\r\n  irreparable harm suffered by the plaintiff.â€ Â Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes W.\r\n    Residential Golf Props., Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 121, 603 S.E.2d 905, 907\r\n  (2004).\r\nWe hold\r\n  Denman has failed in his burden of showing he is entitled to injunctive relief\r\n  because he cannot show irreparable harm.Â  Notably, while he maintains voters in\r\n  District 2 will be disenfranchised if the election is held on April 6th,\r\n  he has presented no evidence, save for his own statement that he would have run\r\n  for the office but for the short notice period, to prove any voter or\r\n  prospective candidate has been disenfranchised.Â  In fact, Denman's argument\r\n  that candidates do not have proper notice of the election is directly\r\n  contradicted in that eight candidates have filed to run for the District 2 seat.Â \r\n  Denman has also failed to present, for example, any evidence that a voter who\r\n  wishes to vote for a District 2 candidate cannot do so because the voter missed\r\n  the deadline to register.Â  Furthermore, while the circuit court found absentee\r\n  voters could be disenfranchised, there is no evidence in the record that the\r\n  County Election Commission does not have sufficient time to ensure absentee\r\n  ballots are properly distributed. Â Finally, while we loathe the suggestion of\r\n  any further litigation in this matter, Denman and other voters do have the\r\n  option of contesting an election if irregularities exist.Â  E.g. Armstrong\r\n    v. Atlantic Beach Mun. Election Com'n, 380 S.C. 47, 668 S.E.2d 400 (2008). [6] Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  the circuit erred in granting the injunction and in declaring a new schedule\r\n  for the election.Â  Therefore, the order is REVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and ACTING JUSTICE JAMES E. MOORE, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Notice of elections for the office of Mayor, City\r\n  Council District 1, City Council District 4, and one City Council at large seat\r\n  were published in The State Newspaper on December 21, 2009, and again on\r\n  January 3, 2010.Â  There is no question that these notices were proper.\r\n[2] We believe the Legislature likely meant for a regular\r\n  election to be the general election.Â  Notably, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-1-20(1) (1976\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009) defines a general election as the election held for the\r\n  election of officers to the regular terms of office provided by law.Â  Section\r\n  7-1-20(2) defines a special election as any other election provided by law to\r\n  be held under the provisions of law applicable to general elections.\r\n[3] Sections 5-7-200 and 5-15-50 were adopted by the legislature\r\n  as part of Act 283 in 1975.Â  Section 5-15-50 originally stated a municipality\r\n  must provide at least ninety days notice of elections.Â  It was amended in 1978\r\n  to lower that requirement to sixty days.Â  Section 5-7-200 has never been\r\n  amended.Â  Section 7-13-35 was adopted in 1978, and it has been amended several\r\n  times.Â Â  \r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-150 (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\n[5] Denman's example concerns a resignation on April 5th and an election to fill the vacancy the next day. \r\n[6] We also note the circuit court ordered the election\r\n  to fill District 2 vacancy could occur as early as June 15, 2010.Â  However,\r\n  this ruling ignores the timing requirements for a special election found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-190(C) (Supp. 2009).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26793","title":"Price v.

Turner\r\n  (Appellant) appeals the family court's order holding Appellant in contempt of\r\n  court for failure to pay child support.Â  We certified the appeal pursuant to\r\n  Rule 204(b), SCACR, and affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn January 2008, Appellant appeared in family court on a rule to\r\n  show cause for failure to pay child support.Â  Appellant was not represented by\r\n  counsel.Â  At the time of the hearing, Appellant owed nearly six thousand\r\n  dollars in child support payments and had not made a payment in a year and a\r\n  half.Â  Appellant testified that his failure to pay was due to incarceration,\r\n  drug addiction, unemployment, and injury.Â  The court found Appellant in willful\r\n  contempt of the child support order and sentenced him to twelve months in a\r\n  detention center, which sentence he could purge himself of and avoid by full\r\n  payment of his child support arrearage.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  appealed the family court's order to the court of appeals.Â  This Court\r\n  certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  finding of contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Durlach\r\n    v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 70, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Such a finding should not be disturbed on appeal unless it is\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the judge has abused his discretion.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution\r\n  guarantee him, as an indigent defendant in family court, the right to appointed\r\n  counsel before being sentenced to one year imprisonment for civil contempt.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  purpose of civil contempt is to coerce the defendant to comply with the court's\r\n  order.Â  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 111, 502 S.E.2d 86, 88 (1998).Â \r\n  In contrast, criminal contempt is intended to punish a party for disobedience\r\n  and disrespect.Â  Id.Â  Â Civil contempt sanctions are conditioned on\r\n  compliance with the court's order.Â  Id. at 112, 502 S.E.2d at 89.Â \r\n  Criminal contempt sanctions are unconditional.Â  Id. at 111, 502 S.E.2d\r\n  at 88.Â  Thus, when the court orders imprisonment for contempt, whether the\r\n  sanction is civil or criminal depends upon whether the sentence is conditional\r\n  or for a definite period.Â  Id. at 111-12, 502 S.E.2d at 89.Â  A contemnor\r\n  imprisoned for civil contempt is said to hold the keys to his cell because he\r\n  may end the imprisonment and purge himself of the sentence at any time by doing\r\n  the act he had previously refused to do.Â  Id. at 112, 502 S.E.2d at 89.Â \r\n  This distinction between civil and criminal contempt is crucial because\r\n  criminal contempt triggers additional constitutional safeguards not mandated in\r\n  civil contempt proceedings.Â  See Miller v. Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 457,\r\n  652 S.E.2d 754, 761 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nHere, the\r\n  family court judge found Appellant in willful contempt of the support order and\r\n  sentenced him to twelve months in a detention facility, stating, &quot;He may\r\n  purge himself of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having a zero balance\r\n  on or before his release.&quot;[1]Â \r\n  This conditional sentence is a classic civil contempt sanction.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Appellant is not constitutionally entitled to appointment of counsel.[2]\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Appellant does not have a constitutional right to\r\n  appointed counsel before being incarcerated for civil contempt for nonsupport.Â \r\n  Because Appellant may avoid the sentence altogether by complying with the\r\n  court's previous support order, he holds the keys to his cell door and is not\r\n  subject to a permanent or unconditional loss of liberty.Â  We affirm the family\r\n  court's ruling.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This sentence is statutorily permitted by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-620, which\r\n  provides for, among other penalties, imprisonment for up to one year for\r\n  contempt of court.\r\n[2] We recognize that in holding a civil contemnor is not entitled to appointment\r\n  of counsel before being incarcerated we are adopting the minority position.Â \r\n  Several jurisdictions have held that appointment of counsel is not\r\n  constitutionally required before a civil contemnor may be incarcerated.Â  See Andrews v. Walton, 428 So. 2d 663 (Fla. 1983) (holding due process did\r\n  not require appointment of counsel in civil contempt proceeding where father\r\n  had ability to pay but willfully refused to do so);Â  Meyer v. Meyer, 414\r\n  A.2d 236 (Me. 1980) (finding a defendant in family court is not entitled to\r\n  appointment of counsel before being jailed for civil contempt for nonsupport); Duval\r\n    v. Duval, 322 A.2d 1 (N.H. 1974) (holding court has discretion to appoint\r\n  counsel in nonsupport civil contempt hearing, but is not constitutionally\r\n  mandated); State ex rel. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Rael, 642 P.2d 1099\r\n  (N.M. 1982) (holding due process does not require appointment of counsel in all\r\n  cases of civil contempt for nonsupport).Â  The majority of courts that have\r\n  considered this issue have determined indigent defendants do have a right to\r\n  appointment of counsel before being incarcerated for civil contempt.Â  See\r\n    e.g., Walker v. McLain, 768 F.2d 1181 (10th Cir. 1985); Sevier v.\r\n      Turner, 742 F.2d 262 (6th Cir. 1984); United States v. Bobert Travel\r\n        Agency, Inc., 699 F.2d 618 (2d Cir. 1983); Henkel v. Bradshaw, 483\r\n  F.2d 1386 (9th Cir. 1973); Johnson v. Zurz, 596 F. Supp. 39 (N.D. Ohio\r\n  1984); Ex parte Parcus, 615 So. 2d 78 (Ala. 1993); Black v. Div. of\r\n    Child Support Enforcement, 686 A.2d 164 (Del. 1996); May v. Coleman,\r\n  945 S.W.2d 426 (Ky. 1997); Rutherford v. Rutherford, 464 A.2d 228 (Md.\r\n  1983); Mead v. Batchlor, 460 NW.2d 493 (Mich. 1990); Cox v. Slama,\r\n  355 N.W.2d 401 (Minn. 1984); McBride v. McBride, 431 S.E.2d 14 (N.C.\r\n  1993); State ex rel. Gullickson v. Gruchalla, 467 N.W.2d 453 (N.D.\r\n  1991); Pasqua v. Council, 892 A.2d 663 (N.J. 2006); Russell v.\r\n    Armitage, 697 A.2d 630 (Vt. 1997); Tetro v. Tetro, 544 P.2d 17\r\n  (Wash. 1975).Â  However, we are persuaded that the minority position held by\r\n  Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, and New Mexico is sound and in keeping with controlling\r\n  precedent.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26794","title":"The Bank of New York v.

Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-10 (Supp. 2008); Kramer v. County\r\n    Council of Dorchester County, 277 S.C. 71, 282 S.E.2d 850 (1981).Â  The\r\n  master is appointed to a six-year term by the Governor, subject to the advice\r\n  and consent of the General Assembly.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-20 (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Candidates for the office must submit applications to, and be reviewed by, the\r\n  Judicial Merit Selection Commission (Commission), which then submits reports\r\n  and recommendations to the county legislative delegation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  2-19-110 (2005).Â  Only candidates found qualified by the Commission may be\r\n  submitted by the delegation to the Governor for consideration as appointee to\r\n  the office.Â  Id.\r\nThe equity courts\r\n  are considered a division of the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-15.Â  A\r\n  master is entitled to the same benefits and is subject to the same requirements\r\n  of the South Carolina Bar as a circuit or family court judge, and is subject to\r\n  the same Supreme Court rules as these judges.Â  Id.Â  Masters, however,\r\n  are not entitled to participate in the state judicial retirement system.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The county in which the master serves is responsible for providing &quot;the\r\n  salary, equipment, facilities, and supplies&quot; for the master, the salaries\r\n  of his support personnel, and all other costs associated with the master's\r\n  office's &quot;necessary and proper operation.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-30\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  Section 14-11-30 also establishes the formula, based upon\r\n  population and the salary of a circuit judge, for determining each county's master's salary.Â  Id.Â \r\n  All fees and costs recovered by the master are to be paid into the county's\r\n  general fund.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-40 (Supp. 2008).\r\nThe Supreme Court\r\n  may remove a master from office for misconduct under Rule 7(b)(1), Rules for\r\n  Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement (RJDE), Rule 502, SCACR.Â  The Governor, too,\r\n  may remove a master from office.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-3-240(A) (2005).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court had before it motions for summary judgment filed by Lenders, Evans,\r\n  County, and SCJD.Â  All motions, except that of SCJD, were denied in summary\r\n  orders.Â  The order granting SCJD's summary judgment contains these findings:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Holloman is not an employee of\r\n  SCJD;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    B.\r\n    Evans is not an employee of SCJD;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    C.\r\n    SCJD is not required by law to\r\n  supervise masters' management of their bank accounts: SCJD monitoring is\r\n  limited to caseloads, and auditing of caseloads only, and therefore SCJD could\r\n  not be negligent for failing to monitor the Sumter County Master's bank\r\n  account;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    D.\r\n    Since Evans was not its employee,\r\n  SCJD cannot be liable for negligent supervision of him;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    E.\r\n     There is no fiduciary relationship\r\n  between SCJD and Lenders;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    F.\r\n    Since SCJD exercised no ownership\r\n  rights over foreclosure funds to the exclusion of Lenders, did not derive any\r\n  benefit from those funds, and had no duty to safeguard, hold or deliver those\r\n  funds, summary judgment on Lenders' conversion and constructive bailment claims\r\n  was appropriate; and\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    G.\r\n    SCJD is immune from liability on\r\n  the basis of judicial immunity and the Tort Claims Act (TCA).[2]\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Lenders raise a number of issues, some of which are directed to the\r\n  potential liability of the County.Â  Since the appealed order granted summary\r\n  judgment to SCJD only, County's liability is an open question to be resolved\r\n  first at the circuit court level.Â  We therefore decline to address any issues\r\nrelated to County's liability.\r\nIn\r\n  its appeal, County has raised two issues, asking whether Evans and/or Holloman was\r\n  an employee of SCJD.Â  We decline to address these issues, and dismiss County's\r\n  appeal.Â  County, unlike Lenders, chose not to file any responsive pleading to\r\n  SCJD's summary judgment motion, but instead filed only a summary judgment\r\n  motion on its own behalf.Â  In asking this Court to hold that Evans and Holloman\r\n  are SCJD employees, County is in reality asking the Court to reverse the trial\r\n  judge's denial of its summary judgment motion, which was predicated in part on\r\n  County's contentions that Evans and Holloman were SCJD employees.Â  Since it is\r\n  well-settled that an order denying summary judgment is never reviewable on\r\n  appeal, Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 580\r\n  S.E.2d 440 (2003), we dismiss County's appeal.\r\nLENDERS' ISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)&nbsp;\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to SCJD finding Evans was not its employee?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred\r\n  in granting SCJD summary judgment on Lenders' negligent supervision theory?&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  holding SCJD did not have a duty to supervise Evans' bank accounts?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  holding that SCJD had no duty to audit Evans' books?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  holding SCJD did not owe Lenders a fiduciary duty to safeguard foreclosure\r\n  funds?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    6)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting SCJD summary judgment on the Lenders' conversion theory?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    7)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  holding there was no constructive bailment between SCJD and the Lenders?&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    8)\r\n    Whether a writ of mandamus should\r\n  issue requiring SCJD to give Lenders the foreclosure funds?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    9)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  holding that SCJD is immune under the Torts Claim Act and/or the doctrine of\r\n  judicial immunity?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and\r\n  it is clear that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.Â  On review of an order granting summary judgment, the\r\n  appellate court applies the same standard as that used by trial court.Â  Edwards\r\nv. Lexington County Sheriff's Dep't, ____ S.C. ____, 688 S.E.2d 125 (2010).\r\nANALYSIS\r\n1. Was SCJD Evans'\r\n  employer?\r\nThe\r\n  Lenders argue the trial court erred in finding SCJD was not Evans' employer,\r\n  and they also argue that he was, in fact, the dual employee of both SCJD and\r\n  County.Â  Since the trial court did not address the dual employee issue, it is\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â  Metts v. Mims, 384 S.C. 491, 682 S.E.2d\r\n  813 (2009) (issue must be raised and ruled upon below to be preserved for\r\n  appeal).Â  We affirm the circuit court's ruling that Evans was not an employee\r\n  of SCJD.\r\n As explained above,\r\n  the trial court's order held that the Lenders' contention that Evans was an\r\n  employee of SCJD rested on three specific actions:[3]\r\nThe Supreme Court\r\n  suspended Evans from office;\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)\r\n    &nbsp;The Supreme Court authorized\r\n  County and the County Sheriff to audit the records in the Evans' Master's\r\n  Office; and\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)\r\n    Court Administration &quot;told\r\n  Sumter County what Judge Evans' salary would be.&quot;\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe judge concluded that none\r\n  of these actions created a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence\r\n  of an employment relationship between SCJD and Evans, and granted SCJD summary\r\njudgment.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  first two alleged indicia of employment, the suspension of Evans and the\r\n  subsequent audit, came about as the result of judicial disciplinary\r\n  proceedings.Â  By statute, masters are subject to discipline by the Supreme\r\n  Court for violations of the Code of Judicial Ethics, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-15; see also Rule 7(b)(1), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We agree with the trial\r\n  judge that actions taken by SCJD in the course of a judicial disciplinary proceeding\r\n  are not indicia of an employee/employer relationship: to hold otherwise, for\r\n  example, would make SCJD the employer of all attorneys, since all members of\r\n  the bar are subject to disciplinary investigation, including suspension by the\r\n  Court and/or an audit.Â  \r\nThe third fact\r\n  advanced by the Lenders in support of their opposition to SCJD's summary\r\n  judgment motion on the employment issue was that SCJD, through Court\r\n  Administration, &quot;told Sumter County what Evans' salary would be.&quot;Â  By\r\n  statute, the salary of a master is based upon a formula which takes into\r\n  account both the salary of a circuit court judge and the county's population. Â See Â§ 14-11-30.Â  While Court Administration sends a letter to each county\r\n  government calculating the master's salary for that county using the statutory\r\n  formula, that salary is determined by the formula, not by the SCJD.\r\nWe affirm the order\r\n  which grants SCJD summary judgment on Lenders' claim that Evans' was an\r\n  employee of SCJD, finding no material issue of fact here.Â  Edwards, supra.\r\n2. Negligent Supervision\r\nLenders\r\n  contend the trial court erred in granting SCJD summary judgment on their\r\n  negligent supervision claims.Â  As Lenders acknowledge, this claim fails since we\r\n  affirm the trial judge's ruling that Evans was not an employee of SCJD.Â  Moreover,\r\n  even if there were an employment relationship, this cause of action lies\r\n  &quot;in circumstances where an employer knew or should have known that its\r\n  employment of a specific person created an undue risk of harm to the public\r\n  â€¦.&quot;Â  James v. Kelly Trucking Co., 377 S.C. 628, 661 S.E.2d 329\r\n  (2008).Â  There is no evidence here that SCJD knew or should have known that\r\n  Evans or Holloman posed an &quot;undue risk of harm to the public.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  order is affirmed to the extent it grants SCJD summary judgment on the Lenders'\r\n  negligent supervision cause of action.Â  Edwards, supra.\r\n3. Duty to supervise a master's\r\n  bank accounts and his audit books\r\nLenders contend\r\n  that statutes impose a duty on SCJD to supervise a master's bank accounts and\r\n  his audit books.Â  The Lenders would find this duty in either the Chief\r\n  Justice's administrative authority to &quot;examine the administrative methods,\r\n  systems and activities of the courts and their employees&quot; pursuant to S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-1-90, or through the Judicial Council (which they contend is a\r\n  part of SCJD), a body authorized to &quot;study and survey the administration\r\n  of justiceâ€¦and of the organization, procedure, practice, rules and methods of\r\n  administration and operation of each and all of the courtsâ€¦.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 14-27-70(1) (1976).Â  We agree with the circuit court judge that summary\r\n  judgment is appropriate here as there is no duty on the part of SCJD.\r\nNeither Â§ 14-1-90\r\n  nor Â§ 14-27-70(1) imposes a duty on SCJD to supervise a master-in-equity's bank\r\n  accounts and/or audit books.Â  Instead, by statute, this auditing duty is placed\r\n  on the county. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150 (Supp. 2008).Â  Even if Â§ 14-1-90 or Â§\r\n  14-27-70(1) were read to create such a duty, Lenders have not made any showing\r\n  that their claims would not be precluded by the public duty rule.Â  E.g., Arthurs ex rel. Estate of Munn v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97, 551 S.E.2d\r\n  579 (2001) (presumption that statute creating or defining duties of public\r\n  office create no duty of care towards individual members of the general\r\n  public).\r\nWe affirm the trial\r\n  judge's decision granting SCJD summary judgment on Lenders' duty to\r\n  audit/supervise claims.\r\n\r\n4. Fiduciary Duty\r\nLenders contend the\r\n  trial judge erred in finding SCJD did not owe lenders a fiduciary duty to\r\n  protect the funds held in the Evans' foreclosure account.Â  Lenders' argument is\r\n  premised, in the first instance, on the assertion that the courts, that is,\r\n  SCJD requires that masters hold these funds.\r\nUnder current\r\n  practice, authority for the master to hold these funds is found in Rule 71,\r\n  SCRCP.Â  The requirement that the master hold these funds in an account over\r\n  which he has control derives not from this rule, however, but rather from the\r\n  foreclosure statutes which permit, among other things, the seeking of a\r\n  deficiency judgment.Â  When such a judgment is sought, upset bids are allowed,\r\n  and where such a bid is made, the initial deposit may have to be returned.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-39-720 and -750 (2005).Â  In order to comply with this\r\n  statutory possibility, the master must control the funds.Â  Moreover, by\r\n  statute, a master's fee for a real estate foreclosure is set at 1% &quot;of the\r\n  bid or of the funds passing through the court, whichever is greater.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-310 (Supp. 2008).Â  This statute anticipates that the\r\n  funds will be held by the master.\r\nIt is simply\r\n  inaccurate to state that the courts (or SCJD), rather than statutes and a rule\r\n  which implements the statutory practices (submitted to the General Assembly)\r\n  require that masters hold these funds.\r\nWe affirm the grant\r\n  of summary judgment to SCJD on Lenders' fiduciary duty theory, which is premised\r\n  on a factual inaccuracy.\r\n5. Conversion\r\nConversion is\r\n  &quot;the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over\r\n  goods or personal chattels belonging to another to the exclusion of the owner's\r\n  rights.&quot;Â  Moore v. Weinberg, 383 S.C. 583, 681 S.E.2d 875 (2009).Â \r\n  Lenders' conversion argument is simply an extension of its negligent\r\n  supervision argument: SCJD negligently supervised Evans, who in turn\r\n  negligently supervised Holloman, who in turn was able to convert the funds.Â \r\n  Since there was no negligent supervision on the part of SCJD vis-Ã -vis Evans,\r\n  who was not its employee, the conversion argument also fails.Â  We affirm the\r\n  grant of summary judgment to SCJD on Lenders' conversion claim.\r\n6. Constructive Bailment\r\n&quot;A\r\n  constructive bailment arises when one person has lawfully acquired possession\r\n  of another person's personal property, other than by virtue of a bailment\r\n  contract, and holds it under such circumstances that the law imposes on the\r\n  recipient of the property the obligation to keep it safely and redeliver it to\r\n  the owner.&quot;Â  Hadfield v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88, 538 S.E.2d 268\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (internal citations omitted).Â  Here, SCJD never acquired\r\n  possession of Lenders' funds, nor does it hold those funds, which have been\r\n  embezzled by Holloman.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  properly granted summary judgment on the bailment claim.\r\n7. Mandamus\r\n Lenders contend the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to issue a writ of mandamus compelling SCJD to\r\n  turn over the foreclosure funds.Â  This issue is not before the Court, as there\r\n  is no ruling below on this mandamus request.Â  E.g. Metts v. Mims, supra.Â  While Lenders sought to mandamus County, no writ of mandamus was\r\n  sought against SCJD until Lenders filed their motion to alter or amend the\r\n  order.Â  It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time in a\r\n  post-trial motion.Â  E.g., Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 849 (2005).\r\n\r\n8. Immunity\r\nSince we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's rulings on all liability theories asserted against SCJD, we\r\n  need not reach the immunity claims raised by SCJD.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Lenders'\r\n  appeals are affirmed, and County's appeal is dismissed.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART;\r\n  DISMISSED IN PART.\r\nACTING CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justices James E.
