At the foreclosure sale,\r\nan affiliate of one of Carolina Park Associates’ members purchased the property.\r\nAppellant Republic-Charleston, the managing member of Carolina Park\r\nAssociates, contends that the circuit court erred when it dismissed claims seeking\r\nto impose a constructive trust in the property and when it cancelled a lis pendens\r\nfiled by Appellants.1 We affirm.       FACTS\r\n\r\nIn 1987, CDM of Charleston, LLC (CDM) purchased Carolina Park, a large\r\nmixed-use real estate development in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina (the Property).\r\nCDM is owned by trusts and partnerships formed by the individual Respondents,\r\nBenedict Marino, Douglas Dittrick, and John Chalsty. MDC of Charleston, LLC\r\n(MDC), also owned by trusts and partnerships affiliated with the individual\r\nRespondents, together with Appellant Republic-Charleston, LLC (Republic),\r\nformed Carolina Park Associates, LLC (Carolina Park). Each held a 50 percent\r\ninterest, with Republic as the managing member. Carolina Park’s sole purpose\r\nwas to purchase and develop the Property. Carolina Park purchased the Property\r\nfrom CDM for $3 million cash and a $22 million promissory note secured by a\r\nsecond mortgage on the Property. A first mortgage was held by NBSC and later\r\nsold to Palmetto Debt Holding Group, LLC (Palmetto Debt).\r\n\r\nCarolina Park defaulted on its mortgages, and Palmetto Debt initiated foreclosure\r\nproceedings in 2009. In March 2010, Carolina Park and its lenders, Palmetto Debt\r\nand CDM, entered a foreclosure consent order, which recognized CDM’s right to\r\ncredit bid2 the amount of its second mortgage on the Property at the foreclosure\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nAt some point, CDM located an entity interested in participating in the\r\ndevelopment of the Property, Grove Land Investors, LLC (Grove Land). Grove\r\nLand agreed to contribute $32 million to CDM in exchange for being admitted as\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Additional allegations, such as breach of contract, are not involved in this appeal.\r\n2 A credit bid permits a bidder who holds a mortgage on the property to substitute\r\nthe value of the mortgage in place of cash at the foreclosure sale.\r\n\ncontrolling majority member, conditioned on CDM’s ability to acquire the\r\nProperty through the foreclosure.\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, the foreclosure sale took place. CDM was the only bidder. It\r\npurchased the Property for $50 million, paying $28 million to redeem the Palmetto\r\nDebt mortgage and credit bidding its $22 million second mortgage. The\r\nforeclosure was neither opposed by any party, including Carolina Park and\r\nRepublic, nor appealed.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Republic initiated this suit in its own behalf and derivatively on behalf\r\nof Carolina Park against CDM, the holder of the second mortgage and purchaser at\r\nthe foreclosure sale, MDC, Republic’s partner in Carolina Park, and the individual\r\nprincipals of CDM and MDC. Republic alleged, among other things, that MDC\r\nviolated its duty of good faith and fair dealing to Carolina Park by usurping its\r\ncorporate opportunity. Appellants contend that CDM is liable for MDC’s acts\r\nbecause it exercised dominion and control over MDC. Appellants seek a\r\nconstructive trust on the Property, an injunction preventing CDM from\r\nencumbering or disposing of the Property, and consequential damages. Appellants\r\nalso filed a lis pendens on the Property.\r\n\r\nCDM moved to cancel the lis pendens and to dismiss. The circuit court granted the\r\nmotion to dismiss in part, finding that Appellants had failed to state facts sufficient\r\nto support their claim for a constructive trust on the Property or for injunctive relief\r\npreventing encumbrance or disposition of the Property, and granted the motion to\r\ncancel the lis pendens. In order to protect Appellants’ interests, the circuit court\r\nordered CDM to provide a semiannual accounting and details of the financial\r\nposition of all CDM partners. Appellants appealed, seeking reinstatement of their\r\nclaims for a constructive trust over the Property itself rather than over the proceeds\r\nderived therefrom, and seeking reinstatement of the lis pendens.\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\n1. Did the circuit court err when it dismissed the causes of action seeking to\r\n   impose a constructive trust on the Property?\r\n2. Did the circuit court err when it canceled the lis pendens?\r\n\n                                   DISCUSSION \n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss, this Court applies the same standard of review as\r\nthe trial court. Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2007). A\r\nruling dismissing a complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a\r\ncause of action must be based solely on allegations set forth in the complaint. Id.\r\n“If the facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom, viewed in the\r\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any\r\ntheory,” dismissal is improper. Id. “Questions of law may be decided with no\r\nparticular deference to the trial court.” Wiegand v. U.S. Auto. Ass’n, 391 S.C. 159,\r\n163, 705 S.E.2d 432, 434 (2011).\r\n\r\nI. Constructive Trust\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that the circuit court erred when it dismissed the causes of action\r\nseeking to impose a constructive trust on the Property. We find that the\r\nconstructive trust action was properly dismissed because Appellants have failed to\r\nallege circumstances under which it would be inequitable to permit CDM to retain\r\ntitle to the Property. We therefore affirm.\r\n\r\nAn action to declare a constructive trust is in equity, and a reviewing court may\r\nfind facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence. Lollis v. Lollis, 291\r\nS.C. 525, 530, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1987). “A constructive trust will arise\r\nwhenever the circumstances under which property was acquired make it\r\ninequitable that it should be retained by the one holding legal title.” Id. at 529, 354\r\nS.E.2d at 560. It “results from fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence, or violation of\r\na fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to make restitution.” Id.\r\n“It is resorted to by equity to vindicate right and justice or frustrate fraud.”\r\nWhitmire v. Adams, 273 S.C. 453, 457, 257 S.E.2d 160, 163 (1979). In addition,\r\nthe standard of proof is high, in that “to establish a constructive trust, the evidence\r\nmust be clear, definite, and unequivocal.” Lollis, 291 S.C. at 530, 354 S.E.2d at\r\n561; see Whitmire, 273 S.C. at 458-61, 257 S.E.2d at 163-65.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Appellants allege that Respondents usurped a corporate opportunity by\r\nfinding a new investor willing to advance funds toward the purchase of the\r\nProperty and not giving Carolina Park an opportunity to negotiate with that\r\ninvestor to finance the Property in cooperation with Carolina Park. Appellants do\r\nnot dispute that Grove Land contributed $32 million cash at the time of the\r\n\nforeclosure sale or that Carolina Park itself was unable to locate a new investor or a\r\nlender willing to refinance the existing first mortgage.\r\n\r\nAppellants have not advanced any argument explaining why Grove Land would\r\nhave been interested in providing additional financing to Carolina Park rather than\r\nacquiring its interest in the Property through foreclosure. Working with Carolina\r\nPark would have required Grove Land to leave Carolina Park with some interest in\r\nthe Property, whereas acquiring the Property with CDM through foreclosure would\r\ngive Grove Land a greater equity stake in the Property and venture. By the same\r\ntoken, Grove Land was well aware of the existence of Carolina Park, since Grove\r\nLand’s participation in the venture with CDM was conditioned on CDM’s ability\r\nto obtain the Property at the foreclosure sale.\r\n\r\nMoreover, at foreclosure, the Property sold for $28 million cash plus the $22\r\nmillion credit bid. Appellants have not sought a constructive trust for a part\r\ninterest in the Property. Rather, they assert that Carolina Park is the beneficial\r\nowner of the entire Property and seek to have the Property transferred or conveyed\r\nto Carolina Park. They ignore the $28 million contributed by Grove Land and\r\nreject the circuit court’s finding that they have an adequate remedy for any injury\r\nthrough a money judgment or a constructive trust over the profits of the\r\ndevelopment. Alternatively, Appellants suggest that they are primarily interested\r\nin retaining some control over development of the Property through the\r\nconstructive trust action and lis pendens rather than obtaining outright ownership\r\nof the Property. In effect, they acknowledge that imposing a constructive trust on\r\nthe entire Property would be inequitable to CDM and the Grove Land investors.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to Appellants,\r\nthe allegations simply fail the equitable test that “the circumstances under which\r\nproperty was acquired make it inequitable that it should be retained by the one\r\nholding legal title.” Lollis, supra. The allegations do not present circumstances in\r\nwhich there is a need to resort to this equitable remedy in order “to vindicate right\r\nand justice or frustrate fraud.” Whitmire, supra.\r\n\r\nEven if Appellants had alleged circumstances more clearly reflecting a loss directly\r\nattributable to Respondents’ activities, equitable relief is unnecessary when an\r\nadequate remedy for money damages is available at law. Monteith v. Harby, 190\r\nS.C. 453, 3 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1939); Key Corporate Capital, Inc. v. County of\r\nBeaufort, 373 S.C. 55, 61, 544 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2007) (“[E]quitable relief is\r\ngenerally available where there is no adequate remedy at law . . . .”); see also\r\n\nWhitmire, supra, at 458, 257 S.E.2d at 163 (“This liberality [in permitting use of\r\nparol evidence] is counterbalanced by the rigid standard of proof which equity\r\ndecrees as a prerequisite to the establishment of a constructive trust.”). In this\r\ncase, Appellants pled money damages in the alternative and have stated no reason\r\nwhy this relief is inadequate other than that they will be unable to participate in the\r\ndevelopment of the Property.\r\n\r\nThus, we affirm the circuit court’s ruling on the ground that Appellants have failed\r\nto state a claim for imposition of a constructive trust as they have failed to state\r\nfacts showing that the circumstances under which the Property was acquired make\r\nit inequitable that it should be retained by CDM.\r\n\r\nII. Lis Pendens\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that the circuit court erred when it cancelled the lis pendens they\r\nhad filed on the Property. They argue that, even if the circuit court correctly\r\ndismissed their claim for a constructive trust over the Property, the statute\r\ngoverning lis pendens does not permit a court to cancel one until the action it is\r\nfiled in connection with has ended. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. § 15-11-10 (Supp. 2004) authorizes the filing of a\r\nNotice of Pendency of Action, or lis pendens, in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n      In an action affecting the title to real property the plaintiff . . . may file\r\n      . . . a notice of the pendency of the action, . . . .\r\n\r\n “Since the filing of a lis pendens is an extraordinary privilege granted by statute,\r\nstrict compliance with the statutory provisions is required.” Pond Place Partners,\r\nInc. v. Poole, 351 S.C.1, 17, 567 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. App. 2002). Thus, a lis\r\npendens is permitted only when the action actually “affect[s] the title to real\r\nproperty.” See id. at 18, 567 S.E.2d at 890.\r\n\r\nWith regard to a court’s cancellation of a lis pendens, S.C. Code Ann. § 15-11-40\r\n(2003) states, in relevant part, that\r\n\r\n      The court in which the action was commenced, in its discretion at any\r\n      time after the action is settled, discontinued, or abated . . . , on\r\n      application of a person aggrieved and on good cause shown . . . , may\r\n      order the notice authorized by this chapter to be cancelled . . . .\r\n\nThe statute permits a court to cancel a lis pendens “authorized by this chapter” “at\r\nany time after the action is settled, discontinued, or abated.” By implication, a lis\r\npendens that meets the statutory requirement for filing may not be canceled during\r\nthe pendency of litigation. However, if the court finds that the lis pendens does not\r\n“affect[] the title to real property” as required under § 15-11-10, the lis pendens is\r\nnot authorized by the statute and the statute does not limit the court’s power to\r\ncancel it.\r\n\r\nBecause Appellants have failed to state a claim for a constructive trust, they have\r\nno claim affecting the title to real property and the lis pendens is not “authorized\r\nby this chapter.” We therefore affirm the cancellation of the lis pendens.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\nAppellants have failed to state a claim for which imposition of a constructive trust\r\nwould be an appropriate remedy because the facts alleged, even viewed in the light\r\nmost favorable to them, do not present circumstances in which an equitable remedy\r\nis required or needed. Moreover, because dismissal of the claims seeking to\r\nimpose a constructive trust on the Property was proper, cancellation of the lis\r\npendens was proper.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

Shupe,\r\n    all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert Mills Ariail, of\r\n    Greenville, Respondent.\r\n\n      JUSTICE BEATTY: Jason Ervin Black (Petitioner) appeals his\r\nconvictions for criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor in the first degree and\r\ncommitting a lewd act upon a minor. Petitioner contends the trial court committed\r\nreversible error in allowing the State to impeach his defense witness with two\r\nmanslaughter convictions that were more than ten years old because their\r\nintroduction violated Rules 404 and 609 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence\r\n(SCRE), and the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.\r\n\r\nI.    FACTS\r\n\r\n      Petitioner was charged with the above offenses as the result of an alleged\r\nencounter that occurred with A.T. (the Minor) at the home of Petitioner's friend\r\nand neighbor, Richard Bush, on May 6, 2006. Petitioner was then 26 and the\r\nMinor was 15.\r\n\r\n       At trial in June 2007, the Minor asserted that she went to Bush's one-\r\nbedroom trailer on the evening of May 6, 2006 and that she and Petitioner had\r\nconsensual sex in the bedroom while Bush remained in the living room watching\r\nTV. Petitioner acknowledged that he and the Minor were at Bush's home on May\r\n6, 2006, but he denied the Minor's allegations of sexual misconduct and maintained\r\nthey had just watched TV together until she left later that evening with a friend.\r\nBush corroborated Petitioner's version of events, stating all three of them had\r\nremained in the living room watching TV until the Minor left with a friend who\r\ncame by and picked her up. Bush was the only witness for the defense other than\r\nPetitioner.\r\n\r\n      Prior to the State's cross examination of Bush, a bench conference was held\r\nregarding the State's request to use Bush's prior convictions for impeachment\r\npurposes. Bush was sentenced in Florida on March 12, 1987 to a total of twenty-\r\ntwo years in prison for two counts of manslaughter and one count of\r\n\"shooting/throwing a deadly missile.\"1 Bush was given concurrent prison\r\n1  The specific provision regarding the deadly missile offense was not identified at\r\ntrial, but we note that Florida law makes it a crime to shoot at or into, or to throw a\r\ndeadly missile (a stone or other hard object that could cause serious bodily harm or\r\ndeath) at or within, a home, building, vehicle, plane, or other area described in the\r\nstatute. Fla. Stat. Ann. § 790.19 (2007).\r\n\nsentences of fifteen years on each count of manslaughter and a consecutive seven\r\nyears on shooting/throwing a deadly missile. He was released from confinement\r\nby Florida authorities on March 1, 1993, after serving approximately six years of\r\nhis twenty-two year sentence.\r\n\r\n       The trial court ruled Bush's 1987 Florida convictions could be used for\r\nimpeachment purposes. Thereafter, the State impeached Bush by asking about his\r\nprior convictions, which Bush acknowledged.\r\n\r\n      Petitioner was convicted of CSC with a minor in the first degree and\r\ncommitting a lewd act upon a minor, and he was given concurrent prison sentences\r\nof twenty years and fifteen years, respectively. The Court of Appeals affirmed\r\npursuant to Rule 220, SCACR. State v. Black, Op. No. 2010-UP-370 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed July 19, 2010). This Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\nII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       In criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review only errors of law, and it\r\nis bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\r\nState v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1,\r\n545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).\r\n\r\n        \"The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the\r\ntrial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\" State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001); see also\r\nState v. Dunlap, 346 S.C. 312, 324, 550 S.E.2d 889, 896 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"The\r\nadmission of evidence concerning past convictions for impeachment purposes\r\nremains within the trial judge's discretion, provided the judge conducts the analysis\r\nmandated by the evidence rules and case law.\").\r\n\r\n       \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an\r\nerror of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary\r\nsupport.\" State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 477-78, 716 S.E.2d 91, 93 (2011)\r\n(citation omitted). To warrant reversal, an error must result in prejudice to the\r\nappealing party. State v. Commander, 396 S.C. 254, 721 S.E.2d 413 (2011).\r\n\nIII.   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       On appeal, Petitioner contends the trial court erred in allowing the State to\r\nuse the two Florida manslaughter convictions to impeach Bush, his only\r\ncorroborating defense witness, because their admission violated Rules 404 and\r\n609, SCRE. Petitioner asserts the convictions were presumptively inadmissible\r\nbecause they were more than ten years old and, thus, remote, and the State bore the\r\nburden of establishing facts and circumstances to substantially overcome that\r\npresumption, citing State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246 (2000). Petitioner\r\nasserts the evidence that his corroborating witness had been convicted of\r\nmanslaughter two decades earlier was not probative of truthfulness and, under Rule\r\n609(b), the convictions were not properly admitted to impeach his witness's\r\ncredibility. Petitioner further contends the error was not harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.2 We agree that the admission of the manslaughter convictions\r\nwas improper; however, for reasons to be discussed, we believe the error was\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\n       A.    Impeachment of Witness with Prior Convictions\r\n\r\n       \"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the\r\ncharacter of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Rule\r\n404(b), SCRE. In contrast, the general rule on impeaching a witness's credibility is\r\nthat a witness, other than the accused, may be impeached with a prior conviction\r\nthat carries a sentence of more than one year.3 See Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE (stating\r\n\"evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall\r\nbe admitted, subject to Rule 403,4 if the crime was punishable by death or\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Petitioner raises no issue on appeal concerning the missile offense, so it is not\r\naddressed here except in the context of harmless error.\r\n3Crimes involving dishonesty or false statement may be admitted for impeachment\r\npurposes regardless of the punishment. Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE.\r\n4 Rule 403, SCRE provides relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative\r\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. \"Evidence is\r\nunfairly prejudicial if it has an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an\r\n\nimprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was\r\nconvicted\").\r\n\r\n      Rule 609(b), however, contains a time limit that establishes a presumption\r\nagainst the admissibility of remote convictions, i.e., those more than ten years old,\r\nfor impeachment unless the trial court expressly finds the probative value of the\r\nconviction \"substantially outweighs\" its prejudicial effect. State v. Johnson, 363\r\nS.C. 53, 609 S.E.2d 520 (2005). The rule provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      (b) Time Limit. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not\r\n      admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the\r\n      date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the\r\n      confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date,\r\n      unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the\r\n      probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and\r\n      circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\nRule 609(b), SCRE (emphasis added). The State bears the burden of establishing\r\nsufficient facts and circumstances to overcome the presumption against the\r\nadmissibility of remote convictions. State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 633 S.E.2d 152\r\n(2006); State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246 (2000).\r\n\r\n       The standard in Rule 609(b) pertaining to remote convictions is higher than\r\nthe standard of Rule 609(a)(1), by which certain convictions that are not more than\r\nten years old are admissible if their probative value simply \"outweighs,\" rather\r\nthan \"substantially outweighs,\" their prejudicial effect. Compare Rule 609(a)(1)\r\nwith Rule 609(b); see also United States v. Cavender, 578 F.2d 528, 531 (4th Cir.\r\n1978) (observing this distinction). As is stated in the Senate Report on the Rules\r\nof Evidence, \"It is intended that convictions over 10 years old will be admitted\r\nvery rarely and only in exceptional circumstances.\" Clay v. State, 725 S.E.2d 260,\r\n273 (Ga. 2012) (discussing the federal rule, upon which many state provisions are\r\nbased) (quoting U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. at p. 7062\r\n(1974)); see also Cavender, 578 F.2d at 532 n.8 (noting the presence of the\r\ncautionary language in the Senate Report and observing that the trial court's\r\n\r\n\r\nimproper basis, such as an emotional one.\" State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545\r\nS.E.2d 827, 830 (2001).\r\n\ndiscretionary balancing power should be exercised \"in a very limited way\" (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\n       This Court has stated that federal cases are persuasive since our rule is based\r\non the federal rule, and we have noted that \"[t]he Fourth Circuit has explicitly held\r\nthat evidence of remote convictions should only be admitted for impeachment\r\n                                           \r\npurposes 'in exceptional circumstances.'\" Colf, 337 S.C. at 626, 525 S.E.2d at 248\r\n(quoting Cavender, 578 F.2d at 530).\r\n\r\n       In performing the balancing test required by Rule 609(b), the trial court shall\r\ndetermine whether the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs\r\nthe prejudice of its admission after carefully balancing the interests involved and\r\narticulating for the record the specific facts and circumstances supporting its\r\ndecision. Colf, 337 S.C. at 629, 525 S.E.2d at 249. Thus, the trial court must state\r\nnot only whether the probative value of the prior conviction substantially\r\noutweighs the prejudicial effect, but also why. Bryant, 369 S.C. at 516-17, 633\r\nS.E.2d at 155.\r\n\r\n       This Court has enumerated at least five factors that a trial court should\r\nconsider in determining, in the interests of justice, whether the probative value of a\r\nprior conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect: (1) the impeachment\r\nvalue of the prior crime, (2) the point in time of the conviction and the witness's\r\nsubsequent history, (3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged\r\ncrime, (4) the importance of the defendant's testimony, and (5) the centrality of the\r\ncredibility issue. Colf, 337 S.C. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248 (citing the Fourth\r\nCircuit's analysis in United States v. Cavender, 578 F.2d 528 (4th Cir. 1978) and\r\nUnited States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414 (4th Cir. 1981)).\r\n\r\n        Colf involved the impeachment of a defendant, so some of these factors\r\nmust, as a practical matter, be adjusted for this particular case, which involves the\r\nconvictions of a non-defendant. See id. (\"These factors are not exclusive,\" and\r\n\"trial courts should exercise their discretion in light of the facts and circumstances\r\nof each particular case.\").\r\n\r\n      Bush's prior convictions date from March 1987, and he was released from\r\nconfinement in March 1993. The trial in this matter occurred in June 2007, some\r\ntwenty years after his convictions and more than fourteen years after his release.\r\nThus, it is undisputed that Bush's manslaughter convictions were remote as more\r\n\nthan ten years had elapsed since his release from confinement, and the convictions\r\nwere presumptively inadmissible under Rule 609(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\n       The trial court acknowledged that it needed to determine, pursuant to Rule\r\n609(b), whether or not the probative value of the remote convictions substantially\r\noutweighed their prejudicial effect. The State argued the convictions were\r\nadmissible \"because the crimes are so heinous that they show a character flaw that\r\nshould be brought out [to] the jury so they can determine whether or not to believe\r\nthis man under oath. Anybody who would kill two people is not as trustworthy as\r\na car thief.\" The State also argued the convictions pertained to a witness, not the\r\ndefendant, so \"[w]e are not impinging on the Defendant's rights. We are talking\r\nabout bringing all the matters to the jury's attention so they can evaluate his\r\ncredibility one way or another.\"\r\n\r\n       The trial court concluded the State could use the convictions to impeach\r\nBush, noting \"a charge of manslaughter has a very high impeachment value.\" The\r\ncourt stated that, although the convictions were remote, given the seriousness of\r\nthe crimes, Bush's actual time served seemed relatively short. In this regard, the\r\ncourt noted that, under South Carolina law, Bush likely would have faced a longer\r\nsentence and that if Florida authorities had required Bush to serve the sentences as\r\noriginally given, then Bush \"would have been released well within the ten-year\r\ntime limit.\" The court stated that, based on this reasoning, the remoteness of the\r\nconvictions was \"diminished a little and it's almost like it's not as remote.\"\r\n\r\n        The trial court remarked that the similarities between the past crime and the\r\ncrime charged was a factor that was more relevant in cases concerning the\r\nimpeachment of a defendant and the crimes were not similar, in any event. The\r\ntrial court found the witness's testimony was \"critical,\" stating if Bush's \"testimony\r\nis true, then it means that this crime could not have even happened at all. . . . That,\r\nof course, makes . . . his credibility essential.\" The trial court concluded after\r\n\"weighing those factors\" that \"the probative value of the convictions substantially\r\noutweigh[ed] their prejudicial effect.\"\r\n\r\n      Although the trial court cited the correct standard and attempted to perform a\r\nbalancing test, we believe the trial court failed to adequately assess the probative\r\nvalue of the remote convictions before balancing the probative value of the\r\nconvictions with their prejudicial effect. In addition, we disagree with the court's\r\napplication of several of the pertinent factors in applying the balancing test. In our\r\n\nview, the first two factors, the impeachment value of the prior convictions and the\r\nwitness's subsequent history, do not weigh in favor of admissibility in this case.\r\nThe manslaughter offenses, while crimes of violence, are not crimes of dishonesty\r\nor untruthfulness that directly impact the witness's veracity. In addition, there is no\r\nevidence the witness has been convicted of any additional crimes since his release\r\nfrom confinement some fourteen years prior to trial. We agree with the trial court\r\nthat the third factor, the similarity of the conduct, is of no consequence here. The\r\nfourth and fifth factors, which overlap somewhat, concern the witness's credibility,\r\nwhich was important in this case. However, this, in itself, is not determinative of\r\nadmissibility. The admission of the remote convictions was certainly prejudicial,\r\nand considering all of the circumstances, the State has not met its high burden of\r\nestablishing that the prejudicial effect of the convictions was substantially\r\noutweighed by their probative value.\r\n\r\n        The starting point in the analysis is the degree to which the prior convictions\r\nhave probative value, meaning the tendency to prove the issue at hand—the\r\nwitness's propensity for truthfulness, or credibility. See Fletcher v. People, 179\r\nP.3d 969, 974 (Colo. 2007) (\"To have probative value, evidence must have a\r\ntendency to prove the proposition for which it is offered.\"); Hopkins v. State, 639\r\nSo. 2d 1247, 1252-53 (Miss. 1993) (observing the State must first show the prior\r\nconviction has probative value on the issue of the witness's propensity for\r\ntruthfulness, as this is the issue with respect to which the prior conviction must be\r\nrelevant if it is to be admissible, and this threshold burden should be met before the\r\ntrial court engages in a balancing test (citation omitted)). The tendency to impact\r\ncredibility, in turn, determines the impeachment value of the prior conviction.\r\nImpeachment value refers to how strongly the nature of the conviction bears on the\r\nveracity, or credibility, of the witness. 33A Federal Procedure, Lawyers Edition\r\n§ 80:176 (2003).\r\n\r\n        \"Under the Rule, the pivotal issue of the probative value of a conviction\r\nturns largely on a consideration of the nature of the conviction itself.\" Cavender,\r\n578 F.2d at 534. \"This follows because the purpose of impeachment is not 'to\r\nshow that the [witness] who takes the stand is a \"bad\" person but rather to show\r\nbackground facts which bear directly on whether jurors ought to believe him . . . .'\"\r\n                                                                                     \r\nId. (citation omitted). \"Accordingly, in general it is a conviction which bears on\r\n'whether jurors ought to believe' the witness or party that qualifies for\r\nimpeachment purposes.\" Id.\r\n\n        \"The crimes which are generally spoken of as meeting this test of giving a\r\nbasis for an inference of a 'propensity to lie' and which 'bear directly on whether\r\njurors ought to believe him' are those which 'rest on dishonest conduct,' Gordon v.\r\nUnited States, [383 F.2d 936, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1967)], or carry 'a tinge of\r\nfalsification,' United States v. Ortega, [561 F.2d 803, 806 (9th Cir. 1977)], or\r\ninvolve '\"some element of deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification,\"' United States v.\r\n                                                                       \r\nThompson [559 F.2d 552, 554 (9th Cir. 1977)].\" Id.\r\n\r\n        A rule of thumb is that convictions that rest on dishonest conduct relate to\r\ncredibility, whereas crimes of violence, which may result from a myriad of causes,\r\ngenerally do not. See Gordon v. United States, 383 F.2d 936, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1967)\r\n(\"In common human experience acts of deceit, fraud, cheating, or stealing . . . are\r\nuniversally regarded as conduct which reflects adversely on a man's honesty and\r\nintegrity. Acts of violence on the other hand, which may result from a short\r\ntemper, a combative nature, extreme provocation, or other causes, generally have\r\nlittle or no direct bearing on honesty and veracity. A 'rule of thumb' thus should be\r\nthat convictions which rest on dishonest conduct relate to credibility whereas those\r\nof violent or assaultive crimes generally do not . . . . The nearness or remoteness\r\nof the prior conviction is also a factor of no small importance.\" (footnote omitted));\r\nsee also State v. Redmond, 803 N.W.2d 112, 122-23 (Iowa 2011) (recognizing that\r\nviolent crimes and remote crimes have less probative value than those involving\r\ndishonesty; the court stated counsel may attempt to show a witness's testimony is\r\nunpersuasive in a number of ways besides prior conviction evidence, such as\r\nshowing bias, a motive to lie, or flaws in the witness's perception).\r\n\r\n        In the current appeal, the trial court stated the manslaughter convictions had\r\n\"a very high impeachment value,\" but we note that \"[t]he impeachment value of\r\ncrimes that involve deception is higher than crimes that involve violence, and the\r\nlatter have a higher potential for prejudice.\" Theus v. State, 845 S.W.2d 874, 881\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (en banc) (citing United States v. Jackson, 627 F.2d 1198,\r\n1210 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). Although the convictions arguably raise a concern as to\r\nBush's general character, it is more narrowly his propensity for telling the truth,\r\ni.e., his credibility, that is properly placed at issue under Rule 609(b). The rule\r\nallows impeachment of a witness only as to his or her credibility, not as to all\r\naspects of the witness's character. See State v. Ross, 405 S.E.2d 158, 165 (N.C.\r\n1991) (In applying the \"critical balancing process [of Rule 609(b)] it is important\r\nto remember that the only legitimate purpose for introducing evidence of past\r\nconvictions is to impeach the witness's credibility,\" not the witness's general\r\n\ncharacter, and \"[t]he use of this rule is necessarily limited by that focus.\" (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\n       The manslaughter convictions, while crimes of violence, are not particularly\r\nprobative of the specific trait of truthfulness; consequently, their impeachment\r\nvalue is limited.5 See Lenard v. Argento, 699 F.2d 874, 895 (7th Cir. 1983) (noting\r\nremote convictions should be admitted only under very rare and exceptional\r\ncircumstances and holding the witness's remote voluntary manslaughter conviction\r\nwas unrelated to his truth-telling capabilities and was properly barred as\r\nimpeachment evidence); United States v. Johnson, 47 F. Supp. 2d 1329, 1331-32\r\n(D. Utah 1999) (holding attempted manslaughter is a crime of violence, not a crime\r\nof dishonesty or false statement, so it does not directly involve veracity and has\r\nonly \"a limited amount of probativeness as to honesty\"); Gov't of Virgin Islands v.\r\nSolis, 475 F. Supp. 542, 543 (D. V.I. 1979) (holding the trial court did not err in\r\nexcluding evidence of the victim's conviction for involuntary manslaughter that\r\nwas more than ten years old as the crime \"has no bearing on the issue of\r\ntruthfulness or untruthfulness\"; the court stated \"Rule 609 countenances the use of\r\nprior convictions when those prior convictions involve some element of deceit,\r\nuntruthfulness or falsification which would tend to show that an accused or a\r\nwitness would be likely to testify untruthfully\"); Mason v. State, 756 P.2d 612, 614\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Petitioner concedes that Rule 609 abandons the \"moral turpitude\" standard, but\r\nasserts \"it should nevertheless be noted that manslaughter was not considered a\r\ncrime of moral turpitude and was inadmissible to impeach the credibility of a\r\nwitness,\" citing Mitchell v. State, 298 S.C. 186, 189, 379 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1989)\r\n(\"In South Carolina, manslaughter is not a crime of moral turpitude.\"). In Mitchell,\r\nthis Court found error in the trial court allowing the State to impeach the\r\ndefendant's credibility with evidence of his prior New York manslaughter\r\nconviction on the basis the conviction did not relate to a crime involving moral\r\nturpitude. Id. at 189-90, 379 S.E.2d at 125. This Court has stated that the moral\r\nturpitude test is no longer relevant under a Rule 609 analysis. See, e.g., Green v.\r\nState, 338 S.C. 428, 432, 527 S.E.2d 98, 100 (2000) (\"[T]he new evidentiary rule\r\nremoves the necessity of determining whether a crime is one of moral turpitude.\").\r\n\n(Okla. Crim. App. 1988) (stating manslaughter is not a crime involving dishonesty\r\nor untruthfulness).6\r\n\r\n       In this case, the trial court did not relate any specific facts or circumstances,\r\nother than the mere existence of the convictions, that made them particularly\r\nprobative of Bush's credibility.7 In State v. Ellerbee, 721 S.E.2d 296, 298 (N.C. Ct.\r\nApp. 2012), the State impeached the defendant's witness with a prior conviction for\r\nmanslaughter that was outside the ten-year window of Rule 609(b); the witness\r\nwas convicted in 1986 and released in 1991 (a relatively short time-span, as in this\r\ncase). Although it ultimately relied upon a harmless error analysis, the North\r\nCarolina Court of Appeals held the admission of the manslaughter conviction was\r\nerror because \"the trial court did not make any findings as to the specific facts and\r\ncircumstances regarding the probative value of this conviction.\" Id. at 298-99; cf.\r\nState v. Howard, 396 S.C. 173, 180-81, 720 S.E.2d 511, 515 (Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(\"While the trial court discussed the importance of credibility in this case, the court\r\n6  In general, many serious crimes, even those involving violence, do not directly\r\nimpact a witness's veracity. See generally Cavender, 578 F.2d at 534 n.19 (\"Many\r\ncrimes, [] while perhaps causing the average man to shun their perpetrator, do not\r\nupon analysis support the inference that the person who committed them has a\r\nspecific proclivity for lying on the witness stand.\" (citation omitted)); State v.\r\nBryant, 369 S.C. 511, 517-18, 633 S.E.2d 152, 155-56 (2006) (observing \"a\r\nconviction for robbery, burglary, theft, and drug possession, beyond the basic\r\ncrime itself, is not probative of truthfulness,\" and also that \"Petitioner's prior\r\nfirearms convictions had nothing to do with Petitioner's credibility\"); State v.\r\nCheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 552 S.E.2d 300 (2001) (holding remote convictions for\r\nhousebreaking and grand larceny were properly excluded under the ten-year limit\r\nof Rule 609(b) as the State failed to show why the ten-year limit should be\r\noverridden; the court stated the offenses were not generally considered probative of\r\ntruthfulness); see also 1 McCormick on Evidence § 42, at 189-90 (6th ed. 2006)\r\n(stating federal courts and most state courts do not classify violent offenses such as\r\nrobbery and possession of a weapon as crimes of dishonesty or falsity).\r\n7  The State argued the prior manslaughter convictions were admissible, despite\r\ntheir remoteness, because they involve \"heinous crimes,\" but this does not address\r\ntheir probative value on the issue of veracity. There is no blanket exemption from\r\nthe ten-year rule of Rule 609(b) for convictions of \"heinous crimes\" such as\r\nmurder or manslaughter.\r\n\nfailed to state how Howard's prior ABHANs were probative of his credibility. The\r\ntrial court instead focused on Howard's character, which does not affect the\r\nimpeachment value of his prior crimes.\").\r\n\r\n       The trial court's comments on the length of time Bush had actually served in\r\nprison on the Florida convictions and its reasoning that Bush would have come\r\nwithin the ten-year window if he had received or served a longer sentence under\r\nSouth Carolina law are not persuasive. The plain language of Rule 609(a)(1)\r\nspeaks in terms of \"the law under which the witness was convicted,\" thus we\r\nbelieve South Carolina's possible treatment of the offense is not relevant in this\r\ncontext. Moreover, the plain language of subsection (b) refers expressly to the\r\ndate of a party's release from confinement, without any qualifying language. It is\r\nundisputed that Bush had been released from confinement more than fourteen\r\nyears prior to this trial, and his convictions were already twenty years old. Thus,\r\ndespite the short time served on his sentence, the rationale behind the rule—that\r\nthe more time that has elapsed since the person's confinement, the less relevant is\r\nthe fact of the prior confinement—is still served.\r\n\r\n        A line must always be drawn somewhere, and to disregard the rule's time\r\nlimit on remote convictions based on such suppositions would vitiate the entire\r\npurpose of the rule, which is to settle the question how old a conviction must be to\r\nbe presumptively prejudicial and inadmissible. See United States v. Nguyen, 542\r\nF.3d 275, 281 (1st Cir. 2008) (stating \"Rule 609(b) draws a bright line test at ten\r\nyears–and whenever the law draws a line, some events will fall on the 'other' side,\"\r\nand if the lines are redrawn based on the vagaries of every case or if the bright-line\r\nrule is abandoned entirely in favor of an insistence on considering the equities in\r\neach and every individual case, this \"would create an arguably greater problem\" in\r\nterms of maintaining \"the efficient administration of justice and the . . .\r\npredictability of results\"); United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 418 (4th Cir.\r\n1981) (finding it was immaterial if the remote conviction was \"only\" eleven years\r\nold because \"[t]he Rule provides for no distinctions between convictions of more\r\nrecent 'vintage' and older ones\" as \"[s]uch distinctions would vitiate the very\r\npurpose of the Rule, which is to settle the question of how old a conviction must be\r\nfor its admission presumptively to\" be of prejudice, and the government must meet\r\n\"the heavy burden of rebutting the presumption\").\r\n\r\n      This is particularly true in light of the absence of information of Bush's\r\nsubsequent history since the convictions. Cf. State v. Caruthers, 676 S.W.2d 935,\r\n\n941 (Tenn. 1984) (observing remote convictions over ten years old have been\r\ndetermined to be admissible where there has been a continuing course of criminal\r\nconduct that is probative of credibility).\r\n\r\n       The genesis of the rule's ten-year provision was the belief that after ten\r\nyears, the probative value of the conviction with respect to a person's credibility\r\nhas diminished to the point where it should no longer be admissible; however, a\r\nprovision was added allowing admissibility where exceptional circumstances have\r\nbeen demonstrated. See State v. Russell, 16 P.3d 664, 671 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001)\r\n(explaining that \"convictions over ten years old generally do not have much\r\nprobative value,\" and instead of banning all convictions more than ten years old,\r\nthe rule provides remote convictions may be admitted in very limited and\r\ncompelling circumstances (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       We recognize the trial court's finding that Bush's credibility was important.\r\nHowever, the manslaughter convictions impact Bush’s character not his veracity.\r\nNevertheless, the importance of Bush’s credibility is not singularly determinative.\r\nSee State v. Green, 29 P.3d 271, 275 (Ariz. 2001) (\"The state argues that because\r\nthis case boils down to 'he said, she said,' the probative value of the prior\r\nconvictions is great enough to carry the burden. We find this argument\r\nunpersuasive. There are many cases in which the testimony of one witness is\r\npitted against another. To allow the admission of remote felonies in every such\r\n'swearing contest' would be to effectively defeat the policy that severely limits their\r\nuse.\").In this case, the State did not meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that the\r\nprejudicial effect of the remote manslaughter convictions was substantially\r\noutweighed by their probative value. As a result, the trial court erred in allowing\r\nthe State to use Bush's remote convictions for impeachment purposes.\r\n\r\n      B.     Harmless Error\r\n\r\n       Having found the admission of the remote manslaughter convictions was\r\nerror, this Court must next consider whether their admission was, nevertheless,\r\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\n      An appellate court generally will decline to set aside a conviction due to\r\ninsubstantial errors not affecting the result.

State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992)\r\n(stating error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if it did not contribute to the\r\nverdict obtained); State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 165, 467 S.E.2d 272, 277 (Ct. App.\r\n1996) (\"In applying the harmless error rule, the court must be able to declare the\r\nerror had little, if any, likelihood of having changed the result of the trial and the\r\ncourt must be able to declare such belief beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (citing\r\nChapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967))).\r\n\r\n       \"In determining harmless error regarding any issue of witness credibility, we\r\nwill consider the importance of the witness's testimony to the prosecution's case,\r\nwhether the witness's testimony was cumulative, whether other evidence\r\ncorroborates or contradicts the witness's testimony, the extent of cross-examination\r\notherwise permitted, and the overall strength of the State's case.\" State v. Fossick,\r\n333 S.C. 66, 70, 508 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1998); see also State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326,\r\n333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318 (2002) (listing these factors for assessing harmless error,\r\nas taken from Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)). Van Arsdall\r\ninvolved a Confrontation Clause violation caused by the erroneous exclusion of\r\nevidence of a prosecution witness's bias. In State v. Holmes, this Court specifically\r\nadopted the factors articulated in Van Arsdall for assessing harmless error and held\r\nthese factors shall likewise apply for any error concerning witness credibility.\r\nState v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 265, 464 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1995) (\"While the\r\nharmless error ruling in Van Arsdall dealt specifically with witness bias, we hold\r\nthat the Van Arsdall factors apply with equal force in determining a harmless error\r\nviolation relating to any issue of witness credibility.\").\r\n\r\n       On appeal, Petitioner has argued the trial court \"commit[ted] reversible error\r\nby allowing the State to impeach [his] corroborating witness with two Florida\r\nmanslaughter convictions from 1987.\" However, the State also impeached\r\nPetitioner's witness with a 1987 conviction for shooting/throwing a deadly missile.\r\nThis conviction occurred at the same time as the manslaughter convictions and\r\nostensibly arose from the same set of facts. Since Petitioner does not challenge the\r\nuse of this conviction to impeach Bush's credibility, this ruling, right or wrong,\r\nbecomes the law of the case. See, e.g., Carolina Chloride, Inc. v. Richland County,\r\n394 S.C. 154, 714 S.E.2d 869 (2011) (stating an unchallenged ruling, right or\r\nwrong, becomes the law of the case); Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d\r\n514 (2000) (observing where the appealing party does not challenge a ruling, it\r\n\nbecomes the law of the case and will not be considered by this Court); see also\r\nRule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not\r\nset forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.\").\r\n\r\n      Bush's unchallenged prior conviction for shooting/throwing a deadly missile\r\ninvolves a serious felony offense, for which Bush was given a consecutive\r\nsentence of seven years in prison.8 We find the jury's knowledge of this conviction\r\nunquestionably established the fact that Bush was a former convict, and it would\r\nhave similarly diminished the jury's view of his character. Cf. Mason v. State, 756\r\nP.2d 612 (Okla. Crim. App. 1988) (holding the erroneous admission of a prior\r\nmanslaughter conviction was harmless error where the witness was already\r\nimpeached by other evidence of prior convictions).\r\n\r\n       We disagree with the dissent's conclusion that the error here could not be\r\ndeemed harmless based on application of the Van Arsdall factors. The Supreme\r\nCourt noted in its decision that the factors were not exclusive; further, it gave no\r\nindication that any single factor was dispositive. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684\r\n(\"Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of\r\nfactors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts.\" (emphasis added)). The Court\r\nobserved that it had \"repeatedly reaffirmed the principle\" that a conviction should\r\nnot be set aside if a reviewing court may say, on the whole record, that the error\r\nwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as a defendant is entitled to a fair trial,\r\nnot a perfect one. Id. at 681.\r\n\r\n       In the current appeal, we believe a review of the entire record indicates the\r\nerror was harmless under the circumstances. In addition to the fact that Bush's\r\ncredibility had already been significantly compromised by the revelation that he\r\nwas a former convict, we note, in considering the overall strength of the State's\r\ncase, that Petitioner's own credibility was seriously impeached at trial as well by\r\ntestimony that he had a criminal record that included two prior offenses for CSC\r\nwith a minor. In addition, an investigator with the Pickens County Sheriff's\r\nDepartment testified that he had contacted Petitioner before the incident alleged\r\nhere and specifically warned him that the Minor was only 15 years old. Petitioner\r\n\r\n8  This offense is identified as a felony in the second degree. Under Florida law a\r\nfelony in the second degree carries a sentence of up to fifteen years, Fla. Stat. Ann.\r\n§ 775.082(3)(c) (Supp. 2012), which equals the fifteen-year sentence Bush actually\r\nreceived on his manslaughter convictions.\r\n\nacknowledged this conversation and conceded that he knew having a relationship\r\nwith a 15-year-old could get him in \"trouble.\"\r\n\r\n       It was undisputed that the Minor was at Bush's home to visit Petitioner the\r\nnight of the incident, and there was evidence at trial that conflicted with that of\r\nBush and Petitioner and that corroborated the Minor's version of events. For\r\nexample, despite Petitioner's and Bush's testimony that the Minor never left the\r\nconfines of the living room, the Minor was able to describe some of the contents of\r\nBush's bedroom, where she maintained Petitioner had taken her to have sex.\r\nMoreover, there was corroborating evidence from Candie Hudson, who picked up\r\nthe Minor from Bush's home around 11:00 p.m., that she saw blood on the Minor's\r\nunderwear after they returned to Candie's home, that she helped the Minor wash\r\nthe garment, and that the Minor asked to borrow another pair from her. There has\r\nbeen no allegation any limitation was placed on the parties' ability to conduct\r\ncross-examination. Considering the foregoing and all of the other evidence\r\nadduced at trial, we find the admission of the additional impeachment evidence\r\nagainst Bush could not reasonably have affected the jury's result in this case and\r\nwe deem the error harmless beyond any reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIV.   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Rule 609(b) imposes a high standard for the admissibility of remote\r\nconvictions. We conclude the factual findings and legal analysis the trial court\r\nrelied upon do not demonstrate that the probative value of the remote manslaughter\r\nconvictions substantially outweighed their prejudicial effect. Consequently, we\r\nhold the trial court abused its discretion in admitting these convictions. However,\r\nPetitioner does not challenge on appeal the trial court's admission of the defense\r\nwitness's prior conviction for shooting/throwing a deadly missile, and this\r\nconviction was also used to impeach the witness. Since its admission is now the\r\nlaw of the case, we find any error in the admission of the two remote manslaughter\r\nconvictions was harmless as the defense witness's character was similarly\r\ndiminished by the admission of the unchallenged conviction for shooting/throwing\r\na deadly missile, and the record as a whole indicates the error could not reasonably\r\nhave impacted the result reached in this case.\r\n\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n       TOAL, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting\r\nin a separate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent. I agree with the majority that the\r\nCourt of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court’s decision to allow Bush,\r\npetitioner’s only witness, to be impeached by two remote manslaughter\r\nconvictions. I disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion that this improper\r\nimpeachment was harmless error.\r\n\r\nThe test for determining whether an error involving a witness’s credibility9 is\r\nharmless is derived from Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986). See\r\nState v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 464 S.E.2d 334 (1995); State v. Gadsden, 314 S.C.\r\n229, 442 S.E.2d 594 (1994). The first inquiry is into the importance of the\r\nwitness’s testimony to the proponent’s case, then whether the witness’s testimony\r\nwas cumulative and whether other evidence contradicts or corroborates this\r\nwitness’s testimony, and finally we look to the strength of the State’s case. Here,\r\nthe case was largely a credibility contest between petitioner and the victim, a\r\nclassic “he said, she said” contest without any physical evidence. Bush was the\r\nonly other person present at the time of the alleged incident, and his testimony was\r\ncritical to petitioner’s defense. While I agree that under some circumstances an\r\nerror in permitting a witness to be impeached by prior convictions can be deemed\r\nharmless in light of another unobjected-to impeachment, I do not find those\r\ncircumstances present here. Compare e.g. State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 306\r\nS.E.2d 611(1983)(in lewd act prosecution, defendant’s erroneous impeachment\r\nwith manslaughter harmless in light of proper impeachment with second degree\r\nrape conviction).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the erroneous impeachment of Bush by the two manslaughter\r\nconvictions cannot be deemed harmless because he was also impeached by a\r\nweapons offense. State v. Holmes, supra. I would reverse the decision of the\r\nCourt of Appeals, and remand the case for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n9 The issue is whether the court improperly permitted Bush’s credibility to be\r\nimpeached by his prior conviction under Rule 609, SCRE, yet the majority at times\r\ntreats the question as one of character impeachment. See Rule 608, SCRE. I do\r\nnot agree that Rule 608 is relevant to our analysis or decision here.\r\n \r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27177","title":"Jennings v.

The circuit court granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of Broome on all claims, including violation of the federal\r\nStored Communications Act (SCA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701-12. The court of\r\nappeals reversed, finding that the e-mails she obtained from hacking\r\nJennings' account were in electronic storage and thus covered by the SCA.\r\nWe reverse.   FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       The computer hacking at issue here emanated from a domestic dispute.\r\nAfter finding a card for flowers for another woman in her husband’s car, Gail\r\nJennings confronted him. Jennings confessed he had fallen in love with\r\nsomeone else, and although he refused to divulge her name, he admitted the\r\ntwo had been corresponding via e-mail for some time. Gail confided this\r\nsituation to her daughter-in-law, Holly Broome.1 Broome had previously\r\nworked for Jennings and knew he maintained a personal Yahoo! e-mail\r\naccount. She thereafter accessed his account by guessing the correct answers\r\nto his security questions and read the e-mails exchanged between Jennings\r\nand his paramour. Broome then printed out copies of the incriminating e-\r\nmails and gave them to Thomas Neal, Gail’s attorney in the divorce\r\nproceedings, and Brenda Cooke, a private investigator Gail hired.\r\n\r\n       When Jennings discovered his e-mail account had been hacked, he filed\r\nsuit against Gail, Broome, and Cooke, individually and as shareholder of BJR\r\nInternational Detective Agency, Inc., for invasion of privacy, conspiracy, and\r\nviolations of the South Carolina Homeland Security Act, South Carolina\r\nCode Ann. § 17-30-135 (2010). He later amended his complaint to include\r\nan allegation that the defendants violated the SCA. Jennings also moved to\r\nadd Neal as a defendant. The circuit court denied this motion and granted\r\n\r\n1   Broome is married to Gail's son from a previous marriage.\r\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims, including the\r\nallegations under the SCA. Jennings appealed. The court of appeals\r\naffirmed the grant of summary judgment as to Gail, Cooke, and BJR.\r\nJennings v. Jennings, 389 S.C. 190, 209, 697 S.E.2d 671, 681 (Ct. App.\r\n2010). However, the court reversed the circuit court's grant of summary\r\njudgment in favor of Broome only as to the SCA claim, finding that the e-\r\nmails at issue were in \"electronic storage\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2510(17). Id. at 198-208, 697 S.E.2d at 675-680. We granted certiorari.\r\n\r\n                            ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      Did the court of appeals err in reversing the circuit court's grant of\r\nsummary judgment because the e-mails in question were not in \"electronic\r\nstorage\" as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2510?2\r\n\r\n                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      In arguing the court of appeals erred by holding the e-mails were in\r\nelectronic storage, Broome contends the court misunderstood the definition\r\nof electronic storage under the Act and incorrectly concluded the e-mails had\r\nbeen stored for the purpose of backup protection. We agree.\r\n\r\n       \"Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law,\r\nand this Court reviews questions of law de novo.\" Town of Summerville v.\r\nCity of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008).\r\n\"Statutory construction must begin with the language of the statute.\" Kofa v.\r\nU.S. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 60 F.3d 1084, 1088 (4th Cir. 1995).\r\n\"In interpreting statutory language, words are generally given their common\r\nand ordinary meaning.\" Nat'l Coal. for Students with Disabilities Educ. &\r\nLegal Def. Fund v. Allen, 152 F.3d 283, 288 (4th Cir. 1998). Where the\r\nlanguage of the statute is unambiguous, the Court's inquiry is over, and the\r\nstatute must be applied according to its plain meaning. Hall v. McCoy, 89 F.\r\nSupp. 2d 742, 745 (W.D. Va. 2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n2The definitions of section 2510 pertaining to the Wiretap Act are\r\nincorporated into the SCA. 18 U.S.C § 2711(1).\r\n\n      Under section 2701(a) of the SCA, anyone who:\r\n\r\n      (1) intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through\r\n      which an electronic communication service is provided; or\r\n\r\n      (2) intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility;\r\n\r\n      and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a\r\n      wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage\r\n      in such system shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of\r\n      this section.\r\n\r\n18 U.S.C. § 2701(a). This section thus proscribes the unauthorized accessing\r\nof an electronic communication while it is in \"electronic storage.\" The SCA\r\ndefines \"electronic storage\" as \"(A) any temporary, intermediate storage of a\r\nwire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission\r\nthereof; and (B) any storage of such communication by an electronic\r\ncommunication service for the purposes of backup protection of such\r\ncommunication.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17). For Jennings to succeed in his\r\nclaim against Broome under the SCA, he must prove the e-mails she accessed\r\nwere in electronic storage as defined in section 2510(17). His argument in\r\nthis regard extends only to subsection (B) of the Act; Jennings has never\r\nargued that the e-mails in questions were in electronic storage pursuant to\r\nsubsection (A).\r\n\r\n      The court of appeals agreed with Jennings and held the e-mails were in\r\n\"electronic storage\" because they were stored for backup protection pursuant\r\nto subsection (B). Broome argues this conclusion was based upon an\r\nimproper interpretation of section 2510(17), asserting that the definition of\r\n\"electronic storage\" within the SCA requires that it must be both temporary\r\nand intermediate storage incident to transmission of the communication and\r\nstorage for the purposes of backup protection. She therefore contends that an\r\ne-mail must meet both subsection (A) and subsection (B) to be covered by the\r\nSCA. We acknowledge that this reading is the interpretation espoused by\r\nthe Department of Justice as the \"traditional interpretation\" of section\r\n2510(17). However, it has been rejected by the majority of courts in favor of\r\na construction that an e-mail can be in electronic storage if it meets either (A)\r\n\nor (B). See, e.g., Theofel v. Farey-Jones, 359 F.3d 1066, 1075 (9th Cir.\r\n2004); Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 352 F.3d 107, 114 (3d Cir. 2003),\r\naff'g in part, vacating in part, and remanding 135 F. Supp. 2d 623 (E.D. Pa.\r\n2001); Strategic Wealth Group, LLC v. Canno, No. 10-0321, 2011 WL\r\n346592, at *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 4, 2011); Cornerstone Consultants, Inc. v.\r\nProd. Input Solutions, LLC, 789 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1055 (N.D. Iowa 2011);\r\nShefts v. Petrakis, No. 10-cv-1104, 2011 WL 5930469, at *5 (C.D. Ill. Nov.\r\n29, 2011); Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 983 (C.D.\r\nCal. 2010); U.S. v. Weaver, 636 F. Supp. 2d 768, 771 (C.D. Ill. 2009); Flagg\r\nv. City of Detroit, 252 F.R.D. 346, 362 (E.D. Mich. 2008). Because Jennings\r\nhas only argued his e-mails were in electronic storage pursuant to subsection\r\n(B), it is unnecessary for us to determine whether to adopt the traditional\r\ninterpretation advocated by the Department of Justice or the interpretation\r\nrecognized by these cases. See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d\r\n26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"[W]hatever doesn't make any difference, doesn't\r\nmatter.\").\r\n\r\n       In finding the e-mails were stored for \"purposes of backup protection\"\r\nand thus subject to subsection (B), the court of appeals relied heavily on\r\nTheofel, a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\r\nIn Theofel, Integrated Capital Associates (ICA) was involved in commercial\r\nlitigation with Farey-Jones. Theofel, 359 F.3d at 1071. Counsel for Farey-\r\nJones subpoenaed ICA's internet service provider, NetGate, for the\r\nproduction of all e-mails sent or received by anyone at ICA \"with no\r\nlimitation as to time or scope.\" Id. NetGate complied as well as it could with\r\nsuch a voluminous request, but when ICA discovered this disclosure it filed a\r\nmotion to quash the subpoena and requested the imposition of sanctions. Id.\r\nAdditionally, several of the employees whose e-mails had been delivered by\r\nNetGate filed a civil suit against Farey-Jones for, inter alia, violations of the\r\nSCA in gaining unauthorized access to communications in electronic storage.\r\nId. The court in Theofel held that ICA's e-mails which had been received and\r\nread, and then left on the server instead of being deleted, could be\r\ncharacterized as being stored \"for purposes of backup protection\" and\r\ntherefore kept in electronic storage under subsection (B). Id. at 1075. We\r\nquestion the reasoning expressed in Theofel that such passive inaction can\r\nconstitute storage for backup protection under the SCA; however, because we\r\nbelieve the plain language of subsection (B) does not apply to the e-mails in\r\n\nquestion, we reverse the conclusion of the court of appeals that they were in\r\nelectronic storage under Theofel.\r\n\r\n      After opening them, Jennings left the single copies of his e-mails on the\r\nYahoo! server and apparently did not download them or save another copy of\r\nthem in any other location. We decline to hold that retaining an opened e-\r\nmail constitutes storing it for backup protection under the Act. The ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word \"backup\" is \"one that serves as a substitute or support.\"\r\nMerriam-Webster                  Dictionary,             http://www.merriam-\r\nwebster.com/dictionary/backup.        Thus, Congress's use of \"backup\"\r\nnecessarily presupposes the existence of another copy to which this e-mail\r\nwould serve as a substitute or support. We see no reason to deviate from the\r\nplain, everyday meaning of the word \"backup,\" and conclude that as the\r\nsingle copy of the communication, Jennings' e-mails could not have been\r\nstored for backup protection.\r\n\r\n        Accordingly, we find these e-mails were not in electronic storage. We\r\nemphasize that although we reject the contention that Broome's actions give\r\nrise to a claim under the SCA, this should in no way be read as condoning her\r\nbehavior. Instead, we only hold that she is not liable under the SCA because\r\nthe e-mails in question do not meet the definition of \"electronic storage\"\r\nunder the Act.                CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we reverse the court of appeals' opinion and\r\nreinstate the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in favor of\r\nBroome.\r\n\r\n     KITTREDGE, J., concurs. TOAL, C.J., concurring in result in a\r\nseparate opinion in which BEATTY, J., concurs. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in result in a separate opinion.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I concur in result, but write separately to express\r\nmy concern with Justice Hearn's adoption of the approach taken in United\r\nStates v. Weaver, 636 F. Supp. 2d 769 (C.D. Ill. 2009). I believe the\r\n\"traditional interpretation\" of the Stored Communications Act (SCA), 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 2701–12 (2000 & Supp. 2011), advanced by the Department of\r\nJustice (DOJ), coupled with the fact that Congress never contemplated this\r\nnew form of technology, provide a sounder basis to reach our decision.\r\n\r\n       In Weaver, the court addressed the government's subpoena of e-mails in\r\na defendant's Hotmail account and whether the e-mails were in \"electronic\r\nstorage,\" a determination which would dictate whether the government would\r\nneed to obtain a warrant for the e-mails or whether a trial subpoena was\r\nsufficient. 636 F. Supp. 2d at 769–71. Weaver held that courts may issue a\r\ntrial subpoena to compel internet service providers (ISPs) to produce the\r\ncontent of opened e-mails stored by a website provider for 180 days or fewer\r\nbecause such e-mails are not in \"electronic storage.\" Id. at 71–73. Weaver\r\nrelied on dicta found in Theofel v. Farey-Jones, 359 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir.\r\n2004), to conclude that Theofel's holding applies only to e-mail systems\r\nwhere users download messages from the ISP's server onto their computers,\r\nand that e-mails stored in the cloud should not be considered stored for\r\nbackup purposes. Id. at 72. Similar to Weaver, Justice Hearn concludes here\r\nthat because Jennings left his e-mails on the Yahoo! Server and apparently\r\ndid not download them from the server or retain a copy of them in any other\r\nlocation, the emails could not be held for \"backup protection\" within the\r\nmeaning of the statute.\r\n\r\n      Justice Hearn relies on the Merriam-Webster Dictionary to argue that\r\nthe definition of \"backup\" requires that there must be more than one copy of\r\nthe email. The exact definition of \"backup\" varies from dictionary to\r\ndictionary. See, e.g., Webster's Third International Dictionary, Unabridged\r\n120 (3rd ed. 2002). Assuming for the sake of analysis that the definition of\r\n\"backup\" is \"one that serves as a substitute or support,\" as Justice Hearn\r\ncontends, this definition would suggest that an email message on an ISP's\r\nserver could be stored for support in the event that the user needs to retrieve\r\nit. As such, even if there is no second copy, the email could still constitute\r\n\"backup protection.\"\r\n\n       Nevertheless, even if I could interpret \"backup\" in this matter, in a\r\nstatute such as this, I am reluctant to read the word \"backup\" in isolation, but\r\ninstead the phrase \"backup protection\" should be viewed in a statutory and\r\nhistorical context. As Professor Kerr explains:\r\n\r\n      An understanding of the structure of the SCA indicates that the\r\n      backup provision of the definition of electronic storage, see id. §\r\n      2510(17)(B), exists only to ensure that the government cannot\r\n      make an end-run around the privacy-protecting ECS rules by\r\n      attempting to access backup copies of unopened e-mails made by\r\n      the ISP for its administrative purposes. ISPs regularly generate\r\n      backup copies of their servers in the event of a server crash or\r\n      other problem, and they often store these copies for the long\r\n      term. Section 2510(17)(B) provides that backup copies of\r\n      unopened e-mails are protected by the ECS . . . .\r\n\r\n           There are many statutory signals that support this\r\n      reading. Several were raised by the United States as amicus and\r\n      rejected by the Theofel court, see Theofel, 359 F.3d at 1076-77,\r\n      but a host of other arguments remain. I think the most obvious\r\n      statutory signal is the text of 18 U.S.C. § 2704, entitled “Backup\r\n      Preservation.” See 18 U.S.C. § 2704 (2000). Section 2704 makes\r\n      clear that the SCA uses the phrase “backup copy” in a very\r\n      technical way to mean a copy made by the service provider for\r\n      administrative purposes. See id. The statutory focus on backup\r\n      copies in the SCA was likely inspired by the 1985 Office of\r\n      Technology Assessment report that had helped inspire the\r\n      passage of the SCA. See Office of Tech. Assessment, Federal\r\n      Government Information Technology: Electronic Surveillance\r\n      and Civil Liberties (1985). The report highlighted the special\r\n      privacy threats raised by backup copies, which the report referred\r\n      to as copies “[r]etained by the [e]lectronic [m]ail [c]ompany for\r\n      [a]dministrative [p]urposes.” Id. at 50.\r\n\r\nOrin Kerr, A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a\r\nLegislator's Guide to Amending It, 72 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1208, 1217 n.61\r\n(2004); see also Pure Power Boot Camp v. Warrior Fitness Boot Camp, 587\r\n\nF. Supp. 2d 548, 555 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (\"The majority of courts which have\r\naddressed the issue have determined that e-mail stored on an electronic\r\ncommunication service provider's systems after it has been delivered, as\r\nopposed to e-mail stored on personal computer, is a stored communication\r\nsubject to the SCA.\") (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, I am concerned that Justice Hearn's position on \"backup\r\nprotection\" potentially leads to illogical results. Weaver, itself, concluded\r\nthat the outcome would be different if a Hotmail user \"opt[ed] to connect an\r\ne-mail program, such as Microsoft Outlook, to his or her Hotmail account\r\nand through it download[ed] messages onto a personal computer.\" Id. Under\r\nWeaver's rule, the privacy protections of personal e-mail are contingent upon\r\nthe operation of the e-mail system used.3 It is not necessary for this Court to\r\nrely on Theofel dicta, which would lead us down the precarious path of\r\nsaying that if one uses Microsoft Outlook for e-mail, one will be protected,\r\nbut if one uses Yahoo! Mail for e-mail, there is no protection. Griffin v.\r\nOceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 575, 102 S. Ct. 3245, 3252 (1982)\r\n(holding \"interpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are\r\nto be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative\r\n3 Theofel stated in dicta, \"A remote computing service might be the only place a\r\nuser stores his messages; in that case, the messages are not stored for backup\r\npurposes.\" 359 F.3d at 1077. Relying on this, Weaver distinguished Theofel and\r\nclaimed that it does not apply to web-based e-mail services where e-mails are\r\nstored in the cloud. 636 F. Supp. 2d at 771–73. Nevertheless, being stored in the\r\ncloud just means that the e-mails are stored on a Yahoo Mail server. See Accessing\r\nYahoo! Mail (March 8, 2012), available at www. help.yahoo.com/tutorials/. The\r\ndistinction between being stored on a Yahoo! Mail Server and being stored on the\r\nISP's server in Theofel in the context of backup storage is slight in my view.\r\nCompare id. with Theofel, 359 F.3d at 1070, 1075. In addition, based on its dicta,\r\nTheofel never explicitly excluded web-based e-mails but spoke of \"remote\r\ncomputing service[s].\" Some courts, including our court of appeals, have\r\nconcluded that web-based e-mail services like Yahoo! provide both electronic\r\ncommunication services (ECS) and remote computing service (RCS) making it\r\nproblematic to rely on Theofel's dicta to exclude web-based e-mails as Weaver has\r\ndone. See, e.g., In re Application of the U.S. for a Search Warrant, for Contents of\r\nElec. Mail and for an Order Directing a Provider of Elec. Commc'n Servs. to Not\r\nDisclose the Existence of the Search Warrant, 665 F. Supp. 2d 1210, 1214 (D. Or.\r\n2009).\r\n\npurpose are available.\"); see also Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 91, 533\r\nS.E.2d 578, 584 (2000) (citation omitted) (\"However plain the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that\r\nmeaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it\r\ncould not possibly have been intended by the Legislature . . . .\").\r\n\r\n       Instead, I advocate a rejection of Theofel entirely and the adoption of\r\nthe \"traditional interpretation\" of the SCA, which tracks the statutory\r\nlanguage and comports with legislative history. Prosecuting Computer\r\nCrimes, DOJML Comment 9-3.000, 5 Department of Justice Manual (Supp.\r\n2011–13) [hereinafter DOJML Comment 9-3.000]; see also Kerr, supra, at\r\n1216–18 (advocating the traditional approach and arguing that \"the Ninth\r\nCircuit's analysis in [Theofel] is quite implausible and hard to square with the\r\nstatutory text\"). Under this approach, the term \"electronic storage\" has a\r\nnarrow, statutorily defined meaning. DOJML Comment 9-3.000. It does not\r\nsimply mean storage of information by electronic means. Rather section\r\n2510(17) provides:\r\n\r\n      (17) “electronic storage” means—\r\n\r\n            (A) any temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or\r\n            electronic communication incidental to the electronic\r\n            transmission thereof; and\r\n\r\n            (B) any storage of such communication by an electronic\r\n            communication service for purposes of backup protection\r\n            of such communication;\r\n\r\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(17) (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       I disagree with Justice Hearn's position that an e-mail is covered under\r\nsection 2701(a) of the SCA if it meets the criteria of \"either subsection (A) or\r\nsubsection (B).\" (emphasis in original). Plainly read, the definition of\r\nelectronic storage encompasses both subsections A and B. I do not rely on\r\nBroome's over-analysis of the word \"such\" in the phrase \"such\r\ncommunication\" to reach this conclusion. Rather, I turn to the structure of\r\nthe statutory text and also to the unambiguous use of the conjunctive \"and.\"\r\n\nBoth subsections A and B are subsumed under section 17, which starts out\r\nwith the phrase \"'electronic storage' means—,\" suggesting that the definition\r\nof electronic storage encompasses both subsections A and B. Furthermore,\r\nsubsections A and B are connected by the conjunctive \"and\" indicating that\r\nthey must be read together. See Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. ___, 131\r\nS. Ct. 1068, 1078 (2011) (noting that \"linking independent ideas is the job of\r\na coordinating junction like 'and'\"). Had Congress intended two alternative\r\ndefinitions for electronic storage then it would have used the disjunctive\r\nparticle \"or\" in place of \"and.\" See, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S.\r\n330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 2331 (1979) (\"Canons of construction ordinarily\r\nsuggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings,\r\nunless the context dictates otherwise.\"); K & A Acquisition Group, LLC v.\r\nIsland Pointe, LLC, 383 S.C. 563, 580, 682 S.E.2d 252, 261 (2009) (The \"use\r\nof the word 'or' in a statute 'is a disjunctive particle that marks an\r\nalternative.'\"). Justice Hearn's approach would delete a word and insert a\r\nnew one into the statutory text, effectively writing out subsection A from the\r\ndefinition of electronic storage.\r\n\r\n       Thus, in my view, electronic storage refers only to temporary storage,\r\nmade in the course of transmission, by an ECS provider, and to backups of\r\nsuch intermediate communications. Under this interpretation, if an e-mail\r\nhas been received by a recipient's service provider but has not yet been\r\nopened by the recipient, it is in electronic storage. Steve Jackson Games, Inc.\r\nv. United States Secret Serv., 36 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that\r\ne-mail which had been sent to a bulletin board but not read by intended\r\nrecipients was \"in 'electronic storage'\"). When the recipient opens the e-mail,\r\nhowever, the communication reaches its final destination. DOJML Comment\r\n9-3.000. If the recipient chooses to retain a copy of the e-mail on the service\r\nprovider's system, the retained copy is no longer in electronic storage because\r\nit is no longer in \"temporary, intermediate storage . . . incidental to . . .\r\nelectronic transmission.\" Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 135 F. Supp.\r\n2d 623, 635–36 (E.D. Pa. 2001), aff'd in part 352 F.3d 107, 114 (3d Cir.\r\n2004) (upholding district court's ruling on other grounds); In re Doubleclick\r\nInc. Privacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 511–13 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)\r\n(emphasizing that electronic storage should have a narrow interpretation\r\n\nbased on statutory language and legislative intent and holding that cookies\r\nfall outside of the definition of electronic storage because of their \"long-term\r\nresidence on plaintiffs' hard drives\").\r\n\r\n       In this case, the circuit court judge found that the e-mails were\r\n\"received, opened and read by [Jennings] . . . .\" Because the e-mails were\r\nalready opened by Jennings when they were retrieved and printed out by\r\nBroome, they reached their final destination and fell outside the scope of the\r\ndefinition of electronic storage under the statute, which requires the e-mails\r\nto be in \"temporary, intermediate storage . . . incidental to the electronic\r\ntransmission thereof.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17).\r\n\r\n       Much of the difficulty in applying the SCA to cases such as this arises\r\nbecause of the discrepancy between current technology and the technology\r\navailable in 1986 when the SCA was first enacted. When the SCA was\r\nenacted, the process of network communication was still in its infancy; the\r\nWorld Wide Web, and the Internet as we know it, did not arrive until 1990.\r\nWilliam Jeremy Robison, Free At What Cost?: Cloud Computing Privacy\r\nUnder the Stored Communications Act, 98 Geo. L.J. 1195, 1198 (2010). An\r\nexamination of how the Senate viewed e-mails in 1986 indicates just how\r\nstrikingly different the technology was compared to the present:\r\n\r\n      Electronic mail is a form of communication by which private\r\n      correspondence is transmitted over public and private telephone\r\n      lines. In its most common form, messages are typed into a\r\n      computer terminal, and then transmitted over telephone lines to a\r\n      recipient computer operated by an electronic mail company. If\r\n      the intended addressee subscribes to the service, the message is\r\n      stored by the company's computer \"mail box\" until the subscriber\r\n      calls the company to retrieve its mail, which is then routed over\r\n      the telephone system to the recipient's computer. If the addressee\r\n      is not a subscriber to the service, the electronic mail company can\r\n      put the message onto paper and then deposit it in the normal\r\n      postal system.\r\n\r\nS. Rep. No. 99-541, at 7 (1986). Viewing the statutory language of the SCA\r\nin this context, the traditional definition of electronic storage becomes more\r\n\nreasonable. The SCA is ill-fitted to address many modern day issues, but it is\r\nthis Court's duty to interpret, not legislate. Moreover, I agree with Justice\r\nHearn that it is prudent to limit our analysis to the language before us and\r\ngive the language its literal meaning. However, I believe doing so requires us\r\nto adopt the traditional interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17) rather than rely\r\non the reasoning advanced by United States v. Weaver. 636 F. Supp. 2d at\r\n769–73. Jennings and similarly situated plaintiffs are not foreclosed from\r\nseeking redress by alternative theories, but under the SCA, Broome's actions\r\ndo not give rise to a claim because the e-mails in question do not meet the\r\ndefinition of electronic storage.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in result. I agree with Chief Justice Toal\r\nthat “electronic storage” under the Stored Communications Act (SCA) refers\r\nto temporary storage of communications during the course of transmission,\r\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(17)(A), and to backups of those communications, §\r\n2510(17)(B). However, I view these two types of storage as necessarily\r\ndistinct from one another: one is temporary and incidental to transmission;\r\nthe other is a secondary copy created for backup purposes by the service\r\nprovider.4 Therefore, an e-mail is protected if it falls under the definition of\r\neither subsection (A) or (B). It does not end the inquiry to find that the e-\r\nmails at issue were not in temporary storage during the course of\r\ntransmission (subsection (A)). Accordingly, because the e-mails in this case\r\nwere also not copies made by Jennings’s service provider for purposes of\r\nbackup (subsection (B)), they were not protected by the SCA.5 I therefore\r\nconcur in result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The “backup” covered by subsection (B) is a copy made by the service provider\r\nto back up its own servers. It does not include an original e-mail that has been\r\ntransmitted to the recipient and remains on the provider’s server after the recipient\r\nhas opened or downloaded it.

Carter, of Manning, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed formal charges\r\nagainst Eleazer Carter for alleged misconduct that occurred during his\r\nrepresentation of Stacey Daniels in a civil suit. Following a hearing, a Panel from\r\nthe Commission on Lawyer Conduct found Carter violated five rules of\r\nprofessional conduct, and accordingly recommended he receive an admonition, pay\r\nthe costs of the proceedings, and complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program's\r\nEthics School within six months. Neither ODC nor Carter took exceptions to the\r\nPanel's findings or recommendations. Nevertheless, we find a greater sanction is\r\nwarranted and publicly reprimand Carter.\r\n\r\n                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn September 2008, Stacey Daniels engaged legal counsel and filed a civil lawsuit\r\narising from a car accident. However, counsel was relieved by consent in May\r\n2009, and Daniels subsequently contacted Carter seeking representation. Daniels\r\nmet with Carter at his office, and they discussed the fee arrangement, prior\r\n\nsettlement offers, authorization for medical records, and possible witnesses if the\r\ncase went to trial.1 At the time, discovery and some settlement negotiations had\r\nalready taken place.\r\n\r\nIn September 2009, Daniels attended a roster meeting for his case. Although\r\nCarter was not present, Daniels informed the circuit judge Carter was representing\r\nhim. Carter happened to be at the courthouse on another matter and was brought to\r\nthe meeting where he confirmed to the judge and opposing counsel he was\r\nrepresenting Daniels. The judge continued the case until the next term of court.\r\n\r\nWhen the case appeared on the roster in March 2010, Carter again failed to appear,\r\nalthough Daniels was present. Opposing counsel moved to dismiss the case, but\r\nthe judge again continued it until the next term. The following month, the\r\ndefendant served Carter with notice of the deposition of Daniels,2 but Carter never\r\ninformed Daniels of the date, and neither Daniels nor Carter attended the\r\ndeposition. Additionally, Carter never told opposing counsel he would not be at\r\nthe deposition or that he was not representing Daniels. Opposing counsel\r\nsubsequently moved to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute, and when the case\r\ncame up again for trial, the judge called Carter and informed him the case was\r\ngoing forward. Carter knew Daniels was incarcerated when he received the\r\nmotion, but he never contacted him about it. Carter argued the motion to dismiss,\r\nduring which he informed the court he was not representing Daniels. The case was\r\nultimately dismissed. Upon receipt of the order of dismissal, Carter forwarded it to\r\nDaniels with a handwritten note stating the case had been dismissed because they\r\nhad not appeared in court. Daniels subsequently filed a grievance with the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before a Panel from the Commission, Carter argued he had never\r\nbeen representing Daniels because Daniels never signed his fee agreement.\r\nAlternatively, he contended that if he was Daniels' lawyer, he represented him\r\ndiligently. Based on the foregoing facts, the Panel found Carter in violation of\r\n\r\n1 Daniels alleges he signed the fee agreement at this initial meeting, but was never\r\ngiven a copy. Carter maintains Daniels never signed the agreement and took the\r\nblank form when he left.\r\n2 The testimony on the scheduling of this deposition is conflicting. Counsel for the\r\ndefendant testified that his secretary scheduled the deposition with Carter\r\npersonally. Carter stated he did not recall that conversation taking place, although\r\nhe admitted she may have talked to someone in his office.\r\n\nRules 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, and 8.4(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR. In determining the\r\nproper sanction, the Panel considered Carter's extensive disciplinary history in\r\naggravation. Carter was admitted in 1989. In January 2002, he received a letter of\r\ncaution with a finding of minor misconduct citing Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.3\r\n(diligence), 1.15 (safekeeping of property), 8.1(a) (cooperation with disciplinary\r\ninvestigation), RPC and Rule 417, SCACR (financial recordkeeping). Shortly\r\nthereafter in July 2002, Carter received another letter of caution finding minor\r\nmisconduct under Rule 1.16(b) (declining or terminating representation). In July\r\n2008—around the time he began representation of Daniels—he received another\r\nletter of caution citing misconduct under Rules 1.5 (fees), 8.4(e) (conduct\r\nprejudicial to the administration of justice), RPC and Rule 416, SCACR (failure to\r\ncomply with decision of Resolution of Fee Disputes Board). Finally, Carter\r\nreceived two letters of caution in May 2010 with findings of minor misconduct\r\nunder Rules 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 5.3 (supervision of nonlawyers),\r\n8.1(b) (cooperating with disciplinary investigation), and 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial\r\nto the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nThe Panel therefore recommended Carter receive an admonition, pay the cost of\r\nthe proceedings, and complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program's Ethics\r\nSchool within six months of the Court's order.\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nNeither party took exception to the Panel Report; thus, the parties are deemed to\r\nhave accepted the Panel's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\nrecommendations. Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Nevertheless, \"[t]his\r\nCourt has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate\r\nsanction after a thorough review of the record.\" In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10,\r\n539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000). The Court may make its own findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law; however, although it is not bound by the findings of the Panel,\r\nthe Court gives great deference to its findings. In re White, 378 S.C. 333, 340-41,\r\n663 S.E.2d 21, 26 (2008).\r\n\r\nThe initial issue is whether Carter formed an attorney-client relationship with\r\nDaniels giving rise to his duty to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\nCarter contended that he was not representing Daniels because they had no written\r\nfee agreement and the Rules of Professional Conduct—as well as opinions of this\r\nCourt—require a signed agreement when, as here, the fee is on a contingent basis.\r\nTechnically, Carter's argument is correct. See Rule 1.5(c), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n\nSCACR (\"A contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing signed by the client . . .\r\n.); see also In re Atwater, 355 S.C. 620, 621, 586 S.E.2d 589, 590 (2003) (publicly\r\nreprimanding attorney who failed, inter alia, to maintain a signed copy of a fee\r\nagreement with a client); In re McDonough, 348 S.C. 197, 198, 559 S.E.2d 832,\r\n832 (1996) (disbarring lawyer for violations including failing to obtain a written\r\ncopy of contingency fee agreement). However, Rule 1.5 and our opinions\r\nsanctioning lawyers for violation of this rule are designed to protect clients from\r\ninadequate representation, not to determine the presence of an attorney-client\r\nrelationship. Moreover, we have also held that the existence of a retainer is not in\r\nand of itself dispositive of whether an attorney is representing a client. See In re\r\nBroome, 356 S.C. 302, 315, 589 S.E.2d 188, 195-96 (2003) (\"[A] signed retainer\r\nagreement is not essential to create [an attorney-client] relationship.\"). Instead, a\r\nperson can be deemed a client when he seeks legal advice and discusses those\r\nmatters with a lawyer in confidence for the purpose of obtaining such advice. Id.\r\n\r\nThe Panel concluded, and we agree that Daniels had reason to believe Carter was\r\nrepresenting him. Daniels and Carter had discussed both the possibility of\r\nsettlement and how to proceed if they instead went to trial. Carter obtained\r\nmedical releases from Daniels to procure evidence and made calls to the insurance\r\nadjuster on Daniels' behalf. Furthermore, Carter informed the judge at a roster\r\nmeeting that he was representing Daniels. We therefore hold Carter established an\r\nattorney-client relationship with Daniels and was therefore obligated to comply\r\nwith the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n   I.\t   SCOPE OF REPRESENTATION AND                            DECLINING         OR\r\n         TERMINATING REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 1.2, an attorney must \"abide by a client's decisions concerning the\r\nobjectives of representation . . . [and] consult with the client as to the means by\r\nwhich they are to be pursued.\" Here, Carter failed to pursue any objective by\r\nneither attempting to settle the case nor adequately preparing for trial. He also\r\nfailed to reasonably consult with Daniels as to how he wanted his case resolved.\r\nAlthough he knew Daniels was incarcerated when he received the motion to\r\ndismiss, he never contacted Daniels or arranged to have him present at the hearing\r\nto determine how he wished to proceed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Rule 1.16(c) requires a lawyer to provide \"notice to or permission of\r\na tribunal when terminating a representation\" and Rule 1.16(d) requires a lawyer to\r\n\"take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests.\"\r\n\nAlthough both the judge and opposing counsel had been led to believe Carter was\r\nrepresenting Daniels, Carter waited until the hearing on the motion to dismiss to\r\ninform them he was not. Carter's concerns about representing Daniels without a\r\nsigned fee agreement may have been justified; however, that does not alleviate his\r\nresponsibility to clearly inform the court and his client that the relationship had\r\nbeen terminated. Instead, Carter allowed the case to be dismissed for failure to\r\nprosecute and did not give Daniels prior notice that the motion had been filed.\r\nFurthermore, he did not return Daniels' file to him to allow him the opportunity to\r\nobtain different counsel or proceed pro se.3 We therefore agree with the Panel that\r\nCarter violated both Rules 1.2 and 1.16.\r\n\r\n    II.    DILIGENCE\r\n\r\nRule 1.3 requires a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\r\nrepresenting a client. Even though Carter received notice of Daniels' scheduled\r\ndeposition, he never told Daniels about it. Additionally, Carter did not inform\r\nopposing counsel that he would not attend. After receiving the defendant's motion\r\nto dismiss, Carter did not file anything in response, and it appears he would not\r\nhave attended the hearing if the judge had not called him. Furthermore, he neither\r\ntold Daniels, who was incarcerated at the time, about the motion, nor arranged to\r\nhave Daniels present at the hearing.\r\n\r\nAlthough Daniels' case seemed relatively simple and Carter began representation\r\nafter settlement discussions had begun, no settlement was ever obtained nor was\r\nCarter ever prepared to take the case to trial. Carter was aware Edgefield County\r\nhad limited terms of court, but he did not monitor the docket and failed to\r\nvoluntarily attend the roster meetings. Accordingly, we agree with the Panel that\r\nCarter failed to diligently represent Daniels in violation of Rule 1.3.\r\n\r\n    III.   COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nAlthough Carter met with Daniels at least twice and spoke on the phone with him\r\nseveral times, the Panel nevertheless found he violated Rule 1.4, noting that it\r\nappeared Daniels had initiated all communication. Rule 1.4 requires an attorney to\r\n\"reasonably consult with the client\" and \"keep the client reasonably informed about\r\n\r\n3As of the date of the hearing before the Panel, Carter was still in possession of\r\nDaniels' file and did not bring it the hearing. ODC informed the Court at oral\r\narguments that Carter did not return Daniels file until March 2012.\r\n\nthe status of the matter.\" Carter failed to keep Daniels apprised of the progress of\r\nthe case. He did not inform Daniels of his scheduled deposition, never contacted\r\nDaniels while he was incarcerated to discuss how he wished to proceed with his\r\ncase, and never notified Daniels that the case was likely to be dismissed.\r\nFurthermore, when informing Daniels the case had been dismissed, he merely\r\nforwarded the order with a handwritten note to Daniels' home address despite\r\nknowing Daniels was incarcerated at the time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rule 1.4 requires that a lawyer \"consult with the client about any\r\nrelevant limitation on the lawyer's conduct.\" Carter never clearly indicated to\r\nDaniels that his representation was contingent on the fee agreement being signed\r\nand that the absence of the agreement precluded him from representing Daniels.4\r\nInstead, Carter simply carried out a haphazard representation. Accordingly, we\r\nagree with the Panel that Carter violated Rule 1.4.\r\n\r\n    IV.\t CONDUCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF\r\n         JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThe Panel also concluded Carter engaged in conduct prejudicial to the\r\nadministration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(e). Carter began representation of\r\nDaniels after the pleadings had been filed and some settlement discussions had\r\nalready taken place. Nevertheless, he failed to advance the case during the fifteen\r\nmonths when he represented Daniels. Although the case came up three separate\r\ntimes on the roster, he either failed to show up or was unprepared to move forward,\r\nand the case was eventually dismissed. Despite knowing that his client was\r\nincarcerated and would only have a limited period of time within which to re-file\r\nhis case, Carter chose to communicate the dismissal of the case by forwarding the\r\norder along with a handwritten note to Daniels' home address. We therefore agree\r\nwith the Panel that Carter's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice,\r\nand therefore, he violated Rule 8.4(e).\r\n\r\n    V.\t   SANCTION\r\n\r\nWe accept the Panel's recommendations ordering Carter to pay the costs of these\r\nproceedings and complete Ethics School. However, although the Panel\r\nrecommends an admonition, we find, based on Carter's conduct, his disciplinary\r\n\r\n We note Daniels testified that he signed a fee agreement, but was never given a\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\ncopy.\r\n\nhistory, and the concerning fact that some of letters of caution came so close in\r\ntime to his representation of Daniels, a more severe sanction is warranted. We\r\ntherefore hold a public reprimand is appropriate under these circumstances. See In\r\nre DePew, 350 S.C. 265, 267, 565 S.E.2d 305, 306 (2002) (publicly reprimanding\r\nattorney for violating rules regarding competency, diligence, communication, and\r\nengaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); Matter of Barnes,\r\n325 S.C.148, 149, 480 S.E.2d 452, 452 (1997) (issuing public reprimand where\r\nattorney violated rules concerning diligence, communication, and engaging in\r\nconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); Matter of Hart, 321 S.C. 272,\r\n272, 468 S.E.2d 76, 76 (1996) (publicly reprimanding attorney for failing to\r\nprovide competent representation, abide by clients decisions, act diligently in\r\nrepresentation, reasonably communicate with client, and protect clients' interests\r\nupon withdrawal of representation); Matter of Lefford, 317 S.C. 177, 178, 452\r\nS.E.2d 605, 606 (1994) (determining attorney's conduct warranted public\r\nreprimand where attorney failed to represent clients competently, communicate\r\nwith clients, and cooperate with the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and\r\nDiscipline, and also engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of\r\njustice).                        CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find Carter violated Rules 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, and 8.4(e) of the\r\nRules of Professional Conduct. Based on the facts of this case as well as Carter's\r\nextensive previous disciplinary history, we hold the misconduct warrants a public\r\nreprimand. Additionally, Carter is to pay the costs of these proceedings within\r\nthirty days and complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program's Ethics School\r\nwithin six months of the issuance of this opinion.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27180","title":"State v.

On appeal, he alleges the trial judge committed\r\nreversible error in charging the jury that they were acting \"for the community\" and\r\nthat their verdict \"will represent truth and justice for all parties that are involved.\"\r\nWe agree that these charges are erroneous, but because appellant did not properly\r\npreserve his issues for appeal, we affirm.\r\n\r\n                                        FACTS\r\nThe victim was shot at about 4:30 am on a Florence street. A witness who was to\r\nmeet the victim testified that she heard a single gunshot and saw a person dressed\r\nin black clothing running away from the scene. There was testimony that appellant\r\nand the victim had argued at Shavonne's party. Shavonne did not observe the two\r\nfighting, but testified she was on the phone with the victim right before he was\r\nshot, and that he told her he was being followed by a man he had argued with at\r\nher party. Another witness testified that appellant had told him he had been hired\r\nto kill the victim. Appellant told this witness he had \"done it\" about an hour after\r\nthe victim was killed.\r\n\r\nAppellant and his girlfriend checked into a motel at about 5:35 am on the day of\r\nthe murder. Excerpts from letters written to the girlfriend following appellant's\r\narrest were introduced at trial. These letters suggested what she should tell people\r\nto give him an alibi. In one, he pointed out the absence of physical evidence to\r\nconvict him, and in another asked her to contact his lawyer and suggests what to\r\nsay, including the instruction that \"it will help me and my bond hearing [sic] you\r\nare who I was with when they found him . . .\" In short, while the State's case\r\nlacked forensic and eyewitness evidence, there was nonetheless substantial\r\nevidence that appellant murdered the victim.\r\n\r\nAt the pre-charge conference, appellant objected to the trial judge's inclusion of a\r\ncharge that \"You and I are acting for the community and that is why we must see to\r\nit that the trial is fair and the verdict is just.\" Appellant contended the \"acting for\r\nthe community\" language was akin to a solicitor's improper golden rule argument,\r\nbut did not object to the \"fair and just\" portion of this proposed charge. The judge\r\ndeclined to alter the \"acting for the community\" language. Appellant also objected\r\nto a different part of the proposed charge, which included the statement\r\n\"[E]veryone is entitled to justice in this case,\" arguing that charge diluted the\r\nState's burden of proof. The judge agreed to omit this \"everyone\" charge.\r\n\r\nThe jury was charged on the presumption of innocence and the State's burden of\r\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. Later, they were charged \"You and I are acting\r\n\nfor the community,\" and that \"This court is of the confirmed opinion that whatever\r\nverdict you reach will represent truth and justice for all parties that are involved in\r\nthis case.\" Appellant renewed his pre-charge objection, but made no additional\r\ncomplaint about the charge.            ISSUES\r\n             1. \tDid the trial judge's charge include an improper \"Golden\r\n                 Rule\" instruction?\r\n\r\n             2. \tDid the trial judge's charge improperly shift the State's\r\n                 burden of proof or dilute it?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \tGolden Rule\r\nAppellant argued to the trial judge that to the extent the jury was to be instructed\r\nthat it and the judge were acting for the community, the charge was erroneous\r\nbecause it was akin to an improper Golden Rule argument. The judge disagreed.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\r\nA 'Golden Rule' argument is one in which the jurors are asked to put themselves in\r\nthe victim's shoes. It is improper because it is meant to destroy the jury's\r\nimpartiality, and to arouse passion and prejudice. Brown v. State, 383 S.C. 506,\r\n680 S.E.2d 909 (2009). A charge that the jury is acting for the community,\r\nhowever, is not similar to a Golden Rule argument in that it does not ask the jury to\r\nconsider the victim's perspective. While appellant has not shown reversible error\r\nhere, we caution the trial judge to restrict his jury instructions to matters of law.\r\n\r\n2. \tBurden of Proof\r\nOn appeal, appellant contends the jury charge unconstitutionally shifted the burden\r\nof proof. He specifically objects to the part of the charge in which the judge stated\r\nit was his \"confirmed opinion\" that the verdict would represent \"truth and justice\r\nfor all parties.\" To the extent appellant now complains about the \"confirmed\r\nopinion\" part of the charge, he is improperly attempting to expand on appeal the\r\nscope of his objection below. E.g., State v. Meyers, 262 S.C. 222, 263 S.E.2d 678\r\n(1974). There was no objection to the \"confirmed opinion\" language at the charge\r\nconference, and appellant stood on his pre-charge objection after the jury\r\ninstructions were given. It is axiomatic that an objection to a jury charge may not\r\n\nbe raised for the first time on appeal. E.g. State v. Rios, 388 S.C. 335, 696 S.E.2d\r\n608 (Ct. App. 2010); Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP.\r\n\r\nAppellant also now argues the trial judge erred in charging the jury that their\r\nverdict would represent the \"truth and justice for all parties.\"1 The State contends\r\nthat there was no contemporaneous objection made at trial to this \"truth and justice\r\nfor all\" language in the charge. We agree. It is axiomatic that a party cannot raise\r\nan objection to a jury charge for the first time on appeal. State v. Rios, supra; Rule\r\n20(b), SCRCrimP.\r\n\r\nAlthough the issue is not preserved, we instruct the trial judge to remove any\r\nsuggestion from his general sessions charges that a criminal jury's duty is to return\r\na verdict that is \"just\" or \"fair\" to all parties. Such a charge could effectively alter\r\nthe jury's perception of the burden of proof, substituting justice and fairness for the\r\npresumption of innocence and the State's burden to prove the defendant's guilt\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, to a lay person, the \"all parties involved\" in\r\na criminal case may well extend beyond the defendant and the State, and include\r\nthe victim. These inaccurate and misleading charges risk depriving a criminal\r\ndefendant of his right to a fair trial.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\nAppellant's convictions and sentences are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nActing Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concurs. TOAL, C.J., concurring in result in\r\na separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\nE. C. Burnett, III, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant had objected to a different proposed charge at the pre-charge\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nconference, that \"Everyone is entitled to justice in this case.\" The judge agreed not\r\nto give this charge, and a review of the record shows that he did not.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I concur in the result reached by Justice Pleicones, but\r\nwriting for a majority of the Court, find that Appellant's burden-shifting arguments\r\nare preserved. The adequacy of the trial court's entire overall instruction cured any\r\npossible constitutional deprivation. In addition, the State presented overwhelming\r\nevidence of Appellant's guilt, rendering any error in the jury instruction harmless.\r\n\r\n                               I.     PRESERVATION\r\n\r\n       At trial, defense counsel objected to portions of the trial court's proposed\r\njury instruction. First, defense counsel took exception to the trial court's proposed\r\nstatement that \"everyone is entitled to justice in this case.\"\r\n\r\n      Defense Counsel: We would argue that this is burden shifting. The\r\n      fact that we don't feel like the state is necessarily entitled to justice.\r\n      Instead, they have the burden of proving defendant guilty beyond a\r\n      reasonable doubt. And we would cite Cage v. Louisiana [498 U.S. 39\r\n      (1990)], which suggest that the jury instructions that dilute the burden\r\n      of proof on the government prove [sic] beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n      violate due process and constitute reversible error.\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      The Court: I was going to say why isn't the State entitled to justice\r\n      just as any defendant who comes into court is entitled to justice.\r\n      Being entitled to justice doesn't remove a burden or lessen a burden. I\r\n      am going to note your exception to that, but . . . .\r\n\r\n      The trial court then agreed to remove the objectionable language:\r\n\r\n      But it's fairly – you know, that paragraph you are referring to where it\r\n      starts with that everyone is entitled to justice, I will take that out and\r\n      just put your verdict in this case cannot be based on sympathy,\r\n      compassion or prejudice, just doesn't seem to be that big a deal.\r\n\r\n      However, the trial court issued a jury instruction containing substantially\r\nsimilar language:\r\n\r\n      Your verdict in this case is not to be based on sympathy, compassion,\r\n      prejudice or some other emotion or other consideration that is not\r\n      found in the evidence. This court is of the confirmed opinion that\r\n\n      whatever verdict you reach will represent truth and justice for all\r\n      parties that are involved in this case.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Defense counsel also objected to the trial court's proposed language that the\r\njudge and jury were \"acting for the community,\" and argued that this statement\r\nasked the jury to act as the \"conscious of the community, similar to a golden rule\r\nargument.\" The court refused to remove this language from his instruction, \"I'm\r\ngoing to note your exception to the language, I'm going to leave that language in.\"\r\n\r\n      The Court then stated the following during his instruction:\r\n\r\n      You are not called to serve as jurors very often. And the proper\r\n      performance of the duty requires each of you to reach the hithe [sic]\r\n      of freeing your mind of all improper influences. You and I are acting\r\n      for the community and that is why we see to it that this trial is fair and\r\n      the verdict is just.\r\n\r\n      Following the completion of the jury instructions, the court referenced\r\ndefense counsel's objections:\r\n\r\n      The Court: Are there any exceptions or objections to the Court's \n\r\n      charge by the State? \n\r\n\r\n      The State: No sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: And by [defense counsel] other than what we discussed\r\n      during the . . .\r\n\r\n      Defense Counsel: That's all, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n       The Record clearly demonstrates that Appellant did not raise the propriety of\r\nthe jury instructions for the first time on appeal, but objected to the offensive\r\nlanguage both before and after the trial court delivered his instruction. Thus,\r\nAppellant's objections were properly preserved for this Court's consideration on\r\nappeal, and consequently, we must address the critical burden shifting issue.2\r\n\r\n\r\n2The trial court's instruction that the jury is \"acting for the community\" is\r\ndangerous, and has all the earmarks of a \"Golden Rule\" argument. While it may\r\nnot directly instruct the jury to place themselves in the victim's shoes, a charge to\r\n\n                                II.   BURDEN SHIFTING\r\n\r\n       While I agree with Appellant's argument that the jury should not have been\r\ninstructed that their verdict would represent truth and justice for the parties, this\r\nCourt must consider instructions as a whole, and \"if as a whole they are free from\r\nerror, any isolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible\r\nerror.\" State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 27, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2000). The\r\nstandard of review when considering an ambiguous jury instruction is whether\r\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction in a\r\nway that violates the constitution. Id. at 27, 538 S.E.2d at 251 (citing Estelle v.\r\nMcGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991)). Under this standard, the trial court's improper\r\nstatements do not require reversal.\r\n\r\n       In Aleksey, this Court addressed whether a trial court's instruction shifted the\r\nburden of proof to the defendant. In that case, the trial court issued a complete and\r\nproper instruction on reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, and the\r\nState's burden of proof. Id. at 26, 538 S.E.2d at 251. The trial court then instructed\r\nthe jury to weigh the credibility of witnesses as follows:\r\n\r\n      Ladies and gentlemen, throughout this entire process, you have but\r\n      one single objective, and that is to seek the truth, to seek the truth\r\n      regardless of from what source that truth may be derived. Now, all of\r\n      these things, ladies and gentlemen, you will consider, bearing in mind\r\n      that you must give the defendant the benefit of every reasonable\r\n      doubt.\r\n\r\nId. at 26, 538 S.E.2d at 250.\r\n\r\n       The Court in Aleksey relied on United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, 11 F.3d\r\n1218 (5th Cir. 1994), in analyzing a contested jury charge. In Gonzalez-Balderas,\r\nthe district court instructed the jury: \"Remember, at all times, you are judges–\r\njudges of the facts. Your sole interest is to seek the truth from the evidence in this\r\ncase.\" Id. at 1223. The defendant argued that instructing the jury that its \"sole\r\n\r\n\r\n\"act for the community\" carries the same connotation and effect. However,\r\nbecause of the overwhelming evidence of Appellant's guilt, discussed infra, any\r\n\"Golden Rule\" error harmless. See Vasquez v. State, 388 S.C. 447, 468–69, 698\r\nS.E.2d 561, 572 (2010) (\"Furthermore, even if the solicitor did make an improper\r\n'Golden Rule' argument, I would find the error harmless in light of the enormity of\r\nthe evidence against Petitioner.\")\r\n\ninterest is to seek the truth\" diluted the reasonable doubt standard of proof. Id.\r\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed:\r\n\r\n      As an abstract concept, \"seeking the truth\" suggests determining\r\n      whose version of events is more likely true, the government's or the\r\n      defendant's, and thereby intimates a preponderance of evidence\r\n      standard. Such an instruction would be error if used in the\r\n      explanation of the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The\r\n      district court, however, did not use it in this way. Rather, the trial\r\n      court began its instructions with a clear definition of the government's\r\n      burden of proof in which it repeatedly stated that the defendant could\r\n      not be convicted unless the jury found that the government had proven\r\n      him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nId.    Similarly, the trial court in Aleksey issued complete and proper reasonable\r\ndoubt and circumstantial evidence charges. Although that trial court's statements\r\nregarding witness credibility were improper, this Court held that this did not taint\r\nthe overall instruction. Thus, it was not reasonably likely that the jury applied the\r\ninstructions in a manner inconsistent with the notion that the State has the burden\r\nof proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 28–29, 538 S.E.2d at 252.\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, the trial court included several improper statements as\r\npart of his jury instruction. However, the trial court prefaced those remarks with\r\nfull and adequate instructions on reasonable doubt. It is troubling that the trial\r\ncourt concluded his jury instruction with statements that could have distracted the\r\njury from their core functions: to examine evidence and make factual\r\ndeterminations, weigh credibility, and perhaps most importantly, decide whether\r\nthe State has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The injection of\r\nextraneous language only serves to distract the jury from performing their critical\r\nrole. However, despite the trial court's mistake, the instruction as a whole properly\r\nconveyed the law to the jury and it is not reasonably likely that the jury acted in\r\ncontravention of the reasonable doubt standard. See Aleksey, 343 S.C. at 29, 538\r\nS.E.2d at 252–53 (finding reversal not required when the trial court's improper\r\ninstructions were given in the context of witness credibility and not reasonable\r\ndoubt).Furthermore, unconstitutional burden shifting does not result in reversible\r\nerror when that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Rose v. Clark, 478\r\n\nU.S. 570, 579–80 (1986); Tate v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 426, 570 S.E.2d 522, 526\r\n(2002). The State presented substantial circumstantial evidence that Appellant\r\ncommitted the crime charged. One witness testified that, as the result of a \"drug\r\ndeal went bad,\" Gary Bostic hired Appellant to kill the victim for $1,000. This\r\nwitness testified that Appellant told him four or five times that he planned to\r\ncommit the crime. The witness stated that he and Appellant watched a news report\r\nregarding the murder, and that following the conclusion of the report, Appellant\r\nadmitted to the murder.3 The witness's girlfriend corroborated his testimony. She\r\ntestified that she was present when Appellant watched the news report, and that she\r\nalso heard Appellant state that he murdered the victim. The State also presented\r\nevidence that between September 5, 2008, the day of the murder, and September 9,\r\n2008, Appellant and Bostic called each other forty-one times.\r\n\r\n        The most revealing evidence presented by the State consisted of actual\r\nletters Appellant wrote in which he attempted to convince his girlfriend to provide\r\nhim with an alibi.\r\n\r\n       Appellant's girlfriend testified that she saw Appellant on the Thursday\r\nevening of September 4, 2008, at approximately 7:30 or 8:00 p.m., and the next\r\ntime she saw him was at 5:30 a.m. the morning of September 5. On that morning,\r\nAppellant picked her up in a van driven by a man named Gary, and Appellant and\r\nhis girlfriend checked into a motel. Following their check-in, Appellant left and\r\nreturned some time later with a rental car. Appellant then drove his girlfriend back\r\nto her residence, and informed her that he would be changing his phone number\r\nthat day, and called her later that day from the new phone number.\r\n\r\n      The State introduced letters authored by Appellant, which sought to\r\npersuade his girlfriend to change her version of the events of September 4 and 5,\r\n2008. In a letter from October 2008, Appellant wrote:\r\n\r\n      They aint got no gun, no bloody clothes, no shells, nothing . . . those\r\n      are the main things they need to actually convict me it don't matter\r\n      how many people say I did it or we argued the time that they say this\r\n\r\n Bradley admitted that he faced pending federal charges for trafficking cocaine,\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nbut received no deal in exchange for his testimony, and only hoped to help himself\r\nin federal court.\r\n\n      happened. I told u that when we went to the room. Remember I said\r\n      we was [sic] together at the settin [sic] up. But you told them u [sic]\r\n      was sleep and I came and pick up [sic] in a van. My people told me\r\n      that if u [sic] tell my solicitor that u will give him or her a statement\r\n      saying we were together then they will give me a bond.\r\n\r\n      In another undated letter, Appellant wrote:\r\n\r\n      Someone told me how u [sic] can help me getting [sic] out of here. I\r\n      don't know what u [sic] told them people but all I need is for u [sic] to\r\n      say is I was with you at morning noon and night.\r\n\r\n      In another letter dated October 2008, Appellant acknowledges that his\r\nversion and his girlfriend's version of the events are not similar:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Our stories are not the same. I told them we left off Carver Circle in a\r\n      green van cab with a [sic] old driver. We were on the computer. But\r\n      I will tell them I was still there playing dominoes u [sic] went home to\r\n      get clothes and I came and got u [sic] from there. No times though . .\r\n      . Make sure dude no [sic] this story. State Taxi . . . .\r\n\r\n      On November 16, 2008, Appellant wrote:\r\n\r\n      But anyways I need you to call this number . . . and talk to . . . my\r\n      lawyer. Tell him that you are my girl and we were at the room during\r\n      the time they said that this occurred. You can still tell him that I\r\n      picked you up in a van and we went to the room but tell him that you\r\n      were waiting on me at your sisters [sic] house but you left because I\r\n      took to [sic] long. If they ask you a time just say you don't know what\r\n      time it was but you were asleep and we was at the room sleep when\r\n      the report on the news said at 5:00 a.m. But anyways you don't have\r\n      to but it will help me at my bond hearing. You are who I was with\r\n      when they found him.\r\n\r\n       By February 2009, Appellant became desperate for his girlfriend to provide\r\na false alibi:\r\n\r\n      But your statement could hurt me in court because they saying you\r\n      told them that it was not a taxi and it was a young dude driving the\r\n\n      van and also that you was sleep and I was on the phone talking to\r\n      somebody about dude but that has got to be when my phone started\r\n      ringing and that I left you and didn't come back until 6:00 am but they\r\n      said dude was dead at 5:17 a.m. and the receipt from the room show\r\n      us checking in at 5:34 a.m. but the clerk saying he didn't see me but to\r\n      cover that up I'll just say I was smoking a cigarette.\r\n\r\n      On June 14, 2009, Appellant admits that a man named \"Gary\" drove him to\r\nthe hotel following the murder:\r\n\r\n      Call 617-6919 and tell Gary that you calling [sic] for me and let him\r\n      know that . . . said he will take $2,000 and come get me out tell him\r\n      my mama need $1,000. That's who . . . dropped us off at the room.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n        These letters clearly demonstrate that Appellant could not account for his\r\nwhereabouts at the time of the victim's murder. His attempts to pressure his\r\ngirlfriend to provide a false alibi, and the testimony of two individuals who\r\nwitnessed his confession provided the jury with substantial circumstantial evidence\r\nof his guilt. Put another way, the circumstances proven are consistent with each\r\nother, and when taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of Appellant to the\r\nexclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis. State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620,\r\n626 n.2, 677 S.E.2d 603, 606 n.2 (2009) (citing State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272,\r\n274–76, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989)). Thus, based on the overwhelming evidence\r\nof guilt presented to the jury, the trial court's erroneous instructions could not have\r\ncontributed to the guilty verdict. See Lowry v. State, 376 S.C. 499, 509, 657\r\nS.E.2d 760, 765 (2008) (\"From this perspective, in order to conclude that the error\r\ndid not contribute to the verdict, the Court must 'find that error unimportant in\r\nrelation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed\r\nin the record.'\") (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\n                                 III.   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       As a final note, although no constitutional error occurred, the trial court's\r\ninappropriate statements in this case came close to jeopardizing the legitimacy of\r\nthe trial. Judges and juries are critical actors in our judicial system. Jurors are\r\nsworn to declare the facts of the case as they are proved from the evidence placed\r\nbefore them. 50A C.J.S. Juries § 1 (2004). The very term \"jury\" connotes a\r\ndeliberative body of persons. Id. A judge sits as a public officer, who presides\r\n\nover, conducts, and administers the law by virtue of the office, and does so cloaked\r\nin judicial authority. Id. Judges § 7 (2004). Judges and juries are not, as this trial\r\njudge put it, \"in it together.\" While their functions may act as a complement to one\r\nanother, it is erroneous to imply that they somehow work hand in hand, and any\r\nblurring of their roles serves as an unnecessary and improper distraction.\r\n\r\n        Judicial instructions to the jury in a criminal case that \"whatever verdict you\r\nreach will represent truth and justice for all parties,\" that \"we must see to it that the\r\ntrial is fair and the verdict is just\" and that you and I are \"in it together,\" may seem\r\nat first blush to be simply harmless phrases intended to put the jury at ease and\r\nportray the judge as a \"regular guy.\" However, the constitutional framework\r\ngoverning criminal trials is a highly technical body of law developed by the United\r\nStates Supreme Court and by state courts operating under the Supreme Court's\r\nguidance. It is inappropriate to jeopardize the constitutionality of a trial by\r\ninstructing the jury in this way.\r\n\r\n       It is critical that jurors understand the proper application of the reasonable\r\ndoubt standard. That standard does not charge the jury with ensuring justice for all\r\nof the parties. Justice Pleicones correctly notes that this language could result in\r\njurors substituting concepts of justice or fairness for the State's constitutional duty\r\nto prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, I join the Justice Pleicones’s\r\nadmonition to the trial court to restrict his jury instructions to matters of law, and\r\nrefrain from issuing instructions which run the risk of depriving defendants of their\r\nright to a fair trial.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

We reverse.2                  FACTS\r\nAppellant Library Associates purchased the building located at 404 King Street \n\r\n(404 King) which was formerly the main branch of the Charleston County Public \n\r\nLibrary. 404 King is bounded by King Street to the west, Tobacco Street to the \n\r\nsouth, and Hutson Street to the north, and backs to the Old Citadel on the east. The \n\r\nOld Citadel and 404 King are separated from Marion Square by Tobacco Street, an \n\r\nunopened right-of-way/pedestrian walkway that forms the north boundary of \n\r\nMarion Square, an approximately five acre park in the historic heart of Charleston. \n\r\nMarion Square is bordered on the west by King Street, on the south by Calhoun \n\r\nStreet, and on the east by Meeting Street. \n\r\n\r\n404 King faces King Street, but is visible in profile when looking north from\n\r\nMarion Square. Viewed in this way, the back of the property abuts the Old \n\r\nCitadel, which faces the park. \n\r\n\r\n404 King was split-zoned: approximately 60% of the building, that part located \n\r\ntowards King Street, was zoned 3X, permitting a building on that site to be 105 \n\r\nfeet tall. The interior of the building that lies towards the Old Citadel was zoned \n\r\n55/30, meaning the height could not exceed 55 feet nor could it be less than 30 feet \n\r\nhigh. The Old Citadel is also zoned 55/30, and is now the site of an Embassy \n\r\nSuites Hotel. Across King Street from 404 King are a number of buildings, \n\r\nincluding St. Matthews German Lutheran Church, a parking garage, and the \n\r\nFrancis Marion Hotel. All properties are zoned 3X in the 400 block of King Street, \n\r\nmeaning their maximum height is three times the distance from the facade of the \n\r\nbuilding to the center of King Street. The evidence in the record indicates that St. \n\r\nMatthews' spire is 297 feet tall, that the parking garage is approximately 60 feet \n\r\ntall, and that the Francis Marion Hotel is around 165 feet tall. \n\r\n\r\n404 King and the Old Citadel are bounded on the north by Hutson Street. Property \n\r\nalong King Street north of Hutson is split zoned 55/30 towards King Street and \n\r\n\r\n Ordinance 2007-147.\n\r\n1Our disposition of this appeal moots the appeal in a related case. Accordingly, the \n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nappeal in Historic Charleston Found. v. City of Charleston is dismissed. \n\r\n\n80/30 towards the interior on the 404 King side, and 55/30 on the opposite side. In\r\nmirror image fashion, the property bordering Meeting Street north of Hutson is\r\nalso split zoned. North of Marion Square along the Meeting Street corridor, the\r\nproperty lying on the west side of Meeting, that is towards King, is split zoned\r\n55/30 facing Meeting and 80/30 towards the interior. The property on the east side\r\nof Meeting is zoned 55/30. This split-zoning scheme continues south of the square\r\nbelow the 400 block of King Street, and along Meeting Street south of the square,\r\nwith the King/Meeting block split zoned and the property across the street zoned\r\n55/30. 404 King was an anomaly in the area in that it was zoned taller towards\r\nKing Street than towards its interior.\r\n\r\nCharleston City Council adopted Zoning Ordinance 2007-147, which rezoned the\r\nentire 404 King property 3X. Respondents then brought this action challenging the\r\nordinance's legality. The master invalidated the ordinance finding it was unlawful\r\nspot zoning. We reverse.          DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWe have defined spot zoning as the \"process of singling out a small parcel of land\r\nfor use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area, for the\r\nbenefit of the owners of that property and to the detriment of other owners.\" Bob\r\nJones Univ. v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351, 361, 133 S.E.2d 843, 840 (1963)\r\ncited with approval in Knowles v. City of Aiken, 305 S.C. 219, 407 S.E.2d 639\r\n(1991). It is not unlawful spot zoning if \"the proposed change is from one use to\r\nanother and there is already a considerable amount of property adjoining the\r\nproperty to be reclassified falling within the proposed classification.\" Id. at 362,\r\n133 S.E.2d at 848. For purposes of this opinion, we accept that although our cases\r\nspeak in terms of \"use classification\" a variance in height classification may also\r\nconstitute unlawful spot zoning.3\r\n\r\nThe question therefore is whether the extension of the 3X height zoning\r\ndesignation from 60% of the 404 King property to 100% is unlawful spot zoning.\r\nIt is true that ordinance 2007-147 singles out a small parcel of land, and that the\r\nrezoning benefits the owner who sought it. However, the application of the 3X\r\nheight to the \"back\" 40% of 404 King is not a change from the property that\r\nliterally adjoins it, that is, the front 60%. It is a change, however, from the Old\r\n\r\n Obviously the intended use of 404 King as a hotel is not a use variance given the\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nproximity of the Francis Marion Hotel and the Embassy Suites to 404 King.\r\n\nCitadel zoning, which abuts the rear of 404 King. However, since every other\r\nproperty in the 400 block of King Street is zoned 3X, there is \"a considerable\r\namount of property adjoining . . . falling within the proposed classification\" and\r\nthus the change to 3X for 404 King is not \"totally different from the surrounding\r\narea.\" Ordinance 2007-0147 rezoning 404 King 3X is not spot zoning. Knowles,\r\nsupra; Bob Jones Univ., supra.\r\n\r\nEven if we were to find the ordinance constituted spot zoning, we must exercise\r\njudicial restraint before declaring it unlawful, keeping in mind the particular\r\ncircumstances of the case. Knowles, supra. Zoning ordinances are presumed valid\r\nand the person attacking one bears the burden of showing the zoning decision is\r\narbitrary, unreasonable, and unjust. Bob Jones, supra. In passing on the validity\r\nof a zoning ordinance, it is not within a court's prerogative to pass upon the\r\nwisdom or expediency of the municipality's decision. Rush v. City of Greenville,\r\n246 S.C. 268, 276, 143 S.E.2d 527, 531 (1965) citing Bob Jones, supra.\r\nRespondents did not meet their heavy burden here.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\nThe order finding ordinance 2007-147 invalid is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. HEARN, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice Alexander S.\r\nMacaulay, concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE HEARN: In my opinion, the majority gives short shrift to the history\r\nof historic preservation in the City of Charleston and the Upper King Street\r\nneighborhood, thereby ignoring the City's steady march away from excessively\r\npermissive height designations and towards zoning classifications that are in\r\naccord with its uniquely historic fabric. Because the ordinance in question here\r\nchanges the zoning of a single piece of property to a classification not consonant\r\nwith the surrounding area and completely at odds with the City's central planning\r\ndocuments, I would affirm the master-in-equity's finding that the ordinance\r\nconstitutes illegal spot zoning. I therefore respectfully dissent.4\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\nLibrary Associates, LLC purchased property located at 404 King Street, in the\r\nUpper King neighborhood of Charleston, which currently houses the old\r\nCharleston County Library.5 404 King Street sits prominently on the northern\r\nboundary of Marion Square, a five-acre public park in the heart of downtown\r\nCharleston. The park lies at the intersection of three major thoroughfares in the\r\nCity: King Street, Meeting Street, and Calhoun Street. Marion Square also is the\r\nformer Citadel parade grounds. Consequently, the Old Citadel building—which is\r\nnow an Embassy Suites Hotel—sits adjacent to 404 King Street on the park's\r\nnorthern boundary. It too directly faces Marion Square.\r\n\r\nStanding on the southern edge of Marion Square and looking north, one has a\r\ndirect and unimpeded view of 404 King Street and the Old Citadel over the open\r\npark. Directly across King Street from 404 King is St. Matthew's Lutheran\r\nChurch, which opened its doors in 1872 and whose spire extends some 297 feet\r\ninto the air. Heading south towards Calhoun Street, one finds a municipal parking\r\ngarage and the Francis Marion Hotel, a narrow building circa 1924 which rises 165\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nI now pick up where the majority leaves off, which is with the history of zoning\r\nregulation in Charleston. Prior to 2006, much of the Upper King neighborhood\r\nwas zoned 3X with no cohesive scheme in mind. Under 3X zoning, the maximum\r\nheight of a building on the property is three times the distance from the façade of\r\n\r\n4 I reluctantly agree with the majority that its disposition of this case moots the \n\r\nappeal in Historic Charleston Foundation v. City of Charleston, Appellate Case \n\r\nNo. 2010-169246.\n\r\n5 This building is a relic from the 1960s which sits unused and boarded up. \n\r\n\nthe building to the center of the right-of-way in front of it. For some properties in\r\nUpper King, this could permit heights up to a couple hundred feet. The City began\r\nits efforts to address this problem in 1982, when it first started planning for the\r\nredevelopment of Marion Square. At the time, the City advocated containing the\r\nsquare with building walls, but those buildings were to be no higher than four to\r\nsix stories. In 1989, City planning documents expressly recognized \"[i]t is\r\nimportant that the traditional scale of Charleston be maintained along Calhoun\r\nStreet. Carefully designed building massing, height, and location with respect to\r\nthe street can maintain the corridor's visible and traditional scale.\" Accordingly,\r\nlow-frame buildings ranging from two to four stories were prevalent, and \"[h]igher\r\nstructures were reserved for symbolic features like steeples, towers, or cupolas.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1991, the City officially adopted the Charleston 2000 plan as the City's central\r\nplanning document. In it, the City noted that the 3X height designation is \"too\r\npermissive\" and needed to be reevaluated. Indeed, one of the specific goals of\r\nCharleston 2000 was to \"[f]oster development of a city with building heights which\r\n. . . respect the historic downtown fabric.\" To that end, the City adopted the\r\nDowntown Plan in 1999 as an update to Charleston 2000. Although this plan is\r\nnot a set of specific guidelines, it outlines the broader development strategy the\r\nCity is to follow. This strategy specifically identifies Marion Square as \"one of the\r\npremier open spaces on the peninsula\" and \"[s]ites around the edges of the park\r\nwill soon be among the most desirable in downtown.\" One study even referred to\r\n404 King Street itself as \"an excellent gateway to the Upper King Street area.\"\r\n\r\nThe Downtown Plan characterizes Charleston's skyline as having \"lower buildings\r\nalong the water edges with higher built spines along King, Meeting, and Calhoun\r\nStreets. Towers and spires punctuate the horizon, signaling important buildings,\r\nthe termination of vistas, and accentuating subtle shifts in the street pattern.\"\r\nHowever, the Plan specifically mentions that the 3X height zone is \"potentially too\r\nhigh to be compatible with the existing city fabric and may be inappropriate\"\r\nbecause it is \"overly permissive.\" In that vein, it specifically calls for the heights\r\nalong King and Meeting Street corridors to be reined in and replaced with\r\nsomething better suited to preserving the City's historic skyline.\r\n\r\nThe Plan, however, does provide for some exceptions to this general rule\r\ndisfavoring tall buildings:\r\n\r\n             Certain sites offer the opportunity to articulate important places\r\n      in the urban fabric, to give special prominence to important buildings,\r\n\n      and to provide a varied skyline. Such landmarks are appropriate at\r\n      important street corners, at the termination of key streets and vistas, or\r\n      in places where streets change direction. These landmarks are\r\n      consistent with the tradition in historic Charleston, as seen in the\r\n      church spires, Market Hall, and the Charleston Place clock tower.\r\n\r\n             In these locations, the Plan proposes to allow discreet\r\n      architectural elements exceeding the zoning height limit. Small\r\n      projections must be subject to a detailed urban design study\r\n      demonstrating the appropriateness of the site, and the preservation of\r\n      vistas and skyline integrity. A careful review and approval process is\r\n      required for each proposal. There may also be an opportunity for\r\n      modest height increases throughout the peninsula, and particularly in\r\n      focal points, subject to a detailed study.\r\n\r\nThus, even though the plan allows for some extra building height, any increase\r\nmust be in accordance with the Plan's goal of encouraging historic preservation.\r\nFurthermore, when discussing Marion Square, and immediately after referring to\r\n404 King Street, the Plan cautioned, \"As new development is planned and\r\ndesigned, particular attention should be paid to preserving the prominence of the\r\nchurch steeples, the old Citadel building and the 'Calhoun Column' on the skyline.\"\r\n\r\nThe first proposal for a wide-scale rezoning of this area in order to bring the King\r\nand Meeting Street corridors in line with the lower height districts below Calhoun\r\nStreet pursuant to the Downtown Plan was made before the City of Charleston City\r\nCouncil in 2005. There was one main exception to this proposal: the area around\r\nMarion Square with 404 King Street, St. Matthew's, and the Francis Marion Hotel\r\nwould remain unchanged. At the time, 404 King Street was split-zoned, meaning\r\nit had two different zoning restrictions for a single lot. Approximately sixty\r\npercent of the property was zoned 3X, and the remainder was zoned 55/30. For\r\n404 King Street, 3X zoning permits a maximum height of 105 feet. Under 55/30\r\n\nzoning, the building may be no higher than fifty-five feet and no shorter than thirty\r\nfeet.6 Across King Street, St. Matthew's, the parking garage, and the Francis\r\nMarion Hotel were all zoned 3X.\r\n\r\nWhen this ordinance effecting a broad change in the district's zoning came up for a\r\nfinal vote in 2006, Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr., advocated the broad\r\nelimination of the 3X height district because it is a \"relic\" and \"prehistoric.\" The\r\nCity Council agreed and passed the ordinance, meaning 404 King Street, St.\r\nMatthew's, the parking garage, and the Francis Marion Hotel were the only\r\nproperties in the vicinity with at least part of the property zoned 3X.\r\n\r\nThe Old Citadel currently is zoned 55/30, although its actual height is somewhere\r\nslightly over sixty feet. Heading north and south along both King and Meeting\r\nStreets, which run right down the center of the peninsula, the interior of the block\r\nbetween these streets is generally zoned 80/30, which permits a maximum height\r\nof eighty feet and a minimum of thirty feet. Directly on these major thoroughfares,\r\nthe zoning is 55/30.7 Outside of the 55/30 zone, the remainder of this part of\r\nCharleston is zoned 50/25. When pieced together, the current zoning regulations\r\naccordingly create a column of 80/30 between King and Meeting Streets, stepping\r\ndown to 55/30 along these streets, and then further stepping down to 50/25 as one\r\ntravels towards the edges of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nDespite refusing to change the zoning of 404 King Street in 2006, in 2007 the City\r\ninitiated the rezoning of this property so that the entire parcel would be zoned 3X.\r\nThe purpose behind zoning the entire property 3X was to open up the possibility\r\nfor Library Associates to build a large, full-service hotel on the lot. The present\r\nproposal calls for a 185-room, nine story building to be erected, with its main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 When applied to 404 King Street, this results in an envelope shaped like a large\r\n\"L,\" with the higher 105 feet zoning amassed along King Street, while the interior\r\nof the site approaching the Old Citadel drops down to a maximum of fifty-five feet.\r\nDue to the openness of Marion Square, the full profile of the L is visible when\r\nlooking north from the park.\r\n7 Many of the buildings fronting the west side of King Street and the east side of\r\nMeeting Street are therefore split-zoned, with the higher 80/30 zone for the rear\r\nportion stepping down to 55/30 along the street. This is the exact opposite\r\narrangement of 404 King Street.\r\n\nentrance facing Marion Square.8 Following public hearings and a referral to the\r\nCity's Planning Commission, the City Council adopted the proposed ordinance,\r\nwhich applied only to 404 King Street and did not rezone any other property in the\r\nCity. The Historic Charleston Foundation and the Preservation Society of\r\nCharleston (collectively, Respondents) then brought the present action challenging\r\nthe ordinance.\r\n\r\nWith this important context in mind, I turn to the question of whether rezoning 404\r\nKing Street to 3X in its entirety constitutes illegal spot zoning.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\nOur inquiry here is a two-step process. We must first determine whether the\r\nordinance in question is spot zoning in the first instance. Spot zoning is \"the\r\n'process of singling out a small parcel of land for use classification totally different\r\nfrom that of the surrounding area, for the benefit of owners of such property and to\r\n[the] detriment of other owners.'\" Knowles v. City of Aiken, 305 S.C. 219, 221, 407\r\nS.E.2d 639, 641 (1991) (quoting Bob Jones Univ., Inc. v. City of Greenville, 243\r\nS.C. 351, 361, 133 S.E.2d 843, 848 (1963)). Thus, if an ordinance changes the\r\nzoning of a small area to a classification not consistent with the area, it is spot\r\nzoning. Talbot v. Myrtle Beach Bd. of Adjustment, 222 S.C. 165, 175, 72 S.E.2d\r\n66, 71 (1952) (\"[W]here an ordinance establishes a small area within the limits of a\r\nzone in which are permitted uses different from or inconsistent with those\r\npermitted within the larger.\"). Conversely, \"it could not be considered as spot\r\nzoning where the proposed change is from one use to another and there was\r\nalready a considerable amount of property adjoining the property sought to be\r\nreclassified falling within the proposed classification.\" Bob Jones, 243 S.C. at 362,\r\n133 S.E.2d at 848.\r\n\r\nWhere a zoning ordinance expands an existing classification, it generally is not\r\nspot zoning. See Lurey v. City of Laurens, 265 S.C. 217, 220, 217 S.E.2d 226, 227\r\n(1975) (suggesting an ordinance was not spot zoning because the amendment did\r\nnot create a new district but merely expanded the existing one); Bob Jones, 243\r\nS.C. at 362, 133 S.E.2d at 848 (\"We conclude that the rezoning of the property in\r\nquestion was not spot zoning because the property immediately to the west thereof\r\n\r\n8 By all accounts, the proposed structure is a handsome, albeit large, building. This\r\nis only a provisional proposal, however, and the building plans are subject to final\r\napproval by the Board of Architectural Review.\r\n\nhad been rezoned so that a shopping center could be built thereon. The rezoning\r\nhere merely expanded an existing commercial area.\"). However, \"not 'every\r\nextension of an existing district is, ipso facto, . . . not spot zoning.'\" Konigsberg v.\r\nBd. of Aldermen of City of New Haven, 930 A.2d 1, 24 (Conn. 2007) (quoting\r\nWade v. Town Plan & Zoning Comm'n of Town of Hamden, 145 A.2d 597, 600\r\n(Conn. 1958)). Instead, the ultimate consideration is whether an extension is \"an\r\norderly development of an existing district which serves the public need in a\r\nreasonable way or whether it is an attempt to accommodate an individual property\r\nowner.\"9 Wade, 145 A.2d at 600.\r\n\r\nThus, spot zoning itself is not improper. In order for it to become unlawful, it must\r\n\"not form a part of a comprehensive plan of zoning or [be] for mere private gain as\r\ndistinguished from the good of the common welfare.\" Talbot, 222 S.C. at 175, 72\r\nS.E.2d at 71. \"The vice of spot zoning lies in the fact that it singles out for special\r\ntreatment a lot or a small area in a way that does not further such a\r\n[comprehensive] plan.\" Gaida v. Planning & Zoning Comm'n of City of Shelton,\r\n947 A.2d 361, 369 (Conn. App. Ct. 2008) (quotations omitted). The very purpose\r\nbehind requiring conformance to a comprehensive plan is \"to prevent the arbitrary,\r\nunreasonable and discriminatory exercise of the zoning power\" and to \"serve[] as\r\nan effective brake on spot zoning.\" Summ v. Zoning Comm'n of Town of Ridgefield,\r\n186 A.2d 160, 164 (Conn. 1962). Stated another way, the singling out of a small\r\nparcel for treatment different than the surrounding uses is \"the very antithesis of\r\nplanned zoning.\" Rodgers v. Vill. of Tarrytown, 96 N.E.2d 731, 735 (N.Y. 1951).\r\nAs we therefore said in Knowles, \"the appropriate analysis is to closely scrutinize\r\nthe following factors: (1) the adherence of the zoning to the City's comprehensive\r\n\r\n9In Bob Jones, for example, the ordinance under review was not spot zoning\r\nbecause the majority of properties in the vicinity were already zoned in accordance\r\nwith the proposed classification. See 243 S.C. at 357, 133 S.E.2d at 845-46. The\r\nordinance examined in Lurey survived judicial review not because it was not spot\r\nzoning, but because it also met a public need for a hospital expansion. See 265 S.C.\r\nat 220, 217 S.E.2d at 227. Thus, this ordinance constituted legal spot zoning. See\r\nTalbot, 222 S.C. at 175, 72 S.E.2d at 71 (stating spot zoning \"is invalid where the\r\nordinance does not form a part of a comprehensive plan of zoning or is for mere\r\nprivate gain as distinguished from the good of the common welfare\" (emphasis\r\nadded, quotations omitted)).\r\n\nplan; and (2) promotion of the good of the common welfare.\" 305 S.C. at 223, 407\r\nS.E.2d at 642.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking this analysis, we must be mindful that zoning ordinances are\r\nlegislative functions and therefore \"entitled to the presumption of legislative\r\nvalidity.\" Hampton v. Richland Cnty., 292 S.C. 500, 507, 357 S.E.2d 463, 467 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1987). Thus, \"[i]n order to successfully assault a city's zoning decision, a\r\ncitizen must establish that the decision was arbitrary and unreasonable.\" Knowles,\r\n305 S.C. at 224, 407 S.E.2d at 642 . The party attacking the zoning ordinance\r\nbears the burden of proving its invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. Town\r\nof Scranton v. Willoughby, 306 S.C. 421, 422, 412 S.E.2d 424, 425 (1991) (per\r\ncuriam). In undertaking this analysis, we \"cannot become city planners but can\r\nonly correct injustices when they are clearly shown to result from the municipal\r\naction.\" Talbot, 222 S.C. at 175, 72 S.E.2d at 70. Therefore, so long as the validity\r\nof the zoning classification is \"fairly debatable,\" \"the legislative judgment must be\r\nallowed to control.\" Bob Jones, 243 S.C. at 361, 133 S.E.2d at 848; see also\r\nKnowles, 305 S.C. at 224, 407 S.E.2d at 642 (\"Courts have no prerogative to pass\r\nupon the wisdom of the municipality's decision unless such decision is so\r\nunreasonable as to impair or destroy [a] citizen's constitutional rights[] and the\r\ndecision should not be overturned by a court so long as the decision is fairly\r\ndebatable.\" (quotations omitted)).       A.\r\nTurning first to whether the ordinance constitutes spot zoning, I believe\r\nRespondents have introduced clear and convincing evidence that it does.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority writes that \"every other property in the 400 block of King\r\nStreet is zoned 3X,\" this characterization is quite misleading as there are only four\r\nproperties on the entire block: 404 King Street, St. Matthews, the parking garage,\r\nand the Francis Marion Hotel. Furthermore, even a cursory review of the record\r\nreveals that these properties are the only ones in the area zoned 3X. Beyond this,\r\nevery single other property, including the only property actually adjoining 404\r\nKing Street, is zoned for a lower height, and in many instances a much lower\r\nheight. It therefore cannot be maintained that there is a \"considerable amount of\r\nproperty\" already zoned 3X. Quite to the contrary, there is a notable absence of\r\nsimilarly zoned property in the Upper King Street neighborhood.\r\n\nMoreover, the mere existence of some property in the vicinity zoned 3X is not, by\r\nitself, dispositive. See Konigsberg, 930 A.2d at 24 (\"[N]ot every extension of an\r\nexisting district is, ipso facto, . . . not spot zoning.\" (internal quotations omitted)).\r\nInstead, we must look to the general character of the neighborhood. Otherwise, a\r\ncity could simply use an anchor property to expand a zoning designation one\r\nproperty at a time while wholly avoiding the prohibition against spot zoning\r\nwithout regard to the neighborhood or why that property has the zoning\r\ndesignation to begin with. But this is precisely what the majority permits Library\r\nAssociates to do. Under the majority's view, Library Associates can automatically\r\nbootstrap the zoning from these three properties despite the fact that these other\r\nproperties are themselves anomalies, vestiges of the old height classifications that\r\nunderwent a wholesale change in 2006. Indeed, the City had only recently lowered\r\nthe height of the surrounding buildings when it sought to increase the height of 404\r\nKing Street. Moreover, St. Matthews and the Francis Marion Hotel are tall,\r\nhistoric buildings constructed long before the current zoning ordinances were\r\nenacted.\r\n\r\nBased on the facts presented, it is readily apparent that the ordinance in question\r\nchanges the zoning of 404 King Street to one totally different than the surrounding\r\narea. This change also was effected to benefit Library Associates at the detriment\r\nof the surrounding property owners, whose smaller historic structures will be\r\ndwarfed and overshadowed by the new building. Accordingly, I believe the\r\nordinance constitutes spot zoning.         B.\r\nAs to whether the ordinance is illegal spot zoning and thus not consonant with the\r\nCity's development plan, I note at the outset that the City's planning documents\r\nreveal competing considerations when it comes to height zoning. On the one hand,\r\nthe City desires to maintain the momentum behind the revitalization of Upper King\r\nStreet and encourage more productive use of the lots in that neighborhood. The\r\nDowntown Plan even called 404 King Street an \"excellent gateway\" and unique\r\nopportunity for this part of town that happens to be well-suited for high-intensity\r\nuse. On the other hand, Charleston is a city deeply steeped in a rich and vibrant\r\nhistory that must be preserved. Indeed, what makes Charleston such a desirable\r\nplace to live, work, and visit is its storied past and well-preserved buildings.\r\n\r\nThe parties introduced much evidence regarding whether a full-service hotel of this\r\nsize would serve the business and social needs of Charleston. Should Library\r\n\nAssociates decide to build something else besides a hotel, I am sure that it too\r\nwould be an economic boon to the area. Nevertheless, the City cannot simply\r\nchoose to promote revitalization and ignore its longstanding practice of historic\r\npreservation. Woven throughout every single planning document is a general tenor\r\nof respect for the historical fabric of the City and an overarching policy of\r\ndeference to historic buildings. The City's 1974 Historic Preservation Ordinance,\r\nas read by one of Respondents' expert witnesses, Professor William Cook, put it\r\npoignantly: \"A vital part of the total City scene not to be really tampered with is\r\nthe skyline. Punctuated with beautiful steeples of historic churches, they add\r\nimmeasurably to the harmony of building heights, which is only occasionally\r\n[s]poiled by modern intrusions.\" In fact, the push behind generally eliminating the\r\n3X height district was due to the potential of tall buildings dominating the historic\r\nskyline.\r\n\r\nAs the 3-D models appearing in the record show, a building filling the 3X design\r\nenvelope at 404 King Street would be a substantial one that would not give the\r\nrequired deference to the Old Citadel, over which it would rise some forty feet, and\r\nthe buildings behind it on King Street, which themselves are only approximately\r\nthree stories tall. Furthermore, the Downtown Plan's statements permitting higher\r\nbuildings were couched in terms of objects that \"punctuate\" the skyline and \"small\r\nprojections,\" such as church spires and clock towers. In contrast, a building fully\r\noccupying the 3X zone at 404 King Street will be a hulking mass rising far above\r\nthe surrounding properties that will dominate the skyline, topped only by just a few\r\nnarrow buildings and spires. The property's prominence across an open public\r\nsquare also makes it difficult to mask the building's height, especially when it is\r\ncontrasted to the smaller Old Citadel building immediately beside it. Finally, the\r\nplan spoke of potential height increases in terms of them being \"modest.\" For 404\r\nKing, the maximum height nearly doubled.\r\n\r\nThus, while it may be fairly debatable whether a large building is necessary for the\r\ncontinued development of Upper King, it is clear that a 105-foot building on this\r\nsite would not be in accord with the Plan's requirement of deference to historical\r\nstructures and respect for the skyline. I certainly am mindful of our role as a court\r\nand the admonition that we not become city planners, as well as the high burden a\r\nchallenger must meet. In purporting to find the ordinance lawful even if it is spot\r\nzoning, the majority hides behind this standard and simply writes that we must\r\n\"keep[] in mind the particular circumstances of the case.\" Yet this is exactly what\r\nthe majority avoids doing, opting instead to allow the City to blatantly ignore its\r\n\nown duly adopted plan. While I respect the tough decisions the City must make to\r\nharmonize the competing concerns identified in the Downtown Plan, those\r\nconcerns still must be harmonized. I simply cannot join the majority in permitting\r\nthe City to arbitrarily disregard its longstanding policies regarding historic\r\npreservation in the name of economic development. This is not the imposition of\r\nmy own judgment over the wisdom of the City's judgment; rather, I would do\r\nwhat the majority does not and hold the City to its plan. I would therefore find the\r\nordinance is illegal spot zoning.       III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the master's order and hold that the\r\nordinance in question constitutes illegal spot zoning. To be clear, I do not believe\r\nthe City is forever barred from raising the height classification of 404 King Street\r\nor any other building. Any such increase, however, must serve the twin goals of\r\npromoting development and respecting the historic skyline of the City. The City's\r\nown planning documents require this, and I would hold that the City must abide by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActing Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
