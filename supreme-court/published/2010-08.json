Â§ 571.205 (1971)) preempts a state\r\n  law products liability claim premised solely on a manufacturer's choice of\r\n  tempered glass for a vehicle's side windows.Â Â  Federal Motor Vehicle Safety\r\n  Standard 205 (Regulation 205) mandates that &quot;[g]lazing materials[1] for use in motor vehicles â€¦ shall conform&quot; to the American National\r\n  Standard Institute &quot;safety code for safety glazing materials.&quot;Â \r\n  Courts across the country faced with this issue have struggled with the\r\n  preemptive effect, if any, of Regulation 205 and have reached opposite conclusions.Â \r\n  Pending resolution from the United States Supreme Court, we join those\r\n  jurisdictions finding the federal regulation preempts state law, and therefore,\r\n  we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Ford Motor\r\n  Company.\r\nI.\r\nIn the early morning hours of\r\n  August 17, 2002, Preston Cromer was driving a 1997 Ford F-150 pickup truck at\r\n  excessive speed near St. George, South Carolina, when he drove off the road and\r\n  rolled the truck several times.Â  Appellant's son, James Lloyd Priester, who was\r\n  in the rear seat of the truck and not wearing his seatbelt, was ejected and\r\n  died at the scene.Â  Cromer and Priester, both of whom were under twenty-one\r\n  years old, were apparently intoxicated after they had allegedly been served\r\n  alcohol at Showgirls(z), a strip club located in Santee, South Carolina.Â  \r\nAppellant filed a products\r\n  liability claim against Ford.[2]Â  Specifically, Appellant\r\n  alleged Ford &quot;breached said warranty by using inappropriate glazing\r\n  materials which would retain occupants inside the vehicle, and which would not\r\n  shatter on impact.&quot;Â  Ford moved for summary judgment, arguing Regulation\r\n  205 preempted the claim.Â  Ford asserted Regulation 205 provided car\r\n  manufacturers with options of types of glass they were permitted to use, and\r\n  since Ford used one of the glass options, the state law products liability suit\r\n  was preempted by the regulation.Â  Although the court recognized the Fifth\r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion holding Regulation 205 did not\r\n  preempt state law, the trial court agreed with Ford's position and granted its\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nII.\r\nThe preemption doctrine is\r\n  rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and provides\r\n  that any state law that conflicts with federal law is\r\n  &quot;without effect.&quot; Â Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,\r\n  505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992).Â  Two &quot;cornerstones&quot;\r\n  of United States Supreme Court preemption jurisprudence provide: 1) the purpose\r\n  of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case; and 2) courts\r\n  should begin with a presumption against preemption.Â  See Wyeth\r\n    v. Levine, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 1195 (2009). Â Â \r\nA federal law may\r\n  either expressly preempt a state law through specific language clearly stating\r\n  its intent or it may impliedly preempt a state law through field preemption or\r\n  conflict preemption. Hillsborough County, Fla. v. Automated Medical\r\n    Laboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 713\r\n  (1985).Â  Field preemption occurs when the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive that it is\r\n  reasonable to infer that Congress left no room for the states to regulate.Â  Id.Â  On the other hand, conflict preemption occurs where compliance with both\r\n  federal and state regulations is physically impossible or where the state\r\n  regulation &quot;stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\r\n  execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.&quot;Â  Hines v.\r\n    Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941).Â  This case implicates conflict\r\n  preemption.Â  \r\na. Regulation 205\r\nUnder the authority of the\r\n  National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, the National Highway\r\n  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) promulgated Regulation 205.Â  This\r\n  regulation provides:\r\n\r\n  S1.Â  Scope.Â \r\n    This standard specifies requirements for glazing materials for use in motor\r\n    vehicles and motor vehicle equipment.\r\n  S2.Â \r\n    Purpose.Â  The purpose of this standard is to reduce injuries resulting from\r\n    impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in\r\n    motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of\r\n    occupants being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisionsâ€¦.\r\n\r\nRegulation 205 does not\r\n  itself specify which types of glazing materials may be used in motor vehicles.Â \r\n  Rather, it requires adherence to the following safety code developed by the\r\n  American National Standards Institute:\r\n\r\n  S5.1.1.6 \r\n    Multipurpose\r\n    passenger vehicles.Â  Except as otherwise specifically provided by this\r\n    standard, glazing for use in multipurpose passenger vehicles shall conform to\r\n    the requirements for glazing for use in trucks as specified in ANS Z26.\r\n\r\nANS Z26 provides that\r\n  laminated glass or tempered glass may be used on the side windows of motor\r\n  vehicles, so long as the glass meets certain testing requirements.[3]Â \r\n  Laminated glass differs from tempered glass in that laminated glass consists of\r\n  two or more sheets of glass held together by an intervening layer or layers of\r\n  plastic material.Â  Laminated glass will crack and break under sufficient\r\n  impact, but the pieces of glass tend to adhere to the plastic.Â  Conversely,\r\n  tempered glass consists of a single sheet of specially treated glass, and when\r\n  broken, the entire piece immediately shatters into innumerable small, granular\r\n  pieces.Â  Thus, it can be stated generally that tempered glass is safer for\r\n  vehicle occupants wearing seatbelts, where the risk of ejection is reduced,\r\n  because it provides less risk of additional injuries.Â  Laminated glass is safer\r\n  for unbelted passengers, where the risk of ejection is increased, because it is\r\n  likely to keep a passenger inside the vehicle due to the &quot;adhering&quot;\r\n  quality of the glass.\r\nb. NHTSA Study\r\nDuring the 1990s, NHTSA began\r\n  a research program to study rollover accidents in an effort to maximize the protection\r\n  of occupants.Â  NHTSA focused on Regulation 205 and considered whether to modify\r\n  the regulation to mandate manufacturers to use advanced glazing[4] on side windows in order to reduce the likelihood of ejections.Â  See NHTSA, Rollover Prevention, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 57 Fed. Reg.\r\n  242 (Jan. 3, 1992).Â  After studying the costs and benefits associated with the\r\n  use of advanced glazing in side windows, NHTSA issued\r\n  a notice of withdrawal, indicating Regulation 205 would not be modified.Â  See Notice of Withdrawal, 67 Fed. Reg. 41, 365 (June 18, 2002).Â  In the final report explaining the decision not to require\r\n  advanced glazing, NHTSA reported that it found advanced glazing increased the\r\n  risk of neck and back injuries in rollover accidents. Â NHTSA was\r\n  &quot;extremely reluctant to pursue a requirement that may increase injury risk\r\n  for belted occupants to provide safety benefits primarily for unbelted\r\n  occupants, by preventing their ejection from the vehicle,&quot; and thus,\r\n  &quot;the agency will not continue to examine potential regulatory requirement\r\n  for advanced side glazing.&quot;Â  \r\nc. United States Supreme Court\r\nIn Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 529 U.S. 861 (2000), the United States\r\n  Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari from the District of Columbia Circuit\r\n  Court of Appeals in order to resolve a dispute among courts across the country\r\n  regarding whether Regulation 208[5] preempted\r\n  state law products liability claims.Â  Regulation 208 specifies performance\r\n  requirements for passive restraint systems for the protection of occupants in\r\n  vehicle crashes in order to reduce the number of deaths and severity of\r\n  injuries.Â  The regulation set forth a\r\n  detailed timeline in which manufacturers were required to gradually introduce\r\n  airbag technology prior to 1997.Â  Manufacturers were permitted to choose which\r\n  restraint, among a range of different passive restraint devices, e.g.: airbags;\r\n  automatic seatbelts; ignition interlock devices, to incorporate into their\r\n  vehicles.\r\nThe plaintiff in Geier filed a state law products liability claim against Honda.Â  Although the vehicle\r\n  was equipped with a proper seatbelt system and was in compliance with\r\n  Regulation 208, the plaintiff alleged the vehicle was defective because Honda\r\n  failed to equip the vehicle with airbags.Â  The United States Supreme Court\r\n  determined that in promulgating Regulation 208, the Department of\r\n  Transportation deliberately provided the manufacturer with a range of choices\r\n  among different passive restraint devices to be gradually introduced.Â  The\r\n  Court found this phase-in program would lower costs, encourage technological\r\n  developments, overcome technical safety problems, and win consumer acceptance -\r\n  &quot;all of which would promote [Regulation] 208's safety objectives.&quot;Â  Id. at 876.Â  In a five to four decision, the Supreme Court held that the\r\n  plaintiff's suit would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of this\r\n  objective, and therefore, Regulation 208 preempted the state law action.\r\nd. Appellate\r\n  Courts\r\nOf the three appellate courts that have faced this issue, one court\r\n  found no preemption, while two courts found Regulation 205 preempted any state\r\n  law claim.[6]Â  \r\nIn O'Hara v. General Motors, 508 F.3d 753 (5th Cir. 2007),\r\n  the plaintiff brought suit alleging General Motors' use of tempered glass in\r\n  the side window was unreasonably dangerous and contended the use of advanced\r\n  glazing would have decreased the likelihood of passenger ejection.Â Â  The Fifth\r\n  Circuit first found Regulation 205 differed from Regulation 208.Â  The court\r\n  then reviewed the text and history of Regulation 205 and determined &quot;it is\r\n  best understood as a minimum safety standard.&quot;Â  Id. at 762.Â  Thus,\r\n  the Fifth Circuit held the regulation did not preempt the plaintiff's products\r\n  liability suit.\r\nConversely,\r\n  when faced with the same issue, the West Virginia Supreme Court held Regulation\r\n  205 did preempt a claim against a manufacturer in which the plaintiff alleged\r\n  his vehicle was defective because Ford used tempered glass in the side window.Â  Morgan v. Ford Motor Co., 680 S.E.2d 77 (W. Va. 2009).Â  Although the\r\n  court recognized the Fifth Circuit's position in O'Hara, the court found\r\n  &quot;[Regulation] 205 permits the manufacturer to make a choice between\r\n  available safety options for side-window glass; a design defect claim would\r\n  foreclose choosing one of those options.&quot;Â  Id. at 94.Â  In reaching\r\n  this conclusion, the court observed that although this suit concerned only one\r\n  glass option - tempered glass - other lawsuits could theoretically eliminate\r\n  all options allowed by Regulation 205 and &quot;eviscerate the unitary federal\r\n  regulation and leave manufacturers with no options for glazing materials in\r\n  vehicle side windows.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court ultimately found its\r\n  decision was controlled by Geier and held Regulation 205 preempted the\r\n  suit because the purpose of the regulation was to give manufacturers the option\r\n  of choosing between laminated and tempered glass in side windows.\r\nIn Lake\r\n  v. Memphis Landsmen, LLC, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee agreed with the\r\n  West Virginia Supreme Court and found Regulation 205 preempted a state law\r\n  products liability claim.Â  2010 WL 891867 (Tenn. Ct. App. March 15, 2010).Â  The\r\n  court determined that in issuing the notice of withdrawal and declining to\r\n  require advanced glazing, NHTSA intended to adopt a policy that allows the\r\n  option of tempered glass based on cost and safety considerations.Â  Thus, the\r\n  court held because &quot;a rule requiring laminated glass in side windows, as\r\n  proposed by the [plaintiff's state law] claimsâ€¦would serve as 'an obstacle to\r\n  the accomplishment and execution of' a federal policy&quot; Regulation 205\r\n  preempted the suit.Â  Id. at 9 (citing Geier, 529 U.S. at 881).Â  \r\nIII. \r\nClearly,\r\n  courts across the country are struggling over Regulation 205 and whether it\r\n  preempts conflicting state law actions.Â  Nonetheless, in the absence of a\r\n  determination from the United States Supreme Court on this matter, we must\r\n  render our best judgment as to whether Regulation 205 provides a manufacturer\r\n  with options and, therefore, preempts Appellant's suit, or merely provides a\r\n  safety floor and allows Appellant's suit to go forward.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the reasoning espoused in Morgan and Lake and hold\r\n  Regulation 205 preempts this suit.Â  In our view, the purpose of this regulation\r\n  is to provide an automobile manufacturer with a range of choices among\r\n  different types of glazing materials, as opposed to providing a minimum\r\n  standard.Â  Regulation 205 directs manufacturers that they &quot;shall\r\n  conform&quot; to ANS Z26, which specifically provides manufacturers the option\r\n  of using tempered glass for side windows.[7]Â  In issuing\r\n  the notice of withdrawal, NHTSA declined to modify Regulation 205 and require\r\n  advanced glazing.Â  Thus, the notice of withdrawal kept Regulation 205 intact,\r\n  thereby preserving the manufacturer's option to use tempered glass on side\r\n  windows.\r\nTo allow this\r\n  suit to go forward would sanction a jury verdict finding the Ford F-150 pickup\r\n  truck to be defectively designed solely because it selected the federally\r\n  authorized choice of tempered glass.Â  Because we believe such a result would\r\n  stand as an obstacle to achieving the purposes and objectives of Regulation\r\n  205, this state tort action presents a conflict between federal law and state\r\n  law.Â  Thus, Regulation 205 preempts this state law claim based on Ford's\r\n  selection of tempered glass for the side windows of the F-150 pickup truck.Â  Compare\r\n    Wyeth, 129 S.Ct. 1187 (finding no preemption where the regulation provided\r\n  a safety floor for warning labels for drug manufacturers, and the FDA did not\r\n  prohibit manufacturers from adding further warnings to the label; therefore, a\r\n  state law tort claim would not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of\r\n  Congress' purposes).Â  \r\nIV.\r\nWe affirm the\r\n  trial court's order granting Ford's motion for summary judgment. \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The term\r\n  &quot;glazing materials&quot; here refers to the glass used in a motor vehicle. \r\n[2] Additionally,\r\n  Appellant filed a negligence suit against Cromer and a dram shop liability suit\r\n  against Showgirls(z) and Nikki D's alleging the sale of alcohol to minors.Â  \r\n[3] Laminated glass is\r\n  the only type of glazing material manufacturers are allowed to use on\r\n  windshields.\r\n[4] Advanced glazing refers to laminated glass and\r\n  glass-plastic glazing material, which can withstand more impact before\r\n  shattering compared to tempered glass.\r\n[5] Federal Motor\r\n  Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (49 C.F.R. Â§ 571.208).\r\n[6] Several trial courts and districts courts have\r\n  faced this issue.Â  See Erickson v. Ford Motor Co., 2007 WL 2302121 (D.Â  Mont.\r\n  2007); Martinez v. Ford Motor Co., 488 F. Supp.2d 1194 (M.D. Fla. 2007)\r\n  (finding preemption) and Raley v. Hyundai Motor Co., 2010 WL 199971 (W.D.\r\n  Okla. 2010); Spruell v. Ford Motor Co., 2008 WL 906648 (W.D. Ark. 2008); Burns v. Ford Motor Co., 2008 WL 222711 (W.D. Ark. 2008); MCI Sales\r\n    and Serv., Inc. v. Hinton, 272 S.W.3d 17 (Tex. App. 2008) (finding no\r\n  preemption).\r\n[7] We recognize the\r\n  Foreword to ANS Z26 contains language which supports a finding of no\r\n  preemption, but the Foreword also provides that it &quot;is not part of&quot;\r\n  ANS Z26.Â  A careful review of the actual standard, including its technical and\r\n  testing requirements, sets forth clear standards and choices for manufacturers\r\n  and, therefore, favors a finding of preemption. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26847","title":"In the Matter of William Ashley Boyd","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26847","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspended a lawyer.","date":"2010-08-09","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of William Ashley Boyd, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26847\r\nSubmitted June 8, 2010 - Filed August 9, 2010Â  \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.\r\n          Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Ericka M.

Â In the fall of 2009, at\r\n  respondent's instructions, the client sent a check and money order made\r\n  directly payable to respondent.Â  The check and money order totaled $500.00.Â \r\n  Respondent deposited the $500.00 directly into his personal account.Â Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  confronted by the partners of the law firm, respondent admitted that he took\r\n  the $2,000.00 from the two clients and deposited the funds into his own\r\n  personal bank account.Â  Respondent made full restitution to the law firm; he resigned\r\n  from the law firm on November 25, 2009.Â  The law firm reports that no client\r\n  funds were at risk and that the funds deposited into respondent's personal\r\n  accounts were the firm's earned fees.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold funds belonging to clients\r\n    or third persons separately from lawyer's personal account and shall promptly\r\n    deliver funds that others are entitled to receive); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall\r\n    not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct\r\n      involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7,\r\n  RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\n  professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in\r\n  conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the courts or\r\n  the legal profession into disrepute or engage in conduct demonstrating an\r\n  unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhile recognizing the seriousness of this\r\n  misconduct, the Court is aware that respondent did not place any client funds\r\n  at risk, that he has fully repaid his former law firm for the misappropriation,\r\n  that he has resigned from the law firm, and that he has no prior disciplinary\r\n  history.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and\r\n  definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for six (6) months. Â Within\r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE Â SUSPENSION.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26848","title":"In the Matter of Joseph W.

Â He requests that the period of suspension be made\r\n  retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, October 1, 2009.Â  See In the Matter of Ginn, 385 S.C. 240, 684 S.E.2d 176 (2009).Â  We accept\r\n  the agreement and impose a nine (9) month suspension with conditions as stated\r\n  hereafter in this opinion.Â  The suspension shall be made retroactive to the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\n In\r\n  August 2007, respondent was appointed to represent Client A in a\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) matter.Â  Respondent worked on the matter until\r\n  March 2008.Â  From March 2008 until his interim suspension from the practice of\r\n  law on October 1, 2009, respondent did not work on the case or communicate with\r\n  Client A or his family.Â  At the time Client A filed his grievance, he did not\r\n  know the status of his PCR action, in spite of his several letters to\r\n  respondent requesting information about the progress of his case.Â Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nOn\r\n  January 9, 2009, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) received\r\n  notice from respondent's bank that a check in the amount of $8,134.91 was\r\n  presented on insufficient funds in respondent's client trust account.Â \r\n  Respondent was unable to produce the documentation necessary to explain this\r\n  discrepancy because he was not in compliance with the recordkeeping\r\n  requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent did not maintain adequate client\r\n  ledgers and did not conduct appropriate monthly reconciliations of his trust\r\n  account.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 1, 2009, respondent was placed on interim suspension because he did not\r\n  respond to inquiries from the Commission or ODC concerning the insufficient\r\n  fund notice from the bank.Â  Upon notice of his interim suspension, respondent\r\n  contacted ODC and, since that time, he has cooperated with ODC's investigation.\r\nFollowing\r\n  his interim suspension, respondent hired an independent auditor to reconstruct\r\n  his account records.Â  The accountant determined respondent should have had a\r\n  balance of $21,559.36 in client funds in his trust account, although the\r\n  balance was only $3,499.66.Â  The discrepancy was the result of respondent's\r\n  improper commingling of personal funds with client funds in the trust account\r\n  and a concurrent failure by respondent to keep adequate records.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  on several occasions and for various reasons, respondent deposited personal\r\n  funds into his trust account.Â  He issued checks from those funds to himself and\r\n  to third parties without maintaining a ledger or monitoring the balance of\r\n  personal funds in the account.Â  Respondent used $18,059.70 in client money for\r\n  his own benefit.Â  Respondent has restored those funds by delivering them to the\r\n  attorney appointed to protect his clients' interests.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  bank's January 9, 2009, notice of insufficient funds to the Commission occurred\r\n  after a check in the amount of $8,134.91 was issued by respondent to a third\r\n  party on behalf of a client in March 2007, but not negotiated until January\r\n  2009.Â  Because respondent was taking more money out of the trust account than\r\n  he was putting into the account, the funds to cover the check were not\r\n  available when it was presented.Â  Respondent was not aware the check had not\r\n  been negotiated for nearly two years because he was not reconciling his trust account\r\n  or reviewing the bank statements.Â  Respondent has now delivered a cashier's\r\n  check to the third party to cover the insufficient funds.Â  \r\nIn mitigation,\r\n  respondent admits that he has suffered from severe depression which affected\r\n  his judgment and decision making processes; however, in the last year he has\r\n  been able to successfully treat his illness with medication, counseling, and\r\n  other forms of therapy, and he voluntarily entered into a monitoring agreement\r\n  with Lawyers Helping Lawyers.Â  Respondent's psychiatrist now asserts respondent\r\n  is mentally fit and capable of returning to the practice of law.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by\r\n  his misconduct he has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation);\r\n  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\r\n  representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed\r\n  about status of matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\n  information); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall safekeep client funds); Rule 1.15(b)\r\n  (lawyer shall not deposit personal funds in trust account except for amount to\r\n  cover service charges); and Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to\r\n  respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent acknowledges his misconduct violated the financial recordkeeping\r\n  provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent admits that his actions constitute\r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the\r\n  practice of law for nine (9) months, retroactive to the date of his interim\r\n  suspension, subject to the following conditions: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    within one year of the\r\n  date of this order, respondent shall complete the South Carolina Bar's Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program Trust Account School and Ethics School;&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    respondent shall renew\r\n  his monitoring contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers for two years from the\r\n  date of his reinstatement to the practice of law and shall deliver a copy of\r\n  the renewed contract to the Commission as soon as practical after it is signed\r\n  and, on a quarterly basis, respondent shall file an affidavit confirming his\r\n  compliance with the contract and a statement from his monitor confirming his\r\n  compliance with the contract with the Commission; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    each quarter during\r\n  the two year period following his reinstatement to the practice of law\r\n  respondent shall file a statement from his primary treating physician setting\r\n  forth his diagnosis, treatment plan, compliance, and prognosis with the\r\n  Commission; and \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.\r\n    each quarter during\r\n  the two year period following his reinstatement to the practice of law\r\n  respondent shall file copies of his law office bank statements, checks, records\r\n  of deposits, monthly reconciliations, and a statement from his accountant that\r\n  he is in compliance with Rule 417, SCACR, with the Commission.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nWithin\r\n  fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\n  demonstrating he has complied with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for\r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26849","title":"Platt v.

CSX\r\n    Transp., Inc., 379 S.C. 249, 665 S.E.2d 631 (2008).\r\nÂ ISSUES\r\nPetitioner presents\r\n  the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n     I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in\r\n  holding the public duty rule barred Petitioner's claim on SCDOT's negligence\r\n  regarding the traffic lights?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in\r\n  holding Petitioner's claims were preempted by federal law?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;III.\r\n     Did the court of appeals err in\r\n  holding the record lacked evidence to establish the traffic signals as a\r\n  proximate cause of the accident?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF RREVIEW\r\nSummary judgment\r\n  is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear\r\n  that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must\r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Koester v.\r\n    Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  When\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard applied by the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488,\r\n  493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). Â Â Â \r\n\r\nANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSCDOT\r\n  alleges and the court of appeals held that the public duty rule bars Petitioner's\r\n  negligence claims based on statutory obligations.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAn essential element in a cause of action based upon negligence is\r\n  the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Doe v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 63, 72, 651 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2007). Without\r\n  a duty, there is no actionable negligence. Â Id. Â A plaintiff alleging\r\n  negligence on the part of a governmental actor or entity may rely either upon a\r\n  duty created by statute or one founded on the common law. Arthurs ex rel.\r\n    Estate of Munn v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97, 104, 551 S.E.2d 579, 582\r\n  (2001). When the duty is created by statute, we refer to this as a â€œspecial\r\n  duty,â€ whereas when the duty is founded on the common law, we refer to this as\r\n  a legal duty arising from â€œspecial circumstances.â€ See id. at 109-10,\r\n  551 S.E.2d at 585 (explaining that this Court restricts the term special duty\r\n  to those arising from statutes, whereas a legal duty\r\n  arising from a â€œspecial circumstanceâ€ is created under the common law).\r\nUnder\r\n  the public duty rule, public officials are not liable to individuals of the\r\n  public for negligence in discharging their statutory obligations.Â  Tanner v.\r\n    Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 561, 521 S.E.2d 152, 158 (1999).Â \r\n  A public official may be liable if he owed a special duty of care to the\r\n  individual, as determined by a six-factor test, assessing whether: (1)Â  an\r\n  essential purpose of the statute is to protect against a particular kind of\r\n  harm; (2) the statute imposes on a specific public officer a duty to guard\r\n  against or not cause that harm; (3) the class of persons the statute intends to\r\n  protect is identifiable before the fact; (4) the plaintiff is a person within\r\n  that class; (5) the public officers know or should know of the likelihood of\r\n  harm to the class if he fails in his duty; and (6) the officer is given\r\n  sufficient authority to act in the circumstances or he undertakes to act in the\r\n  exercise of his office.Â  Jensen v. Anderson County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,\r\n  304 S.C.195, 200, 403 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1991).Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  does not contend that the six-factor test is met in this case.Â  Rather, she\r\n  argues the public duty rule is not dispositive because SCDOT has a common law\r\n  duty to properly repair and maintain the state highway system, which she\r\n  contends the court of appeals erroneously failed to consider when it affirmed\r\n  the trial court's grant of summary judgment. Â We find Petitioner's common law\r\n  argument is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nWhile\r\n  Petitioner pleaded common law negligence in her complaint, the trial court did\r\n  not rule on that issue, and Petitioner did not file a motion to alter or amend\r\n  the judgment.Â  See I'on L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n  526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (stating if the trial court fails to rule upon an issue\r\n  raised to it, the losing party must file a motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment to preserve that issue for appellate review).Â  In fact, Petitioner did\r\n  not fully assert a common law basis for SCDOT's duty until her reply brief to\r\n  the court of appeals.Â  For these reasons, we hold Petitioner did not properly\r\n  preserve the issue of a common law duty for appellate review.Â  See Lucas v.\r\n    Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E2d 712, 715 (2004) (stating\r\n  issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal). \r\nBecause\r\n  Petitioner's common law argument is unpreserved and the court of appeals\r\n  correctly affirmed the grant of summary judgment regarding SCDOT's statutory\r\n  obligations, Petitioner is unable to establish SCDOT owed a legal duty to Petitioner.Â  See Doe, 375 S.C. at 72, 651 S.E.2d at 309.Â  Without this essential\r\n  element, Petitioner cannot prevail on her negligence claim.Â  See id. Â \r\nHaving\r\n  found Petitioner is unable to establish a legal duty, we need not address Petitioner's\r\n  remaining issues.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Greenville, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (recognizing that appellate court\r\n  need not address remaining issues when determination of one issue is\r\n  dispositive).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals as to the public\r\n  duty rule, and vacate the remainder of that opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  trial court properly granted summary judgment on SCDOT's statutory duty, and\r\n  the court of appeals correctly affirmed on that ground.Â  Petitioner failed to\r\n  preserve her common law duty argument; thus, she cannot establish SCDOT owed\r\n  her a legal duty.Â  Therefore, the court of appeals is affirmed in part and\r\n  vacated in part.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justices James E.

Porter, Frank L. Valenta, Jr., Linda A. Grice, of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Osier P. Blackwell, III (Appellant) appealed the administrative\r\n  law court's (ALC) decision that a conviction for driving with an unlawful\r\n  alcohol concentration constitutes a major violation under the habitual traffic\r\n  offender statute found at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-1020.Â  We certified the case\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 2003, Appellant twice\r\n  was cited for and convicted of driving while under suspension.Â  Appellant was\r\n  cited for driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration (DUAC) in 2006, but\r\n  not convicted until 2008.Â  In July 2008, Appellant received an official Notice\r\n  of Declaration of Habitual Offender Status from the Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles (DMV), which included a five year suspension of his driver's license.\r\nAppellant requested\r\n  a hearing, and the Division of Motor Vehicles Hearings (DMVH) rescinded\r\n  Appellant's suspension.Â  The DMVH found that DUAC is not a major offense under\r\n  the habitual traffic offender statute because it does not include the material\r\n  element of establishing the offender was under the influence of alcohol.Â  Thus,\r\n  DUAC does not equate to the enumerated offense in section 56-1-1020 of\r\n  operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of\r\n  alcohol.\r\nThe DMV appealed to\r\n  the ALC, which reversed the DMVH.Â  South Carolina Code section 56-5-2950(b)(3)\r\n  says that if a person has an alcohol concentration of .08% or greater, then it\r\n  may be inferred that person is under the influence of alcohol.Â  The ALC\r\n  reasoned that because the DUAC statute requires a person's alcohol\r\n  concentration to be at .08% or above, you can infer &quot;under the\r\n  influence&quot; from a DUAC conviction.Â  Thus, if a person is convicted of\r\n  DUAC, it is a major violation of the habitual traffic offender statute because\r\n  it equates to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.Â \r\n  The ALC reversed the DMVH and reinstated Appellant's suspension.Â  Appellant\r\n  appealed, and we certified the case.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from\r\n  the ALC's decision, the Administrative Procedures Act provides the appropriate\r\n  standard of review.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2008).Â  This Court\r\n  will only reverse the ALC's decision if it is:\r\n\r\n  (a) in\r\n    violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n    (b) in\r\n    excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    (c) made upon unlawful\r\n    procedure;\r\n    (d)\r\n    affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n    probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n    (f)\r\n    arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n    unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the ALC erred in reversing the DMVH and reinstating his suspension.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina's habitual offender law states that a person who has been convicted of\r\n  committing at least three described offenses within a three year period is an\r\n  habitual traffic offender.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-1020 (2006).Â  Included in the\r\n  list is &quot;operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under\r\n  the influence of intoxicating liquors, narcotics or drugs.&quot;Â  Id. Â§\r\n  56-1-1020(a)(2).\r\nAppellant\r\n  was convicted of driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration under section\r\n  56-5-2933, which states that it is &quot;unlawful for a person to drive a motor\r\n  vehicle within this State while his alcohol concentration is eight\r\n  one-hundredths of one percent or more.&quot;Â  This offense is distinct from\r\n  &quot;operating a motor vehicle while under influence of alcohol or\r\n  drugs,&quot; which requires the driver to be under the influence of alcohol to\r\n  the extent that the driver's faculties are &quot;materially and appreciably\r\n  impaired.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 56-5-2930.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that because the habitual offender statute uses the language &quot;under\r\n  the influence,&quot; an offense that does not require a showing of being\r\n  &quot;under the influence&quot; may not be counted against him under the\r\n  statute.Â  The ALC, on the other hand, found that DUAC is comparable to\r\n  operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and thus is sufficient for the\r\n  habitual offender statute.Â  We agree.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  the ALC found that while &quot;under the influence&quot; is not defined within\r\n  the statutes, section 56-5-2950(b)(3) states that if a driver's alcohol\r\n  concentration is .08% or higher, it may be inferred that the driver is under\r\n  the influence of alcohol.Â  Thus, because a driver must have an alcohol\r\n  concentration of at least .08% to be convicted of DUAC, an inference of\r\n  &quot;under the influence&quot; may be inferred from a DUAC conviction.Â  That\r\n  permissible inference, along with the broad and inclusive nature of the\r\n  habitual offender statute,[1] supports the ALC's ruling that a conviction of DUAC is contemplated by and\r\n  qualifies under the habitual offender statute.Â  \r\nThe offense of DUAC\r\n  carries a permissible inference of being under the influence.Â  A conviction\r\n  under section 56-5-2930 requires a driver to be under the influence to a\r\n  certain extent.Â  A driver may have an alcohol concentration sufficient to\r\n  support a conviction of DUAC and trigger the inference, but his faculties may\r\n  not be impaired to the degree required for a conviction under section 56-5-2930.Â \r\n  Both offenses are predicated upon a driver operating a vehicle while under the\r\n  influence of alcohol, albeit to potentially different extents.Â  The plain\r\n  language of the habitual offender statute only requires a driver to be under\r\n  the influence - it does not have the higher standard of section 56-5-2930.Â \r\n  Therefore, a conviction for DUAC qualifies as a major violation under the\r\n  habitual offender statute.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  reasons, the ALC's decision\r\n  that a conviction for driving with an unlawful alcohol concentration\r\n  constitutes a major violation under the habitual traffic offender statute is affirmed.\r\nHEARN, J. and\r\n  Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE: I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  The habitual traffic offender statute defines a &quot;habitual\r\n  offender&quot; as a person who has:\r\n\r\n  (a) Three or more convictions,\r\n    singularly or in combination of any of the following separate and\r\n      distinct offensesarising out of separate acts:\r\n  (1)\r\n    Voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide resulting\r\n    from the operation of a motor vehicle; \r\n  (2) Operating or attempting to\r\n    operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\r\n    narcotics or drugs; \r\n  (3) Driving or operating a\r\n    motor vehicle in a reckless manner; \r\n  (4) Driving a motor vehicle\r\n    while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been\r\n    suspended or revoked, except a conviction for driving under suspension for\r\n    failure to file proof of financial responsibility; \r\n  (5) Any offense punishable as\r\n    a felony under the motor vehicle laws of this State or any felony in the\r\n    commission of which a motor vehicle is used; \r\n  (6) Failure of the driver of a\r\n    motor vehicle involved in any accident resulting in the death or injury of any\r\n    person to stop close to the scene of such accident and report his identity;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-1020(a)\r\n  (2006) (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  habitual offender statute lists six specific offenses that &quot;count&quot;\r\n  towards habitual offender status.Â  Indeed, the legislature elected to limit\r\n  qualifying offenses to the enumerated &quot;separate and distinct\r\n  offenses.&quot;Â  The enumerated offenses set forth in sections (1), (2), (3),\r\n  (4) and (6), refer to specific statutory offenses,[2] and section (5) incorporates the provisions of the motor vehicle laws\r\n  punishable as a felony.\r\nGiven\r\n  the clear statutory language, I take the view that if an offense is not one of\r\n  the six listed in the habitual offender statute, the conviction may not\r\n  &quot;count&quot; towards habitual offender status.Â  The offense of driving\r\n  with an unlawful alcohol concentration (DUAC) is not included as one of the\r\n  section 56-1-1020(a) offenses.Â  I thus conclude the offense of DUAC is not a\r\n  qualifying offense under section 56-1-1020(a) for habitual offender status.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  I disagree with the Court's attempt to satisfy the statute by equating the\r\n  offense of DUI with the offense of DUAC.Â  Under South Carolina law, DUI and\r\n  DUAC are different offenses.Â  See Â§ 56-5-2930 and Â§ 56-5-2933.Â  The element of &quot;driving under the influence&quot; is not\r\n  present in an offense for DUAC.Â  I respectfully disagree with the\r\n  majority's analysis which bootstraps Â§ 56-5-2950(b)(3), a permissible inference\r\n  provision located in an entirely different statute, to the DUAC statute in\r\n  order to reach the conclusion that a conviction for DUAC qualifies as a\r\n  conviction of &quot;operating or attempting to\r\n  operate a motor vehicle while under the influence.&quot;\r\nI certainly understand the policy rationale for including the\r\n  offense of DUAC as a qualifying offense for habitual traffic offender status,\r\n  but that determination lies with the legislature and not this Court.Â  \r\nI\r\n  vote to reverse the decision of the ALC.Â  \r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The legislative declaration of policy also supports the ALC's reading of the\r\n  habitual offender statute.Â  See id.Â§ 56-1-1010 (stating the policy\r\n  behind the legislation is to provide for the safety of people on public roads,\r\n  to deny driving privileges to those drivers who demonstrate indifference to\r\n  traffic laws, and to discourage drivers from repeatedly violating traffic\r\n  laws). \r\n[2] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-1-440, 56-5-1210, 56-5-2910, 56-5-2920,\r\n  and 56-5-2930 (2008).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26851","title":"Mathis v.

Employment History\r\nMathis was employed\r\n  as an account executive and producer for Reidman Insurance in Spartanburg,\r\n  which was acquired by Appellant during Mathis's employment.Â  In 2003, Mathis\r\n  left employment with Appellant and went to work with a company that would later\r\n  become Carolina First.\r\n In 2004, Mathis\r\n  received a call from an acquaintance, Herb McBride, the Profit Center Manager\r\n  for Appellant's Greenville office.Â  The two had lunch a number of times and\r\n  began to discuss Mathis returning to work for Appellant.Â  In August 2004,\r\n  McBride verbally offered Mathis a salary of $90,000 per year for the first year\r\n  of employment with Appellant, as well as a 20% commission on new business\r\n  generated by Mathis.Â  Additionally, Mathis would be assigned the $300,000 book\r\n  of business of a departing producer and, in six months, would be named the\r\n  Sales Manager.Â  Mathis declined the offer.Â  \r\nMcBride\r\n  later laid out a new offer, which he then communicated in an e-mail (the\r\n  McBride e-mail) which provided in part:\r\n\r\n  This offer is from Hyatt Brown.Â  The guaranteed salary\r\n    for the first year is $110,000.Â  You will be assigned the duties,\r\n    responsibilities, and title of sales manager.Â  Going forward I will assign, at\r\n    least, $500,000 in coded existing business to comply with the 40/20 [commission\r\n    structure] or apply the appropriate salary as a sales manager to insure that\r\n    the second year will be $120,000 earnings.Â  As we discussed, if you are meeting\r\n    your goals and achievements, doing your part, we will make sure we do our part\r\n    and you are taken care [of] going forward.Â  You will have an open expense\r\n    account for customary expenses less than $100.Â  Anything larger will require my\r\n    approval.\r\n\r\nHyatt Brown was the CEO of\r\n  Appellant's corporate office.Â  Mathis testified that McBride explained that\r\n  Hyatt Brown was involved through &quot;corporate assistance,&quot; which meant\r\n  that corporate headquarters was willing to pay part of Mathis's salary.Â  After\r\n  further negotiations, on September 17, 2004, Mathis accepted the offer and sent\r\n  his resignation letter to Carolina First.Â  Mathis began work on September 27, 2004.Â  Two days later, he signed an Employment Agreement.\r\nB. Employment with Appellant\r\nMathis\r\n  testified that he arrived for work one morning and found a blank copy of a\r\n  corporate assistance form on his chair with a note from McBride saying that\r\n  they needed to discuss the document.Â  Mathis reviewed the document and noticed\r\n  that it contained language providing for certain production goals and\r\n  consequences for failing to meet the goals.Â  According to Mathis, he objected to\r\n  McBride that such contingencies were not part of his contract deal to which\r\n  McBride responded that Mathis's salary would be unaffected by any failure to\r\n  meet the goals.\r\nIn\r\n  February 2005, McBride was replaced as Profit Center Manager by Clay Collins.Â \r\n  Mathis testified that he met with Collins and brought his correspondence and\r\n  employee records.Â  Collins explained that he would not need a sales manager as\r\n  he would be handling those duties himself.Â  Mathis testified that he told\r\n  Collins that he expected to have his job offer honored, to which Collins\r\n  responded that he needed time to get acclimated to the new job and they would\r\n  discuss the matter later.\r\nIn\r\n  an e-mail in May 2005, Collins placed limits on expense accounts which were\r\n  inconsistent with Mathis's agreement with McBride.Â  In July 2005, Collins asked\r\n  to meet with Mathis and informed him that, due to his failure to meet corporate\r\n  assistance goals, he would reduce Mathis's salary to $90,000.Â  According to\r\n  Mathis, he told Collins that &quot;it was wrong&quot; and that the two of them\r\n  needed to speak with McBride, but Collins declined to do so.Â  Mathis testified\r\n  that he then turned to McBride who explained that he could not help Mathis.Â \r\n  Beginning August 8, Appellant paid Mathis at the reduced salary.\r\nIn\r\n  January 2006, Collins set new goals for Mathis for the coming year and warned\r\n  that &quot;[a]ny future short falls in new business and growth to your book\r\n  will certainly have an impact on your compensation.&quot;Â  Mathis responded\r\n  with a letter in which he detailed his negotiations with McBride and the terms\r\n  set forth in the e-mails from McBride.Â  In a memo dated March 10, 2006, Collins\r\n  again outlined payment reductions and extended a termination offer to Mathis.Â \r\n  The memo provided, in part: \r\n\r\n  In an email sent by Herb McBride (Profit Center\r\n    Manager at the time) in September 2004, it was agreed that you would earn\r\n    $110,000 in the first year and $120,000 in the second year of employment.Â  In\r\n    return for full cooperation with reasonable requests made by me, I am prepared\r\n    to continue paying your current bi-weekly draw of $3,461.54 through March 31,\r\n    2006.Â  During this time, you will be expected to meet with all current clients\r\n    and future prospects currently in inventory in order to make full introductions\r\n    to the new agent handling the account or myself as the Profit Center Manager.Â \r\n    In return, I will provide you with a severance package totaling $16,124.86\r\n    which is equivalent to the pro-rata difference of $110,000 Year 1 and $120,000\r\n    Year 2 salaries that were originally agreed upon versus amounts paid through\r\n    March 31, 2006.\r\n\r\nMathis did not respond to the\r\n  offer and was terminated.Â  Mathis then instituted this action.\r\nC. Procedural History\r\nThe\r\n  trial court found a two-year contract of employment existed between the parties\r\n  and that Appellant breached the terms of the contract by reducing Mathis's\r\n  pay.Â  The court further found that there was no bona fide dispute regarding the\r\n  wages due Mathis and that Appellant violated the Payment of Wages Act by\r\n  failing to pay Mathis the contract amount.Â  Pursuant to the Payment of Wages\r\n  Act, the trial court awarded Mathis three times the unpaid wages of his\r\n  two-year contract, plus attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2005).Â  The award was based on the difference between the\r\n  reduced wages and the contractual compensation during the period Mathis\r\n  remained employed, plus the wages he would have earned for the remaining term\r\n  of the contract, less post-termination wages earned from other employment during\r\n  that term.Â  Appellant appealed, contesting a number of issues from the trial\r\n  court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nActions seeking\r\n  damages for breach of contract and actions for violation of the Payment of\r\n  Wages Act are actions at law.Â  See McCall v. ICON, 380 S.C. 649,\r\n  657, 670 S.E.2d 695, 700 (2008); Ross v. Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\r\n  371 S.C. 464, 468, 639 S.E.2d 460, 462 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In an action at law\r\n  tried without a jury, the trial judgeâ€™s findings have the force and effect of a\r\n  jury verdict upon the issues and are conclusive on appeal when supported by\r\n  competent evidence.Â  See Beheler v. Natâ€™l Grange Mut. Ins. Co.,\r\n  252 S.C. 530, 535, 167 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1975).Â  Accordingly, this Courtâ€™s scope\r\n  of review is limited to determining whether the findings are supported by\r\n  competent evidence and correcting errors of law.Â  See Temple v.\r\n    Tec-Fab, Inc., 381 S.C. 597, 600, 675 S.E.2d 414, 415 (2009).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the trial court err in finding\r\n  that Appellant breached its contract with Mathis?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n     Did the trial court err in finding\r\n  that Appellant violated the Payment of Wages Act?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did the trial court err in\r\n  applying the Payment of Wages Act to prospective wages?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Did the trial court order comply\r\n  with Rule 52, SCRCP?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.\r\n    Did the trial court err in denying\r\n  a change of venue?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that Appellant breached its contract with Mathis?\r\nAppellant\r\n  does not dispute that a contract was created by the McBride e-mail, but instead\r\n  contends that it did not breach the contract for the following reasons: (1) the\r\n  McBride e-mail did not establish a term contract but rather one of indefinite\r\n  duration; (2) Mathis was employed â€œat willâ€; (3) even if the McBride e-mail\r\n  established a term contract, Mathis was estopped from raising any claims for\r\n  breach by continuing to work following the compensation change; and (4) the\r\n  contract was voidable because it was induced by Mathisâ€™s misrepresentations as\r\n  to the size of his business at Carolina First.Â  We address each argument in\r\n  turn.\r\nA. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that the McBride e-mail established a term contract rather than one of\r\n  indefinite duration?\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that the McBride e-mail did not create a contract of definite term.Â \r\n  Appellant therefore argues that it was free to reduce Mathisâ€™s pay without\r\n  violating the contract.Â  We find there is competent evidence to support the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding that the e-mail created a contract of definite term.\r\nAppellant\r\n  correctly notes that &quot;'[i]n order for a contract to be valid and\r\n  enforceable, the parties must have a meeting of the minds as to all essential\r\n  and material terms of the agreement.'&quot;Â  Davis v. Greenwood Sch. Dist.\r\n    50, 365 S.C. 629, 634, 620 S.E.2d 65, 67 (2005).Â  Appellant argues that,\r\n  &quot;[a]t a minimum, there was no meeting of the minds regarding [Appellant's]\r\n  right to terminate the employment relationship at-will&quot;:\r\n\r\n  The McBride e-mail makes it clear that Mathis['s]\r\n    employment was of indefinite duration.Â  It specifically stated, &quot;As we\r\n    discussed, if you are meeting your goals and achievements, doing your part, we\r\n    will make sure we do our part and make sure you are taken care of going\r\n    forward.&quot;Â  Therefore, no definite term was established, but rather the\r\n    employment period was intended by both parties to be indefinite.\r\n  The McBride e-mail provides, in\r\n    relevant part, as follows:\r\n  As we discussed, we at Brown &amp; Brown are convinced\r\n    that you are a big part of our future.Â  This offer is from Hyatt Brown.Â  The\r\n    guaranteed salary for the first year is $110,000.Â  You will be assigned the\r\n    duties, responsibilities and title of sales manager.Â  Going forward, I will\r\n    assign at least $500,000 in coded existing business to comply with the 40/20 or\r\n    apply the appropriate salary as a sales manager to insure that the second year\r\n    will be $120,000 earnings.Â  As we discussed, if you are meeting your goals and\r\n    achievements, doing your part, we will make sure we do our part and you are\r\n    taken care of going forward. Â \r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find that the plain language of the e-mail refutes Appellant's contention that\r\n  &quot;the employment period was intended by both parties to be indefinite&quot;\r\n  and that Appellant could terminate the relationship at-will.Â  The e-mail\r\n  specifically refers to two years of employment.Â  The document guarantees Mathis\r\n  one-year of employment at a salary of $110,000.Â  It then provides that McBride\r\n  will &quot;insure that the second year will be $120,000 in earnings.&quot;Â \r\n  These statements provide competent evidence to support the trial court's\r\n  finding that the contract was a two-year contract.Â  That the parties may or may\r\n  not have chosen to continue their relationship beyond the two-year term does\r\n  not render the contract one of indefinite duration.Â  The vague language cited\r\n  by Appellant that &quot;if you are meeting your goals and achievements, doing\r\n  your part, we will make sure we do our part and you are taken care of going\r\n  forward&quot; does not refute the language providing for, at minimum, two years\r\n  of guaranteed employment.Â  See Moody v. McLellan, 295 S.C. 157,\r\n  367 S.E.2d 449, 451 (Ct. App. 1988) (courts must interpret contracts based on\r\n  their plain language).Â  Moreover, even if the language creates an ambiguity, a\r\n  court will construe any doubts and ambiguities in an agreement against the\r\n  drafter of the agreement.Â  See Duncan v. Little, 384 S.C. 420,\r\n  425, 682 S.E.2d 788, 790 (2009). \r\nB. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that Mathis was not employed &quot;at-will&quot;?\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that overwhelming evidence demonstrates that Mathis was employed\r\n  &quot;at-will&quot; and, consequently, the trial court erred in finding that\r\n  the contract between Mathis and Appellant was a term contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, employment at-will is presumed absent the creation of a\r\n  specific contract of employment.Â  See Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop.,\r\n  335 S.C. 330, 334-36, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925-26 (1999).Â  An at-will employee may\r\n  be terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason, with or without\r\n  cause.Â  See Hessenthaler v. Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., 365\r\n  S.C. 101, 107, 616 S.E.2d 694, 697 (2005).\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that while Mathis may have initially been party to a term contract, by\r\n  signing the Employment Agreement, he became an at-will employee.Â  Appellant\r\n  cites to the case of Cape v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 365 S.C. 316,\r\n  618 S.E.2d 881 (2005), for the proposition that a term contract may be altered\r\n  to at-will.Â  365 S.C. at 319, 618 S.E.2d at 883.Â  We find that Cape is\r\n  not applicable here.Â  \r\nIn Cape,\r\n  a teacher signed a contract for a specific school year which contained a\r\n  provision specifying that the contract was for at-will employment.Â  Id. at 317, 618 S.E.2d at 882.Â  This Court noted that a contract for a definite\r\n  term â€œis presumptively terminable only upon just causeâ€ but found that the\r\n  parties had &quot;by express contract provision, altered the presumption that employment for a definite term is terminable only upon just cause, and\r\n  replaced that presumption with an at-will termination clause.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).Â  The instant case is markedly different than Cape as\r\n  the e-mail which formed the basis for the contract did not contain an at-will\r\n  clause, and instead only referenced the definite term.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the document which Appellant contends converted the contract from a term\r\n  contract to an at-will contract was signed after the contract was\r\n  created.Â  Any subsequent agreement must be supported by consideration and\r\n  Appellant has shown no separate consideration to support the Employment\r\n  Agreement.Â  See Poole v. Incentives Unlimited, Inc., 345 S.C.\r\n  378, 548 S.E.2d 207 (2001) (holding that when a\r\n  covenant is entered into after the inception of employment, separate\r\n  consideration, in addition to continued employment, is necessary in order for\r\n  the covenant to be enforceable).\r\nAppellant\r\n  further contends that &quot;Mathis was aware from the outset of his discussions\r\n  about the possibility of working for [Appellant] . . . that his employment\r\n  would be at-will and governed by [Appellantâ€™s] Employment Agreement.&quot;Â \r\n  However, the portions of the record cited by Appellant do not support this\r\n  contention.Â  Mathis admits that, based on his past employment with Appellant,\r\n  he expected that he would have to sign an Employment Agreement, which he\r\n  referred to as a &quot;non-piracy&quot; agreement.Â  However, while Mathis\r\n  testified that he expected certain non-compete clauses to be part of the\r\n  Employment Agreement, Appellant did not demonstrate that Mathis knew that the\r\n  Employment Agreement specified at-will employment.Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  the above, we find competent evidence supports the trial court's finding that\r\n  the contract between Appellant and Mathis was a term contract rather than an\r\n  at-will contract.\r\nC. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that Appellant breached its contract with Mathis where Appellant had a\r\n  reasonable good faith belief that it had &quot;cause&quot; to terminate Mathis?\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that even if its contract with Mathis was a term contract and,\r\n  consequently, could only be terminated &quot;for cause,&quot; Appellant had a\r\n  reasonable good faith belief that it had &quot;cause&quot; to terminate Mathis.Â \r\n  Consequently, in Appellant's view, it did not breach the contract by reducing\r\n  Mathisâ€™s salary or discharging him and the trial court erred in finding to the\r\n  contrary.Â  We find that this issue is not properly preserved for our review.\r\nIn\r\n  order for an issue to be properly preserved for appeal, it must have been both\r\n  raised to and ruled on by the trial court.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town\r\n    of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000). Â The trial\r\n  court's order did not address Appellant's argument that it had\r\n  &quot;cause&quot; to terminate Mathis's contract.Â  Appellant's Motion to Alter\r\n  or Amend did not bring the absence of this issue to the trial court's attention.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved.Â  \r\nD. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that Mathis was not estopped from raising his claims by continuing to\r\n  work following the compensation change?\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that even if the McBride e-mail established a term contract, the trial\r\n  court erred in finding that it breached the contract as Mathis was estopped\r\n  from raising claims regarding the change in compensation by continuing to work\r\n  for Appellant.Â  We disagree.[1]\r\nAs\r\n  noted above, Collins informed Mathis of the compensation change in writing in a\r\n  letter dated August 1, 2005.Â  According to Mathis, Collins verbally notified\r\n  him of the change during a meeting on July 18, 2005.Â  Mathis testified that he\r\n  objected to the change and asked that they discuss the matter with McBride,\r\n  which Collins declined to do.Â  Mathis then claimed that he raised the issue\r\n  with McBride and presented Collins with McBride's initial offer, explaining\r\n  that he had declined the offer and instead accepted a two-year guarantee.Â \r\n  Months later, in response to a letter from Collins referencing Mathis's\r\n  agreement with McBride, Mathis sent a letter to Collins detailing his negotiations\r\n  with McBride and the e-mail offers.\r\nAppellant\r\n  claims that because Mathis continued to work for Appellant in the months\r\n  following the change in compensation, he is estopped from raising contract and\r\n  wage claims.Â  In support of its argument, Appellant cites Facelli v.\r\n    Southeast Mktg. Co., 284 S.C. 449, 327 S.E.2d 338 (1985).Â  In Facelli,\r\n  this Court found that an employee who continued to work for his employer for\r\n  six months without complaint following a change to his commission rate\r\n  impliedly consented to the change.Â  Id. at 452, 327 S.E.2d at 339.Â \r\n  Consequently, the employee was estopped from seeking damages for the change.Â  Id.\r\nMathis\r\n  argues that Facelli is distinguishable from the instant case because,\r\n  unlike the employee in Facelli, Mathis objected to the compensation\r\n  change.Â  Two cases from the Court of Appeals are instructive on this point and\r\n  reach different conclusions on the issue.Â  In Matthews v. City of Greenwood,\r\n  305 S.C. 267, 407 S.E.2d 668 (Ct. App. 1991), the Court of Appeals relied on Facelli in upholding a circuit court's ruling granting summary judgment on an\r\n  employee's claim based on a unilateral change in his original employment\r\n  contract.Â  Id. at 270-71, 407 S.E.2d at 669-670.Â  The City initially\r\n  agreed to provide the employee with a car for personal and business use, but\r\n  then gave the employee notice of a new policy which prohibited personal use of\r\n  city vehicles.Â  Id. at 270, 407 S.E.2d at 669.Â  Despite the fact that\r\n  Matthews protested the change, the Court of Appeals found that by continuing to\r\n  work for approximately seven years after the change, he was estopped from\r\n  seeking damages.Â  Id. at 271, 407 S.E.2d at 670.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion in Estes v. Roper Temp.\r\n    Serv., 304 S.C. 120, 403 S.E.2d 157 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Estes involved\r\n  an employee whose written employment contract was unilaterally altered by her\r\n  employer.Â  Id. at 121, 403 S.E.2d at 158.Â  The Court of Appeals noted\r\n  that the employee &quot;did not agree to these changes and, indeed, objected to\r\n  them while continuing to work&quot; and it found that the trial court erred in\r\n  finding the employee estopped from asserting the breach of contract action.Â  Id. at 122, 403 S.E.2d at 158.\r\nThe Estes court noted that the employer, as the party seeking estoppel, was required to\r\n  prove the elements of estoppel, including that the employee &quot;engaged in\r\n  conduct that amounted to a false misrepresentation or concealment.&quot;Â  Id.,\r\n  citing Frady v. Smith, 247 S.C. 353, 359, 147 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1966) (the\r\n  party estopped must have made a false misrepresentation or concealment or made\r\n  some representation calculated to convey an incorrect impression of the facts), overruled on other grounds by Tolemac, Inc. v. United Trading, Inc.,\r\n  326 S.C. 103, 484 S.E.2d 593 (1997).Â  The court continued: \r\n\r\n  The trial court, relying upon [Facelli] found\r\n    Estes made a false representation by continuing to work and receive\r\n    compensation.Â  In Facelli, the Supreme Court held that an employeeâ€™s\r\n    continuing to work and accept compensation, without either objecting to or\r\n    complaining about a change in compensation, constitutes a representation that\r\n    the employee impliedly consents to the employerâ€™s unilateral change in\r\n    compensation.Â  The trial court, however, ignored the fact that in this instance\r\n    the employee objected to the change in compensation.Â  This circumstance alone\r\n    distinguishes the case here from Facelli.Â  More importantly, it creates\r\n    a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Estes consented to the change in\r\n    compensation and thus renders summary judgment inappropriate.\r\n\r\nEstes, 304\r\n  S.C. at 122, 403 S.E.2d at 158.\r\nWe are\r\n  most persuaded by Estes, as we find it to be more relevant factually and\r\n  that it best comports with the doctrine of estoppel.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law\r\n  Dictionary 589 (8th ed. 2004) (defining estoppel, in part, as: &quot;A bar that\r\n  prevents one from asserting a claim or right that contradicts what one has said\r\n  or done before or what has been legally established as true.&quot;).Â  We\r\n  therefore hold that, on these facts, there was a genuine issue of material fact\r\n  whether Mathis consented to the compensation reduction by continuing employment\r\n  with Appellant.Â  We find competent evidence to support the trial court's\r\n  finding that Mathis did not impliedly consent by continuing to work following\r\n  the reduction in pay.\r\nE. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that the contract was not voidable because it was induced by Mathis's\r\n  misrepresentation?\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends the trial court erred in finding it breached its contract with Mathis\r\n  because the contract was induced by Mathis's misrepresentations regarding his\r\n  book of business at Carolina First and is therefore voidable.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  contract may be rescinded for mistake, if justice so requires, where the\r\n  mistake is unilateral and has been induced by the fraud, deceit,\r\n  misrepresentation, concealment, or imposition of the party opposed to the\r\n  recission, without negligence on the part of the party claiming recission.Â  See King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 313, 318 S.E.2d 125, 128 (Ct. App. 1984),\r\n  citing Jumper v. Queen Mab Lumber Co., 115 S.C. 452, 106 S.E. 473\r\n  (1921).Â  We find there is conflicting evidence whether Mathis made\r\n  misrepresentations to Appellant.Â  Clearly, the trial judge made a credibility\r\n  determination in favor of Mathis.Â  We find that the trial court's determination\r\n  is supported by competent evidence and he did not err in failing to find the\r\n  contract voidable based on misrepresentation.Â  See Pinckney v. Warren,\r\n  344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001) (scope of review does not require\r\n  appellate court to disregard findings below or ignore the fact that the trial\r\n  judge is in the better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses).Â  \r\nII. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding that Appellant violated the Payment of Wages Act?\r\nAs\r\n  noted, the trial court found that Appellant withheld wages from Mathis though\r\n  there was no bona fide dispute as to wages due.Â  The court therefore found that\r\n  Appellant violated the Payment of Wages Act and awarded Mathis an amount equal\r\n  to three times the unpaid wages, plus costs and attorney's fees.Â  Appellant\r\n  contends that the trial court erred in finding that it violated the Payment of\r\n  Wages Act because (1) there was a bona fide dispute as to wages due Mathis, and\r\n  (2) Appellant provided seven days notice prior to the compensation change as\r\n  required under the Payment of Wages Act.\r\nA. Bona fide dispute\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in ruling that Appellant did not have any\r\n  bona fide dispute to Respondent's contract and Payment of Wages Act claims.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40 generally requires an employer to timely pay all wages due\r\n  and Â§ 41-10-50 provides that when an employer discharges an employee, it must\r\n  timely pay him all wages due.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-40, 50 (Supp. 2005).Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) provides that when an employer violates the\r\n  provisions of Â§Â§ 41-10-40 or 41-10-50 &quot;the employee may recover in a civil\r\n  action an amount equal to three times the full amount of the unpaid wages, plus costs and\r\n  reasonable attorney's fees as the court may allow.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2005).Â  However, this Court held in Rice v. Multimedia,\r\n    Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 456 S.E.2d 381 (1995), that the penalty set forth in Â§\r\n  41-10-80(C) is discretionary with the trial judge.Â  318 S.C. at 98, 456 S.E.2d\r\n  at 383.Â  The Court reasoned that &quot;[t]he imposition of treble damages in\r\n  those cases where there is a bona fide dispute would be unjust and\r\n  harsh.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that &quot;[t]o warrant reversal, [Brown &amp; Brown] need only\r\n  establish that one of the following defenses constitutes a bona fide defense or\r\n  good faith dispute&quot; and then lists each of the arguments set forth in its\r\n  brief.Â  However, the relevant date for determining whether the employer\r\n  reasonably withheld wages is the time at which the wages were withheld, i.e.,\r\n  when the employer allegedly violated the Act.Â  See Rice, 318 S.C.\r\n  at 99, 456 S.E.2d at 383 (in enacting the Payment of Wages Act, &quot;the\r\n  legislature intended to punish the employer who forces the employee to resort\r\n  to the court in an unreasonable or bad faith wage dispute.&quot;).Â  The\r\n  question before this Court, therefore, is whether, at the time that Appellant\r\n  reduced Mathis's compensation, it had a reasonable good faith reason for doing\r\n  so. Â Consequently, Appellant's arguments that it reasonably believed that the\r\n  agreed-upon compensation was not owed Mathis due to (1) his waiver by\r\n  continuing to work after the change; and (2) alleged violations of the\r\n  non-piracy provisions cannot justify the decision to reduce Mathis's guaranteed\r\n  salary.[2]Â  \r\nWe\r\n  have addressed Appellant's remaining arguments above and we find competent\r\n  evidence supports the trial court's finding that no bona fide dispute existed\r\n  to support Appellant's decision.Â  \r\n\r\nB. Required Notice\r\nAppellant\r\n  also contends that the trial court erred in finding that it violated the\r\n  Payment of Wages Act because it complied with the Act by providing Mathis with\r\n  seven days notice prior to the compensation change, in accordance with S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30 requires, in part:\r\n\r\n  Every\r\n    employer shall notify each employee in writing at the time of hiring of the normal\r\n    hours and wages agreed upon, the time and place of payment, and the deductions\r\n    which will be made from the wages, including payments to insurance programs.Â \r\n    The employer has the option of giving written notification by posting the terms\r\n    conspicuously at or near the place of work.Â  Any changes in these terms must be\r\n    made in writing at least seven calendar days before they become effective.Â \r\n    This section does not apply to wage increases.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2005).Â  Appellant notes that, in a letter dated August 1, Clay Collins\r\n  informed Mathis of the reduction in salary effective August 8.Â  Consequently,\r\n  in Appellant's view, &quot;[b]y giving Mathis seven-days written notice of the\r\n  change in his compensation structure, [Brown &amp; Brown] fully\r\n  complied with the Payment of Wages Act regardless of the Trial Court's ruling\r\n  regarding Mathisâ€™s contract claim.&quot;\r\nEven\r\n  assuming that Appellant has complied with the requirements of Â§ 41-10-30(A),\r\n  this alone does not show full compliance with the Payment of Wages Act.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40(C) provides: &quot;An employer shall not withhold or\r\n  divert any portion of an employeeâ€™s wages unless the employer is required or\r\n  permitted to do so by state or federal law or the employer has given written\r\n  notification to the employee of the amount and terms of the deductions as\r\n  required by subsection (A) of Â§ 41-10-30.&quot;Â  Appellant cannot comply with Â§\r\n  41-10-40(C) merely by giving notice, as the latter half of the statute applies\r\n  only to â€œdeductions.â€Â  In altering Mathisâ€™s salary, Appellantâ€™s action\r\n  constituted a reduction rather than a deduction.Â  A\r\n  &quot;deduction&quot; within the terms of the statute, is the act of taking\r\n  away from a salary in order to fund some benefit.Â  This is how the term is used\r\n  in the context of Â§ 41-10-30(A): &quot;Every employer shall notify each\r\n  employee in writing at the time of hiring of the normal hours and wages agreed\r\n  upon, the time and place of payment, and the deductions which will be made\r\n    from the wages, including payments to insurance programs.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  This reading better comports\r\n  with the purpose of the Payment of Wages Act, which is &quot;to protect\r\n  employees from the unjustified and willful retention of wages by the employer.&quot;Â  Rice, 318 S.C. at 98, 456 S.E.2d at 383.\r\nUnder\r\n  this interpretation, Appellant cannot comply with the Payment of Wages Act,\r\n  while breaching the contract, simply by providing seven days notice of the\r\n  breach.Â  Consequently, even assuming that Appellant gave notice, we find\r\n  competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that Appellant violated\r\n  the Act.\r\n\r\nIII. Did the trial court err in\r\n  finding the Payment of Wages Act applies to prospective wages?\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that the trial court erred in awarding Mathis damages for prospective\r\n  wages under the Payment of Wages Act.[3]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nAs\r\n  noted above, this Court has held that the purpose of the Payment of Wages Act\r\n  is &quot;to protect employees from the unjustified and willful retention of\r\n  wages by the employer.&quot;Â  Rice, 318 S.C. at 98, 456 S.E.2d at 383.Â \r\n  The Act itself defines the term &quot;wages&quot; as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  &quot;Wages&quot; means all amounts at which labor\r\n    rendered is recompensed, whether the amount is fixed or ascertained on a\r\n    time, task, piece, or commission basis, or other method of calculating the\r\n    amount and includes vacation, holiday, and sick leave payments which are due to an employee under any employer policy or employment contract.Â  Funds placed\r\n    in pension plans or profit sharing plans are not wages subject to this chapter.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10(2)\r\n  (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).Â  The past tense of the word &quot;rendered&quot;\r\n  suggests services provided in the past.Â  The word &quot;recompensed&quot; too\r\n  suggests that payment is for labor already completed.Â  See Webster's\r\n  Third New Int'l Dictionary 1897 (2002) (defining &quot;recompensed&quot; in\r\n  part, as &quot;an equivalent or a return for something done, suffered, or\r\n  given&quot;).Â  Other sections of the Payment of Wages Act speak of acts done in\r\n  the past.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-40(D) (&quot;Every\r\n  employer in the State shall pay all wages due at the time and place\r\n  designated . . . .&quot;); 41-10-50 (&quot;When an employer separates an\r\n  employee from the payroll . . . the employer shall pay all wages due . .\r\n  . .&quot;); 41-10-80(C) (&quot;In case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee . . . .&quot;).Â  The word &quot;due&quot; means &quot;owed or\r\n  owing as a debt&quot; and, as wages are defined by the Act as amounts paid for\r\n  labor rendered, no wages can be due for future services.Â  See Webster's\r\n  Third New Int'l Dictionary 699 (2002).Â  Based on the plain language of the\r\n  statutes in the Payment of Wages Act, the Act does not apply to prospective\r\n  wages.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578,\r\n  581 (2000) (&quot;Where the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous and conveys\r\n  a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\n  needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.&quot;).\r\nA majority\r\n  of other jurisdictions addressing this issue have interpreted similar statutes\r\n  as applying only to services rendered in the past.[4]Â \r\n  North Carolina courts have found that future unearned wages are not\r\n  &quot;wages&quot; for purposes of its Wage and Hour Act, which contains a\r\n  definition of &quot;wage&quot; similar to the definition of &quot;wages&quot;\r\n  found in the South Carolina Act.Â  See, e.g., Narron v.\r\n    Hardeeâ€™s Food Sys., 75 N.C. App. 579, 583, 331 S.E.2d 205, 208 (N.C. Ct.\r\n  App. 1985), overruled on other grounds (&quot;the Wage and Hour Act\r\n  requires an employer . . . to pay those wages and benefits due when the\r\n  employee has actually performed the work required to earn them.&quot;).\r\nIn\r\n  support of his argument that the Payment of Wages Act applies to future wages,\r\n  Mathis cites to a case from the Louisiana Court of Appeals, Saacks v. Mohawk\r\n    Carpet Corp., 855 So.2d 359 (La. Ct. App. 2003).Â  In Saacks, the\r\n  Louisiana court found that amounts owed under a fixed-term contract constituted\r\n  &quot;wages&quot; under a Louisiana statutory scheme similar to the Payment of\r\n  Wages Act.Â  We do not find Saacks persuasive as the case contains little\r\n  discussion of the past wages versus future wages issue and espouses a view\r\n  which it appears has not been adopted by any other jurisdiction.Â  We find\r\n  persuasive the argument advanced by the amici, that while\r\n  &quot;prospective&quot; or &quot;post-termination&quot; earnings may be awarded\r\n  as damages for breach of contract, they do not constitute &quot;wages.&quot;\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court erred in finding the Payment of Wages Act applied to\r\n  future wages.Â  Accordingly, the treble damages award should be reduced from\r\n  $127,199.94 to $46,073.25.[5]\r\n\r\nIV. Did the trial court's order\r\ncomply with Rule 52, SCRCP?\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court's order lacks findings of fact and does not address\r\n  Appellant's defenses specifically and is therefore not in compliance with Rule\r\n  52, SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule\r\n  52, SCRCP provides that &quot;[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a\r\n  jury . . . the court shall find facts specially and state separately its\r\n  conclusions of law thereon . . . .&quot;Â  Rule 52, SCRCP.Â  This Court has held\r\n  that this rule &quot;is directorial in nature so 'where a trial court substantially\r\n  complies with Rule 52(a) and adequately states the basis for the result it\r\n  reaches, the appellate court should not vacate the trial court's judgment for\r\n  lack of an explicit or specific factual finding.&quot;Â  In re Treatment and\r\n    Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 131, 568 S.E.2d 338, 342 (2002), citing Noisette\r\n      v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 123 (1991).Â  The requirement\r\n  for appropriately detailed findings &quot;is designed . . . to dispose of the\r\n  issues raised by the pleadings and to allow the appellate courts to perform\r\n  their proper function in the judicial system.&quot;Â  Id. at 132, 568\r\n  S.E.2d at 343, citing Coble v. Coble, 300 N.C. 708, 712, 268 S.E.2d 185,\r\n  189 (N.C. 1980).Â  A lower court is not required to set out findings on all the\r\n  myriad factual questions arising in a particular case, but the findings must be\r\n  sufficient to allow this Court, sitting in its appellate capacity, to ensure\r\n  the law is faithfully executed below.Â  Id.\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court's four-page order complies with Rule 52(a).Â  The order\r\n  expressly addressed the existence of a valid employment contract, the terms of\r\n  the contract, breach of the contract, mitigation, Mathis's damages, and the\r\n  applicability of the Payment of Wages Act.Â  The trial court also specifically\r\n  found no bona fide dispute as to the wages owed and that Mathis did not waive\r\n  his claims.Â  The order is sufficient to allow this Court to perform its role of\r\n  appellate review.\r\nV. Did the trial court err in\r\n  denying the motion to change venue?\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion to change venue from\r\n  Spartanburg to Greenville County.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  motion to change venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge\r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion.Â  See McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 335, 479 S.E.2d 67,\r\n  71 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  South Carolina's venue statute provides that &quot;[a]\r\n  civil action tried pursuant to this section against a domestic corporation . .\r\n  . must be brought and tried in the county in which the: (1) corporation . . .\r\n  has its principal place of business at the time the cause of action arose; or\r\n  (2) most substantial part of the alleged act or omission giving rise to the\r\n  cause of action occurred.&quot;Â  Appellant is a domestic corporation with\r\n  offices in Charleston, Greenville, and Spartanburg counties.Â  Appellant does\r\n  not have a principal place of business in South Carolina[6],\r\n  but its largest office is in Greenville.\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that the most substantial part of the alleged act or omission giving\r\n  rise to the cause of action occurred in Greenville County, where Mathis\r\n  maintained his office, and therefore Greenville is the appropriate venue.Â  Mathis\r\n  counters that venue in Spartanburg is appropriate because Appellant maintains\r\n  an office in Spartanburg and actively recruited Mathis, a Spartanburg resident,\r\n  for employment.\r\nIn\r\n  denying Appellant's motion to transfer venue, the trial court noted that\r\n  &quot;the central issue to the case is going to be the contract or the\r\n  existence of the contract. . . . Furthermore, from the attachments to the\r\n  Complaint, it appears that Spartanburg is the primary county for purposes of\r\n  the contract and, thus, venue can be considered proper . . . .&quot;Â  We do not\r\n  believe Appellant has shown the trial judge committed a manifest abuse of\r\n  discretion in denying its motion to transfer venue.[7]\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, we affirm that portion of the trial court's order\r\n  finding that Appellant breached its contract with Mathis but reverse that\r\n  portion awarding damages for prospective wages under the Payment of Wages Act.Â \r\n  We therefore remand the matter to the circuit court for calculation of damages\r\n  consistent with this opinion, which should not include damages for prospective\r\n  wages under the Payment of Wages Act.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Though Appellant uses the term &quot;waiver,&quot; Appellant actually argued to\r\n  the trial court and argues in its brief to this Court that Mathis is barred\r\n  from recovering for the compensation change under the doctrine of estoppel.Â \r\n  Case law cited by Appellant at the trial court and on appeal holds that an\r\n  employee may be barred recovery for a reduction in salary based on estoppel.\r\n[2] These points could be relevant to show that a bona fide dispute existed\r\n  regarding Appellant's failure to pay Mathis's future wages, but we need not\r\n  address this contention as we find below that the Payment of Wages Act does not\r\n  apply to future wages.\r\n[3] The South Carolina Hospital Association and the South Carolina Chamber of\r\n  Commerce submitted amicus briefs on this issue.\r\n[4] See, e.g., Martin v. Pomeroy Computer Res., Inc., 87\r\n  F.Supp.2d 496 (W.D.N.C. 1999); Lee v. Great Empire Broad, Inc., 794 P.2d\r\n  1032 (Colo. Ct. App. 1989); City of Clinton v. Goldner, 885 N.E.2d 67\r\n  (In. Ct. App. 2008); Battaglia v. Clinical Perfusionists, Inc., 658 A.2d\r\n  680 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1995).\r\n[5] Mathis agreed that the difference between what he was paid by Appellant and\r\n  what he should have been paid under his guaranteed salary is $15,357.75.Â  This\r\n  amount trebled is $46,073.25.Â  Mathis is also entitled to receive an additional\r\n  $27,042.23 as post-termination breach of contract wages.\r\n[6] Appellant argues in its Reply Brief that its principal place of business is in\r\n  Greenville County.Â  Appellant did not make this argument in its Motion to Change\r\n  Venue and Clay Collins's affidavit, which it submitted to the trial court,\r\n  provides that Appellant does not have a principal place of business in the\r\n  State.Â  Consequently, Appellant may not argue that its principal place of\r\n  business is in Greenville.Â  See I'On, L.L.C., 338 S.C. at 422,\r\n  526 S.E.2d at 724.Â  \r\n[7] Additionally, we note Appellant does not allege that it was harmed by the trial\r\n  court's refusal to change venue, especially given the fact that the case was\r\n  tried without a jury, at its specific insistence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26852","title":"Vasquez v.

Â Petitioner locked the two in the freezer. Â After about\r\n  five minutes, Atkins and Robertson forced their way out of the freezer and fled\r\n  through the back door.\r\nConcerned about\r\n  Williams and Walker, Atkins returned to the Burger King and discovered that they\r\n  had been shot and killed. Â When investigating the scene, the police discovered\r\n  that $737 had been stolen from the restaurant. Â The police also found\r\n  nine-millimeter shell casings and live nine-millimeter ammunition. Â Ballistic\r\n  analysis revealed that the bullets that killed Williams and Walker were fired\r\n  from a nine-millimeter pistol that was linked to Petitioner.\r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury convicted Petitioner of\r\n  two counts of murder, four counts of kidnapping, one count of armed robbery,\r\n  and one count of criminal conspiracy.\r\nB.\r\nIn the penalty phase, the State sought to establish the following\r\n  statutory aggravating factors before the jury:Â  (1) the murder was committed\r\n  while in the commission of a kidnapping; (2) the murder was committed while in\r\n  the commission of a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon; and (3) two or\r\n  more persons were murdered by the Petitioner by one act or pursuant to one\r\n  scheme or course of conduct.[1]Â  \r\nAfter outlining Petitioner's prior record, the State presented the\r\n  testimony of SLED Agent Stephen Derrick, an expert witness who reviewed the\r\n  crime scene reconstruction material, crime scene photographs, and autopsy\r\n  photographs.Â  Based on this information, Agent Derrick opined that Kuma Walker\r\n  was shot first and then Joey Williams.Â  He further testified that the shots\r\n  were not random given both victims were shot in the head.Â  \r\nIn response, Petitioner's trial counsel offered evidence as to the\r\n  following mitigating circumstances:Â  (1) Petitioner had no significant history\r\n  of prior criminal convictions involving the use of violence against another\r\n  person; and (2) Petitioner was an accomplice in the murder committed by another\r\n  person and his participation was relatively minor.[2]Â  \r\nIn addition to presenting evidence of Petitioner's background,\r\n  trial counsel called Rasheed Kaleem Solom Mohammed to provide testimony\r\n  regarding Petitioner's Muslim faith.Â  Rasheed, an imam[3] for all Muslims incarcerated in South\r\n  Carolina, testified he met Petitioner, a Sunni Muslim, and ultimately\r\n  &quot;appointed him as imam&quot; at the J. Reuben Long Correctional Facility\r\n  where he teaches other Muslim inmates.Â  In discussing his and Petitioner's\r\n  faith, Rasheed stated, &quot;Ever since September the 11th we as Muslims have\r\n  had it very, very, extremely hard.&quot;Â  \r\nDuring their closing arguments, the solicitor and trial counsel\r\n  elaborated on this witness's testimony.Â  The solicitor, who characterized\r\n  Petitioner as a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; during his opening guilt phase\r\n  statements, drew a correlation between the events of September 11th and those\r\n  for which Petitioner was charged.Â  In response, trial counsel referenced the solicitor's\r\n  use of the term &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; and attempted to counter the\r\n  implications of this term.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the solicitor's and his trial counsel's closing arguments, Petitioner made a\r\n  statement to the jury in which he reiterated the evidence of his troubled\r\n  background.Â  He then specifically denied his guilt and explained to the jury\r\n  his Muslim faith and attempted to discount the State's references to him as a\r\n  terrorist and events of September 11th.\r\nUltimately, the jury found three aggravating factors and\r\n  recommended the death penalty.Â  The trial judge denied all of Petitioner's\r\n  post-trial motions and ordered that Petitioner be put to death as a result of\r\n  the conviction.Â  Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentences to this\r\n  Court.\r\nThis Court vacated the two life sentences for\r\n  kidnapping with regard to the murder victims, but affirmed Petitioner's\r\n  convictions and remaining sentences. Â State v. Vazquez, 364 S.C. 293, 613\r\n  S.E.2d 359 (2005), abrogated in part by State\r\n    v. Evans, 371 S.C. 27, 637 S.E.2d\r\n  313&nbsp;(2006) (recognizing error preservation requirements after State v.\r\n    Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) for challenging mitigation jury\r\n  charges during a capital sentencing proceeding).Â  \r\nC.\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Petitioner filed a PCR application in which he raised thirty-six allegations of\r\n  counsel's ineffectiveness. Â In an amended application, Petitioner's PCR counsel\r\n  requested Petitioner be granted a new sentencing hearing on the grounds trial\r\n  counsel was ineffective in two respects:Â  (1) failing to object to the\r\n  solicitor's improper &quot;Golden Rule&quot; argument wherein he appealed to\r\n  the jury's bias by asking them to imagine themselves in the place of the\r\n  victims; and (2) failing to object when the solicitor referred to the tragic\r\n  events of September 11th during his closing in the penalty phase at trial,\r\n  implying that Petitioner deserved the death penalty because he was a fanatic\r\n  terrorist and a practicing Muslim who inspired fear across the country. \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, one of Petitioner's trial attorneys admitted he should have\r\n  objected to the solicitor's &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; comment during his\r\n  opening statement of the guilt phase.Â  He believed his failure to object was\r\n  &quot;double prejudice&quot; because Petitioner's September trial occurred\r\n  during the second anniversary of September 11th and Petitioner was a Muslim.Â  He\r\n  further explained, &quot;[A]t [this] time . . . the whole country was sort of\r\n  upset with Muslims;&quot; &quot;they didn't have good Muslims and bad\r\n  Muslims,&quot; most people thought &quot;all Muslims were bad&quot; based on\r\n  the events of September 11th.Â  He testified the jurors knew Petitioner was a\r\n  Muslim because he wore a traditional Muslim prayer cap throughout the trial.Â  Although\r\n  he could not definitively testify that the solicitor's comments affected the\r\n  jurors, he felt &quot;the atmosphere at the time was charged with . . . Muslim\r\n  hatred.&quot;\r\nPetitioner's\r\n  other trial attorney conceded that he should have objected to the solicitor's\r\n  reference to the events of September 11th during closing argument in the\r\n  sentencing phase.Â  He believed in retrospect that the argument could be\r\n  perceived as inappropriate given the solicitor initially called Petitioner a\r\n  &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; and the jury clearly knew Petitioner was a\r\n  Muslim based on his attire and his choice of mitigation witnesses.\r\nPCR\r\n  counsel also called Dr. Nick DePhillips, an expert in clinical and\r\n  neuropsychology, who testified regarding his research on psychological issues after\r\n  September 11th.Â  According to Dr. DePhillips, a study revealed that when the\r\n  term &quot;terrorist&quot; is used in a conversation about Muslims, the people\r\n  interviewed &quot;have more negative views of Muslims.&quot;Â  Dr. DePhillips\r\n  opined the solicitor's use of the word &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; would\r\n  have inferred to the jury that &quot;this is a person who . . . had a plan to .\r\n  . . hurt society in the same way as the people who . . . planned and took out\r\n  the 9/11 attacks.&quot;Â  He believed that once the solicitor used the term\r\n  &quot;terrorist,&quot; the negative connotations associated with that term\r\n  could not be removed.Â Â  \r\nTo\r\n  explain the comments in the context of the trial, PCR counsel called the\r\n  solicitor who prosecuted Petitioner.Â  He testified he intentionally used the\r\n  term &quot;domestic terrorist,&quot; referenced the events of September 11th,\r\n  and asked the jury to imagine the final moments of Williams' life.Â  In terms of\r\n  the &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; comment and the September 11th reference, he\r\n  admitted that he knew Petitioner was Muslim, but nevertheless, believed these\r\n  comments were a &quot;fair characterization&quot; of Petitioner's actions\r\n  during the crimes.Â  He believed the jury could have interpreted the term\r\n  &quot;terrorist&quot; in the general sense that Petitioner &quot;struck fear in\r\n  the hearts of innocent people.&quot;Â  He further explained that the September\r\n  11th reference &quot;made a very valid point&quot; and was &quot;sort of the\r\n  introductory story for the victim impact testimony.&quot;Â  He acknowledged that\r\n  his request for the jury to imagine the final moments of Williams' life could\r\n  be construed as &quot;objectionable.&quot;Â  He, however, testified his purpose\r\n  in making this argument was to give the jury &quot;some sense of the fear and\r\n  the terror that . . . Joey Williams inevitably experienced.&quot;Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the hearing, the PCR judge issued an order in which he dismissed Petitioner's\r\n  application in its entirety. Â Although the PCR judge rejected each of Petitioner's\r\n  allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, he specifically found trial\r\n  counsel was deficient in failing to object to: Â (1) the solicitor's improper &quot;Golden\r\n  Rule&quot; argument where he appealed to the jury's bias by asking them to\r\n  imagine themselves in the place of the victim; and (2) the solicitor's closing\r\n  argument reference to the events of September 11th. Â However, the judge\r\n  concluded Petitioner was not prejudiced by his counsel's deficient\r\n  performance.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of trial counsel's failure to object to the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;\r\n  argument, the PCR judge concluded that &quot;the brief reference to 'imagine\r\n  the terror' and horror in the prosecution['s] closing statement did not\r\n  undermine the confidence in the outcome&quot; of the trial.Â  Essentially\r\n  applying a harmless error analysis, the judge reasoned that Petitioner had\r\n  killed two known friends and co-workers &quot;in execution style.&quot;Â  The\r\n  judge also stated that Petitioner had a history of refusing to obey correctional\r\n  officers and a history of criminal domestic violence.Â  \r\nWith\r\n  respect to trial counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's use of the term\r\n  &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; and reference to the events of September 11th,\r\n  the judge determined that the deficient performance was not prejudicial given\r\n  it &quot;did not undermine confidence in the outcome&quot; of the penalty\r\n  phase.Â  The judge reasoned that &quot;the comments were not a call to arouse\r\n  the passion and prejudice of the jury nor equate [Petitioner] as a member of\r\n  the 9-11 terrorist[s].&quot;Â  The judge further found the solicitor's comments\r\n  were not &quot;anti-Muslim.&quot;Â  Instead, he concluded the comments were an\r\n  &quot;acceptable argument&quot; which was &quot;figurative speech concerning\r\n  victim impact evidence generally.&quot;Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the PCR judge.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; DISCUSSION\r\nA.\r\nThe\r\n  Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the\r\n  right to effective assistance of counsel.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI; Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Lomax v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 665\r\n  S.E.2d 164 (2008).Â  \r\nThe United States\r\n  Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test to establish ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel by which a PCR applicant must show (1) counsel's\r\n  performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\n  defendant.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Cherry v. State, 300\r\n  S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  Under the second prong, the PCR applicant &quot;must\r\n  show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\n  unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.&quot;Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.Â  &quot;A reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.&quot;Â  Simmons v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998).\r\nThis Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge\r\n  when there is any evidence of probative value to support them, and will reverse\r\n  the decision of the PCR judge when it is controlled by an error&nbsp;of\r\n  law.&nbsp; Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886\r\n  (2007).Â Â  \r\nB.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends trial counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's opening statement\r\n  during the guilt phase, in which he described Petitioner as a &quot;domestic\r\n  terrorist,&quot; and his closing argument at sentencing, in which he drew a\r\n  correlation between the events of September 11, 2001, and the acts for which\r\n  Petitioner was standing trial constituted deficient performance.Â  Given the\r\n  solicitor's &quot;egregiously prejudicial&quot; comments during the capital\r\n  trial, Petitioner asserts the PCR judge erred in not finding Petitioner was\r\n  denied effective assistance of counsel.Â  Based on this assertion, Petitioner\r\n  requests this Court reverse his convictions and sentence of death.\r\nIn\r\n  the first sentence of his opening statement to the jury during the guilt phase\r\n  of the trial, the solicitor stated, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is a case\r\n  about a domestic terrorist.&quot;Â  Prior to informing the jury about\r\n  Petitioner's charges, the solicitor again stated, &quot;This case is about a\r\n  domestic terrorist.&quot; Â \r\nIn\r\n  his closing argument to the jury during the penalty phase, the solicitor made\r\n  the following reference to the events of September 11th:\r\n\r\n\tI was - - I guess this was several weeks ago . . . .Â \r\n  It was in September.Â  It was right before the 11th.Â  I was watching a news show\r\n  and former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani, was being interviewed and they were\r\n  talking to him about - - 9/11 was coming up, the second anniversary of 9/11 was\r\n  coming up - - and they're talking to him about his experiences and . . . he was\r\n  talking to this reporter about the things that happened that day and that he\r\n  was actually very close to ground zero after the first plane hit and then he\r\n  got out of there. . . . [H]e talked about so many of his friends, personal\r\n  friends and acquaintances and co-workers with the City of New York that were\r\n  killed in the attack, and he talked about his secretary who was - - had been\r\n  with him for 20 years. . . . [T]hey were, you know, very, very, very close friends,\r\n  and he talked about on 9/11 how his secretary came in and he had to tell her\r\n  that her husband had been killed in one of the towers, and during and just\r\n  hours after the attack, and he concluded his discussion and his interview about\r\n  this, he said, you know, &quot;Now I have - - before 9/11 I had one life, but\r\n  now I have two lives,&quot; . . . &quot;I have my life before September 11th of\r\n  2001, and I have my life after September 11th, 2001.Â  Â \r\n\tIn this case, folks, the friends and family of Joey\r\n  Williams and Kuma Walker have two lives.Â  They have their life before March 26th,\r\n  2002.Â  They have their life after March 26th, 2002.Â  It's appropriate, it's\r\n  proper for you to consider the impact of this crime on the family and friends\r\n  of Kuma Walker and Joey Williams.Â  \r\n\r\nA solicitor's closing argument must be carefully tailored so\r\n  as not to appeal to the personal biases of the jury.Â  State v. Copeland,\r\n  321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996).Â  The State's closing arguments\r\n  must be confined to evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences that\r\n  may be drawn from the evidence.Â  Id.Â  &quot;A solicitor has a right to\r\n  state his version of the testimony and to comment on the weight to be given\r\n  such testimony.&quot;Â  Randall v. State, 356 S.C. 639, 642, 591 S.E.2d\r\n  608, 610 (2004).Â  However, &quot;[s]olicitors are bound to rules of fairness in\r\n  their closing arguments,&quot; as we have explained:\r\n\r\n\tWhile\r\n  the solicitor should prosecute vigorously, his duty is not to convict a defendant\r\n  but to see justice done.Â  The solicitor's closing argument must, of course, be\r\n  based on this principle.Â  The argument therefore must be carefully tailored so\r\n  as not to appeal to the personal bias of the juror nor be calculated to arouse\r\n  his passion or prejudice.\r\n\r\nState v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 222, 641 S.E.2d 873, 881 (2007) (quoting State\r\n  v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 312, 278 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981)).\r\n&quot;On\r\n  appeal, the appellate court will view the alleged impropriety of the solicitor's\r\n  argument in the context of the entire record, including whether the trial judge's\r\n  instructions adequately cured the improper argument and whether there is\r\n  overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.&quot;Â  Simmons, 331 S.C.\r\n  at 338, 503 S.E.2d at 166. &quot;Improper comments do not automatically require\r\n  reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant, and the appellant has\r\n  the burden of proving he did not receive a fair trial because of the alleged\r\n  improper argument.&quot;Â  Humphries v. State, 351 S.C. 362, 373, 570\r\n  S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002).Â  &quot;The relevant question is whether the solicitor's\r\n  comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting\r\n  conviction a denial of due process.&quot; Â Id.; see State v.\r\n    Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 129, 484 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1997)(&quot;A denial of due process occurs when a defendant in a criminal trial is\r\n  denied the fundamental fairness essential to the concept of justice.&quot;).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  we agree with the PCR judge's conclusion that trial counsel was deficient in\r\n  failing to object to the above-referenced comments, we find the PCR judge erred\r\n  in finding Petitioner was not prejudiced by this deficient performance.Â  As\r\n  will be more thoroughly discussed, we hold the solicitor's comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting death\r\n  sentence a denial of due process.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, Petitioner's case was clearly not one that constituted\r\n  &quot;terrorism&quot; by the legal sense of the word.Â  Significantly, our\r\n  General Assembly has promulgated a specific statutory scheme related to\r\n  terrorist acts within this state.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-23-710 to -770 (2003\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  As defined by this Act, Petitioner's indicted conduct did\r\n  not come within the purview of this statute.[4]Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  the solicitor's depiction of Petitioner as a domestic terrorist was without\r\n  legal support, trial counsel was deficient in failing to object on this\r\n  ground.Â  Furthermore, it is indisputable that the term &quot;terrorist,&quot; even\r\n  in the general sense, can only conjure negative connotations.Â  Thus, the\r\n  solicitor's use of the term was clearly improper because there was no\r\n  evidentiary basis to support this characterization.Â  See Thomas M.\r\n  Fleming, Annotation, Negative Characterization or Description of Defendant,\r\n    by Prosecutor During Summation of Criminal Trial, as Ground for Reversal, New\r\n    Trial, or Mistrial -- Modern Cases, 88 A.L.R.4th 8, Â§ 28 (1991 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2009) (discussing differing results of cases where prosecutor characterized the\r\n  defendant in closing argument as a &quot;terror&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot;); cf. Hernandez v. State, 114 S.W.3d 58, 64 (Tex. Ct. App. 2003) (finding\r\n  solicitor's penalty phase argument that equated defendant to a terrorist did\r\n  not violate defendant rights because the term &quot;terrorism&quot; is\r\n  generally defined as &quot;the act of terrorizing; use of force or threats to\r\n  demoralize, intimidate, and subjugate&quot; and the evidence established\r\n  defendant committed the crime to advance in the hierarchy of a gang; therefore,\r\n  the prosecutor's statements were merely a summation of the evidence in the case).\r\nAlthough\r\n  this Court on several occasions has found no reversible error in a solicitor's singular\r\n  inflammatory characterization of a defendant,[5] we find the solicitor's comments in the instant case clearly\r\n  exceeded the bounds this Court has established with respect to this type of\r\n  comment.Â  Here, the inflammatory term characterizing Petitioner, a Sunni\r\n  Muslim, as a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; was intentionally used in\r\n  conjunction with the solicitor's extensive reference to the events of September\r\n  11, 2001.Â  We find the solicitor's statements improperly evoked religious\r\n  prejudice and, thus, served only to inflame the passions and prejudice of the\r\n  jury.Â  Cf. Toyota of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 442\r\n  S.E.2d 611 (1994) (holding &quot;vicious, inflammatory&quot; closing argument\r\n  that evoked racial prejudice was a flagrant case warranting a new trial).\r\nHaving\r\n  determined the solicitor's comments were improper, the question becomes whether\r\n  trial counsel's failure to object to these comments prejudiced Petitioner and,\r\n  in turn, denied him effective assistance of counsel.\r\nAs\r\n  recognized by the PCR judge, this is a novel issue in this state and has only\r\n  been addressed to a limited extent in other jurisdictions.Â  A number of\r\n  appellate decisions, which were cited by the PCR judge, have held references to\r\n  the events of September 11th did not constitute reversible error; however, these\r\n  cases do not establish a definitive rule on this issue.Â  Instead, these\r\n  decisions merely provide guidance given the significant factual distinctions\r\n  from Petitioner's capital case.\r\nUnlike\r\n  Petitioner, none of the defendants in the cited cases was Muslim.Â  Here,\r\n  Petitioner's Muslim faith was a key theme throughout the trial proceedings\r\n  which coincided with the second anniversary of September 11th. Â Â \r\nEven\r\n  before the inception of the trial, the jurors were apprised that Petitioner was\r\n  a Muslim.Â  Apparently concerned with the jurors' perception of Petitioner,\r\n  trial counsel questioned potential jurors during voir dire as to whether\r\n  Petitioner's Muslim faith would affect their decision.Â  At the beginning of the\r\n  penalty phase, counsel explained to the jury about Petitioner's Muslim beliefs\r\n  and the fact that Petitioner wore a &quot;traditional Muslim headdress&quot;\r\n  during the trial. Â During his penalty phase closing argument, trial counsel also\r\n  referenced the solicitor's use of the term &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; and\r\n  attempted to counter the implications of such a term.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  also affirmatively reinforced his Muslim faith to the jury:Â  by wearing a\r\n  traditional Muslim prayer cap during trial; calling his &quot;brother&quot;\r\n  Rasheed as a mitigation witness; and giving a statement to the jury in which he\r\n  explained his Muslim faith and attempted to counter what he perceived to be the\r\n  State's attempt to disparage his Muslim faith.Â  Notably, even one of the\r\n  State's witnesses during the penalty phase made reference to Petitioner as a Muslim.\r\n  Â \r\nThus,\r\n  in the context of the entire record, the solicitor's characterization of\r\n  Petitioner, a Muslim, as a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; and the direct correlation\r\n  between Petitioner's indicted conduct and the events of September 11th can only\r\n  be deemed prejudicial as confirmed by the expert witness called by Petitioner\r\n  during the PCR hearing.Â  Â Â See State v. Millsaps, 610 S.E.2d 437\r\n  (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) (holding defendant was entitled to a new trial where the\r\n  prosecutor in closing compared defendant's acts to those of the September 11th\r\n  terrorists); cf. United States v. Hakim, 344 F.3d 324, 333 (3rd\r\n  Cir. 2003) (finding government's mention of defendant's Muslim religion\r\n  &quot;disturbing,&quot; but concluding no plain error given government offered\r\n  a permissible explanation for why it made these references to defendant's faith\r\n  and &quot;never directly drew the link between [defendant's] faith and the\r\n  events of 9/11&quot;).\r\nAdditional\r\n  support for this conclusion may be found in the analogous case of State v.\r\n    Jones, 558 S.E.2d 97 (N.C. 2002).Â  In Jones, the defendant was\r\n  convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Â On direct appeal, the\r\n  North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the defendant's conviction, but reversed\r\n  his sentence of death and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding based on the\r\n  prosecutor's improper closing argument.Â  Over the defendant's objection, the\r\n  prosecutor referenced the Columbine school shootings and the bombing of the\r\n  Oklahoma City federal building.Â  Specifically, he stated:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  United States of America, a great country, indeed [known] around the world for\r\n  its freedoms:Â  freedom of speech, freedom of privacy in your own home.Â  But\r\n  with those freedoms comes individual responsibility that every citizen of this\r\n  country must realize; that to have these freedoms, one is responsible for their\r\n  [sic] own conduct; one is responsible for their [sic] own behavior.\r\n\tA\r\n  year ago the Columbine shootings; five years ago Oklahoma City bombings.Â  When\r\n  this nation faces such tragedy - [the defendant's objection overruled] - the\r\n  laws of this country come in to bring order to that tragedy, to speak to that\r\n  tragedy.Â  Here we are addressing a tragedy of a man's life.Â  The tragedy not of\r\n  this defendant, the tragedy of the [the victim] . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 107.Â  In interpreting these remarks, the North\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court stated that such remarks could not be &quot;construed as\r\n  anything but a thinly veiled attempt to appeal to the jury's emotions by\r\n  comparing defendant's crime with two of the most heinous violent criminal acts\r\n  of the recent past.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court found the argument was\r\n  improper for at least three reasons:Â  &quot;(1) it referred to events and\r\n  circumstances outside the record; (2) by implication, it urged jurors to\r\n  compare defendant's acts with the infamous acts of others; and (3) it attempted\r\n  to lead jurors away from the evidence by appealing instead to their sense of passion\r\n  and prejudice.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Finally, the court determined that the defendant\r\n  was prejudiced by these remarks given &quot;[t]he impact of the statements in\r\n  question, which conjure up images of disaster and tragedy of epic proportion,\r\n  is too grave to be easily removed from the jury's consciousness, even if the\r\n  trial court had attempted to do so with instructions.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nSimilar to\r\n  the comments in Jones, the solicitor's remarks in the instant case were\r\n  clearly improper and indisputably prejudicial to Petitioner's case.Â  Because\r\n  there was no legal or evidentiary support for the solicitor's use of the term\r\n  &quot;domestic terrorist,&quot; the comments invoked circumstances outside of\r\n  the record.Â  Furthermore, by verbally drawing a direct correlation between\r\n  Petitioner's acts and the events of September 11th, the solicitor appealed to\r\n  the jurors' sense of passion and prejudice involving anti-Muslim sentiment.Â  Additionally,\r\n  given that trial counsel did not object, there was no opportunity for the trial\r\n  judge to even attempt to cure the error.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find there is a reasonable probability that trial\r\n  counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's comments affected the jury's\r\n  deliberation of Petitioner's sentence of death.Â  See Von Dohlen v.\r\n    State, 360 S.C. 598, 613, 602 S.E.2d 738, 746 (2004) (&quot;It is difficult\r\n  to determine the precise impact of the solicitor's argument on the jury's\r\n  deliberation of the sentence, but the potential impact must be carefully and\r\n  thoroughly evaluated in a capital case.&quot;); State v. McClure, 342\r\n  S.C. 403, 409, 537 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2000) (&quot;We note the evaluation of the\r\n  consequences of an error in the sentencing phase of a capital case [is] more\r\n  difficult because of the discretion that is given to the sentencing jury.Â  A\r\n  capital jury can recommend a life sentence for any reason or no reason at\r\n  all.&quot;); State v. White, 246 S.C. 502, 507, 144 S.E.2d 481, 483\r\n  (1965) (noting that &quot;[i]n view of the absolute discretion of the jury with\r\n  regard to the issue of mercy, it is impossible to determine whether the\r\n  argument actually had a prejudicial effect upon the verdict&quot;).\r\nBecause\r\n  the solicitor's comments were primarily confined to the penalty phase and not\r\n  the guilt phase of Petitioner's trial, we hold they do not warrant a reversal\r\n  of his convictions.Â  Instead, a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n  only entitles Petitioner to a new sentencing hearing.\r\nAdmittedly,\r\n  the facts of this case are horrific and there is overwhelming evidence of\r\n  Petitioner's guilt. Â Moreover, we are cognizant of this Court's decisions\r\n  finding that counsel's deficient performance in a death penalty case did not\r\n  warrant reversal where the error did not contribute to the verdict.[6]Â \r\n  However, the sheer weight of the evidence in the instant case does not negate\r\n  the prejudicial impact of the solicitor's improper comments. Â \r\nAs\r\n  previously described, the solicitor intentionally and unnecessarily injected religious\r\n  prejudice into Petitioner's trial.Â  Because we are bound to uphold the\r\n  integrity of this state's court proceedings, we cannot condone the deliberate\r\n  use of religious prejudice during a trial.Â  Accordingly, we must necessarily\r\n  conclude that trial counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's remarks was\r\n  prejudicial to Petitioner.Â  See Simmons, 331 S.C. at 340, 503\r\n  S.E.2d at 167 (stating that &quot;because the issue is whether the solicitor's\r\n  improper argument prevented the jury from fairly considering the guilty with a\r\n  recommendation of mercy verdict, the overwhelming evidence of petitioner's\r\n  guilt does not eliminate the reasonable probability that the result of the\r\n  trial would have been different had trial counsel objected to portions of the\r\n  solicitor's closing argument&quot;).[7]Â  \r\nIII.\r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, we hold Petitioner's trial counsel was deficient in failing to\r\n  object to the solicitor's challenged remarks.Â  Because the solicitor's\r\n  characterization of Petitioner, a Muslim, as a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot;\r\n  and correlation between Petitioner's acts and the events of September 11th was\r\n  so egregious, Petitioner has proven he was prejudiced by counsel's deficient\r\n  performance.Â  Thus, the PCR judge erred in failing to find Petitioner was\r\n  denied effective assistance of counsel.Â  Given the solicitor's improper remarks\r\n  occurred primarily during the penalty phase of Petitioner's trial, we find Petitioner\r\n  is only entitled to a new sentencing hearing and not a reversal of his\r\n  convictions. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only. TOAL, C.J., dissenting\r\n  in a separate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my view, the PCR judge properly concluded Petitioner was not\r\n  denied effective assistance of counsel, and I would affirm the PCR judge's\r\n  denial of relief.\r\n&nbsp;I.&nbsp; Guilt Phase\r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  majority arrived at the correct result regarding the guilt phase of the trial.Â \r\n  While I agree Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial, I do not agree with\r\n  the majority that trial counsel was deficient or Petitioner was prejudiced by\r\n  trial counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's &quot;domestic\r\n  terrorist&quot; comment.Â  However, even assuming those prongs are satisfied, I\r\n  would find the overwhelming evidence of guilt established at trial precludes\r\n  relief.Â  See Rosemond v. Catoe, 383 S.C. 320, 325, 680 S.E.2d 5, 8\r\n  (2009) (holding PCR applicant not prejudiced by trial counsel's performance\r\n  because evidence of guilt was overwhelming).Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Sentencing Phase\r\nAs to the\r\n  sentencing phase, I disagree with the majority that trial counsel was deficient\r\n  or Petitioner was prejudiced by the solicitor's comments regarding September\r\n  11, 2001.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  my view, the solicitor's statement regarding September 11, 2001 simply was\r\n  reference to an historical event, not an attempt to inflame the passions and\r\n  prejudices of the jury.Â  The PCR judge found the statement an acceptable\r\n  introduction to the victim impact evidence.Â  I agree with the PCR judge.Â \r\n  During his speech, the solicitor mentioned September 11, 2001 as a tragic,\r\n  life-changing historical event.Â  The solicitor's remark, despite the majority's\r\n  characterization, was not religious in nature or directed at Petitioner's\r\n  Muslim faith.[8]Â \r\n  He did not call attention to any racial or religious aspect of that event, and\r\n  he did not liken Petitioner to the attackers.Â  The solicitor focused on the\r\n  before-and-after effects on an individual who suffers a sudden, tragic loss of\r\n  a loved one.Â  Therefore, in my opinion, the solicitor's comments were not\r\n  improper, and I would hold counsel was not deficient for failing to object.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  assuming trial counsel were deficient for failing to object to the solicitor's\r\n  closing argument, I do not believe the solicitor's comments so infected the\r\n  proceedings with unfairness that Petitioner was denied due process.Â  A\r\n  solicitor's statements must be viewed in the context of the entire record. Â State\r\n    v. Smith, 375 S.C. 507, 523, 654 S.E.2d 523, 532 (2007).Â  Appellant has the\r\n  burden of proving he did not receive a fair trial because of the alleged\r\n  inappropriate comments.Â  State v. Simmons, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  164, 166 (1998).Â  The relevant question is whether those comments so infected\r\n  the proceedings with unfairness so as to make the result a denial of due\r\n  process.Â  Id.Â  Improper comments do not require reversal if they are not\r\n  prejudicial.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority first finds that counsel was deficient, and then discusses the\r\n  egregiousness of the solicitor's comments.Â  From there, the majority presumes\r\n  prejudice from the comments regarding September 11, 2001, stating they are\r\n  &quot;so egregious&quot; there is no possibility they did not affect the jury's\r\n  sentence of death.[9]Â \r\n  This approach creates a per se rule of prejudice and ignores the\r\n  well-established analytical framework for PCR cases.Â  Our PCR jurisprudence is\r\n  clear that the PCR applicant must prove the allegations in his petition.Â  Butler\r\n    v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985). Â To\r\n  establish prejudice, Petitioner must show a reasonable probability the result\r\n  of the proceeding would have been different but for trial counsel's\r\n  deficiency.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117-18, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625\r\n  (1989).Â  Therefore, to demonstrate prejudice in this case, Petitioner must\r\n  prove a reasonable probability exists that a jury would not have sentenced him\r\n  to death if trial counsel had objected to the solicitor's comments.Â  In my\r\n  view, Petitioner has not met his burden of proving prejudice.Â  \r\nIn Arnold\r\n  v. State/Plath v. State, 309 S.C 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992), a combined\r\n  death penalty PCR appeal, this Court said that to find harmless error, a court\r\n  must find that error &quot;unimportant in relation to everything else the jury\r\n  considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the record.&quot;Â  That\r\n  case concerned a constitutionally improper burden-shifting jury charge.Â  This\r\n  Court evaluated all the evidence and found beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\n  improper jury charge could not have affected the verdict; thus the improper\r\n  charge was harmless error.\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in the instant case, I would find any alleged error is unimportant in relation\r\n  to everything else the jury considered.Â  First, overwhelming evidence of\r\n  Petitioner's guilt was established during the guilt phase of the trial.Â \r\n  Second, three statutory aggravating factors were established during the\r\n  sentencing phase: (1) the murder was committed while in the commission of a\r\n  kidnapping; (2) the murder was committed while in the commission of a robbery\r\n  while armed with a deadly weapon; and (3) two or more persons were murdered by\r\n  Petitioner by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.Â  Third,\r\n  there are no relevant statutory mitigating factors.[10]Â \r\n  Thus, following this Court's earlier decision in Arnold v. State/Plath v.\r\n    State, I would find the weight of evidence against Petitioner and the utter\r\n  lack of mitigating circumstances demonstrate there is no reasonable probability\r\n  the solicitor's comments influenced the jury's sentence of death.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  in my opinion, in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt established at\r\n  trial and the statutory aggravating factors, there is no reasonable probability\r\n  that the jury would not have recommended the death penalty but for the\r\n  solicitor's comments, and I would affirm the PCR judge's denial of relief.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Golden Rule Argument\r\nThe\r\n  majority does not address Petitioner's Golden Rule argument because it reverses\r\n  the PCR court's denial of relief on other grounds.Â  Because I would affirm the\r\n  PCR court on those grounds, I address Petitioner's remaining argument.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the solicitor made an improper Golden Rule argument in his closing of\r\n  the sentencing phase by asking the jurors if they could imagine the terror and\r\n  horror the victims experienced in their final moments of life.Â  I disagree, and\r\n  would find the solicitor's statements were appropriate references to victim\r\n  impact statements.Â  The references did not encourage the jury to depart from\r\n  neutrality and decide the case on personal interest or bias rather than the\r\n  evidence presented.Â  See State v. Reese, 370 S.C. 31, 633 S.E.2d 898\r\n  (2006) (finding improper Golden Rule argument when solicitor asked the jury to\r\n  speak for the victim through its verdict); Von Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C.\r\n  598, 602 S.E.2d 738 (2004) (finding solicitor's comments asking jurors to put\r\n  themselves in victim's shoes was an improper Golden Rule argument).Â \r\n  Furthermore, even if the solicitor did make an improper Golden Rule argument, I\r\n  would find the error harmless in light of the enormity of the evidence against\r\n  Petitioner, the presence of three statutory aggravating factors, and the\r\n  absence of any factors in mitigation.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C.

Arnold v. State/Plath v. State,\r\n  309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992) (finding, in capital case, trial counsel's\r\n  failure to object to unconstitutional malice charge was harmless where, beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt, the error did not contribute to the verdict in light of the\r\n  overwhelming evidence of malice).Â  \r\n[7] Â In view of our holding as to Petitioner's first\r\n  issue, we need not address Petitioner's remaining issue regarding the PCR\r\n  judge's determination that Petitioner was not prejudiced by trial counsel's\r\n  failure to object to the solicitor's &quot;Golden Rule&quot; argument.\r\n[8] The majority indicates the solicitor's comments are\r\n  so egregiously prejudicial because they &quot;intentionally and unnecessarily\r\n  injected religious prejudice into Petitioner's trial.&quot;Â  However, as the\r\n  majority details, Petitioner repeatedly raised the issue of his religious faith\r\n  at various stages of the trial, making his religion a theme throughout the\r\n  trial. The solicitor did not invoke Petitioner's religion at any point during\r\n  either phase of the trial.Â  Thus, in my view, the majority's assertion that the\r\n  solicitor introduced any supposed religious prejudice with his comments is\r\n  unfounded.\r\n[9] The majority appears to find that the solicitor's\r\n  reference to September 11, 2001 is not per se prejudicial by itself, but\r\n  rather the prejudice results when the comments are coupled with the fact\r\n  Petitioner is Muslim.\r\n[10] Petitioner did present evidence of two mitigating\r\n  factors: (1) no significant prior criminal history involving violence; and (2)\r\n  Petitioner was an accomplice whose participation was relatively minor.Â \r\n  However, the facts of the crime do not support these mitigating factors.Â  After\r\n  having been fired for using obscenities at a customer, Petitioner recruited his\r\n  cousin, armed himself, and returned that evening to the restaurant.Â  At\r\n  gun-point, Petitioner kidnapped and imprisoned two employees in the restaurant's\r\n  cooler.Â  Those employees escaped.Â  Petitioner then brought the store manager\r\n  and another employee into the cooler, where he repeatedly shot each victim\r\n  &quot;execution style&quot; in the back of the head.Â  He then left with over\r\n  one thousand dollars from the cash register and went directly to a nearby strip\r\n  club.Â  I would find the sheer cold brutality of this crime outweighs\r\n  Petitioner's lack of prior criminal violence.Â  Further, the second mitigating\r\n  factor simply cannot be proven in light of the guilty verdict.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26853","title":"State v.

Mattison, 380\r\n  S.C. 326, 669 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 2008), affirming Mattison's convictions for\r\n  murder, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK), and possession of a\r\n  weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  In so ruling, the Court of\r\n  Appeals found the trial judge did not err in refusing Mattison's request to\r\n  charge that &quot;prior knowledge of the commission of a crime is insufficient\r\n  to establish guilt&quot; and that &quot;mere association with a person who\r\n  commits a crime is insufficient to establish guilt.&quot;Â  We affirm as\r\n  modified.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nOn\r\n  the morning of August 21, 2003, Jose Garcia was injured in a shooting that left\r\n  his brother, Roberto Garcia, and their cousin, Jorge Lemus-Patricio, dead.Â  In\r\n  its opening statement, the State advanced the theory that Mattison and Britney Ervin\r\n  schemed to lure all three men to a remote location to murder them and steal\r\n  Jose's 1964 black Chevy Impala.[1]Â  \r\nJose,\r\n  the State's primary witness, testified that his cousin Jorge woke him up on the\r\n  morning of August 21, 2003, and told him that someone wanted to buy Jose's\r\n  Chevy Impala. Â Shortly thereafter, a &quot;black skinny man,&quot; whom Jose\r\n  later identified as Ervin, came to his home to discuss the purchase price of\r\n  the car.Â  After this discussion, Ervin left and returned approximately five to\r\n  ten minutes later requesting to test drive the car.Â  Jose and Ervin then left\r\n  the house in the car.Â  As they approached a street corner, Jose saw Mattison\r\n  wave at them, but they did not pick him up. Â Jose and Ervin continued driving\r\n  and then returned to Jose's home at which time Ervin left.Â  Approximately five\r\n  minutes later, Ervin returned to Jose's house and told him that he wanted to\r\n  purchase the car but had to go to his grandfather's house to get the money.\r\nJose\r\n  then drove Ervin to the home of Ervin's grandfather.Â  Roberto and Jorge\r\n  followed in their Honda Passport vehicle in order to bring Jose home after he\r\n  sold the car. Â As Jose and Ervin were driving, they saw Mattison at the same street\r\n  corner as before.Â  This time, they stopped the car and picked up Mattison as a\r\n  passenger.Â  Although Jose could not completely understand their conversation\r\n  due to a language barrier, he testified that Ervin and Mattison talked during\r\n  the ride and appeared to know each other.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  arrival at the destination, Mattison and Ervin exited the car and walked around\r\n  the house.Â  After about ten minutes, Mattison returned to the car and began\r\n  talking with Jose. Â Mattison told Jose that he did not want to go back around\r\n  the house because Ervin's grandfather did not like him. \r\nAfter\r\n  waiting for approximately fifteen minutes, Jose was about to leave, but Ervin\r\n  returned to the front of the house and told Jose that he was getting the money\r\n  from his grandfather.Â  Ervin also said that he needed help with a tire.Â \r\n  Roberto complied with this request and went around the house with Ervin to\r\n  assist him.Â  Jorge exited the Honda Passport and asked Jose what was happening\r\n  when they heard a gunshot. Â Mattison told Jose that Ervin's grandfather\r\n  &quot;was crazy and he was shooting.&quot;\r\nJose,\r\n  Jorge, and Mattison then went around the house where Jose observed Ervin with a\r\n  gun in his hand, coming toward the three men.Â  When Jorge saw Ervin with the\r\n  gun, he tried to run.Â  As Ervin chased Jorge, Mattison told Jose not to worry\r\n  because he also had a gun and that he would help them.Â  Mattison then pulled\r\n  out a handgun, which Jose described as &quot;not like&quot; the one that Ervin\r\n  brandished.Â  Ervin caught Jorge and the four men then continued walking toward\r\n  the back of the house with Jose and Jorge in front followed by Ervin and then\r\n  Mattison.Â Â Â  \r\nAs\r\n  they reached the corner of the house, Jose heard Roberto moaning and then saw\r\n  him face down on the ground.Â  Jose then pled with Mattison and Ervin to just\r\n  take the cars and let him get his brother to a hospital.Â  As Ervin raised the\r\n  gun to shoot Jose, Jorge jumped on top of Ervin and Jose joined in the\r\n  struggle. Â Jose looked up and saw Mattison standing in the same corner as\r\n  before with the gun in his hands. \r\nDuring\r\n  the struggle over the gun with Ervin, the gun fired but did not hit Jose.Â  As\r\n  Ervin was trying to shoot Jose, he told Mattison more than once to shoot Jose.Â \r\n  Jose then heard a gunshot from Mattison's direction, felt his shirt fly up, and\r\n  then turned to see Mattison running away.Â  Jose noticed Jorge &quot;getting\r\n  weaker in fighting&quot; and saw him fall to the ground.Â  Jose eventually\r\n  obtained control of the gun.Â  Ervin then fled the scene.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  Jose went to seek help, he discovered both the Chevy Impala and Honda Passport\r\n  were gone.Â  Ultimately, Jose found a neighbor who called 911 to report the\r\n  incident.Â  \r\nJose\r\n  suffered a bullet graze injury to his shoulder during the struggle.Â  Roberto\r\n  and Jorge were transported to the hospital where both were eventually\r\n  pronounced dead.Â  According to the autopsies, Roberto died from a gunshot wound\r\n  to the abdomen and another to the pelvis.Â  Jorge died from a gunshot wound to\r\n  the head.Â  Ballistic evidence revealed that the two bullets recovered from\r\n  Roberto were fired from the nine millimeter Luger gun that Jose had taken from\r\n  Ervin during the struggle.Â  The bullet recovered from Jorge was a thirty-two\r\n  caliber, fired from a gun that authorities never recovered.Â  \r\nLater\r\n  in the day, Jose gave a statement to investigating officers wherein he\r\n  described his assailants as &quot;the skinny guy and the fat guy.&quot;Â  Â He\r\n  identified Ervin as &quot;the skinny guy&quot; from a photographic lineup after\r\n  Ervin was arrested while driving Jose's Chevy Impala.Â  Jose made an in-court\r\n  identification of Mattison as the other man who rode in the back of his car\r\n  that day and ultimately shot in his direction. \r\nFollowing\r\n  his arrest, Ervin gave two statements to the investigating officers.Â  In his\r\n  first statement, Ervin claimed Mattison asked him to set up &quot;some\r\n  Mexicans&quot; so that Mattison could rob them of their drugs.Â  In describing\r\n  the incident at his grandfather's shop, Ervin claimed that Mattison used a nine\r\n  millimeter gun to shoot &quot;the Mexicans.&quot;\r\nErvin\r\n  asserted he gave a second statement in order to correct his first statement\r\n  &quot;regarding how the shooting went down.&quot;Â  In contrast to his first\r\n  statement, Ervin admitted to shooting one of the victims in the chest and the\r\n  neck.Â  However, he claimed his gun discharged when the other men struggled with\r\n  him over the weapon.Â  Ervin further stated that when his gun discharged,\r\n  Mattison fired his weapon. \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Ervin denied telling the investigating officers much of what was in his\r\n  two prior statements.Â  He also gave a different version of the events in that\r\n  he claimed Mattison brought &quot;some Mexicans&quot; to his home that day to\r\n  see if Ervin wanted to buy a Chevy Impala.Â  Ervin testified that when they\r\n  arrived at his grandfather's property, Mattison shot one of the Mexicans.Â \r\n  After hearing these gunshots, Ervin claimed to have driven away in the Chevy\r\n  Impala.\r\nAlthough\r\n  Mattison did not testify at trial, a statement made by Mattison was read into\r\n  the record.Â  In his statement, Mattison claimed Ervin brought a Mexican to his\r\n  house who tried to buy Mattison's car in exchange for drugs.Â  According to\r\n  Mattison, he rode with Ervin and the Mexican in a black car while a &quot;short\r\n  black guy named Chuck or Bud&quot; followed in a gray car with two other\r\n  Mexicans.Â  Mattison stated that Ervin and the Mexican then exited the car and\r\n  went around the house while the Mexicans from the gray car remained with\r\n  Mattison.Â  Mattison claimed that &quot;Chuck&quot; remained in the gray car.Â \r\n  Mattison then heard a &quot;pop, pop,&quot; and said &quot;let's go,&quot; but\r\n  one of the Mexicans refused because of his brother.Â  They then ran to the back\r\n  of the house.Â  When Mattison heard &quot;pop, pop&quot; again, he took off\r\n  running in the other direction.Â  As he ran up the driveway, Mattison claimed to\r\n  have seen Ervin drive off in the &quot;black car.&quot;\r\nPrior\r\n  to closing arguments, Mattison's counsel submitted eight requests to charge\r\n  involving &quot;mere knowledge,&quot; &quot;mere association,&quot; and\r\n  &quot;mere presence.&quot;Â  In response, the trial judge stated he would cover\r\n  the requests, but &quot;not exactly&quot; as counsel requested.Â  Counsel then\r\n  asked whether the trial judge would instruct the jury that &quot;prior\r\n  knowledge is not sufficient, mere association.&quot;Â  Mattison's counsel took\r\n  exception to the trial judge's refusal to charge this request. \r\n\r\n\tDuring\r\n  his jury instructions, the trial judge charged in part:\r\n\tLadies and Gentlemen, a principal in a crime is one\r\n  who either in person perpetrates the crime or who being present aides and abets\r\n  and assists the commission of that crime.Â  I charge you, Ladies and Gentlemen,\r\n  that mere presence at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to convict.\r\n\tHowever, when one does an act in the presence of or\r\n  with the assistance of another, the act is done by both.Â  Where two or more\r\n  acted with a common design or intent is present at the commission of a crime,\r\n  it does not matter by one who the crime is committed, for all are guilty.\r\n\tIntent, however, Ladies and Gentlemen, is a necessary\r\n  element of the offense.Â  There must have been a common design or attempt to\r\n  commit the crime.Â  The crime must have been committed pursuant to the person\r\n  aiding and abetting by some overt act.Â  Now, presence at the commission of a\r\n  crime means to be sufficiently near so as to be able to aid and abet in its\r\n  commission.\r\n\tStated somewhat differently, Ladies and Gentlemen, is\r\n  several, two or more persons [pursuant] to a common [design] to commit an\r\n  unlawful act, set out together and each takes a part agreed upon or assigned to\r\n  him to commit the act or which to watch at a proper distance at stations to\r\n  prevent an appearance or surprise or to encourage the commission of [an]\r\n  unlawful act or to assist, if necessary, escape of those immediately engaged in\r\n  the commission of the unlawful act, under any or all of these circumstances, if\r\n  the unlawful act is committed, the act is one, the act of one is the act of all\r\n  and all would be guilty.\r\n\tIn other words, if several persons agree or conspire\r\n  to commit a crime, each of those persons are criminally responsible for the\r\n  acts of his confederates of which are done in the presence of the common\r\n  purpose for which they combined.Â  The common purpose may have not included or\r\n  involved killing anyone.\r\n\tBut, if in executing the common design and purpose, a\r\n  common homicide is committed by one of the confederates and you, the jury,\r\n  determine from all the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide was\r\n  a probable and natural consequence of the acts which was done in pursuit to the\r\n  common design, then Ladies and Gentlemen, all who are present either actually\r\n  or constructively and participated in the unlawful common design would be\r\n  guilty. \r\n\r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of the charge, Mattison's counsel took exception to the trial judge not\r\n  charging his requests, &quot;particularly mere association and prior\r\n  knowledge.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Mattison guilty of:Â  (1) the murder of Jorge; (2) possession of a\r\n  weapon during the commission of a violent crime as to Jorge's murder; and (3)\r\n  ABWIK with respect to Jose.[2]Â \r\n  Because the jury was unable to reach a verdict regarding Roberto's murder, the\r\n  trial judge declared a mistrial as to this charge.Â  \r\nMattison appealed\r\n  his convictions to the Court of Appeals based on the trial judge's failure to\r\n  charge the jury that &quot;prior knowledge that a crime is going to be\r\n  committed is not sufficient to convict&quot; and that &quot;mere association\r\n  with a person who commits a crime was insufficient to establish guilt as an\r\n  accomplice or an aider or abetter.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed Mattison's convictions.Â  State v. Mattison,\r\n  380 S.C. 326, 669 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nRelying\r\n  in part on this Court's decision in State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502\r\n  S.E.2d 63 (1998), the court found the trial judge's charge on the whole was\r\n  proper.Â  Id. at 336, 669 S.E.2d at 640.Â  Specifically, the court noted\r\n  the charge to the jury included a &quot;detailed instruction on aiding,\r\n  abetting, and assisting in the commission of a crime through some overt\r\n  act.&quot;Â  Id. at 335, 669 S.E.2d at 640. Â Based on this language, the\r\n  court concluded the charge &quot;clearly indicated that mere presence alone was\r\n  insufficient to sustain a conviction.&quot;Â  Id. at 335-36, 669 S.E.2d\r\n  at 640.Â  Additionally, the court stated:\r\n\r\n\tImplicit\r\n  in the charge given to the jury was that mere knowledge a crime was going to\r\n  occur, or mere association with one who commits a crime is insufficient to\r\n  constitute guilt, but that Mattison must have, while present at the commission\r\n  of the crime, aided, abetted, or assisted in the commission of the crime\r\n  pursuant to a common design or purpose before a conviction could be had.\r\n\r\nId. at 336, 669 S.E.2d at 640.\r\nThis Court granted Mattison's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nMattison\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial judge's refusal to\r\n  instruct the jury that &quot;prior knowledge of the commission of a crime was\r\n  insufficient to establish guilt&quot; and that &quot;mere association with a\r\n  person who commits a crime was insufficient to establish guilt.&quot;Â  Because\r\n  the evidence in this case &quot;made the jury's understanding of those legal\r\n  principles critical,&quot; Mattison claims the judge had &quot;a duty to craft\r\n  his instructions to the facts of the case.&quot;Â  \r\nB.\r\n&quot;In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the\r\n  court's jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at\r\n  trial.&quot;Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;A jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as\r\n  a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.&quot;Â  Id. at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 464; State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523,\r\n  377 S.E.2d 570 (1989) (recognizing that jury instructions must be considered as\r\n  a whole and if as a whole, they are free from error, any isolated portions that\r\n  might be misleading do not constitute reversible error). Â A jury charge that is\r\n  substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  State\r\n    v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996). \r\nThe trial court is required to charge only the current and correct\r\n  law of South Carolina. Â Sheppard v. State,\r\n  357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472 (2004).Â  &quot;The law to be charged\r\n  must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.&quot; Â State v.\r\n    Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  &quot;The substance\r\n  of the law is what must be charged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.&quot;Â  Adkins, 353 S.C. at 318-19, 577 S.E.2d at 464.\r\n&quot;A request to charge a correct statement of the law on an\r\n  issue raised by the indictment and the evidence presented at trial should not\r\n  be refused.&quot;Â  State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 458, 385 S.E.2d 830,\r\n  831 (1989).Â  &quot;However, if the trial judge refuses to give a specific\r\n  charge, there is no error if the charge actually given sufficiently covers the\r\n  substance of the request.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nTo warrant reversal, a trial judge's refusal to give a requested\r\n  jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State\r\n    v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002).Â  &quot;Failure\r\n  to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial error where the\r\n  instructions given afford the proper test for determining the issues.&quot; Â Id. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at 304.Â  An appellate court will not reverse the trial\r\n  judge's decision regarding a jury charge absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144 (2007).\r\n&quot;It\r\n  is well settled that a defendant may be convicted on a theory of accomplice\r\n  liability pursuant to an indictment charging him only with the principal\r\n  offense.&quot;Â  State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 295, 534 S.E.2d 268, 269\r\n  (2000).Â  &quot;Under the 'hand of one is the hand of all' theory, one who joins\r\n  with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for\r\n  everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common\r\n  design and purpose.&quot;Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562\r\n  S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n&quot;Under\r\n  accomplice liability theory, 'a person must personally commit the crime or be\r\n  present at the scene of the crime and intentionally, or through a common\r\n  design, aid, abet, or assist in the commission of that crime through some overt\r\n  act.'&quot;Â  State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 648-49, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101\r\n  (1999) (quoting Austin, 299 S.C. at 459, 385 S.E.2d at 832).Â  \r\n&quot;In\r\n  order to be guilty as an aider or abettor, the participant must be chargeable\r\n  with knowledge of the principal's criminal conduct.&quot;Â  State v. Leonard,\r\n  292 S.C. 133, 137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1987); see Wilson v. Wilson,\r\n  319 S.C. 370, 373, 461 S.E.2d 816, 817 (1995) (&quot;Prior knowledge that a\r\n  crime is going to be committed, without more, is not sufficient to make a\r\n  person guilty of the crime.&quot;).Â  \r\n&quot;Mere\r\n  presence at the scene is not sufficient to establish guilt as an aider or\r\n  abettor.&quot;Â  Leonard, 292 S.C. at 137, 355 S.E.2d at 272; State v.\r\n    Barroso, 328 S.C. 268, 272, 493 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1997) (stating that mere\r\n  association with admitted members of a conspiracy is insufficient to tie other\r\n  persons to the conspiracy).Â  However, &quot;presence at the scene of a crime by\r\n  pre-arrangement to aid, encourage, or abet in the perpetration of the crime\r\n  constitutes guilt as a principle.&quot;Â  State v. Hill, 268 S.C. 390,\r\n  395-96, 234 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1977).\r\n&quot;Any person who is present at a homicide, aiding\r\n  and abetting, is guilty of the homicide as a principal, even though another\r\n  does the killing.&quot;Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 103, 610 S.E.2d\r\n  859, 864 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nC.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note the judge's charge is confusing and at times contradictory with respect\r\n  to the explanation of &quot;mere presence.&quot;Â  However, the charge when read\r\n  as a whole was proper in that it adequately covered the law and was consistent\r\n  with at least two of this Court's decisions.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C.\r\n  50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830\r\n  (1989). \r\nIn Kelsey,\r\n  a case involving the murder of a teenage female by three teenage males, Kelsey\r\n  argued the trial judge erred in failing to give proper conspiracy and mere\r\n  presence instructions.Â  Kelsey further asserted the judge\r\n  improperly failed to instruct the jury that one's mere association with a\r\n  person who commits a crime does not make a defendant an accomplice or a\r\n  co-conspirator to the guilty perpetrator.Â  Kelsey challenged the\r\n  following portion of the trial judge's instruction:\r\n\r\n\tNow of\r\n  course, mere presence at the scene is insufficient to prove someone guilty of a\r\n  crime.Â  The burden is upon the state to prove every element of the crime\r\n  charged.Â  If you find after reviewing all of the evidence that the state has\r\n  proven that the defendant was only present at the scene of the crime and they\r\n  have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt any other participation in the crime,\r\n  then you must find a defendant not guilty.\r\n\tThe law\r\n  says that proof of mere presence at the scene of the crime is not sufficient to\r\n  find someone guilty. Â But, of course the law also says that the hand of one is\r\n  the hand of all.\r\n\tThe law\r\n  says-that if a person-if a crime is committed by two or more persons who are\r\n  acting together in the commission of a crime, then the act of one is the act of\r\n  both.\r\n\r\nKelsey, 331 S.C. at 76-77, 502 S.E.2d at 76.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the charge did not include Kelsey's requested charge of &quot;mere\r\n  association,&quot; this Court found the trial judge's instructions on mere\r\n  presence and accomplice liability were not misleading and were proper as a\r\n  whole.Â  Id. at 77, 502 S.E.2d at 76-77.Â  In support of this finding, we\r\n  noted the charge clearly explained that the State had the burden of proving\r\n  every element of the crime and that mere presence was not enough to sustain a\r\n  conviction.Â  Additionally, we found the trial judge extensively instructed the\r\n  jury on the requisite criminal intent of each of the charged crimes.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  similar to the instruction in Kelsey, the judge specifically instructed\r\n  that &quot;mere presence&quot; was insufficient to sustain a conviction.Â  The\r\n  judge also charged the jury regarding the State's burden of proving each and\r\n  every element of the offenses for which Mattison was indicted.Â  \r\nIn Austin,\r\n  this Court found sufficient a nearly identical &quot;mere presence&quot; charge\r\n  as the one in the instant case.Â  In Austin, the trial judge charged the\r\n  jury in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\t[A]\r\n  principal in a crime is one who either in person perpetrates the crime or who\r\n  being present aids, abeits [sic] and assists in the commission of that crime.Â \r\n  When one does an act in the presence of and with the assistance of another, the\r\n  act is done by both.Â  And where two or more, acting with a common design or a\r\n  common intent, are present at the commission of a crime, it matters not by\r\n  whose immediate agency that crime is committed because all would be guilty.Â \r\n  Intent, however, ladies and gentlemen, is a necessary element, for there must\r\n  have been a common design or intent to commit the crime and the crime must have\r\n  been committed pursuant thereto with the person aiding and abeiting [sic] by\r\n  some overt act. \r\n\r\nAustin, 299 S.C. at 458-59, 385 S.E.2d at 831-32.Â  Given\r\n  &quot;the language of the instruction made it sufficiently clear that to find\r\n  guilt for a crime, a person must personally commit the crime or be present at\r\n  the scene of the crime and intentionally, or through a common design, aid,\r\n  abet, or assist in the commission of that crime through some overt act,&quot; this\r\n  Court found the trial judge did not err by refusing to give Austin's requested\r\n  &quot;mere presence&quot; charge.Â  Id. at 459, 385 S.E.2d at 832.\r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by these decisions, we find the trial judge correctly and\r\n  sufficiently charged the law on &quot;mere presence&quot; and &quot;mere\r\n  association.&quot; Â Furthermore, the judge's instructions regarding &quot;mere\r\n  presence&quot; encompassed Mattison's request to charge &quot;mere\r\n  association.&quot;Â  A review of Mattison's requests to charge reveals that he\r\n  included &quot;mere presence&quot; in the same charge as &quot;mere\r\n  association&quot; and specifically recognized that these principles were\r\n  similar or essentially synonymous.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in\r\n  refusing to charge Mattison's requests with respect to &quot;mere\r\n  presence&quot; and &quot;mere association.&quot;\r\nWe\r\n  are, however, concerned with the trial judge's failure to charge &quot;mere\r\n  knowledge&quot; or &quot;prior knowledge&quot; and the Court of Appeals'\r\n  conclusion that this charge was &quot;implicit&quot; in the judge's\r\n  instruction.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, we believe this case is factually distinguishable from Kelsey and Austin on the ground Mattison submitted this charge and challenged\r\n  its omission on appeal.Â  In contrast, this was not an issue in either Kelsey or Austin.Â  Thus, unlike the Court of Appeals, we find Kelsey is not\r\n  dispositive of Mattison's entire appeal.\r\nIn\r\n  view of this factual distinction, it is necessary to analyze the trial judge's\r\n  refusal to charge Mattison's requested instruction regarding &quot;mere\r\n  knowledge.&quot;\r\nSignificantly,\r\n  the element of &quot;knowledge&quot; is not mentioned in the trial judge's\r\n  instruction even though Mattison's request to charge represented a correct\r\n  statement of the law.Â  See, e.g., State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133,\r\n  137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1987) (analyzing accomplice liability charge as to\r\n  the offense of reckless homicide arising out of an automobile collision and\r\n  recognizing a &quot;charge must clearly explain&quot; that &quot;[i]n order to\r\n  be guilty as an aider or abettor, the participant must be chargeable with\r\n  knowledge of the principal's criminal conduct&quot;); State v. Collins,\r\n  266 S.C. 566, 570-71, 225 S.E.2d 189-92 (1976) (concluding trial judge erred in\r\n  refusing to charge that &quot;[p]rior knowledge that a crime is going to be\r\n  committed, without more, is not sufficient to make a person guilty of that\r\n  crime&quot; given the evidence was susceptible to the inference that &quot;the\r\n  defendant knew the robbery was to take place but did not aid in it&quot;); State\r\n    v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 610 S.E.2d 859 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding &quot;mere\r\n  presence&quot; charge was sufficient where charge included an instruction on\r\n  &quot;mere knowledge&quot; in addition to an explanation of aiding and abetting\r\n  and the requisite intent element); State v. Staten, 364 S.C. 7, 41, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 823, 840 (Ct. App. 2005) (concluding the following charge sufficiently\r\n  covered the law on mere presence and knowledge:Â  &quot;To be liable as an\r\n  accomplice, the defendants must have knowledge of the principal's criminal\r\n  conduct.Â  Now, mere presence at the scene of the crime is not sufficient to\r\n  establish . . . guilt as an accomplice.&quot;), vacated in part by, 374\r\n  S.C. 9, 647 S.E.2d 207 (2007) (vacating Court of Appeals' analysis regarding Crawford\r\n    v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004)). \r\nDespite\r\n  this omission, the Court of Appeals found it to be &quot;implicit&quot; in the\r\n  judge's instruction. Â Although we agree with the Court of Appeals' ultimate\r\n  decision that the trial judge's failure to charge this requested instruction\r\n  was not fatal to the entire charge, we are disturbed by the use of the term\r\n  &quot;implicit.&quot; Â We believe that to require jurors to delve into and\r\n  interpret a judge's &quot;implicit&quot; instruction is contrary to the purpose\r\n  of a trial judge being an instructor of the law.Â  If\r\n  this were the case, the burden would effectively shift from the trial judge, as\r\n  the instructor of the law, to the jury to discover the &quot;hidden&quot;\r\n  meaning in a judge's charge.\r\nInstead,\r\n  we find the trial judge's explicit instruction regarding the necessary element\r\n  of &quot;intent,&quot; sufficiently covered the substance of Mattison's\r\n  &quot;mere knowledge&quot; request and, thus, there was no error. Â This\r\n  principle has been explained as follows:\r\n\r\n\tFor\r\n  a person who has not actually committed the homicidal act to be regarded as a\r\n  participant in a homicide, he or she must have aided, abetted, assisted,\r\n  encouraged, or advised the killing.Â  Also, the courts have required that the\r\n\talleged\r\n    accomplice must have acted with the intention of encouraging and abetting the\r\n    commission of the homicide, or, at least that the commission of the murder\r\n  by the principal must have been a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the\r\n  defendant's actions.\r\n\r\n40 Am. Jur. 2d Homicide Â§ 26 (2010) (emphasis added); see 40 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 30 (2010)\r\n  (&quot;To be guilty as an accomplice to homicide, a defendant must have acted\r\n  with the state of mind required for guilt.&quot;). Â Â \r\nApplying the above-referenced principle, we conclude the judge's\r\n  &quot;intent&quot; instruction in conjunction with his instruction regarding\r\n  each element of the offenses[3] and his instruction that the jury find &quot;beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt that the homicide was the probable and natural consequence\r\n  of the acts which was done in pursuit to the common design&quot; was\r\n  substantially correct and adequately covered the applicable law.\r\nFinally, in view of the jury's verdict, we believe the jurors\r\n  understood this portion of the charge.Â  More specifically, the jury convicted\r\n  Mattison only of Jorge's murder and ABWIK as to Jose.Â  According to Jose's\r\n  testimony, Mattison was present during these crimes and actually aided Ervin\r\n  when he asked for Mattison's assistance.Â  Jose further testified that a shot was\r\n  fired from Mattison's direction during his and Jorge's struggle with Ervin over\r\n  the weapon.Â  \r\nThe jury, however, was unable to reach a verdict as to Roberto's\r\n  murder.Â  According to Jose, Mattison was with him at the time Roberto was shot.Â \r\n  Thus, the jury's decision would appear to discount Mattison's concern that he\r\n  was convicted based on &quot;mere knowledge&quot; or simply &quot;prior\r\n  knowledge.&quot;Â  Instead, the jury arguably applied the judge's instruction\r\n  regarding the requisite &quot;intent&quot; and, as a result, convicted Mattison\r\n  of the applicable charges.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, we find the trial judge's instruction:Â  (1) was confusing and\r\n  contradictory with respect to an explanation of &quot;mere presence;&quot; (2)\r\n  omitted an express instruction regarding &quot;mere association;&quot; and (3)\r\n  omitted an express instruction regarding &quot;mere knowledge.&quot;Â  However,\r\n  when the trial judge's instruction is read as a whole we find it adequately\r\n  covered the law and sufficiently covered the substance of Mattison's requests\r\n  to charge.\r\nWe modify the portion of the Court of Appeals' decision regarding\r\n  the use of the term &quot;implicit.&quot;Â  In view of this modification, our\r\n  decision should dispel any inference that a trial judge's general instruction\r\n  is necessarily sufficient to cover a defendant's specific request to charge a\r\n  correct statement of the law.Â  Rather, we would urge trial judges to carefully\r\n  consider charging a request to charge that is factually accurate and a correct\r\n  statement of the law.Â Â Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and R. Knox McMahon,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  As a result of this incident, a Greenville County\r\n  grand jury indicted Mattison for:Â  (1) ABWIK with respect to Jose Garcia; (2)\r\n  murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime as\r\n  to Jorge Lemus-Patricio; (3) murder and possession of a weapon during the\r\n  commission of a violent crime with regard to Roberto Garcia; and (4) grand\r\n  larceny as to Roberto and Jorge's vehicle.Â  Mattison was charged based on his\r\n  &quot;aiding, abetting, and/or assisting&quot; of Ervin. Â Ervin pleaded guilty\r\n  to the charges prior to Mattison's trial.\r\n[2] Â Before the case was submitted to the jury, the trial\r\n  judge granted Mattison's directed verdict motions as to the charge of\r\n  possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime with respect to\r\n  the murder of Roberto, as well as the charge of grand larceny of the Honda\r\n  Passport.Â  \r\n[3] Â See S.C.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina C. Todd, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia,\r\n  for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tJeffrey Scott Holcombe, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand or a definite\r\n  suspension of no more than two years from the practice of law.Â  We accept the Agreement\r\n  and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for two years.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement,\r\n  are as follows.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter A\r\nRespondent\r\n  was working as a contract attorney with Law Firm A when the firm was hired to\r\n  represent a client who had been injured on a cruise ship.Â  The clientâ€™s injury\r\n  occurred less than a month before she hired the firm and her case was\r\n  respondentâ€™s direct responsibility.Â  Respondent gathered information from the\r\n  client, spoke with the client, and wrote a letter of representation to the\r\n  cruise line.Â  However, respondent performed no other work on the case.Â \r\n  Approximately five months after the representation began and one month after\r\n  his single letter to the cruise line, respondent ended his relationship with\r\n  Law Firm A.Â  Respondent did not notify the client or the cruise line of his\r\n  departure from the firm and did not reach a clear understanding with the firm as\r\n  to whether he or the firm would retain the clientâ€™s case and associated\r\n  responsibilities.Â  After leaving the firm, respondent performed no additional\r\n  work in the matter and the clientâ€™s claim against the cruise line became time\r\n  barred.\r\nMatter B\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented a client in a post-conviction relief matter.Â  The circuit court\r\n  issued a final order in favor of the State; however, respondent failed to\r\n  notify the client of the outcome of the case as well as his right to appeal the\r\n  courtâ€™s decision.Â  Respondent also failed to file a notice of appeal to protect\r\n  the clientâ€™s right to appeal the courtâ€™s decision.Â  Respondent failed to timely\r\n  respond to Disciplinary Counselâ€™s initial inquiry in this matter and did not\r\n  provide a substantive response, despite multiple reminders and requests from\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, until after receiving a Notice of Full Investigation.\r\n\r\nMatter C\r\nRespondent\r\n  worked at Law Firm B from May of 2006 until late February of 2009.Â  When he\r\n  began work at the firm, he was still working on files from his time with Law\r\n  Firm A.Â  Law Firm B was generally aware of these holdover cases and expected to\r\n  be compensated for the time and effort respondent devoted to completing the\r\n  cases.Â  However, respondent failed to diligently work on several of the cases\r\n  and failed to keep some of the clients informed of the status of their\r\n  matters.Â  He also failed to hold separately any unearned fees associated with\r\n  those cases.\r\nIn\r\n  addition to his continued representation of clients associated with Law Firm A,\r\n  respondent also continued his representation of other clients without the\r\n  knowledge or permission of Law Firm B.Â  Respondent did not hold any unearned\r\n  fees or other funds associated with those cases in a trust account, nor did he perform\r\n  a conflicts check with Law Firm B with regard to any of the clients.Â  Finally,\r\n  respondent failed to diligently pursue at least two of the matters and failed\r\n  to communicate adequately with at least one of the clients.\r\nRespondent\r\n  also accepted new clients while working at Law Firm B without the firmâ€™s\r\n  knowledge or permission.Â  As with his other clients who were not clients of Law\r\n  Firm B, respondent failed to maintain a trust account for any unearned fees or\r\n  other funds associated with the clients.Â  Respondent also failed to diligently\r\n  pursue the matters that several of the clients hired him to pursue.\r\nRespondent\r\n  also failed to diligently represent at least two of Law Firm Bâ€™s clients.Â  In\r\n  one matter, respondent represented two clients in a civil lawsuit.Â  During the\r\n  representation, the clients asked respondent to help them incorporate their\r\n  business.Â  Although respondent prepared the articles of organization, he never\r\n  filed the appropriate documents or forwarded the clientsâ€™ checks to the South\r\n  Carolina Secretary of State.Â  In another matter, respondent represented a\r\n  client in a domestic action.Â  He failed to comply or respond to numerous\r\n  requests from the client, failed to comply with the clientâ€™s request for a copy\r\n  of a letter respondent wrote to opposing counsel, failed to file a motion at\r\n  the clientâ€™s request, and failed to keep the client informed of the status of\r\n  settlement negotiations and his efforts on the clientâ€™s behalf.\r\nRespondent\r\n  accepted another client on behalf of Law Firm B on a matter outside of the firmâ€™s\r\n  normal area of practice.Â  Respondent accepted a $1,000 check from the client\r\n  and submitted the funds to the firm for deposit.Â  One month later, respondent\r\n  accepted another $1,000 check from the client.Â  Unlike the first check,\r\n  respondent negotiated the second check and retained the funds for his own\r\n  personal use.Â  The client sought a refund after respondentâ€™s departure from the\r\n  firm.Â  Law Firm B refunded $1,312.60 to the client, representing the unearned\r\n  balance of his initial payment and the full amount of his second payment even\r\n  though the firm never received his second payment.\r\nWhen\r\n  respondentâ€™s employment with Law Firm B ended, he left the files of several\r\n  clients who were not associated with Law Firm B in his office.Â  He did not\r\n  notify his active clients of his whereabouts and other than leaving the files\r\n  in a firm with other attorneys, he took no steps to protect his clientsâ€™\r\n  interests.\r\nThe\r\n  complaint in this matter was filed by a partner of Law Firm B.Â  Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel served respondent with a Supplemental Notice of Full Investigation.Â \r\n  Although respondent appeared and testified during an interview pursuant to Rule\r\n  19(c)(5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and provided limited documentation in response\r\n  to Disciplinary Counselâ€™s subpoena, he never provided a written response to the\r\n  Supplemental Notice.Â  Respondent also failed to provide a written response to\r\n  the Amended Supplemental Notice of Full Investigation that Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  served after the interview. \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client, which requires\r\n  the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary\r\n  for the representation); Rule 1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s\r\n  decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the\r\n  client as to the means by which the objectives are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (a\r\n  lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a\r\n  client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall reasonably consult with the client about the\r\n  means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client\r\n  reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with\r\n  reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent\r\n  reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding\r\n  the representation); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall hold property of clients that is\r\n  in a lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s own property, in a separate account maintained in the state where the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s office is situated, and the property shall be identified as such and appropriately\r\n  safeguarded; complete records of such account funds and other property shall be\r\n  kept by the lawyer; a lawyer shall comply with Rule 417, SCACR; a lawyer shall\r\n  deposit into a client trust account unearned legal fees and expenses that have\r\n  been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or\r\n  expenses incurred); Rule 1.16 (a lawyer may withdraw from representation of a\r\n  client in certain situations, but must take steps to the extent reasonably\r\n  practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice\r\n  to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering\r\n  papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance\r\n  payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 8.1(b) (a\r\n  lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter shall not knowingly fail to\r\n  respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule\r\n  8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation);\r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in\r\n  conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline\r\n  for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of\r\n  this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(6)\r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office\r\n  taken to practice law in this state and contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend\r\n  respondent from the practice of law in this state for two years from the date\r\n  of this opinion.Â  Respondentâ€™s\r\n  reinstatement shall be conditioned upon his compliance with the conditions of\r\n  reinstatement set forth in the Agreement for Discipline by Consent,[1] as well as those set forth in Rule\r\n  33, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In addition, respondent shall,\r\n  within thirty days of the date of this opinion, pay the costs incurred in the\r\n  investigation of this matter by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct.\r\nDEFINITE

Â Although we\r\n  disagree with the court of appeals' rationale, we affirm in result.Â Â  Â Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nMaria\r\n  Raney, a resident of Westwood Apartments in Gaffney, looked out the window of\r\n  her apartment in the early morning hours of April 21, 2003 and noticed an\r\n  individual inside her vehicle. Â She immediately called 911, and was instructed\r\n  by the 911 operator to remain on the line until police arrived.Â  While waiting,\r\n  Raney saw the individual exit her vehicle and enter a nearby Ford Explorer.Â  Minutes\r\n  later, Officers Michael Scruggs and Randy Quinn of the Gaffney Police\r\n  Department arrived on the scene.Â  \r\nScruggs\r\n  and Quinn approached the apartment complex in their patrol car, with the\r\n  headlights and siren turned off.Â  The officers parked their car around the\r\n  corner of the building and then proceeded on foot.Â  Once they rounded the\r\n  corner of the building, they saw an individual standing next to a Ford\r\n  Explorer.Â  As they approached the suspect, he looked up, and Quinn shouted\r\n  &quot;stop, police!&quot;Â  The suspect fled.Â  After chasing him for 300 to 350\r\n  yards, the officers apprehended the suspect and placed him under arrest.Â  The\r\n  suspect was later identified as the respondent, Ricky Brannon.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State charged Brannon with breaking into a motor vehicle and resisting arrest\r\n  under section 16-9-320(A) of the South Carolina Code (2003), which makes it\r\n  &quot;unlawful for a person knowingly and willfully . . . to resist an\r\n    arrest being made . . . .&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  At the\r\n  conclusion of the evidence, Brannon moved for a directed verdict on the charge\r\n  of resisting arrest, arguing the State failed to demonstrate that an arrest was\r\n  being made when he fled from police.Â  The circuit court denied Brannon's\r\n  motion.Â  Subsequently, Brannon was convicted of both charges.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals reversed, finding Brannon\r\n  was not &quot;seized&quot; under the Fourth Amendment, and\r\n  therefore, not under arrest when he ran from police.Â  State v. Brannon, 379 S.C. 487, 508, 666\r\n  S.E.2d 272, 282 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  This Court granted the State's petition for\r\n  writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is\r\n  concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to\r\n  produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. Ladner, 373 S.C. 103,\r\n  120, 644 S.E.2d 684, 693 (2007).Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict,\r\n  this Court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 32, 667\r\n  S.E.2d 728, 733 (2008).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  PROCEDURAL ARGUMENTS\r\nInitially, the State asserts the court of\r\n  appeals violated error preservation rules by using a seizure analysis to\r\n  determine whether an arrest was being made.Â  The State contends this argument\r\n  was not preserved for appellate review because Brannon never used the terms\r\n  &quot;seizure&quot; or &quot;Fourth Amendment&quot; in his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nError preservation rules do not require a party to use the exact\r\n  name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve an issue for appellate review.Â  State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003).Â Â  Instead, a\r\n  litigant is only required to fairly raise the issue to the trial court, thereby\r\n  giving it an opportunity to rule on the issue.Â  Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C.\r\n  12, 19, 5 S.E.2d 187, 189 (1939).Â  In this case, Brannon met this requirement\r\n  by arguing an arrest was not being made when he ran from police.Â  See State\r\n    v. Mitchell, 378 S.C. 305, 662 S.E.2d 493 (Ct. App. 2008), cert.\r\n      dismissed as improvidently granted, Feb. 2010 (finding defense counsel\r\n  preserved his objection under the Confrontation Clause where he objected to the\r\n  introduction of a written statement at trial on the grounds he could not\r\n  cross-examine the statement).Â  Accordingly, we find this issue was properly\r\n  preserved for appellate review.\r\nThe\r\n  State also argues the court of appeals disregarded the law of the case doctrine\r\n  in finding Brannon's flight from police did not constitute resisting arrest.Â  Brannon,\r\n  379 S.C. at 517, 666 S.E.2d at 287.Â  In charging the jury, the circuit court defined\r\n  the term &quot;resist&quot; to include &quot;peaceful nonviolent indirect\r\n  obstruction of an arrest.&quot;Â Â  Brannon failed to object to this charge.Â  As\r\n  a result, the State contends the circuit court's definition of the term\r\n  &quot;resist&quot; is the law of the case, and under that definition, Brannon's\r\n  act of running from police qualifies as resisting arrest under section\r\n  16-9-320(A).Â  See Mickle v. Blackmon,\r\n  255 S.C. 136, 141-42, 177 S.E.2d 548, 549-50 (1970) (stating the failure to\r\n  object to a jury instruction makes the charge the law of the case).Â  We find it\r\n  unnecessary to address this issue.Â Â  Â \r\nThe State has the burden of proof as to all the essential elements\r\n  of the crime.Â  State v. Attardo, 263 S.C. 546, 550, 211 S.E.2d 868, 870 (1975).Â  The\r\n  accused is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present\r\n  evidence on a material element of the offense charged.Â  State v. Brown,\r\n  360 S.C. 581, 586, 602 S.E.2d 392, 395 (2004).Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nThere are multiple\r\n  elements to the crime of resisting arrest as codified in section 16-9-320(A).\r\n  Under section 16-9-320(A), the State must demonstrate that the accused\r\n  knowingly and willfully resisted an arrest being made.Â  As explained below, we\r\n  find the State has failed to put forth any evidence demonstrating that an\r\n  arrest was being made when Brannon fled from police.Â  In light of this finding,\r\n  we need not decide whether Brannon's flight from police amounted to\r\n  resistance.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee Cty. Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C.\r\n  335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating an appellate court need not\r\n  address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive). Â Â \r\nII.Â  SEIZURE ANALYSIS\r\nNext, the State contends the court of appeals erred in using a\r\n  seizure analysis to determine whether an arrest was being made because the\r\n  concepts of arrest and seizure are different.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nAt the outset, we note the concepts of arrest and seizure are\r\n  related in the sense that an arrest represents the highest form of seizure of\r\n  the person under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.Â  California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 n.3, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1551 n.3\r\n  (1991).Â  However, the\r\n  concepts are distinguishable because under Terry v. Ohio and its\r\n  progeny, an individual can be seized under the Fourth Amendment without being\r\n  arrested under state law.Â  392 U.S. 1, 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1877 (1968).Â  As the\r\n  United States Supreme Court stated in Terry, &quot;[i]t is quite plain\r\n  that the Fourth Amendment governs 'seizures' of the person which do not\r\n  eventuate in a trip to the station house and prosecution for crimeâ€”'arrests' in\r\n  traditional terminology.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, the concepts of arrest\r\n  and seizure are also distinguishable because each concept requires a distinct\r\n  analysis.Â  In determining whether an arrest has occurred, the focus is on the\r\n  intent of the police officer and the suspect.Â  State v. Williams, 237 S.C. 252, 257, 116 S.E.2d 858, 860-61 (1960).Â  By contrast an\r\n  individual is seized under the Fourth Amendment when a reasonable person, in\r\n  view of all the circumstances of a particular case, would not believe he was\r\n  free to leave. Â Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 573, 108 S.Ct.\r\n  1975, 1979 (1988).Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the analysis\r\n  employed by the court of appeals constitutes error because the concepts of\r\n  arrest and seizure are unique creatures of criminal law, calling for distinct\r\n  inquiries.Â  Accordingly, we turn our\r\n  attention to the common law of arrest to determine whether an arrest was being\r\n  made at the time of Brannon's flight.Â  Â \r\n\r\nIII.Â  WHETHER AN ARREST WAS BEING MADE\r\nIn Williams,\r\n  this Court set forth specific elements to determine when an arrest has been\r\n  consummated.Â  237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d\r\n  at 860-61.Â  Where the police officer does not manually touch the suspect, an\r\n  arrest requires intent on the part of the officer to arrest the suspect, and\r\n  intent on the part of the suspect to submit to the arrest, under the belief\r\n  that submission was necessary.Â  Id.Â  Although Williams sets forth two\r\n  elements to determine when an arrest has occurred, an arrest, itself, is an\r\n  &quot;ongoing process&quot; in South Carolina.Â  State v. Dowd, 306 S.C. 268, 270, 411 S.E.2d 428, 429\r\n  (1991).Â  In this case, consistent with the plain language of section 16-9-320(A), we must determine whether an arrest was\r\n  being made when Brannon fled from police.Â  See Gay v. Ariail, 381 S.C.\r\n  341, 345, 673 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2009) (stating whether the statute's language is\r\n  plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear, definite meaning, the rules of\r\n  statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose\r\n  another meaning).Â  Thus, our inquiry is directed at determining whether the\r\n  arresting process was underway at the time of Brannon's flight.Â  Because the\r\n  State has failed to put forth any evidence demonstrating that the officers\r\n  either intended to arrest Brannon or that Brannon submitted to the arrest, we\r\n  find an arrest was not being made when Brannon ran from police.Â Â  \r\nInitially, the State urges\r\n  this Court to evaluate the officers' intent based on an objective inquiry of\r\n  whether the officers had probable cause to arrest Brannon at the time of\r\n  flight.Â  Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 153, 125 S.Ct. 588, 593\r\n  (2004).Â  We decline to do so because it is immaterial to our analysis to\r\n  determine if the officers had probable cause to arrest Brannon.Â  Under the\r\n  plain language of section 16-9-320(A), we are only focused on determining\r\n  whether an arrest was being made at the time of Brannon's flight.Â  In Williams,\r\n  this Court noted where the officer does not manually touch the suspect,\r\n  &quot;the intentions of the parties to the transaction are very important . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860.Â  We find the phrase &quot;the\r\n  intentions of the parties to the transaction,&quot; refers to the subjective\r\n  intentions of the law enforcement officer and the suspect.Â  Thus, the intent of\r\n  the officers to arrest Brannon must be evaluated under a subjective standard\r\n  rather than the objective standard governing probable cause.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBoth Officer Scruggs and Officer Quinn testified that\r\n  when they arrived on the scene, they believed Brannon was breaking into automobiles.Â \r\n  However, neither officer testified they intended to arrest him after seeing\r\n  him.Â  In fact, Quinn testified &quot;our intention was to approach the subject\r\n  and find out exactly what he was doing there at the time.&quot;Â  Thus,\r\n  according to Quinn, the police officers intended to question Brannon at the\r\n  time he ran away.Â  In support of its argument that an arrest was being made, the\r\n  State points to the facts and circumstances as they existed when the police\r\n  officers encountered Brannon.Â  However, in our view, these facts reveal only\r\n  that the police officers could have\r\n  arrested Brannon, i.e. they had probable cause to believe he was\r\n  committing a crime.Â  These facts do not demonstrate that the police officers\r\n  intended to actually do so.[1]Â  \r\nLikewise,\r\n  there was also no evidence presented demonstrating Brannon submitted to the\r\n  officers.Â  To the contrary, as soon as Brannon saw the police officers, he\r\n  ran.Â  Therefore, we find an arrest was not being made at the time Brannon fled\r\n  from police.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the result reached by the court\r\n  of appeals and find the circuit court erred in denying Brannon's motion for a\r\n  directed verdict on the charge of resisting arrest.\r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  Acting Justice James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent\r\n  from the majority's opinion, and would reverse the court of appeals' decision\r\n  finding the trial court erred in denying Brannon's motion for a directed verdict\r\n  on the resisting arrest charge.Â  I would affirm the trial court's denial of the\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  \r\nSection III\r\nThe\r\n  majority holds, &quot;Because the State has failed to put forth any evidence\r\n  demonstrating that the officers either intended to arrest Brannon or that\r\n  Brannon submitted to arrest, we find an arrest was not being made when Brannon\r\n  ran from police.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  I disagree, and would hold that when the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  are viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the State put forth\r\n  evidence that the officers intended to arrest Brannon.Â  See State v.\r\n    Weston,&nbsp;367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (recognizing that when reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court\r\n  views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\r\n  the non-moving party).\r\nI agree with the majority that, in addressing the issues in this\r\n  matter, we are focused on whether an arrest was being made at the time of\r\n  Brannon's flight.Â  However, I disagree with their analysis and conclusion.Â  The\r\n  statute at issue states, &quot;It is unlawful for a person knowingly and\r\n  willfully . . . to resist an arrest being made by one whom the person knows or\r\n  reasonably should know is a law enforcement officer, whether under process or\r\n  not.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-320(A) (2003).\r\nAn arrest is an ongoing\r\n  process.Â  State v. Dowd, 306 S.C. 268, 270, 411 S.E.2d 428, 429&nbsp;(1991).Â \r\n  This Court has held that in order to &quot;'constitute an arrest, there must be\r\n  an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person, performed with\r\n  the intention to effect an arrest and so understood by the person\r\n  detained.'&quot; Â State v. Williams,&nbsp;237 S.C. 252, 257, 116 S.E.2d\r\n  858, 860&nbsp;(1960) (quoting Jenkins v. United States, 161 F.2d 99, 101\r\n  (10th Cir. 1947)).Â  Williams provided further guidance:\r\n\r\n\tÂ It is\r\n  not necessary &quot;that there be an application of actual force, or manual\r\n  touching of the body, or physical restraint which may be visible to the eye, or\r\n  a formal declaration of arrest; it is sufficient if the person arrested\r\n  understands that he is in the power of the one arresting and submits in\r\n  consequence. However, in all cases in which there is no manual touching or\r\n  seizure or any resistance, the intentions of the parties to the transaction are\r\n  very important; there must have been intent on the part of one of them to\r\n  arrest the other, and intent on the part of such\r\n  other to submit, under the belief and impression that submission was necessary.\r\n  There can be no arrest where the person sought to be arrested is not conscious\r\n  of any restraint of his liberty.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860-61&nbsp;(quoting 4 Am. Jur. Arrest Â§ 2 (1936)); see also 5 Am. Jur. 2d Arrest Â§ 4 (2007) (&quot;Police\r\n  detention constitutes an 'arrest' if a reasonable person in the suspect's\r\n  position would understand the situation to be a restraint on freedom of the\r\n  kind that the law typically associates with a formal arrest.&quot;); 6A C.J.S. Arrest Â§ 1 (2004) (&quot;An arrest is the taking, seizing, or detaining the person of\r\n  another by any act which indicates an intention to take him or her into custody\r\n  and subject the person arrested to the actual control and will of the person\r\n  making the arrest.&quot;). \r\nBecause\r\n  Brannon was not physically touched or seized, pursuant to Williams the\r\n  intentions of the parties are important.Â  The question of intent from Brannon's\r\n  perspective is obvious.Â  Brannon was breaking into vehicles in the middle of\r\n  the night.Â  When he was surprised by two uniformed police officers, he ran and\r\n  tried to avoid arrest.Â  Any reasonable person in Brannon's position would not\r\n  have the slightest doubt that the pursuing officers intended to place him in\r\n  custody.Â  Clearly, Brannon was &quot;conscious of [the] restraint of his\r\n  liberty.&quot;Â  Williams,&nbsp;237 S.C. at 257, 116 S.E.2d at 860.Â  \r\nRegarding\r\n  the officers' intent, the majority holds that the intent of the officers must\r\n  be evaluated under a subjective standard rather than the objective standard\r\n  governing probable cause.Â  I disagree and would apply an objective standard.Â \r\n  The evidence reveals that a resident called 911 to report a car break-in which\r\n  the caller was seeing in progress.Â  The 911 operator kept the caller-witness on\r\n  the line and notified the officers as to the location of the break-in and its\r\n  progress.Â  As the officers apprehended the suspect, they were receiving a live\r\n  transmission of the caller-witness's ongoing observations as relayed by the 911\r\n  operator.Â  Based on the information received from the 911 operator, coupled\r\n  with the officers observations of Brannon next to the Ford Explorer with its\r\n  door open and inside light on, a reasonably prudent police officer would have\r\n  cause to believe that Brannon was committing the crime of breaking into a motor\r\n  vehicle.Â  The majority merely quoted one sentence of Officer Quinn's testimony\r\n  when he stated that &quot;[o]ur intention was to approach the subject and find\r\n  out exactly what he was doing there at the time.&quot;Â  The next sentence out\r\n  of Officer Quinn's mouth was, &quot;We believe [sic] he was breaking into a\r\n  motor vehicle and we placed him under arrest for that charge.&quot; Â Taking the\r\n  officers' testimony as a whole, and construing it in a light most favorable to\r\n  the State, I would find there was sufficient evidence of intent to arrest\r\n  Brannon.[3]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  presence of probable cause to arrest for breaking into a motor vehicle at the\r\n  time of the initial encounter lies at the core of my view that the process of\r\n  arrest was underway when the officers caught Brannon in the act.Â  Probable\r\n  cause is guided by Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and an officer's &quot;[s]ubjective\r\n  intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment\r\n  analysis,&quot;Â  Whren v. U.S., 517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S. Ct. 1769, 135\r\n  L. Ed. 2d 89&nbsp;(1996).Â  The proper inquiry is an objective one, based on\r\n  what a reasonable police officer would believe under the same circumstances.Â  Id. at 810-13.Â  In this case, a reasonable police officer would have probable cause\r\n  to arrest Brannon at the initial encounter.Â  Brannon's location and conduct\r\n  exactly matched the witness's description, as Brannon was standing next to the\r\n  Ford Explorer with an open door in the deserted parking lot late at night.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, I would hold that a person violates section 16-9-320(A)\r\n  irrespective of the lack of physical contact when: (1) a law enforcement\r\n  officer, from an objective standpoint, has probable cause to believe a person\r\n  has committed a crime; (2) the law enforcement officer through words or actions\r\n  makes known his intent to arrest or otherwise detain the person; (3) the\r\n  person, from an objective standpoint, recognizes the presence of a law\r\n  enforcement officer and understands the intent of the officer to arrest him;\r\n  and (4) the person attempts to avoid the arrest by impeding, hindering, or\r\n  obstructing the law enforcement officer, by means of fleeing from the officer\r\n  or some other method of resisting or opposing the arrest.Â  In this case,\r\n  viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the\r\n  State, I would find a jury question was presented as to the charge of resisting\r\n  arrest and would affirm the trial court's denial of a directed verdict\r\n  motion.Â Â  \r\nSections I &amp; II\r\nI\r\n  agree with the majority's holding in Section II of the majority opinion.Â  I\r\n  also agree with the portion of Section I of the majority opinion that holds\r\n  Brannon did not need to use the terms &quot;seizure&quot; or &quot;Fourth\r\n  Amendment&quot; in his motion for a directed verdict.Â  However, because I would\r\n  analyze Section III of the opinion differently than the majority, it is\r\n  necessary for me to address the resistance issue in Section I of the majority\r\n  opinion.Â  In Section I, the majority held that it need not decide whether\r\n  Brannon's flight from police amounted to resistance because it found there was\r\n  no evidence an arrest was being made when Brannon fled from police.Â  Because I\r\n  would find there is evidence that an arrest was being made, I must also address\r\n  whether Brannon's flight from police amounted to resistance.\r\nThe State argues\r\n  the court of appeals disregarded the law of the case doctrine in finding\r\n  Brannon's flight from police did not constitute resisting arrest.Â  I agree.Â  In\r\n  charging the jury, the trial court defined the term &quot;resist&quot; to\r\n  include &quot;peaceful nonviolent indirect obstruction of an arrest.&quot;Â \r\n  Brannon failed to object to this charge.Â  As a result, the trial court's\r\n  definition of &quot;resist&quot; is the law of the case, and under that\r\n  definition, Brannon's act of running from the police qualifies as resisting\r\n  arrest under section 16-9-320(A).Â  See Mickle v. Blackmon, 255\r\n  S.C. 136, 141-42, 177 S.E.2d 548, 549-50 (1970) (recognizing the failure to\r\n  object to a jury instruction makes the charge the law of the case).Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, I would affirm the trial court's denial of the\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â Â  \r\nActing Justice\r\n  James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The State contends the question of the officers'\r\n  intent was a factual issue for the jury to determine.Â  We disagree. This\r\n  argument fails to take into account that an arrest is a material element of the\r\n  crime of resisting arrest under section 16-9-320(A).Â  See Brown, 360\r\n  S.C. at 586, 602 S.E.2d at 395 (stating the accused is entitled to a directed\r\n  verdict when the State fails to present evidence on a material element of the\r\n  offense charged).\r\n[2] Brannon did not submit to the arrest because he was\r\n  running away from the officers.Â  Holding a suspect must submit to an arrest for\r\n  an arrest to be initiated leads to an absurd result in a resisting arrest\r\n  charge.Â  The whole point of a resisting arrest charge is that a person is not\r\n  submitting.Â Â  \r\n[3] Even using the majority's subjective standard, I\r\n  believe that taking Officer Quinn's testimony as a whole and construing it in a\r\n  light most favorable to the State would provide sufficient evidence of his\r\n  subjective intent to arrest Brannon.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26856","title":"SC Energy Users Committee v.

Pub. Serv. Comm'n of S.C., 343 S.C. 554,\r\n  558, 541 S.E.2d 250, 252 (2001).Â  The Commission is considered the expert\r\n  designated by the legislature to make policy determinations regarding utility\r\n  rates.Â  Kiawah Prop. Owners Group v. Public Serv. Comm'n of S.C., 359\r\n  S.C. 105, 109, 597 S.E.2d 145, 147 (2004).Â  &quot;The construction of a statute\r\n  by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most\r\n  respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling\r\n  reasons.&quot;Â  Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Exam'rs. In Optometry, 291 S.C.\r\n  221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987).Â  Because the Commission's findings are\r\n  presumptively correct, the party challenging the Commission's order bears the\r\n  burden of convincingly proving the decision is clearly erroneous, or arbitrary\r\n  or capricious, or an abuse of discretion, in view of the substantial evidence\r\n  of the record as a whole.Â  Duke Power Co., 343 S.C. at 558, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  at 252; see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(f) (Supp. 2009) (stating this\r\n  Court may reverse or modify the Commission's decision if it is arbitrary,\r\n  capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion).Â  Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Commission found SCE&amp;G was entitled to recover contingency costs as a\r\n  component of capital costs pursuant to section 58-33-270(B)(2) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  We disagree.Â  In our view, the Commission abused\r\n  its discretion in granting contingency costs to SCE&amp;G.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the legislature.&quot;Â  Hardee v. McDowell, 381 S.C. 445, 453,\r\n  673 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2009) (internal quotation omitted).Â  Under the plain\r\n  meaning rule, it is not the province of the court to change the meaning of a\r\n  clear and unambiguous statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  Where the statute's language is plain, unambiguous,\r\n  and conveys a clear, definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation\r\n  are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.Â  Gay v.\r\n    Ariail, 381 S.C. 341, 345, 673 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2009).Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the statute is ambiguous, however, courts must construe the terms of the\r\n  statute.Â  Lester v. S.C. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, 561, 514\r\n  S.E.2d 751, 752 (1999).Â  &quot;A statute as a whole must receive practical,\r\n  reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and\r\n  policy of lawmakers.&quot;Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs,\r\n  370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606 (2006).Â  Words in a statute must be\r\n  construed in context, and their meaning may be ascertained by reference to\r\n  words associated with them in the statute.Â  Eagle Container Co., LLC v. City\r\n    of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 570, 666 S.E.2d 892, 895-96 (2008).Â  When faced\r\n  with an undefined statutory term, the term must be interpreted in accordance\r\n  with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Branch v. City of Myrtle Beach,\r\n  340 S.C. 405, 409-10, 532 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2000).Â  Courts should not merely\r\n  consider the language of the particular clause being construed, but the\r\n  undefined word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole\r\n  statute and the policy of the law.Â  Id., at 410, 532 S.E.2d at 292.\r\nInitially,\r\n  the General Assembly explicitly defined what type of costs a utility can\r\n  recover under the Base Load Review Act.Â  In section 58-33-275(C) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009), the General Assembly stated, &quot;[s]o long as the\r\n  plant is constructed or being constructed in accordance with the approved\r\n  schedules, estimates, and projections set forth in Section 58-33-270(B)(1) and\r\n  58-33-270(B)(2) . . . the utility must be allowed to recover its capital costs\r\n  related to the plant through revised rate filings or general rateÂ \r\n  proceedings.&quot;Â  Thus, under the Base Load Review Act, a utility, such as\r\n  SCE&amp;G, can recover its capital costs related to the nuclear facility.Â  The\r\n  General Assembly did not leave any room for doubt as to what type of costs qualify\r\n  as capital costs.Â  The General Assembly broadly defined capital costs as:\r\n\r\n\t[C]osts\r\n  associated with the design, siting, selection, acquisition, licensing,\r\n  construction, testing, and placing into service of a base load plant, and\r\n  capital costs incurred to expand or upgrade the transmission grid in order to\r\n  connect the plant to the transmission grid and includes costs that may be\r\n  properly considered capital costs associated with a plant under generally\r\n  accepted principles of regulatory or financial accounting, and specifically\r\n  includes AFUDC[7] associated with a plant and capital costs associated with facilities or\r\n  investments for the transportation, delivery, storage, and handling of fuel.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-220(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nContingency\r\n  costs are not included in the statutory definition of recoverable capital\r\n  costs.Â  In fact, the phrase &quot;contingency costs&quot; does not appear anywhere\r\n  in the Base Load Review Act.Â  However, the term &quot;contingencies&quot;\r\n  appears multiple times in the Base Load Review Act.Â  Because it is not defined\r\n  in the statute, we must interpret the word &quot;contingencies&quot; in accordance\r\n  with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Branch, 340 S.C. at 409-10, 532\r\n  S.E.2d 292.Â  In doing so, we cannot merely consider the language of the\r\n  particular clause being construed, but the undefined word and its meaning in\r\n  conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  Id.,\r\n  at 410, 532 S.E.2d at 292.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  term &quot;contingencies&quot; appears for the first time in section\r\n  58-33-270(B)(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  Section 58-33-270(B)(1)\r\n  provides, &quot;[t]he base load review order shall establish:Â  (1) the\r\n  anticipated construction schedule for the plant including contingences . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Under section 58-33-270(B)(1), the Commission interpreted the term\r\n  &quot;contingencies&quot; to refer to unexpected events potentially affecting\r\n  the construction schedule of the nuclear facility.Â  The Commission identified\r\n  the possibility for &quot;major components being damaged in transit or their\r\n  manufacturing being delayed&quot; as factors possibly contributing to the delay\r\n  of the project.Â  In light of the possible delays associated with a project of\r\n  this magnitude, the Commission granted SCE&amp;G a construction schedule\r\n  contingency of eighteen months.Â  Thus, it is clear the Commission interpreted\r\n  the term &quot;contingencies&quot; as used by General Assembly in section\r\n  58-33-270(B)(1) to refer to unexpected events.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  term &quot;contingencies&quot; appears for a second time in section\r\n  58-33-270(B)(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).[8]Â \r\n  Section 58-33-270(B)(2) states, &quot;[t]he base load review order shall\r\n  establish . . . (2) the anticipated components of capital costs and the\r\n  anticipated schedule for incurring them, including specified contingencies.&quot;Â \r\n  The Commission found, &quot;the plain meaning and grammatical structure of this\r\n  statutory provision intends that contingencies be provided both for capital\r\n  costs and for the schedule for incurring capital costs.&quot;Â  The Commission's\r\n  finding indicates that it gave two meanings to the term\r\n  &quot;contingencies&quot; in this section.Â  On the one hand, consistent with\r\n  the manner that it defined &quot;contingencies&quot; in section\r\n  58-33-270(B)(1), the Commission interpreted the term to refer to unexpected\r\n    events accelerating or delaying SCE&amp;G's schedule for incurring capital\r\n  costs.Â  In accordance with this understanding of the term, the Commission\r\n  granted SCE&amp;G a twenty-four-month cost acceleration contingency period to\r\n  be used if the project was ahead of schedule, and an eighteen-month capital\r\n  cost rescheduling contingency period to be used if the project should incur\r\n  delays.Â  On the other hand, the Commission interpreted the term\r\n  &quot;contingencies&quot; to refer to unexpected costs and awarded\r\n  SCE&amp;G contingency costs in the amount of $438,293,000.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the grammatical structure of section 58-33-270(B)(2), it is possible that\r\n  the General Assembly intended for the term &quot;contingencies&quot; to apply\r\n  to both &quot;the anticipated components of capital costs and the\r\n  anticipated schedule for incurring them.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  However,\r\n  even if we were to agree with such an interpretation of this statute, the term\r\n  &quot;contingencies&quot; as it appears in section 58-33-270(B)(2) cannot have\r\n  two meanings.Â  In other words, it cannot refer to both unexpected events and\r\n  unexpected costs.Â  As a consequence, we find the Commission abused its discretion\r\n  in finding the plain meaning of section 58-33-270(B)(2) allowed SCE&amp;G to\r\n  recover contingency costs.Â  In our view, the statute is ambiguous.Â  Moreover,\r\n  we find it unclear as to whether the Base Load Review Act allows utilities to\r\n  recover contingency costs.Â  As explained above, the General Assembly\r\n  unequivocally stated that capital costs were recoverable under the Base Load\r\n  Review Act.Â  58-33-275(C).Â  Â Â The General Assembly went on to expressly define\r\n  capital costs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-220(5).Â  In doing so, the General\r\n  Assembly did not include contingency costs in the definition of recoverable\r\n  capital costs.Â  For these reasons, we find it unclear as to whether contingency\r\n  costs are recoverable under the Base Load Review Act.Â  Thus, we turn to the\r\n  policy objectives behind the Base Load Review Act to discern whether the\r\n  General Assembly intended for utilities to recover contingency costs as a\r\n  component of capital costs.\r\nIn\r\n  enacting the Base Load Review Act, the General Assembly announced the purpose\r\n  of the Act &quot;is to provide for the recovery of the prudently incurred costs\r\n  associated with new base load plants . . . when constructed by investor-owned\r\n  electrical utilities, while at the same time protecting customers of\r\n  investor-owned electrical utilities from responsibility for imprudent financial\r\n  obligations or costs.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-210 (Supp. 2009) (Editor's\r\n  Note).Â  Thus, the goal of the Base Load Review Act is two-fold:Â  (1) to allow\r\n  SCE&amp;G to recover its &quot;prudently incurred costs&quot; associated with\r\n  the nuclear facility; and (2) to protect customers &quot;from responsibility\r\n  for imprudent financial obligations or costs.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nInitially,\r\n  the first objective of the Base Load Review Act is not achieved by allowing\r\n  SCE&amp;G to recover contingency costs.Â  The contingency costs requested by\r\n  SCE&amp;G do not represent costs SCE&amp;G anticipates incurring in\r\n  constructing the nuclear facility.Â  Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and\r\n  Chief Financial Officer of SCE&amp;G, testified &quot;[t]he Company does not currently\r\n  anticipate needing to use these contingencies . . . .&quot;Â  Stephen Byrne,\r\n  Senior Vice President of SCE&amp;G, stated the contingency costs:\r\n\r\n\t[A]re\r\n  based on SCE&amp;G's assessment of the potential for actual costs to be greater\r\n  than the forecasted costs based on such things as the necessity for change\r\n  orders, delays due to weather, delays in receiving licenses and permits, actual\r\n  inflation exceeding applicable indices, and estimates of the units of time and\r\n  materials used to price the project that understate actual requirements.Â  In my\r\n  opinion, these risk factors are not subject to mathematical quantification, but\r\n  must be assessed as a matter of sound engineering judgment. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, because\r\n  contingency costs are not costs SCE&amp;G anticipates incurring in constructing\r\n  the nuclear facility, the first objective of the Base Load Review Act would not\r\n  be achieved by allowing SCE&amp;G to recover contingency costs. \r\nThe\r\n  Commission's award of contingency costs to SCE&amp;G also does not meet the\r\n  second objective of the Base Load Review Actâ€”to protect customers &quot;from\r\n  responsibility for imprudent financial obligations or costs.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  SCE&amp;G has not designated how contingency funds will be spent.Â \r\n  Additionally, if this Court approves the contingency costs granted to SCE&amp;G\r\n  by the Commission, ratepayers will have no means to challenge how SCE&amp;G\r\n  spends contingency funds in the future.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-275(B) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  Thus, in effect, the Commission has allowed SCE&amp;G to increase rates\r\n  so that it can recover in excess of 438 million dollars in speculative,\r\n  un-itemized expenses with no mechanism in place to challenge the prudence of\r\n  SCE&amp;G's financial decisions.Â  Accordingly, the Commission's award of\r\n  contingency costs to SCE&amp;G directly conflicts with the two stated purposes\r\n  of the Base Load Review Act.Â  For this reason, we find the General Assembly did\r\n  not intend for SCE&amp;G to recover contingency costs under the Base Load\r\n  Review Act.Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the enactment of section 58-33-270(E) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009)\r\n  reveals that the General Assembly anticipated that construction costs could\r\n  increase during the life of the project.Â  Under section 58-33-270(E), SCE&amp;G\r\n  may petition the Commission for an order modifying rate designs.Â  Consistent\r\n  with the above mentioned objectives of the Base Load Review Act, section\r\n  58-33-270(E)(2) further states that the Commission should approve such a\r\n  request, after a hearing, if the Commission finds the &quot;rate designs are\r\n  just and reasonable.&quot;Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the Commission abused its discretion in granting SCE&amp;G contingency\r\n  costs under the Base Load Review Act.Â  In light of our decision, we also find\r\n  the Commission erred in adding inflation to the contingency costs.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the decision of the Commission is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J. and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a\r\n  separate opinion. KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I join Justice\r\n  Kittredge's dissent as I agree that we should defer to the Commission's\r\n  interpretation of the statute it is required to administer.Â  See Dunton\r\n    v. South Carolina Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353\r\n  S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987).Â  \r\nI\r\n  further dissent as I believe the Commission's order does not indicate that it\r\n  gave two meanings to the word &quot;contingencies,&quot; as used in S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 58-33-270(B).Â  Instead, I believe the Commission defined\r\n  &quot;contingencies&quot; as &quot;unexpected events&quot; and simply\r\n  considered the impact of such &quot;unexpected events&quot; in the context of\r\n  each of the subsections of Â§ 58-33-270(B), specifically in the context of the\r\n  construction schedule and capital costs.Â Â  This interpretation best comports\r\n  with our rules of statutory construction.Â  See Adams v. Clarendon\r\n    County School Dist. No. 2, 270 S.C. 266, 241 S.E.2d 897 (1978) (&quot;It is\r\n  the duty of this Court to give all parts and provisions of a legislative\r\n  enactment effect and reconcile conflicts if reasonably and logically\r\n  possible.&quot;).Â  Consequently, I would affirm the order of the Commission.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  Â I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  I vote to affirm the order of the South Carolina Public Service Commission.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to the Base Load Review Act, South Carolina favors the development and\r\n  construction of new coal and nuclear fueled electrical generating facilities to\r\n  meet our state's increasing energy demands.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§58-33-210 et\r\n    seq. (Supp. 2009).Â  I agree with the majority that the applicable\r\n  &quot;statute is ambiguous&quot; and that it is &quot;unclear as to whether the\r\n  Base Load Review Act allows utilities to recover contingency costs.&quot;Â \r\n  Given this ambiguity juxtaposed to the clear purpose of the Act, I see no\r\n  compelling reason to depart from the general rule that we should accord\r\n  deference to the Commission's construction of a statute it must administer.Â  I\r\n  would not reverse the Commission's interpretation of the statute.Â  The\r\n  estimated capital cost of the proposed project is in excess of $4.5 billion,\r\n  including contingency costs in the amount of $438,293,000.Â  The Commission\r\n  fully vetted all issues at the multi-week hearing, including the basis for\r\n  determining the contingency costs.Â  In my judgment, the inclusion of\r\n  contingency costs for the construction of the proposed nuclear facility is\r\n  amply supported by the record and survives the deferential &quot;substantial\r\n  evidence&quot; standard of review.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This is a companion case to Friends of the Earth\r\n  v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of S.C., No. 26811, 2010 WL 1656997 (S.C. Apr. 26, 2010).\r\n[2] Base load plants are typically either coal or nuclear\r\n  fired plants.Â  Base load plants are fuel efficient generating units that are\r\n  designed and intended to run for extended periods of time at high capacity.Â  \r\n[3] The majority of the equipment and service costs that\r\n  are primarily nuclear in nature are subject to fixed or firm prices.Â  The price\r\n  terms that are neither fixed nor firm are primarily standard construction cost\r\n  items (labor and general construction materials).Â  \r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-10 et seq. (1977 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2009).\r\n[5] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-210 et seq. (Supp. 2009).\r\n[6] In addition to Energy Users, the Commission also\r\n  received timely petitions to intervene from CMC\r\n  Steel South Carolina, Pamela Greenlaw, Friends of the Earth, Mildred A.\r\n  McKinley, Lawrence P. Newton, Ruth Thomas, Maxine Warshauer, Samuel Baker, and\r\n  Joseph Wojcicki.Â  None of the above listed intervenors are a party to this\r\n  action.Â  \r\n[7] &quot;'AFUDC' means the allowance for funds used\r\n  during construction of a plant calculated according to regulatory accounting\r\n  principles.&quot;Â  S.C.

Gregory Hembree, of\r\n          Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this capital murder\r\n  case, Louis Michael Winkler, Jr. (Appellant) appeals his sentence of death.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nAppellant\r\n  kidnapped and sexually assaulted Rebekah Grainger Winkler (Victim) on October\r\n  10, 2005, five months before Victim was murdered.[2]Â \r\n  That evening, Appellant's car was spotted behind the Seacoast Medical Center\r\n  (Seacoast).Â  Victim's car was found off the road in some trees and appeared to\r\n  have been wrecked.Â  There was blood on both of Victim's car seats, around the\r\n  center console, and on the interior panel of the passenger's side door.Â  The\r\n  Horry County Police Department activated its dog team in an attempt to locate\r\n  two missing persons.Â  Victim was later found next to Stephen's Crossroads,\r\n  which is where the magistrate's complex and library is located.Â  \r\nPhyllis\r\n  Richardson (Richardson) arrived at the parking lot at Stephen's Crossroads around\r\n  7:30 a.m. on October 11, 2005, and saw a woman walking in the parking lot being\r\n  followed by a man.Â  Richardson noted the woman looked distraught and was acting\r\n  confused, and that the man's hands were in the air as if he were raging and\r\n  irritated.Â  Shortly after Richardson entered her office, she saw the woman from\r\n  the parking lot on the phone in her office building.Â  The woman's hair was matted\r\n  and tangled with some bald spots.Â  Richardson later learned the woman making\r\n  the call was Victim. Â Curtis Thompson was the first officer to arrive at the\r\n  building, and noticed some of Victim's hair looked like it had been ripped out,\r\n  and she had black eyes, abrasions, and other scratches. \r\nVictim\r\n  was transported to Seacoast by EMS where Lisa Gore (Gore), a nurse at Seacoast,\r\n  tended to Victim and noted her injuries to the left eye, some swelling in the\r\n  jaw area, bruising around the neck, a fractured nose, an upper lip injury,\r\n  redness under her right eye, corneal abrasions, multiple bruises and\r\n  contusions, a bite mark to the face, and a large amount of hair removed from\r\n  her head.Â  A sexual assault kit was collected from Victim.Â  The DNA found in\r\n  the rectal and vaginal swabs from the sexual assault kit matched Appellant's\r\n  DNA.\r\nOn\r\n  October 11, 2005, Appellant was arrested for criminal sexual conduct, first\r\n  degree, assault and battery with intent to kill, and kidnapping.Â  Bond was\r\n  initially denied; however, at a second bond hearing, Appellant's bond was set\r\n  at $150,000 and he was required to wear an electronic monitor while out on\r\n  bond.Â  At a third bond hearing, Appellant's bond was amended to allow him to\r\n  remove his electronic monitor for two hours so he could seek employment between\r\n  the hours of 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.Â  Appellant was out of jail on bond on the day\r\n  Victim was murdered.\r\nAt\r\n  around 5:30 p.m. March 6, 2006, Appellant kicked in the door to Victim's\r\n  condominium.Â  Appellant knocked Victim's son, Jonathan G. (Jonathan), onto the\r\n  ground and then shot Victim once in the face at point blank range.Â  According\r\n  to the forensic pathologist who conducted Victim's autopsy, death occurred\r\n  instantly.Â  Appellant then walked over and pointed the gun at Jonathan.Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Appellant left the condominium. \r\nAppellant\r\n  hid in the woods for two weeks.Â  When police apprehended Appellant,[3] they recovered a Jennings .380 pistol from his right front pants pocket.Â  Five\r\n  live rounds were found in the pistol, but there was not a live round in the\r\n  port.Â  During a full search of Appellant, police recovered eighteen rounds of\r\n  .380 ammunition, a guard lock blade knife, and a wallet.Â  In the wallet, there\r\n  was a newspaper clipping about the shooting and murder.\r\nAppellant\r\n  was tried and found guilty of murder, first-degree burglary, and assault and\r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  At trial, the State sought to\r\n  establish two statutory aggravating circumstances: (1) the murder was committed\r\n  during the commission of a burglary; and (2) the murder was of a witness or potential witness committed at any time during the\r\n  criminal process for the purpose of impeding or deterring prosecution of any\r\n  crime.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(c), (C)(a)(11) (2003 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2009).Â  The jury recommended that Appellant be sentenced to death.Â Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the guilt phase of Appellant's trial, Mary Elizabeth C. (Mary), Jonathan's\r\n  friend, testified that on the evening of the murder she was on the phone with\r\n  Jonathan when she heard a loud pop noise, and a voice that was not Jonathan's\r\n  say, &quot;I told you I'd be back.Â  I'm not going to jail you stupid bitch, and\r\n  I'm notâ€”I'm back, I'm back.Â  I'm never going back to jail.&quot;Â  Mary then\r\n  heard a hit and the phone went to static.Â  Andrew Cooper (Cooper), a former\r\n  crime scene technician for the Horry County Police Department, testified that\r\n  it appeared there had been a forced entry because the door jamb, door frame,\r\n  lock mechanism, and other parts of the door had been broken.Â  Cooper also\r\n  testified that a reddish colored liquid was collected from the kitchen\r\n  countertop.Â  Kimberly Hahn, a former State Law Enforcement Division (SLED)\r\n  scientist, testified that she compared the blood swabs recovered from the\r\n  counter of Victim's residence to Appellant's blood standard, and the blood from\r\n  the counter matched Appellant's blood profile.Â  Cooper testified that a\r\n  projectile was recovered from the baseboard of the wall behind Victim.Â  A\r\n  firearms and toolmark examiner for SLED testified that the Jennings pistol\r\n  found on Appellant when apprehended fired the bullet recovered from Victim's\r\n  baseboard.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the sentencing phase of Appellant's trial, Jill Shelley (Shelley), Victim's\r\n  older daughter, testified that in September 2005, six months before the murder,\r\n  she could not contact Victim on the phone so she drove to Victim's home.Â  When\r\n  she arrived at Victim's residence she saw that Victim was beat up and her arms\r\n  were covered in bruises.Â  Appellant later arrived, started kicking the door,\r\n  and was screaming for Victim to let him in.Â  Shelley threatened to call the\r\n  police.Â  Appellant responded that Victim knew what would happen if they called\r\n  the police.Â  Shelley testified that Victim moved out of Appellant's home as a\r\n  result of that confrontation.Â  One piece of evidence presented by the State was\r\n  a letter sent by Appellant to Shelley while Appellant was incarcerated.Â  In the\r\n  letter Appellant asserted that had Shelley not gotten involved, Victim would\r\n  still be alive.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the trial court err in admitting an audio tape recording as a prior consistent\r\n  statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the trial court err in allowing the jury to review the transcript of the 911 tape?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did the trial court err in refusing to allow Appellant to represent himself during\r\n  the sentencing phase of trial?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Did the trial court err in not conducting a full Faretta inquiry?\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.\r\n    Did\r\n  the trial court err in allowing defense counsel to present mitigation evidence\r\n  to which Appellant objected?\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VI.\r\n    Did\r\n  the trial court err in denying Appellant's motion for a directed verdict on the\r\n  aggravating circumstance outlined in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20 (C)(a)(11)?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d\r\n  827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;This Court does not re-evaluate the\r\n  facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines\r\n  whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by any evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  &quot;The admission or exclusion of evidence is left\r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed\r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Saltz,&nbsp;346\r\n  S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244&nbsp;(2001).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support\r\n  or are controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  State v. Pittman,&nbsp;373\r\n  S.C. 527, 577, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170&nbsp;(2007) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Rule\r\n  801(d)(1)(B), SCRE\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in admitting as a prior consistent statement under\r\n  Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE an audio tape recording of Jonathan's interview with\r\n  police on the evening of the murder.Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior consistent statements\r\n  are not hearsay if: \r\n\r\n  The declarant testifies at the\r\n    trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement,\r\n    and the statement is . . . consistent with the declarant's testimony and is\r\n    offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent\r\n    fabrication or improper influence or motive; provided, however, the statement\r\n    must have been made before the alleged fabrication, or before the alleged\r\n    improper influence or motive arose.\r\n\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.Â  In\r\n  order for a prior consistent statement to be admissible pursuant to Rule\r\n  801(d)(1)(B), the following elements must be present:\r\n\r\n  (1) the declarant must testify and be subject to\r\n    cross-examination, (2) the opposing party must have explicitly or implicitly\r\n    accused the declarant of recently fabricating the statement or of acting under\r\n    an improper influence or motive, (3) the statement must be consistent with the\r\n    declarant's testimony, and (4) the\r\n    statement must have been made prior to the alleged fabrication, or prior to the\r\n    existence of the alleged improper influence or motive.\r\n\r\nSaltz,&nbsp;346 S.C. at 121-22, 551 S.E.2d at 244. \r\nJonathan\r\n  testified that he saw Appellant shoot and kill his mother.Â  During cross\r\n  examination, Jonathan testified that his father was Roger Grainger (Grainger).Â \r\n  He also testified that Grainger was the only person he called &quot;dad,&quot; and\r\n  that he did not refer to Appellant as &quot;dad.&quot;Â  Defense counsel asked\r\n  Jonathan if he remembered telling the first officer who arrived on the scene\r\n  that it was his dad who shot his mother.Â  Jonathan denied he told the officer\r\n  that it was his dad, and stated he told the officer it was his stepdad.Â \r\n  Jonathan also testified that Grainger was supposed to arrive at the condominium\r\n  around 6 p.m. on the night of the murder. \r\nOfficer\r\n  Thomas Knoch (Knoch), the first officer to arrive at the scene of the murder,\r\n  testified that as he was heading up the steps to the condominium the following\r\n  conversation took place between him and Jonathan, &quot;He said he's gone, and\r\n  I asked him.Â  I said who. . . . He said my dad . . . .&quot;Â  Knoch also\r\n  testified that in his report he wrote, &quot;When I asked him who, he said my\r\n  dad.&quot;\r\nDetective\r\n  Ann Pitts (Pitts) testified that she spoke with Jonathan on the evening of the\r\n  shooting and recorded the conversation.Â  The state moved to enter the tape\r\n  recorded conversation into evidence.Â  In the statement to Pitts, Jonathan\r\n  identified Appellant as the man who broke into the condominium and shot\r\n  Victim.Â  Appellant objected and the court overruled Appellant's objection under\r\n  Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.\r\nWe\r\n  hold that Jonathan's statement to Pitts was a prior consistent statement admissible\r\n  under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.Â  First, Jonathan testified at trial and was\r\n  subject to cross-examination.Â  Second, Appellant accused Jonathan of recently\r\n  fabricating the statement.Â  Appellant was accusing Jonathan of lying when\r\n  Jonathan testified that he told Knoch it was his stepdad who shot his mother,\r\n  not his dad.Â  This alleged fabrication was necessarily recent because it\r\n  happened during the trial.Â  Third, Jonathan's statement to Pitts was consistent\r\n  with his testimony at trial.Â  Fourth, the statement to Pitts occurred before\r\n  the alleged recent fabrication.Â  Thus, all of the elements of Rule\r\n  801(d)(1)(B), SCRE are satisfied and the trial court committed no error in\r\n  allowing into evidence Jonathan's statement to Pitts.Â  \r\nII. 911\r\n  Tape\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in allowing the jury to view the transcript of the\r\n  911 tape while the jurors were listening to the tape during deliberations.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  trial judge, in his discretion, may permit the jury at their request to review,\r\n  in the defendant's presence, testimony after beginning their deliberations.&quot;Â  State v. Plyler, 275 S.C. 291, 298, 270 S.E.2d 126, 129&nbsp;(1980).Â \r\n  &quot;The extent of such review is within the discretion of the trial judge to\r\n  be exercised in the light of the jury's request.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court\r\n  is not required to submit evidence to the jury for review beyond that\r\n  specifically requested but in its discretion may have the jury review other\r\n  evidence relating to the same factual issue so as not to give undue prominence\r\n  to the evidence requested.Â  Id.Â  In Plyler, the trial court\r\n  allowed the jury to hear a tape of the testimony of the defendant's ex-wife in\r\n  response to the jury's request to have her testimony read back to them.Â  Id.Â \r\n  In that case, this Court found there was no abuse of discretion where only the\r\n  direct examination was played and the trial judge denied the defendant's motion\r\n  that the jury be required to also hear the cross-examination to prevent\r\n  overemphasis of the portion reheard.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, during jury deliberations, the jury sent the judge a question asking\r\n  if they could read the 911 transcript.Â  Appellant argued the transcript was not\r\n  part of the trial record, was only offered as an aid to the tape recording, and\r\n  was never put into evidence.Â  The trial court replayed the 911 tape for the\r\n  jury in the courtroom and the jury was allowed to review the transcript while\r\n  the tape played, which mirrored the way in which the evidence was presented at\r\n  trial.[4]Â \r\n  This was done in Appellant's presence at the request of the jury.Â  Thus, the\r\n  judge exercised proper discretion and committed no error in allowing the jury\r\n  to read the transcript while listening to the 911 tape.\r\nIII. Self-representation\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow Appellant to\r\n  represent himself during the sentencing phase of the trial.Â  We disagree.[5]\r\nAn\r\n  accused may waive the right to counsel and proceed pro se.Â  Faretta\r\n    v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975).Â \r\n  However, &quot;[a] defendant's right to waive the assistance of counsel is not\r\n  unlimited.&quot;Â  State v. Fuller,&nbsp;337 S.C. 236, 241, 523 S.E.2d\r\n  168, 170&nbsp;(1999).Â  &quot;The request to proceed pro se must be\r\n  clearly asserted by the defendant prior to trial.&quot;Â  Id. (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;If the request to proceed pro se is made after trial\r\n  has begun, the grant or denial of the right to proceed pro se rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge.&quot;Â  Id. (citing United\r\n    States v. Singleton, 107 F.3d 1091 (4th Cir.1997); United States v.\r\n      Lawrence, 605 F.2d 1321 (4th Cir. 1979)).Â  &quot;Once trial commences, that\r\n  right [to proceed pro se] is subject to the trial court's discretion\r\n  which requires a balancing of the defendant's legitimate interests in\r\n  representing himself and the potential disruption and\r\n  possible delay of proceedings already in progress.&quot; U.S. v. Wesley,&nbsp;798\r\n  F.2d 1155, 1155-56&nbsp;(8th Cir. 1986) (citations omitted); see also U.S. v. Stevens,&nbsp;83 F.3d 60, 66-67&nbsp;(2d Cir. 1996) (&quot;[O]nce\r\n  a trial has begun, a defendant's right to represent himself 'is sharply\r\n  curtailed,' and the judge considering the motion must weigh 'the prejudice to\r\n  the legitimate interests of the defendant' against the 'potential disruption of\r\n  proceedings already in progress.'&quot;).Â  The sentencing phase of a capital\r\n  trial does not constitute a separate trial.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B)\r\n  (2003); see also State v. Stewart,&nbsp;288 S.C. 232, 235,\r\n  341 S.E.2d 789, 791&nbsp;(1986).\r\nAppellant\r\n  did not make his request to proceed pro se at the beginning of trial.Â \r\n  Appellant made his request to proceed pro se at the beginning of the\r\n  sentencing phase, which is not a separate trial.Â  Thus, review of this issue is\r\n  governed by the abuse of discretion standard outlined above and Appellant's\r\n  right to represent himself was sharply curtailed by his failure to exercise\r\n  this right prior to trial. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's request to\r\n  proceed pro se at the sentencing phase of the trial.Â  First, the trial\r\n  court noted it was concerned that Appellant's medication would affect his\r\n  ability to properly and fully function as his own counsel.Â  Second, the trial\r\n  court was concerned that allowing Appellant to represent himself during the\r\n  sentencing phase would require some delay for Appellant to fully prepare.Â \r\n  Third, the trial court was concerned the jury may be confused to have the first\r\n  half of the case tried by counsel and the second half tried without counsel,\r\n  especially if the jury could see counsel at Appellant's counsel table.Â  For\r\n  these reasons, the trial court properly considered the legitimate interests of\r\n  Appellant and the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress.Â \r\n  Hence, the trial court's decision to not allow Appellant to proceed pro se during the sentencing phase of trial was not an abuse of discretion and,\r\n  therefore, nor error.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIV. Faretta Warnings\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred by failing to properly provide Appellant with Faretta warnings when Appellant sought to proceed pro se at the beginning\r\n  of the sentencing phase.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs noted above, Appellant\r\n  did not timely waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se.Â \r\n  Hence, Appellant's reliance on Faretta is misplaced.Â  Had Appellant\r\n  moved to proceed pro se before the trial began, then Faretta would apply.Â  Moreover, Appellant contends that Fuller requires\r\n  reversal.Â  In Fuller, the defendant moved to proceed pro se before the trial began.Â  337 S.C. at 241, 523 S.E.2d at 170. Â Â However, in this\r\n  case, Appellant did not seek to proceed pro se until the sentencing\r\n  phase.Â  Appellant's reliance on Faretta and Fuller is misplaced,\r\n  and the trial court properly considered the legitimate interests of Appellant\r\n  and the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress.[6]Â Â Â Â  \r\nV. Mitigating\r\n  Social History\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends the trial court erred by allowing defense counsel to present\r\n  mitigating social history evidence and call Appellant's family members as\r\n  mitigation witnesses over Appellant's objection.Â  We disagree. \r\n&quot;An\r\n  attorney undoubtedly has a duty to consult with the client regarding 'important\r\n  decisions,' including questions of overarching defense strategy.&quot;Â  Florida\r\n    v. Nixon,&nbsp;543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S. Ct. 551, 560, 160 L. Ed. 2d 565,\r\n  578&nbsp;(2004) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688,\r\n  104 S. Ct. 2052, 2065, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 694 (1984)). &quot;That obligation,\r\n  however, does not require counsel to obtain the defendant's consent to 'every\r\n  tactical decision.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Taylor v. Illinois, 484\r\n  U.S. 400, 418, 108 S. Ct. 646, 657, 98 L. Ed. 2d 798, 816 (1988)).Â  The\r\n  introduction of the mitigation evidence at issue was a tactical decision made\r\n  by Appellant's trial counsel and is reviewed on a case by case basis.Â  The\r\n  mitigation evidence presented served the purpose of humanizing Appellant to the\r\n  jury.Â  We find the introduction of this mitigation evidence was a tactical\r\n  decision made by trial counsel and the trial court committed no error in\r\n  admitting mitigating evidence that Appellant did not want to be introduced.Â Â  \r\nVI. S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(11)\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred by refusing to direct a verdict on the statutory\r\n  aggravating circumstance of the murder of a witness to impede or deter\r\n  prosecution of a crime.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether to submit an aggravating circumstance to the jury, the\r\n  trial court is concerned only with the existence of evidence, not its\r\n  weight.&quot;Â  State v. Smith, 298 S.C. 482, 485, 381 S.E.2d 724,\r\n  726&nbsp;(1989).Â  &quot;The trial judge should submit a statutory aggravator to\r\n  the jury if there is any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support\r\n  it.&quot;Â  State v. Lindsey,&nbsp;372 S.C. 185, 194-95, 642 S.E.2d 557,\r\n  562&nbsp;(2007).\r\nThe aggravating\r\n  circumstance at issue is &quot;[t]he murder of a\r\n  witness or potential witness committed at any time during the criminal process\r\n  for the purpose of impeding or deterring prosecution of any crime.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(11) (2003 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  The State established\r\n  there was an ongoing criminal process from 2005 against Appellant for criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, first degree, assault and battery with intent to kill, and\r\n  kidnapping at the time Victim was murdered.Â  Victim, as the victim in the 2005\r\n  crimes, was clearly a potential witness in Appellant's trial on these three\r\n  charges.Â  There was circumstantial evidence to support a finding that Appellant\r\n  murdered Victim to impede or deter prosecution of the charges listed above.Â \r\n  Jonathan testified that Appellant stated, &quot;you thought I was going to\r\n  prison,&quot; when he broke into the condominium.Â  Mary testified she heard a\r\n  loud pop noise, and a voice that was not Jonathan's say, &quot;I told you I'd\r\n  be back.Â  I'm not going to jail you stupid bitch, and I'm notâ€”I'm back, I'm\r\n  back.Â  I'm never going back to jail.&quot;Â  Shelley testified that Appellant\r\n  warned Victim that she knew what would happen if someone called the police.Â \r\n  Lastly, in the letter from Appellant to Shelley written while Appellant was\r\n  incarcerated, Appellant asserted that Victim would still be alive had Shelley\r\n  not gotten involved in Victim's life.Â  This evidence is circumstantial evidence\r\n  to support the statutory aggravating circumstance contained in section 16-3-20(C)(a)(11),\r\n  and the trial court is affirmed in its denial of Appellant's motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  \r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nPursuant\r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), we have conducted a proportionality review and find the death sentence was not the result\r\n  of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of\r\n  other decisions demonstrates that Appellantâ€™s sentence is neither excessive nor\r\n  disproportionate. Â See, e.g., State v. Williams, 386 S.C.\r\n  503, 690 S.E.2d 62 (2010); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478\r\n  S.E.2d 260&nbsp;(1996).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, Appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.Â \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This case consolidates Appellant's direct appeal and the mandatory review\r\n  provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003).Â  \r\n[2] Victim was Appellant's estranged wife.Â  Â Â \r\n[3] Three days after the murder, police searched Appellant's residence and found a\r\n  piece of paper with Victim's address on it.Â  However, police were not able to\r\n  find Appellant until March 20, 2006, two weeks after the murder.Â Â  \r\n[4] Appellant offered no objection to the introduction of the 911 transcript at\r\n  trial, nor did he object to the transcript being read while the 911 tape\r\n  played.\r\n[5] Issue three condenses Appellant's third and fourth issues on appeal into one\r\n  issue.\r\n[6] Even if Faretta were applicable, the record reflects the trial judge met\r\n  the Faretta standard by adequately warning Appellant of the dangers of\r\n  self-representation.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26858","title":"Ray v.

Â Additionally, Cintas's\r\n  risk management strategy was inserted into the language of the policy as an\r\n  endorsement.Â  The endorsement read:Â Â  &quot;For all states, where permitted to\r\n  do so, the Insured has elected to reject Uninsured and/or Underinsured\r\n  Motorists coverage.Â  In those states, where the rejection of coverage is not\r\n  permitted, the lowest permissible coverage limit applies.&quot; Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  state specific form provided by Lumbermens for South Carolina was entitled\r\n  &quot;Offer of Optional Additional Uninsured Motorist and Optional Underinsured\r\n  Motorist Coverage&quot; (&quot;the form&quot;).Â  The form, itself, was four\r\n  pages long.Â  On pages one and two of the form, it explained the nature of UM\r\n  and UIM coverage.Â  With regard to UIM coverage, the form stated: \r\n\r\n  [Y]ou\r\n      have the right to buy UIM coverage in limits up to the limits of liability\r\n      coverage which you will carry under your automobile insurance policy.Â  Some of\r\n      the more commonly sold limits of underinsured motorist coverage, together with\r\n      the additional premiums which you will be charged have been printed by your\r\n      insurance company upon this Form.Â  If there are other limits in which you are\r\n      interested, but which are not shown upon this Form, then fill in those limits\r\n      in the blanks provided. If your insurance company is allowed to market those\r\n      limits within this State, then your insurance agent will fill in the amounts of\r\n      the increased premium.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn page three, the\r\n  form contained blank lines for the insurance company to fill in commonly sold\r\n  limits of UIM coverage along with increases in premium for the selection of\r\n  such coverage.Â  In the form issued to Ryan, Lumbermens failed to fill in the\r\n  blanks.Â  Also, on page three, the form asked, &quot;[d]o you wish to purchase\r\n  underinsured motorist coverage?&quot;Â  During Ryan's deposition, he offered\r\n  conflicting testimony as to whether he personally checked the &quot;no&quot;\r\n  box next to this question.Â  Ryan also failed to sign under the &quot;no&quot; box\r\n  as required by the form.Â  However, Ryan signed the very last page of the form.Â \r\n  By signing, Ryan acknowledged he had read the offers of UM and UIM coverage and\r\n  indicated whether he wished to receive such coverage in the space provided.Â  \r\nShortly\r\n  after the policy became effective, Richard Ray, a Cintas employee, was severely\r\n  injured in an automobile accident when Jonathan Austin failed to stop at a red\r\n  light and collided with the vehicle driven by Ray.Â  At the time of the\r\n  accident, Ray was driving a vehicle owned by Cintas.[1] Â Following the accident, Ray filed a negligence action against Austin.Â  Austin,\r\n  through his insurance carrier, Safe Auto Insurance Company, agreed to tender\r\n  the limits of his automobile policy in exchange for Ray entering into a\r\n  Covenant Not to Execute.[2]Â \r\n  Ray then filed a declaratory judgment action against Lumbermens, contending\r\n  Lumbermens failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Cintas.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, Ray asked the circuit court to reform the policy to provide UIM\r\n  coverage in an amount equal to the five million dollar liability limits of the\r\n  policy issued by Lumbermens.Â  \r\nÂ Thereafter,\r\n  Ray and Lumbermens filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court\r\n  denied Ray's motion for summary judgment and granted Lumbermens' motion for\r\n  summary judgment, finding Lumbermens made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to\r\n  Cintas.Â  Specifically, the circuit court found the form complied with the\r\n  requirements of section 38-77-350(A)-(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2009), entitling Lumbermens to the statutory presumption that a meaningful\r\n  offer was made.Â  In the alternative, the circuit court found Lumbermens made a\r\n  meaningful offer of UIM coverage under State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (1987).Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment, an appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Lanham v. Blue\r\n    Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331,\r\n  333 (2002).&nbsp; Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\r\n  issue of material fact such that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a\r\n  matter of law.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493,\r\n  567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  &quot;In determining whether any triable issues of\r\n  fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that\r\n  may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.&quot;Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially, we must\r\n  determine whether the form complied with the requirements set forth in section\r\n  38-77-350(A), entitling Lumbermens to the statutory presumption that a\r\n  meaningful offer was made.Â  We hold it did not. \r\nAutomobile\r\n  insurance carriers are required to offer UIM coverage up to the limits of the\r\n  insured's liability coverage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  The insurer\r\n  bears the burden of establishing that it made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage.Â  Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 759\r\n  (1996).Â  &quot;[A] noncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer at\r\n  all.&quot;Â  Hanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57,\r\n  389 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1990).Â  If the insurer fails to comply with its duty to\r\n  make a meaningful offer, the policy will be reformed by operation of law to\r\n  include UIM coverage up to the limits of liability insurance carried by the\r\n  insured.Â  Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475 S.E.2d at 760.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  insurer enjoys a presumption that a meaningful offer of UIM coverage has been\r\n  made when a form offering UIM coverage complies with the requirements set forth\r\n  in section 38-77-350(A) and is signed by the named insured.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-77-350(A)-(B).Â  Section 38-77-350(A) provides:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    director or his designee shall approve a form that automobile insurers shall\r\n    use in offering optional coverages required to be offered pursuant to law to\r\n    applicants for automobile insurance policies.Â  This form must be used by insurers\r\n    for all new applicants.Â  The form, at a minimum, must provide for each optional\r\n    coverage required to be offered:\r\n  (1) a brief and concise explanation\r\n    of the coverage;\r\n  (2) a list of available limits and\r\n    the range of premiums for the limits; \r\n  (3) a space to mark whether the\r\n    insured chooses to accept or reject the coverage and a space to state the\r\n    limits of coverage the insured desires; Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  (4) a space for the insured to sign\r\n    the form that acknowledges that the insured has been offered the optional\r\n    coverages;\r\n  (5) the mailing address and\r\n    telephone number of the insurance department that the applicant may contact if\r\n    the applicant has questions that the insurance agent is unable to answer.Â  \r\n\r\nThe circuit\r\n  court erred in finding the form offering UIM coverage to Cintas complied with\r\n  the statutory requirements of section 38-77-350(A).Â  Page three of the form\r\n  contained three blanks for Lumbermens to fill in the commonly sold limits of\r\n  UIM coverage along with corresponding increases in premium for selecting such\r\n  coverage.Â  Lumbermens failed to fill in the blanks.Â  Accordingly, the form\r\n  failed to comply with the requirements of section 38-77-350(A)(2).Â  As such,\r\n  Lumbermens was not entitled to the statutory presumption that a meaningful\r\n  offer of UIM coverage was made.Â  Â \r\nNext,\r\n  we must determine whether Lumbermens made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to\r\n  Cintas under Wannamaker.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  where the insurer is not entitled to the statutory presumption that a\r\n  meaningful offer of UIM coverage was made, the insurer can still demonstrate\r\n  that a meaningful offer of UIM coverage was made to the insured under Wannamaker.Â  Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 264, 626 S.E.2d 6, 12\r\n  (2005).Â  In Wannamaker, this Court established a four part test to\r\n  determine whether a meaningful offer of UIM coverage has been made.Â  291 S.C.\r\n  at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556.Â  In order for an insurer to make a meaningful offer\r\n  of UIM coverage:\r\n\r\n  (1) the insurer's notification\r\n    process must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing;\r\n  (2) the insurer must specify the\r\n    limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general\r\n    terms;\r\n  (3) the insurer must intelligibly\r\n    advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and\r\n  (4) the insured must be told that\r\n    optional coverages are available for an additional premium.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n&quot;The purpose\r\n  of requiring automobile insurers to make a meaningful offer of additional UM or\r\n  UIM coverage 'is for insureds to know their options and to make an informed\r\n  decision as to which amount of coverage will best suit their needs.'&quot;Â  Floyd,\r\n  367 S.C. at 262-63, 626 S.E.2d at 12 (citing Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 352, 608 S.E.2d 569, 573 (2005)).Â  The insurer\r\n  is required to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to commercial insureds\r\n  even if the insured has expressed a desire not to purchase such coverage.Â  Croft\r\n    v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 420, 618 S.E.2d 909, 918 (2005).Â  &quot;One\r\n  who is ignorant and unwary might require more explanation than a sophisticated\r\n  applicant.&quot;Â  Anders v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C.\r\n  371, 376, 415 S.E.2d 406, 409 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  &quot;[E]vidence of the insured's\r\n  knowledge or level of sophistication is relevant and admissible when analyzing,\r\n  under Wannamaker, whether an insurer intelligibly advised the insured of\r\n  the nature of the optional UM or UIM coverage.&quot;Â  Croft, 365 S.C. at\r\n  420, 618 S.E.2d at 918.Â  \r\nWe find Lumbermens met\r\n  three of the four Wannamaker factors.Â  Initially, Lumbermens notified Cintas\r\n  of the availability of UIM coverage in a commercially reasonable manner.Â  Consistent\r\n  with their ten-year course of dealings, Purtell, on behalf of Lumbermens, met\r\n  with Ryan, Cintas's insurance purchasing agent, to discuss the insurance\r\n  options available to Cintas.Â  At the meeting, Purtell explained to Ryan that Cintas\r\n  had the option to purchase UIM coverage.Â  Additionally, Purtell presented Ryan\r\n  with the form offering UIM coverage.Â  The form itself intelligibly advised Cintas\r\n  of the nature of UIM coverage.Â  The form explained that UIM coverage is\r\n  triggered when liability coverage is insufficient to cover the damages of the\r\n  insured.Â  Finally, the form stated that UIM coverage was available for an\r\n  additional premium.Â  Â \r\nThe only remaining\r\n  element to analyze under Wannamaker is whether Lumbermens specified the\r\n  limits of UIM coverage and did not merely offer such coverage in general terms.Â \r\n  Lumbermens contends it satisfied this prong of the Wannamaker test by\r\n  advising Cintas of its option to purchase UIM coverage &quot;up to the limits\r\n  of liability coverage.&quot;Â  If we were to find that such a general statement\r\n  satisfied this prong of the Wannamaker test, we would essentially do\r\n  away with this element altogether.Â  On the other hand, if we were to find\r\n  Lumbermens failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage because it failed\r\n  to offer coverage in more specific terms, we would reach the absurd result of\r\n  reforming the insurance policy to give Cintas coverage it understood, did not\r\n  want, and clearly rejected.Â  Moreover, in reaching this absurd result, we would\r\n  turn the policy objective behind the meaningful offer requirement in Wannamaker on its head.\r\nWe refuse to apply\r\n  the Wannamaker factors in a manner that contravenes the very purpose\r\n  behind the meaningful offer requirement.Â  The clear purpose of the meaningful\r\n  offer requirement is to protect insuredsâ€”to give them the opportunity &quot;to\r\n  know their options and to make an informed decision as to which amount of\r\n  coverage will best suit their needs.&quot;Â  Floyd, 367 S.C. at 262-63, 626\r\n  S.E.2d at 12 (internal quotation omitted).Â  In this case, there can be no doubt\r\n  that Lumbermens informed Cintas of its option to purchase UIM coverage.Â \r\n  Lumbermens explained to Cintas the nature of UIM coverage through oral\r\n  discussions and in writing. Â During Ryan's deposition, he confirmed that Purtell\r\n  informed him of the availability of UIM coverage.Â  Ryan stated, &quot;[w]e [he\r\n  and Purtell] would talk about whether we wanted to buy any additional\r\n  coverage.Â  Of course, our stance was no.Â  We knew that additional coverage had\r\n  additional cost associated with it.&quot;Â  The facts of this case reveal that Cintas\r\n  made a business decision to refuse UIM coverage.Â  Cintas made this decision with\r\n  full awareness of the nature of the coverage it was rejecting.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find Lumbermens made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Cintas.\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the ruling of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.Â  \r\nTOAL, CJ.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring separately.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority's decision to affirm the\r\n  circuit court order granting summary judgment to Lumbermens.Â  I write\r\n  separately because I conclude that we need not reach the Wannamaker[4]/statutory\r\n  presumption[5] &quot;meaningful offer&quot; issues where, as here, the insured's agent does\r\n  not contend he lacked all the information necessary to make an intelligent\r\n  decision whether and in what amount to purchase underinsured and uninsured\r\n  coverage.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).\r\nThe typical\r\n  &quot;meaningful offer&quot; case arises when an insured or third party to the\r\n  insurance contract seeks to reform that contract to include underinsured or\r\n  uninsured coverage, alleging that the insurer failed to meet its obligation to\r\n  make a sufficient offer under Â§ 38-77-160.Â  In essence, the insurer can rely on\r\n  the Wannamaker factors or a statutorily acceptable form as an\r\n  affirmative defense in such a suit, relying on this evidence to show it in fact\r\n  conveyed the requisite information to the insured.Â  In my opinion, however,\r\n  where the insured itself does not dispute it had all the information necessary\r\n  to make an informed, intelligent choice, there is no need to discuss whether\r\n  the form was acceptable under Â§ 38-77-350 or whether Wannamaker has been\r\n  satisfied. \r\nI concur in the\r\n  decision to uphold the grant of summary judgment here.\r\n\r\n[1] To date, Ray has received workers' compensation\r\n  benefits in the amount of $574,823.48.Â  \r\n[2] Austin maintained $15,000 in liability coverage, the\r\n  minimum required under South Carolina law at the time of the accident.Â  \r\n[3] After the filing of the declaratory judgment action\r\n  against Lumbermens, Ray's lawsuits against Austin and Lumbermens were\r\n  consolidated.Â  \r\n[4] State Farm Mut.

Cox, 284 S.C. 574, 579, 328 S.E.2d 108, 112 (Ct. App. 1985) (&quot;In\r\n  a products liability action the plaintiff must establish three things,\r\n  regardless of the theory on which he seeks recovery:Â  (1) that he was injured\r\n  by the product; (2) that the product, at the time of the accident, was in\r\n  essentially the same condition as when it left the hands of the defendant; and\r\n  (3) that the injury occurred because the product was in a defective condition\r\n  unreasonably dangerous to the user.&quot;). Â Ford, therefore,\r\n  concludes that the negligence claim (which required Branham to prove that the\r\n  seatbelt sleeve was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user)\r\n  should have been dismissed.Â  We agree.Â  When an element common to\r\n  multiple claims is not established, all related claims must fail.Â  \r\nA negligence theory imposes\r\n  the additional burden on a plaintiff &quot;of demonstrating the defendant\r\n  (seller or manufacturer) failed to exercise due care in some respect, and,\r\n  unlike strict liability, the focus is on the conduct of the seller or\r\n  manufacturer, and liability is determined according to fault.&quot; Bragg v.\r\n    Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 539, 462 S.E.2d 321, 326 (Ct. App. 1995). Â The\r\n  fault-based element is of no moment where, as here, there is no showing in the\r\n  first instance of a product in a defective condition unreasonably\r\n  dangerous to the user.\r\nIn addition, Ford asserts there is no separate &quot;failure to test claim&quot;\r\n  apart from the duty to design and manufacture a product that is not defective\r\n  and unreasonably dangerous.Â  We agree, for if a product is not in a defective\r\n  condition unreasonably dangerous to the user, an alleged failure to test cannot\r\n  be the proximate cause of an injury.Â  The failure to establish that the\r\n  seatbelt sleeve was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user\r\n  for purposes of the strict liability claim requires the dismissal of the\r\n  companion negligence claim.Â Â Â  \r\nRelying on Bragg, the trial court determined it\r\n  appropriate to grant a directed verdict on the strict liability claim, while at\r\n  the same time allowing the negligence claim to go forward.Â  We find the trial\r\n  court's reliance on Bragg misplaced.\r\nIn Bragg, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of\r\n  the manufacturer with respect to the strict liability claim, but refused to\r\n  grant a directed verdict on the negligence claims.Â  319 S.C. at 538, 462 S.E.2d\r\n  at 325.Â  Bragg alleged two negligence claims:Â  negligence &quot;in failing to\r\n  place appropriate warnings&quot; on the product and another negligence claim &quot;in\r\n  supplying [a product] that was defective[ly] [designed].&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  537-38, 462 S.E.2d at 325.Â  The jury returned a verdict against Bragg on the\r\n  negligence claims.\r\nBragg appealed the dismissal of the strict liability claim, &quot;contend[ing]\r\n  the court's decision to grant the motion for directed verdict on strict\r\n  liability, while denying the motion for directed verdict on negligence, was\r\n  logically inconsistent and reversible error because those claims are virtually\r\n  identical and require the same proof.&quot;Â  Id. at 538, 462 S.E.2d at\r\n  325.Â  The court of appeals in Bragg affirmed the trial court and noted\r\n  that &quot;[s]trict liability and negligence are not mutually exclusive theories\r\n  of recovery; that is, an injury may give rise to claims that can be established\r\n  either under principles of strict liability or negligence, and failure to prove\r\n  one theory does not preclude proving the other.&quot;Â  Id. at 539, 462\r\n  S.E.2d at 326.\r\nWhile we agree that strict liability and negligence are not\r\n  mutually exclusive theories of recovery, we caution against a broad reading of Bragg in this regard.Â  An analytical framework that turns solely on whether strict\r\n  liability and negligence are mutually exclusive theories of recovery may miss\r\n  the mark.Â  As noted, the negligence claim must have a fault-based element,\r\n  which is not required for a strict liability claim.Â  Where one claim is\r\n  dismissed and a question arises as to the continuing viability of the companion\r\n  claim, the critical inquiry is to ascertain the basis for the dismissal.Â  If\r\n  one claim is dismissed and the basis of the dismissal rests on a common element\r\n  shared by the companion claim, the companion claim must also be dismissed.\r\nIn the present case, because the strict liability claim was\r\n  dismissed due to the absence of an element shared by the companion negligence\r\n  claim, the negligence claim should have been dismissed as well.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court determined as a matter of law that the seatbelt sleeve was not in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.Â \r\n  Consequently, the absence of this common, shared element required\r\n  the dismissal of the strict liability claim and the companion negligence\r\n  claim.[5]Â \r\n  The trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict as to the negligence\r\n  seatbelt sleeve claim.[6]Â  \r\nB.\r\n  The &quot;Handling and Stability&quot; Design Defect\r\nClaim\r\nThe &quot;handling\r\n  and stability&quot; design defect claim (strict liability and negligence) is\r\n  the gravamen of Branham's case.Â  Branham alleged a design defect related to the\r\n  rollover propensity of the Bronco.Â  Ford appeals from the denial of its motions\r\n  to dismiss the strict liability and negligence design defect claims.Â  Viewing\r\n  the evidence in a light most favorable to Branham, we find no error in the\r\n  submission of these design defect claims to the jury.Â Â Â Â  Pye v. Estate of\r\n    Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006) (stating that on appeal\r\n  from the denial of a directed verdict motion, the evidence must be viewed in a\r\n  light most favorable to the nonmovant). \r\nWe\r\n  begin with an overview of the technical information involved in the design\r\n  defect claims.Â  Ford uses the term &quot;stability index&quot; to describe the\r\n  overall stability of a vehicle.Â  The stability index is a comparison of the\r\n  height and width of the vehicle, expressed in a numerical term.Â  A closely\r\n  connected term is the center of gravity.Â  A vehicle's center of gravity relates\r\n  to what one usually thinks of as &quot;top heavy&quot; or &quot;stable.&quot;Â \r\n  The lower the center of gravity in a vehicle, the more stable it is.Â \r\n  Conversely, the higher the center of gravity (top heavy), the less stable the\r\n  vehicle is.Â  \r\nThe stability of a\r\n  vehicle is related in part to its suspension.Â  According to Branham's expert,\r\n  Dr. Melvin Richardson, a vehicle with a stable suspension is able to make a\r\n  turn in the road, and &quot;as the vehicle goes around the curve, it leans over\r\n  some and . . . the tires stay the same distance apart where they touch the\r\n  ground.&quot;Â  A vehicle with an unstable suspension will cause the tires to &quot;scrub&quot;\r\n  the ground during a turn, which &quot;cuts down friction, [and] increases tire\r\n  wear,&quot; causing the vehicle to handle poorly.Â  When a vehicle is turning\r\n  and the tires begin to scrub, &quot;you lose some of [the tire's] capabilities\r\n  to keep the vehicle going in the right direction and lose some of the ability\r\n  to control the vehicle.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nFord\r\n  primarily employed two engineering tests as a means of determining whether the\r\n  Bronco II was ready for manufacturing.Â  The first test is called a &quot;J&quot;\r\n  turn.Â  In this test, as described by Dr. Richardson, the vehicle is driven down\r\n  a roadway, and &quot;as quickly as possible the driver turns [the wheel to a]\r\n  predetermined angle and just holds it there&quot; for the remainder of the\r\n  turn.\r\nThe\r\n  second test is called an accident avoidance maneuver test.Â Â  This is where the\r\n  vehicle is turned in an abrupt fashion one way, like in the &quot;J&quot; turn,\r\n  but with the added maneuver of an immediate turn back in the opposite\r\n  direction.Â  With these engineering concepts in mind, we turn to the design\r\n  defect evidence presented. \r\nThomas\r\n  Feaheny, a former vice president at Ford, testified for Branham.Â  Feaheny\r\n  described the marketing forces and engineering insights that led to the\r\n  development of the Bronco II.Â Â  The genesis of the Bronco II spawned from the\r\n  YUMA Program, which came into being in the late 1970s.Â  YUMA was Ford's code\r\n  name for the study of small trucks, which eventually resulted in the Ford\r\n  Ranger, and later the Bronco II.Â  The YUMA prototypes initially had a\r\n  MacPherson front suspension, which, according to Feaheny, is a &quot;type of\r\n  independent front suspension that is used on a lot of small cars and trucks.&quot;Â \r\n  Ford's engineers requested the MacPherson front suspension for the Bronco II\r\n  when communicating with management on how best to address the Bronco II's\r\n  handling and stability concerns raised during the prototype stage.Â  \r\nFeaheny opined that\r\n  the MacPherson strut was the &quot;best, most feasible suspension from a\r\n  functional standpoint and also from a cost and weight standpoint.&quot; Â However,\r\n  there was a divergence in viewpoints between corporate executives and\r\n  engineers, as Ford's engineers advocated the use of the MacPherson strut for\r\n  the small truck program.Â  Since the mid-1960s Ford had employed a Twin I-Beam\r\n  suspension on its bigger trucks.Â  Feaheny testified that &quot;there was a\r\n  belief that [Ford] should adapt [the] Twin I-Beam suspension to the new small\r\n  trucks.&quot;Â  \r\nThe engineers at\r\n  Ford believed the MacPherson suspension the better choice and &quot;opposed\r\n  [the Twin I-Beam suspension] because it was directionally wrong from the\r\n  standpoint of steering, handling and rollover propensity and other\r\n  characteristics.&quot;Â  Because the Twin I-Beam suspension was physically\r\n  larger than the MacPherson suspension, using it required the entire vehicle to\r\n  be lifted higher.Â  This had a cascading effect on the composite makeup of the\r\n  vehicle, which detrimentally moved the center of gravity higher off the\r\n  ground.Â  To make room for the Twin I-Beam suspension, the engine had to be\r\n  raised &quot;two to three&quot; inches.Â  With the engine raised a few inches,\r\n  the transmission had to be raised, which caused the hood to be raised, which\r\n  then caused the seating to be raised.Â  The net effect of this was a higher\r\n  center of gravity, &quot;which add[ed] a rollover propensity.&quot;Â  \r\nFeaheny also noted\r\n  that the Twin I-Beam had a tendency for &quot;jacking.&quot;Â  Feaheny stated\r\n  that jacking is a term used to describe an occurrence when the &quot;vehicle\r\n  will slide out in a severe handling maneuver.Â  The outboard wheel would tend to\r\n  dig into . . . the suspension arm, which was strong and stiff, [and it] would\r\n  have to move with that wheel and the inner pivot would go up in the air.&quot;Â \r\n  When a vehicle jacks, there is an instantaneous raising of the center of\r\n  gravity, which further &quot;increase[s] the propensity for rollover.&quot;Â  \r\nUse of the Twin\r\n  I-Beam and its attendant safety concerns came to a head in the late 1970s.Â  A\r\n  group of engineers approached Feaheny and recommended that Ford use either the\r\n  MacPherson suspension or the SLA (short long arm) suspension for the YUMA\r\n  prototypes.Â  The engineers made it clear that they were &quot;very concerned&quot;\r\n  with the Twin I-Beam.Â  Feaheny directed the engineers to one of his colleagues,\r\n  Jim Capalongo, and Feaheny later met with Capalongo to discuss the engineers'\r\n  concerns.Â  After this meeting, alternative suspension designs were discussed\r\n  and tested for &quot;about a year&quot; but the Twin I-Beam was still selected.\r\nThe\r\n  reason the Twin I-Beam was selected in the face of engineering concerns was\r\n  that it served a &quot;major marketing advantage,&quot; as Ford had promoted\r\n  this form of suspension on its full size trucks since the mid-1960s.Â  In the\r\n  minds of the marketing executives, the Twin I-Beam was part and parcel of a\r\n  tough truck, and it made business sense to carry that suspension into the smaller\r\n  trucks.Â  \r\nThe testimony of\r\n  Dr. Richardson buttressed the evidence supplied by Feaheny and Ford's internal\r\n  documents.Â  Dr. Richardson opined that the use of the Twin I-Beam suspension\r\n  led to the Bronco II being unreasonably dangerous.Â  Dr. Richardson described\r\n  three common suspension systems referenced above:Â  (1) the SLA; (2) the\r\n  MacPherson; and (3) the Twin I-Beam.Â  It was through Dr. Richardson that\r\n  Branham introduced many of Ford's internal documents showing the competing\r\n  concerns and interests of the engineers and management over the proper\r\n  suspension.\r\nThe Bronco II was\r\n  designed from the existing &quot;bones&quot; of the Ford Ranger.Â  Dr.\r\n  Richardson opined that using the Ranger as the design platform was an\r\n  appropriate engineering decision, and that it gave Ford the advantage of using\r\n  components that had already been made.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Richardson testified to a Ford document dated February 5, 1981, and titled &quot;Revised\r\n  Stability Index for Utility.&quot;Â  The stated objective of the document was to\r\n  &quot;review alternatives to increase stability index.&quot;Â  Reading from the\r\n  document, he stated that, &quot;a study of methods to improve the stability\r\n  index for the Bronco II has resulted in several design alternatives to achieve\r\n  an improvement . . . from 1.85 to maximum achievable of 2.25 without a totally\r\n  new concept vehicle.&quot;Â  \r\nThe document made a\r\n  general assessment about improving the stability index.Â  &quot;In order to\r\n  improve stability index substantially, the following are required: widen track\r\n  width, and lower center of gravity achieved by raising the wheel center lines\r\n  with respect to body with trade-offs in ground clearance and vehicle package.&quot;Â \r\n  The document also made five proposals to achieve a higher stability index.Â  The\r\n  first two proposals did not jeopardize the target release date for the Bronco\r\n  II, but the latter three did.Â  Only one of the proposals would have achieved a\r\n  stability index of 2.25 for the Bronco II, but it was not selected.\r\nFord\r\n  selected what is referred to as &quot;proposal two,&quot; and it had a target\r\n  stability index of 2.02.Â  Dr. Richardson pointed out that proposal two saved\r\n  Ford money.Â  None of the proposals on this document argued for a change in the\r\n  suspension system.Â  But Dr. Richardson opined that had Ford opted to use an SLA\r\n  or a MacPherson suspension system, then it could have achieved a stability\r\n  index of 2.25.Â  At that point, however, Ford had already decided to employ the\r\n  Twin I-Beam suspension notwithstanding its engineers' criticisms.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Richardson testified to Plaintiff's exhibit 31, dated March 17, 1982, which\r\n  discussed &quot;J&quot; turn testing for the Bronco II.Â  In relevant part, the\r\n  document stated the following:\r\n\r\n  Engineering sign-off for the Bronco II is scheduled\r\n    for 7/9/82.Â  Minimal development DVP&amp;R[7] testing has been completed because the suspension and steering system designs\r\n    have not been finalized for improved roll characteristics during the &quot;J&quot;\r\n    turn maneuver.\r\n  A decision is required to solidify the steering and\r\n    suspension designs.Â  Development recommends pursuing items 1, 2, and 3 below if\r\n    a small improvement in roll characteristics during a &quot;J&quot; turn\r\n    maneuver is deemed acceptable, or pursuing item 4 below if a major improvement is required.Â  Incorporation of item 4 would most likely cause a\r\n    delay in Job #1 [the release date of the Bronco II].\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  Dr.\r\n  Richardson testified that to his knowledge none of the recommendations set out\r\n  in the document were adopted.Â  \r\nDr. Richardson\r\n  testified to a Ford document dated May 4, 1982.Â  The document identified the\r\n  current stability index of the Bronco II at 2.03.Â  Dr. Richardson noted that\r\n  any change to the Bronco II after the date of this document &quot;had to be\r\n  very small if [Ford] w[as] going to still put [the Bronco II] on the market in\r\n  the beginning of [1983].&quot;Â  He went on to testify that in the state the\r\n  Bronco II was then in, with a stability index of 2.03 the vehicle would be &quot;dangerously\r\n  unstable.&quot;Â  \r\nBranham introduced\r\n  a Ford document from September 14, 1982, with the following stated purpose:Â  &quot;To\r\n  identify advanced engineering projects that will be undertaken to provide for\r\n  continued improvement, Bronco II handling, during its cycle life.&quot;Â  Dr.\r\n  Richardson responded to the document as follows:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    vehicle should have been made reasonably safe when it was first designed and\r\n    built.Â  There was time to do that, the discussions in the engineering\r\n    documents, to me as an engineer, show me that the engineers knew how to do\r\n    that, could have done it, and that should have been done.Â  To release it\r\n    without it being reasonably safe then subjects those people who buy it to\r\n    risk.Â  Now, if it is released in that configuration, it certainly should be improved\r\n    as time goes along because it shouldn't be left that way.\r\n\r\nFollowing up on his expert's\r\n  opinion, Branham asked whether improvements were ever made to correct the\r\n  problems in the Bronco II when it was released.Â  Dr. Richardson responded, &quot;there\r\n  were no improvements made that would correct this defect.&quot;\r\nThe rollover\r\n  propensity in the Bronco II 4x4, as reflected in the stability index and\r\n  elevated center of gravity, was increased in the Bronco II 4x2.Â  The two-wheel\r\n  drive Bronco was lighter than its four-wheel version, resulting in reduced\r\n  stability and an even higher center of gravity.Â  The Bronco II involved in this\r\n  litigation is a 4x2.\r\nThe\r\n  foregoing is not an exhaustive review of the evidence presented by Branham, but\r\n  it serves to support the able trial judge's determination that Branham\r\n  presented sufficient evidence of a design defect known to Ford at or prior to\r\n  the date of manufacture to withstand a directed verdict motion.Â  We make this\r\n  determination without having to rely on the further body of evidence of the\r\n  Bronco II's rollover tendencies found in the substantial post-distribution\r\n  evidence which the trial court allowed.[8]\r\nC.\r\nWe next\r\n  address Ford's two-fold argument that: (1) Branham failed to prove a reasonable\r\n  alternative design pursuant to the risk-utility test; and (2) South Carolina law\r\n  requires a risk-utility test in design defect cases to the exclusion of the\r\n  consumer expectations test.\r\nFor a plaintiff to successfully advance a design\r\n  defect claim, he must show that the design of the product caused it to be &quot;unreasonably\r\n  dangerous.&quot;Â  Madden v. Cox, 284 S.C. 574, 579-80, 328 S.E.2d 108,\r\n  112 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  In South Carolina, we have traditionally employed two\r\n  tests to determine whether a product was unreasonably dangerous as a result of\r\n  a design defect: (1) the consumer expectations test and (2) the risk-utility\r\n  test.\r\nIn Claytor\r\n  v. General Motors Corp., this Court phrased the consumer expectations test\r\n  as follows: &quot;The test of whether a product is or is not defective is\r\n  whether the product is unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user given the\r\n  conditions and circumstances that foreseeably attend use of the product.&quot;Â \r\n  277 S.C. 259, 262, 286 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1982).Â  \r\nThe Claytor Court articulated the risk-utility test in the following manner: &quot;[N]umerous\r\n  factors must be considered [when determining whether a product is unreasonably\r\n  dangerous], including the usefulness and desirability of the product, the cost\r\n  involved for added safety, the likelihood and potential seriousness of injury,\r\n  and the obviousness of danger.&quot;Â  Id. at 265, 286 S.E.2d at 132.\r\nLater,\r\n  in Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., our court of appeals phrased the\r\n  risk-utility test as follows: &quot;[A] product is unreasonably dangerous and\r\n  defective if the danger associated with the use of the product outweighs the\r\n  utility of the product.&quot;Â  319 S.C. 531, 543, 462 S.E.2d 321, 328 (Ct. App.\r\n  1995).Â  The Bragg court went on to list the above factors set forth in Claytor as the relevant inquiry when weighing the danger of the product versus its\r\n  utility.Â  Id. at 543-44, 462 S.E.2d at 328.\r\nFord\r\n  contends Branham failed to present evidence of a feasible alternative design.Â \r\n  Implicit in Ford's argument is the contention that a product may only be shown\r\n  to be defective and unreasonably dangerous by way of a risk-utility test, for\r\n  by its very nature, the risk-utility test requires a showing of a reasonable\r\n  alternative design.[9]Â  Branham counters, arguing that under Claytor he may prove\r\n  a design defect by resort to the consumer expectations test or the risk-utility\r\n  test.Â  Branham also argues that regardless of which test is required, he has\r\n  met both, including evidence of a feasible alternative design.Â  We agree with\r\n  Branham's contention that he produced evidence of a feasible alternative\r\n  design.Â  Branham additionally points out that the jury was charged on the\r\n  consumer expectations test and the risk-utility test.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  discussed above, Branham challenged the design of the Ford Bronco II by\r\n  pointing to the MacPherson suspension as a reasonable alternative design.Â  A\r\n  former Ford vice president, Thomas Feaheny, testified that the MacPherson\r\n  suspension system would have significantly increased the handling and stability\r\n  of the Bronco II, making it less prone to rollovers.Â  Branham's expert, Dr.\r\n  Richardson, also noted that the MacPherson suspension system would have\r\n  enhanced vehicle stability by lowering the vehicle center of gravity.Â  There\r\n  was further evidence that the desired sport utility features of the Bronco II\r\n  would not have been compromised by using the MacPherson suspension.Â  Moreover,\r\n  there is evidence that use of the MacPherson suspension would not have\r\n  increased costs.Â  Whether this evidence satisfies the risk-utility test is ultimately\r\n  a jury question.Â  But it is evidence of a feasible alternative design,\r\n  sufficient to survive a directed verdict motion.Â  \r\nWhile the consumer\r\n  expectations test fits well in manufacturing defect cases, we do agree with\r\n  Ford that the test is ill-suited in design defect cases.Â  We hold today that\r\n  the exclusive test in a products liability design case is the risk-utility test\r\n  with its requirement of showing a feasible alternative design.Â  In doing so, we\r\n  recognize our Legislature's presence in the area of strict liability for\r\n  products liability.\r\nIn\r\n  1974, our Legislature adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 402A\r\n  (1965), and identified its comments as legislative intent.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  15-73-10-30 (2005).Â  The comments in section 402A are pointed to as the basis\r\n  for the consumer expectations test.[10]Â  Since the adoption of section 402A, the American Law Institute\r\n  published the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability (1998).Â \r\n  The third edition effectively moved away from the consumer expectations test\r\n  for design defects, and towards a risk-utility test.Â  We believe the\r\n  Legislature's foresight in looking to the American Law Institute for guidance\r\n  in this area is instructive.\r\nThe Legislature\r\n  has expressed no intention to foreclose court consideration of developments in\r\n  products liability law.Â  For example, this Court's approval of the risk-utility\r\n  test in Claytor yielded no legislative response.Â  We thus believe the\r\n  adoption of the risk-utility test in design defect cases in no manner infringes\r\n  on the Legislature's presence in this area.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSome form of a\r\n  risk-utility test is employed by an overwhelming majority of the jurisdictions\r\n  in this country.[11]Â  Some of these jurisdictions exclusively employ a risk-utility\r\n  test,[12] while others do so with a hybrid of the risk-utility and the\r\n  consumer expectations test, or an explicit either-or option.[13]Â  States that exclusively employ the consumer expectations test\r\n  are a decided minority.[14]Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe that in design defect cases the risk-utility test provides the best\r\n  means for analyzing whether a product is designed defectively.Â  Unlike the\r\n  consumer expectations test, the focus of a risk-utility test centers upon the\r\n  alleged defectively designed product.Â  The risk-utility test provides objective\r\n  factors for a trier of fact to analyze when presented with a challenge to a\r\n  manufacturer's design.Â  Conversely, we find the consumer expectations test and\r\n  its focus on the consumer ill-suited to determine whether a product's design is\r\n  unreasonably dangerous.[15]\r\nWe believe the\r\n  rule we announce today in design defect cases adheres to the approach the trial\r\n  and appellate courts in this state have been following.Â  In reported design\r\n  defect cases, our trial and appellate courts have placed their imprimatur on\r\n  the importance of showing a feasible alternative design.Â  See Claytor\r\n    v. Gen. Motors Corp., 277 S.C. 259, 265, 286 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1982)\r\n  (adopting the risk-utility test); Kennedy v. Custom Ice Equip. Co., 271\r\n  S.C. 171, 176, 246 S.E.2d 176, 178 (1978) (affirming verdict in favor of\r\n  plaintiff by noting that plaintiff presented evidence of a design alternative); Mickle v. Blackmon, 252 S.C. 202, 234-35, 166 S.E.2d 173, 187-88 (1969)\r\n  (discussing a manufacturer's decision to use one type of inferior material as a\r\n  component part one year, but a superior material the following yearâ€”that is, a\r\n  design alternative); Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 546, 462\r\n  S.E.2d 321, 330 (Ct. App. 1995) (affirming defense verdict and noting that\r\n  plaintiff failed to present evidence of a feasible alternative design); Sunvillas\r\n    Homeowners Ass'n v. Square D Co., 301 S.C. 330, 334, 391 S.E.2d 868, 870\r\n  (Ct. App. 1990) (affirming a defense directed verdict and noting that plaintiff's\r\n  expert failed to discuss design alternatives); Gasque v. Heublein, Inc.,\r\n  281 S.C. 278, 283, 315 S.E.2d 556, 559 (Ct. App. 1984) (affirming a plaintiff's\r\n  verdict and noting in detail existence of alternative design evidence).\r\nIn Kennedy v.\r\n  Custom Ice Equipment Co., this Court specifically pointed to evidence that\r\n  the challenged industrial ice machine would have been safer had the\r\n  manufacturer installed a protective cover.Â  271 S.C. at 176, 246 S.E.2d at\r\n  178.Â  In Gasque v. Heublein, Inc., our court of appeals acknowledged the\r\n  importance of a reasonable alternative design in a product liability design\r\n  defect case wherein it noted evidence of alternative designs in an opinion\r\n  affirming an award for the plaintiff.Â  281 S.C. at 283, 315 S.E.2d at 559.Â  In like\r\n  manner is the case of Sunvillas Homeowners Ass'n v. Square D Co., where\r\n  the court of appeals upheld a directed verdict in favor of a manufacturer,\r\n  noting that plaintiffs did not produce any evidence of design alternatives.Â \r\n  301 S.C. at 334, 391 S.E.2d at 870.Â  And more recently, in Bragg, our\r\n  court of appeals again noted the absence of alternative design evidence in\r\n  affirming a defense verdict.Â  319 S.C. at 546, 391 S.E.2d at 330.Â  The very nature of feasible alternative design\r\n  evidence entails the manufacturer's decision to employ one design over\r\n  another.Â  This weighing of costs and benefits attendant to that decision is the\r\n  essence of the risk-utility test.Â  \r\nThis approach is\r\n  in accord with the current edition of the Restatement of Torts:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    product . . . is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed\r\n    by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a\r\n    reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a\r\n    predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the\r\n    alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.\r\n\r\nRestatement\r\n  (Third) of Torts: Products Liability Â§\r\n  2(b) (1998).Â  Concerning the framework for the risk-utility test, we agree with\r\n  Professor David G. Owen, who observed:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    basic liability test should be congruent with the basic issue that in most\r\n    cases must be proved.Â  In design defect litigation, that basic issue involves\r\n    the following fundamental . . . question:Â  whether the manufacturer's failure\r\n    to adopt a particular design feature proposed by the plaintiff was, on balance,\r\n    right or wrong.Â  A congruence between this central issue and the liability test\r\n    requires that the test focus squarely on the issue of what, in particular,\r\n    allegedly was wrong with the manufacturer's design decision.Â  More\r\n    specifically, this inquiry asks whether the increased costs (lost dollars, lost\r\n    utility, and lost safety) of altering the designâ€”in the particular manner the\r\n    plaintiff claims was reasonably necessary to the product's safetyâ€”would have\r\n    been worth the resulting safety benefits.Â  \r\n\r\nDavid G. Owen, Toward a\r\n  Proper Test for Design Defectiveness: &quot;Micro-Balancing&quot; Costs and\r\n  Benefits, 75 Tex. L. Rev.\r\n  1661, 1687 (1997).Â  \r\nIn every design\r\n  defect case the central recurring fact will be a product that failed causing\r\n  damage to a person or his property.Â  Consequently, the focus will be whether\r\n  the product was made safe enough.Â  This inquiry is the core of the risk-utility\r\n  balancing test in design defect cases, yet we do not suggest a jury question is\r\n  created merely because a product can be made safer.Â  We adhere to our\r\n  longstanding approval of the principle that a product is not in a defective\r\n  condition unreasonably dangerous merely because it &quot;can be made more safe.&quot;Â \r\n  As we observed in Marchant v. Mitchell Distributing Co.:\r\n\r\n  Most\r\n    any product can be made more safe. Automobiles would be more safe with disc\r\n    brakes and steel-belted radial tires than with ordinary brakes and ordinary\r\n    tires, but this does not mean that an automobile dealer would be held to have\r\n    sold a defective product merely because the most safe equipment is not\r\n    installed.Â  By a like token, a bicycle is more safe if equipped with lights and\r\n    a bell, but the fact that one is not so equipped does not create the inference\r\n    that the bicycle is defective and unreasonably dangerous. \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n  . . . \r\n\r\n  There\r\n    is, of course, some danger incident to the use of any product.\r\n\r\n270 S.C. 29, 35-36, 36, 240\r\n  S.E.2d 511, 513, 514 (1977).\r\nIn\r\n  sum, in a product liability design defect action, the plaintiff must present\r\n  evidence of a reasonable alternative design.Â  The plaintiff will be required to\r\n  point to a design flaw in the product and show how his alternative design would\r\n  have prevented the product from being unreasonably dangerous.Â  This\r\n  presentation of an alternative design must include consideration of the costs,\r\n  safety and functionality associated with the alternative design.[16]Â  On retrial, Branham's design defect claim will proceed pursuant\r\n  to the risk-utility test and not the consumer expectations test.\r\nIII.\r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the existence of ample evidence to withstand a directed verdict motion on the\r\n  handling and stability design defect claim, we reverse and remand for a new\r\n  trial.Â  There are three reasons we reverse and remand the finding of liability\r\n  and award of actual damages.Â  First, this case implicates two evidentiary rules\r\n  related to products liability cases.Â  The first rule provides that whether a\r\n  product is defective must be measured against information known at the time the\r\n  product was placed into the stream of commerce.Â  When a claim is asserted\r\n  against a manufacturer, post-manufacture evidence is generally not admissible.Â \r\n  The second rule provides that evidence of similar incidents is admissible where\r\n  there is a substantial similarity between the other incidents and the accident\r\n  in dispute tending to prove or disprove some fact in controversy. Â Evidence was\r\n  introduced that violated both of these rules.Â  Third, Branham's closing\r\n  argument was a direct appeal to the passion and prejudice of the jury.Â  And\r\n  although not a standalone ground for reversal, we find that because Ford and\r\n  Hale were joint tortfeasors, it was error to require the jury to apportion\r\n  responsibility between the defendants.Â Â Â Â  \r\nA.\r\nPost-distribution evidence\r\nIn order for a plaintiff to prove his case in a product liability\r\n  action, he must show that the &quot;product was in a defective condition at the\r\n  time that it left the hands of the particular seller . . . and unless evidence\r\n  can be produced which will support the conclusion that it was then defective, the burden is not sustained.&quot;Â  Claytor v.

(1998) (&quot;[F]or the liability system\r\n  to be fair and efficient, the balancing of risks and benefits in judging\r\n  product design . . . must be done in light of the knowledge of risks and\r\n  risk-avoidance techniques reasonably attainable at the time of distribution.&quot;).Â \r\n  Because the claim here is against the manufacturer, the &quot;time of\r\n  distribution&quot; is the time of manufacture.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  we find Branham presented sufficient evidence to create a jury question on his\r\n  design defect claim, we further find Ford was prejudiced by Branham's\r\n  unrelenting pursuit of post-distribution evidence on the issue of liability.Â \r\n  Given the extent of the improper post-distribution evidence introduced, the\r\n  error cannot be considered harmless.Â  \r\nWe first clarify what is post-distribution evidence.Â  Simply\r\n  defined, post-distribution evidence is evidence of facts neither known nor\r\n  available at the time of distribution.Â Â  When assessing liability in a design\r\n  defect claim against a manufacturer, the judgment and ultimate decision of the\r\n  manufacturer must be evaluated based on what was known or &quot;reasonably\r\n  attainable&quot; at the time of manufacture.[17]Â  See Restatement (Third) of Torts:\r\n  Products Liability Â§ 2, cmt. a. (1998).Â \r\n  The use of post-distribution evidence to evaluate a\r\n  product's design through the lens of hindsight is improper.Â  See Gregory v.\r\n    Cincinnati, Inc., 538 N.W.2d 325, 326 (Mich. 1995) (&quot;Evidence of\r\n  conduct after the date of manufacture improperly shifts the focus from the\r\n  premanufacturing decision and has the potential to taint any finding of\r\n  liability.&quot;).Â  \r\nHale's Ford Bronco II 4x2 was manufactured in 1986.Â  The following\r\n  is a sampling of the post-manufacture (or post-distribution) evidence.\r\nBranham introduced a memorandum dated April 14, 1989, dealing with\r\n  a meeting that three Ford engineers had with &quot;six people from Consumers\r\n  Report.&quot;Â  The memorandum stated that:\r\n\r\n  Our objective was to &quot;give it our\r\n    best shot&quot; at diffusing a very negative story on the Bronco II in the June\r\n    issue . . . .Â  The magazine has done a comparative test of the Chevy S-10\r\n    Blazer, Geo Tracker, Dodge Raider and Bronco II.Â  As the result of several\r\n    calls from a Consumer Report writer, we were led to believe that the story\r\n    could be nearly as negative as last summer's Suzuki Samurai story.Â  Plus, NHTSA\r\n    is currently conducting an engineering analysis of the Bronco II which creates\r\n    a negative cloud.Â  And, FARS [Fatal Analysis Reporting System] data shows\r\n    Bronco II to have a higher fatal rollover rate relative to certain competitors.Â \r\n\r\n  The memorandum went on to note the following: &quot;Our data are not terribly\r\n    favorable.Â  Our rollover rate is three times higher than the Chevy S-10 Blazer.&quot;Â \r\n  This evidence of the Bronco II's rollover rate is post-manufacture evidence.\r\nLater in the same 1989 memorandum, as the engineers discuss how\r\n  they thought they did, this comment is made:Â  &quot;We think, however, that we\r\n  have clouded their minds, loosened some conclusions they may have reached prior\r\n  to our meeting and sent them off to search for additional information that\r\n  could work to our advantage.&quot;Â  The &quot;clouded their mind&quot; comment\r\n  became a mantra for Branham on the issue of liability and otherwise.\r\nThrough Branham's expert, Dr. Richardson, a 1989 film was\r\n  introduced.Â  Counsel emphasized this film, taped in 1989, comparing the S&#8209;10\r\n  Blazer and the Bronco II.Â  As reflected in Plaintiff's exhibit 54A, which is\r\n  the corresponding report to the videotape, Ford requested &quot;additional 'J'\r\n  turn tests&quot; on May 17, 1989 for various vehicles, including a 1989 Bronco\r\n  II 4x4.Â  The tape (post-manufacture evidence) revealed that the 1989 Bronco II\r\n  did not handle as well as the S-10 Blazer.Â  \r\nDr. Richardson also testified to a document, Plaintiff's exhibit\r\n  168, referencing post-manufacture evidence that compared a 1989 Bronco II\r\n  (referred to in the document as BII) to the UN46 prototype, now known as the\r\n  Ford Explorer.Â  This exhibit shows the additional evidence of the rollover\r\n  tendency of the Bronco II that came to light after 1986:\r\n\r\n  Current &quot;strategies&quot; for development of\r\n    utility vehicle stability have changed over the past few years due (sic) the\r\n    increased availability of rollover accident data and analyses.Â  Previous strategies were partially driven by the\r\n    Insurance Institute tests of the Jeep CJ7 in the early 80's which emphasized\r\n    risk from rollovers caused by extreme (rate and magnitude) steering inputs in\r\n    emergency maneuvers.Â  Independent DOT, GM and Ford studies have confirmed that\r\n    rollovers directly induced by extreme steering inputs are rare for any Utility\r\n    vehicle (including the CJ7).Â  The following quote from GM's recent SAE Paper\r\n    (Reconstruction of Rollover Collisions, SAE 890857) summarizes current wisdom.Â \r\n    &quot;A common pre-rollover maneuver is an off-road path by the car, followed\r\n    by heavy steer correction back towards the road leading to a side slide, and,\r\n    ultimately, a trip followed by the rollover.&quot; Based on this new\r\n    information, the UN46 was developed using a handling philosophy notably\r\n    different from the BII.[18]\r\n  This post-distribution exhibit concludes:\r\n  Based on an analysis of FARS accident summaries and\r\n    BII &amp; Competitive handling characteristics, it is impossible to identify\r\n    any type of vehicle &quot;defect&quot; that could explain the BII FARS\r\n    performance.Â  It is most likely that the handling strategy used during the\r\n    development of the BII, which fully exploited the vehicles (sic) inherent\r\n    quickness (due to its short wheelbase), encourages aggressive driving and makes\r\n    the vehicle more sensitive to the large steering wheel &quot;over-corrections&quot;\r\n    that seem to be part of most rollover scenarios.Â  This sensitivity is\r\n    aggravated by the fact the (sic) most operators in rollover accidents are\r\n    either inexperienced drivers, under the influence of alcohol or both.Â  The\r\n    UN46, designed with the benefit of the FARS experience for all utility\r\n    vehicles, has been intentionally developed to resolve these issues. \r\n\r\nYet another example of post-distribution evidence is found in a\r\n  March 3, 1989 memorandum addressing an accident caused while testing a\r\n  prototype anti-lock braking system (ABS) at the Dearborn Proving Grounds\r\n  (DPG).Â  The memorandum revealed that on February 28, 1989, a &quot;demonstration\r\n  was conducted on an ice pad located on the DPG East-West runway&quot; and that\r\n  the &quot;accident involved a Kelly-Wayes Company owned 1989 Bronco II with\r\n  prototype ABS.&quot;Â  The goal was to test the efficacy of the ABS system when\r\n  running partially on ice and partially on dry ground.Â  During the test\r\n  procedure the Bronco II rolled over.Â  The rollover occurred on ice.Â  \r\nThere are other examples of post-manufacture evidence, but the few\r\n  examples cited illustrate the inherent prejudice that flows from\r\n  post-distribution evidence.Â  It is good when a manufacturer continues to test\r\n  and evaluate its product after initial manufacture.Â  As additional information\r\n  is learned, changes may be made that improve product safety and function.Â  As a\r\n  matter of policy, the law should encourage the design and manufacture of safe,\r\n  functional products.Â  In holding manufacturers accountable for unreasonably\r\n  dangerous products pursuant to a fair system, products liability law serves\r\n  that goal.Â  Moreover, the law should encourage manufacturers to continue to\r\n  improve their products in terms of utility and safety free from prior design\r\n  decisions judged through the lens of hindsight.\r\nWhether the 1987 Ford Bronco II was defectively designed and in a\r\n  defective condition unreasonably dangerous must be determined as of the 1986\r\n  manufacture date of the vehicle.Â  Ford's 1986 design and manufacture decision\r\n  should be assessed on the evidence available at that time, not the increased\r\n  evidence of additional rollover data that came to light after 1986.\r\nB.\r\nOther Similar Incidents\r\nIn Whaley\r\n  v. CSX Transportation Inc., this Court recognized that similar accidents\r\n  are admissible if they &quot;tend[] to prove or disprove some fact in dispute.&quot;Â \r\n  362 S.C. 456, 483, 609 S.E.2d 286, 300 (2005).Â  The Court also recognized that\r\n  this type of evidence has the potential to be &quot;highly prejudicial.&quot;[19]Â  Id. at 483, 609 S.E.2d at 300.Â \r\n  Accordingly, it set forth a stringent standard for admissibility:Â  &quot;'[A]\r\n  plaintiff must present a factual foundation for the court to determine that the\r\n  other accidents were substantially similar to the accident at issue.'&quot;Â  Id. at 483, 609 S.E.2d at 300 (quoting Buckman v. Bombardier Corp., 893\r\n  F. Supp. 547, 552 (E.D.N.C. 1995)); see also Atkinson v. Orkin\r\n    Exterminating Co., 361 S.C. 156, 604 S.E.2d 385 (2004) (recognizing that &quot;unless\r\n  Orkin's past conduct is 'similar' to the conduct directed at the [plaintiffs],\r\n  it is inadmissible&quot;).\r\nBefore\r\n  addressing the &quot;substantially similar&quot; test, we resolve Ford's twin\r\n  challenge to the post-manufacture evidence of supposed similar incidents.Â  Even\r\n  assuming a plaintiff satisfies the Whaley &quot;substantially similar&quot;\r\n  test, such evidence must not run afoul of the rule in products liability cases\r\n  that prohibits post-distribution evidence to establish liability.Â  Whaley is instructive in this regard.\r\nWhaley was employed by CSX Transportation.Â  Whaley became ill,\r\n  allegedly due to work conditions, with heat-related symptoms first reported on\r\n  May 24, 2000.Â  Whaley introduced evidence that &quot;between 1984 and 2000, CSX\r\n  had received ninety-seven employee complaints about heat.Â  In addition, the\r\n  trial judge permitted Whaley to introduce evidence that, between 1993 and 2000,\r\n  eighteen CSX employees had suffered heat stroke.&quot;Â  Whaley, 362 S.C.\r\n  at 483, 609 S.E.2d at 300.Â  Because &quot;Whaley did not establish that the\r\n  reported complaints and injuries stemmed from the same or similar circumstances\r\n  as his injuries[,]&quot; it was error to admit the evidence.Â  Id. at\r\n  483-84, 609 S.E.2d at 300.Â  Yet Whaley never attempted to introduce evidence of\r\n  other incidents that occurred after the 2000 injury date.\r\nOn the issue of liability, Branham presented voluminous evidence\r\n  of post-manufacture rollover data.Â  The post-manufacture evidence of purported\r\n  similar incidents was error, even if the &quot;substantially similar&quot;\r\n  threshold was met.[20]Â  Post-manufacture evidence of similar\r\n  incidents is not admissible to prove liability.\r\nThis Court\r\n  recently revisited Whaley in a products liability setting, Watson v.\r\n    Ford Motor Co., Op. No. 26786 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 15, 2010)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 37).Â  In Watson, we repeated that &quot;[e]vidence\r\n  of similar accidents, transactions, or happenings is admissible in South\r\n  Carolina where there is some special relation between the accidents tending to\r\n  prove or disprove some fact in dispute.&quot;Â  Id. at 50.Â  In imposing a\r\n  burden on plaintiffs to demonstrate &quot;that the other accidents were\r\n  substantially similar to the accident at issue[,]&quot; the Court &quot;set\r\n  forth factors to support a claim that the present accident was caused by the\r\n  same defect: (1) the products are similar; (2) the alleged defect is similar;\r\n  (3) causation related to the defect in the other incidents; and (4) exclusion\r\n  of all reasonable secondary explanations for the cause of the other accidents.&quot;Â  Id. at 51 (citing Buckman v. Bombardier, 893 F. Supp. at 552).\r\nWe turn now to the evidence of pre-manufacture rollover data.Â \r\n  Branham introduced evidence of rollover accidents involving the Bronco II and\r\n  other vehicles in the same class that was known at or prior to the 1986\r\n  manufacture of Hale's Bronco II.Â  Ford claims the pre-manufacture comparative\r\n  evidence of rollover accidents violates the Whaley-Watson &quot;substantially\r\n  similar&quot; test because there was no showing that the cause of the other\r\n  accidents was similar to the cause of the rollover accident at issue.\r\nIn commenting on this evidentiary dispute, we must be careful not\r\n  to foreclose the discretion of the trial court in ruling on objections during\r\n  the course of the retrial.Â  This is especially true with &quot;other similar\r\n  incidents&quot; evidence because of its potential to be &quot;highly\r\n  prejudicial,&quot; thereby implicating Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Our discussion,\r\n  therefore, is intended as a general guideline, as we recognize a host of\r\n  factors can arise during the course of a trial that impact a trial court's\r\n  decision to admit or exclude evidence.Â  \r\nWith that caveat, on the record before us, we disagree with Ford.Â \r\n  Admittedly, a showing of comparative rollover accident rates does not establish\r\n  the manner in which any particular accident occurred.Â  But Ford misconstrues\r\n  the essence of Branham's design defect claim.Â  To the extent Branham is able to\r\n  establish (at or prior to the manufacture date of the subject vehicle) the rate\r\n  or number of rollover accidents of the Bronco II was greater as compared to\r\n  other vehicles in its class, such evidence may well be relevant on whether the\r\n  Bronco II was unreasonably dangerous.\r\nWe do agree with Ford that if the cause of an accident is known\r\n  and the cause is not substantially similar to the accident at issue, evidence\r\n  of the other accident should be excluded.Â  Yet, where the precise cause of an\r\n  accident is not known, Bronco II rollover accident data has relevance when\r\n  compared to rollover accident data of other vehicles in class.Â Â  This relevance\r\n  is linked directly to Branham's claim that the design of the Bronco II caused\r\n  it to have an unreasonably dangerous tendency to rollover.\r\nLike the trial court, we are persuaded by neither Ford's general\r\n  argument that many accidents may be attributable to inexperienced or impaired\r\n  drivers, nor its specific reference to Hale's inattention as the cause of the\r\n  June 17, 2001 accident.\r\nFirst, as referenced in a Ford document (Plaintiff's exhibit 168),\r\n  Ford recognized the tendency of the Bronco II to roll over, describing it as\r\n  driving &quot;sensitivity&quot; which is &quot;aggravated by the fact [that] most operators in rollover accidents are\r\n  either inexperienced drivers, under the influence of alcohol or both.&quot;Â \r\n  Assuming a number of rollover accidents are caused by inexperienced or impaired\r\n  drivers, there is no suggestion in this record that inexperienced or impaired\r\n  drivers disproportionately favored the Bronco II, thus skewing the comparative\r\n  rollover accident data.Â  It is inferable that rollover accidents caused by\r\n  inexperienced or impaired drivers are shared by all vehicles in the class, not\r\n  just the Bronco II.Â  While Ford's position may have appeal as a jury argument,\r\n  it is of little moment on the admissibility question in the record before us. \r\nSecond,\r\n  there may be little or no doubt as to Hale's negligence, but that misses the\r\n  point in terms of the admissibility of comparative rollover accident data.Â  A\r\n  car manufacturer must design and produce vehicles that are not in a defective\r\n  condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.Â  Cars are designed with utility\r\n  and safety in mind, and careless driving is a foreseeable reality.Â  The general\r\n  nature of the alleged negligent driving on the part of Hale was (or should have\r\n  been) part of the evaluative process that culminated in the ultimate decision\r\n  of Ford to design, manufacture and market the Bronco II to the driving public.Â \r\n  Ford had a duty to design and manufacture the Bronco II as a reasonably safe\r\n  vehicle.\r\nWe\r\n  believe our consideration of the admissibility of the pre-manufacture rollover\r\n  accident data necessarily flows from the risk-utility test for products\r\n  liability design defect cases.\r\nC.\r\nClosing Argument\r\nIt is\r\n  improper for counsel to make a &quot;closing argument to the jury . . .\r\n  calculated to arouse passion or prejudice.&quot;Â  Gathers v. Harris Teeter\r\n    Supermarket, Inc., 282 S.C. 220, 231, 317 S.E.2d 748, 755 (Ct. App. 1984).Â \r\n  The closing argument of Branham's counsel was designed to inflame and prejudice\r\n  the jury.Â  Closing argument excerpts include:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n    &quot;This is how Ford looks at\r\n  this. That little bit of thirty people being killed every year didn't matter.\r\n  Those thirty people, those thirty extra people getting killed in a year didn't\r\n  matter to them because it was just a little bitty number.&quot; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    &quot;It does matter about those\r\n  people getting killed.&nbsp; Those thirty people do count.&nbsp; Those thirty\r\n  people--that's thirty more people that got killed that year.&nbsp; If you expect\r\n  these vehicles to last about twenty years, that's six hundred more people\r\n  getting killed using this vehicle as opposed to a Chevy S-10 Blazer.&nbsp; That's\r\n  serious.&quot;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.\r\n    &quot;And that doesn't count the\r\n  paralyzed people, the quadriplegics, the people with serious injuries, the\r\n  thousands of people that have been in these events because of this rollover\r\n  propensity of this vehicle that they knew about, and they knew it since day one\r\n  but they chose profit over safety every time because they looked at it as\r\nnumbers.&nbsp; They didn't look at it as lives, as people.&quot;\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.\r\n    &quot;I submit to you that the\r\n  evidence is that they did it because they thought it was a little, small\r\n  number. . . .&nbsp; [T]hey did not look at it as thirty lives a year[], they didn't\r\n  look at it as six hundred lives.&nbsp; That's how they should have looked at it, but\r\n  that was not how they did it.&quot;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5.\r\n    &quot;They got together at the\r\n  highest levels of Ford Motor Company and they made a judgment that rather than\r\n  delaying and improving the Bronco II, they were going to sell the vehicle as it\r\n  was and that they were going to risk people's lives and they were going to risk\r\n  serious injuries like we have here today.&nbsp; They were going to risk people's\r\n  brains.&quot;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    6.&nbsp;\r\n    &quot;Jesse Branham is here today\r\n  with a brain injury and six hundred other people, or however many it is, lost\r\n  their lives, and numerous others have brain injuries or are paralyzed,\r\n  quadriplegic, have extremely serious injuries.&nbsp; We believe that you should tell\r\n  Ford Motor Company what you think about this kind of thing.&quot; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is unmistakable that the closing argument relied\r\n  heavily on inadmissible evidence.Â  In addition, as will be discussed below,\r\n  much of the prejudice resulting from the improper evidence was merged in\r\n  closing argument with Branham's pursuit of punitive damages in requesting that\r\n  the jury punish Ford for harm to Branham and others.Â  The closing\r\n  argument invited the jury to base its verdict on passion rather than reason.Â \r\n  The closing argument denied Ford a fair trial.Â  Scoggins v. McClellion,\r\n  321 S.C. 264, 269, 468 S.E.2d 12, 15 (Ct. App. 1996) (&quot;The test for\r\n  granting a new trial on the basis of improper closing argument by opposing\r\n  counsel is whether the complaining party was prejudiced to the extent that he\r\nor she was denied a fair trial.&quot;).\r\nD.\r\nThe Verdict Form\r\nOver Ford's objection, the trial court required the jury to\r\n  apportion liability between Ford and Hale.Â  This was error.Â  S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 303, 641 S.E.2d 903,\r\n  907-08 (2007) (&quot;[A] special verdict question may be so defective in its\r\n  formulation that its submission results in a prejudicial effect which\r\n  constitutes reversible error.&quot;).Â  Whether Ford was prejudiced by the\r\n  improper verdict form is speculation, but we address the issue in light of the\r\n  remand for a new trial.\r\nFord and Hale were alleged joint tortfeasors.Â  The accident\r\n  occurred in 2001.Â  In 2001, multiple tortfeasors were jointly and severally\r\n  responsible for all damages.Â  Concerning a plaintiff's ability to collect on a\r\n  judgment, there could be no apportionment of fault among joint tortfeasors.[21]Â  The trial court used a verdict form that\r\n  is standard in comparative negligence cases where a defendant alleges the\r\n  plaintiff's own negligence caused the accident and resulting injuries.Â \r\n  Question five of the verdict form asked the following:\r\n\r\n  Taking the combined negligence that proximately caused the parties'\r\n    injuries as one hundred percent (100%), what percentage of that negligence is\r\n    attributable to Defendant Ford Motor Company and what percentage is\r\n    attributable to the Defendant Cheryl Jane Hale?\r\n\r\nThe jury apportioned fault 55% Ford and 45% Hale.Â  Allocating\r\n  fault between Ford and Hale served no legitimate purpose.Â  Our comparative\r\n  system for allocating liability between a plaintiff and a defendant is in no manner implicated where\r\n  fault lies, if at all, among multiple defendants. Since the Nelson v.\r\n    Concrete Supply[22] decision adopting comparative negligence\r\n  (between a plaintiff and a defendant), this Court has reaffirmed the\r\n  applicability of joint and several liability among joint tortfeasors.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 48, 492 S.E.2d 55,\r\n  61 (1997); Am. Fed. Bank, FSB v. No. One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C.\r\n  169, 175-76, 467 S.E.2d 439, 443 (1996); see also Fernanders v. Marks\r\n    Constr. of S.C., Inc., 330 S.C. 470, 478, 499 S.E.2d 509, 513 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court justified the apportionment question on the basis of a need to\r\n  ensure that any punitive damage award was supported by a negligence cause of\r\n  action, and not the strict liability claim.Â  The trial court's reasoning is not persuasive.Â  If there were genuine\r\n  concern regarding the basis of a plaintiff's verdict, the easy solution was a\r\n  verdict form tailored to that concern, just as Ford requested.\r\nA\r\n  detailed verdict form would have specified whether a finding of negligence\r\n  against Ford was based on the seatbelt sleeve claim or the design defect claim,\r\n  or both.Â  A proper verdict form would have avoided the confusion caused by\r\n  having the jury apportion blame between jointly and severally liable\r\n  defendants.Â  More to the point, Ford's requested special verdict form would\r\n  have avoided the very real risk that the jury (unaware of joint and several\r\n  liability principles) would take the cue from the apportionment question and\r\n  inflate the actual damage award to ensure Branham received a full recovery from\r\n  the one deep-pocket defendant.Â  The actual damage award causes genuine concern\r\n  as to the effect on the jury of the improper verdict form. \r\nIV.\r\nFord\r\n  challenges the jury's award of $16,000,000 actual damages and $15,000,000\r\n  punitive damages.Â  Because of our directive for a new trial, we decline to\r\n  address Ford's contentions that these awards are excessive. \r\nA.\r\nActual Damages\r\nFord\r\n  contends the $16,000,000 actual damage award is grossly excessive.Â  &quot;When\r\n  a verdict is 'grossly excessive and the amount awarded is so shockingly\r\n  disproportionate to the injuries as to indicate that the jury acted out of\r\n  passion, caprice, prejudice, or other consideration not founded on the\r\n  evidence, it becomes the duty of this Court, as well as the trial court, to set\r\n  aside the verdict.'&quot;Â  Sanders v. Prince, 304 S.C. 236, 238, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 640, 642 (1991) (quoting Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C.\r\n  481, 487, 357 S.E.2d 452, 455 (1987)).Â  In light of the remand for a new trial,\r\n  it is unnecessary to resolve Ford's claim that the actual damage award is\r\n  grossly excessive.\r\nB.\r\nPunitive damages\r\nThe\r\n  issue of punitive damages was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Ford, however, contends that the $15,000,000 punitive\r\n  damage award cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.Â  We agree.Â  Because of\r\n  the necessity of a new trial, we address two issues: Branham's reliance on &quot;harm\r\n  to others&quot; and the evidence of compensation of Ford's executives.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  pervasive prejudice resulting from the improper post-manufacture evidence on\r\n  the issue of liability was compounded in Branham's pursuit of punitive\r\n  damages.Â  Perhaps the manifestation of this error is most easily seen in\r\n  counsel's request that the jury punish Ford for harming others beyond Branham.Â  See Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 653, 602 S.E.2d 760, 767\r\n  (2004) (reversing an award of punitive damages because the trial court allowed\r\n  the jury to &quot;punish&quot; the defendant for a &quot;bad act unrelated&quot;\r\n  to the defendant's action toward the plaintiff); see also Philip Morris USA\r\n    v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 350, 353 (2007) (reversing a punitive damages award\r\n  where plaintiff's counsel asked the jury to &quot;think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the State of Oregon\r\n  there have been,&quot; and holding that &quot;the Constitution's Due\r\n  Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive damages award to punish a\r\n  defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they\r\n  directly represent, i.e., injury that it inflicts upon those who are,\r\n  essentially, strangers to the litigation&quot;).\r\nAs\r\n  outlined above, punishing Ford in this case for harming all Bronco II rollover\r\n  victims was a central theme in counsel's closing argument.[23]Â \r\n  The trial court charged the jury not to punish Ford for other &quot;conduct.&quot;Â \r\n  The charge violated the &quot;harm to others&quot; prohibition set forth in Durham\r\n    v. Vinson and Philip Morris USA v. Williams.Â  By focusing on\r\n  conduct, as opposed to harm to Branham, the charge invited the jury to punish\r\n  Ford for all Bronco rollover deaths and injuriesâ€”the very harm Durham and Philip Morris forbid.Â  \r\nWe next examine the admission of financial data\r\n  regarding Ford.Â  Unless the United States Supreme Court holds otherwise under\r\n  the Due Process Clause, we adhere to South Carolina law that &quot;the wealth\r\n  of a defendant is a relevant factor in assessing punitive damages.&quot;Â  Welch\r\n    v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 307, 536 S.E.2d 408, 423 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  This\r\n  is frequently described as the &quot;ability to pay&quot; factor.Â  But this\r\n  factor is not without boundaries. &quot;Punitive damages pose an acute danger\r\n  of arbitrary deprivation of property.Â  Jury instructions typically leave the\r\n  jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence\r\n  of a defendant's net worth creates the potential that juries will use their\r\n  verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without\r\n  strong local presences.&quot;Â  Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U.S. 415,\r\n  432 (1994); see also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538\r\n  U.S. 408, 427 (2003) (&quot;[R]eference to [the defendant's] assets . . . ha[s]\r\n  little to do with the actual harm sustained by the [plaintiff].Â  The wealth of\r\n  a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages\r\n  award.&quot;).\r\nBranham\r\n  presented evidence of Ford's net worth, income, revenues and cash flow.Â  In 2005, Ford's net worth was $12,597,000,000.Â  Also in 2005,\r\n  Ford had $1,986,000,000 in income, $177,000,000,000 in revenue and\r\n  $21,000,000,000 in cash flow.Â  Branham extrapolated these figures to &quot;per\r\n  week,&quot; &quot;per day,&quot; and &quot;per hour.&quot;Â  For example,\r\n  concerning Ford's cash flow, &quot;[t]hat's $416 Billion per week,[24] $59 Million per day, [and] $2.474 Million per hour.&quot;Â  \r\nThis Court has approved the use of a defendant's net worth as a\r\n  proper guide in assessing the &quot;ability to pay&quot; factor.Â  Hicks v.\r\n    Herring, 246 S.C. 429, 437, 144 S.E.2d 151, 154 (1965) (noting that &quot;the\r\n  wealth of a defendant is a relevant factor in assessing punitive damages&quot;).Â \r\n  This Court has not, however, addressed the propriety of extrapolating financial\r\n  data in the manner introduced at trial.Â  Our court of appeals has directly\r\n  addressed this issue and found no abuse of discretion in the admission of per\r\n  day earnings of a defendant, Orangeburg Sausage Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co.,\r\n  316 S.C. 331, 344, 450 S.E.2d 66, 73-74 (Ct. App. 1994), nor has it found an\r\n  abuse of discretion in admitting the per day operating revenue or per day net\r\n  income.Â  Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 169-70, 536 S.E.2d\r\n  380, 385-86 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  These court of appeals decisions have not been\r\n  tested since the 2003 Supreme Court opinion of State Farm v. Campbell.\r\nBecause the United States Supreme Court\r\n  has discovered that a state court's punitive damages award implicates federal\r\n  substantive due process, this Court is not the final arbiter of determining\r\n  what financial evidence is proper in assessing punitive damages.Â  Evidence\r\n  concerning net worth appears the safest harbor.Â  Honda Motor speaks\r\n  directly to &quot;net worth.&quot;Â  512 U.S. at 432.Â  Consideration of a\r\n  defendant's net worth is well-rooted in the common law of punitive damages.Â Â  State\r\n    Farm v. Campbell's cautionary observation that &quot;reference to [the defendant's] assets . . . ha[s] little to do\r\n  with the actual harm sustained by the [plaintiff]&quot; militates against\r\n  venturing beyond net worth and extrapolations from net worth.Â  State Farm,\r\n  538 U.S. at 427.Â  The retrial shall be confined to such evidence. \r\nWhile the United States Supreme Court's foray into punitive\r\n  damages law is, to be sure, confusing, there can be no serious doubt concerning\r\n  financial evidence of the salaries and compensation of a defendant corporation's\r\n  officers.Â  Such evidence introduces an arbitrary factor in a jury's\r\n  consideration and assessment of punitive damages.\r\nBranham\r\n  went far beyond the pale in submitting evidence of Ford's senior management compensation, including the following: In 2005, the\r\n  Ford Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was compensated by stock options\r\n  worth $5,300,000; the Ford President and Chief Operating Officer received a\r\n  salary $1,458,000 in 2005; the Ford Executive Vice President received a salary\r\n  of $972,000 in 2005; the Ford Chief Financial Officer received a salary of\r\n  $916,000 in 2005; a former Ford chairman received $880,000 in 2005.Â  Additional\r\n  testimony revealed that &quot;[i]n 2005, they didn't pay bonuses.Â  In 2004,\r\n  they did pay bonuses: $2 Million, $1 Million, $1 Million and $1 Million plus\r\n  stock and other compensation.Â  This gives you a picture of Ford Motor Company's\r\n  financial condition.&quot;Â  The admission of this evidence was error and highly\r\n  prejudicial.\r\nV.\r\nAlignment of Parties\r\nWe\r\n  reach Ford's final challenge assigning error to the trial court's\r\n  failure to realign defendant Hale as a plaintiff.Â  Ford requested realignment\r\n  of Hale as a plaintiff so that Ford would not have to share its allotment of\r\n  preemptory jury strikes[25] with Hale.[26]Â  We find the issue not preserved for review, but we address this\r\n  issue in the hope that our speaking to the matter will aid the bench and bar.Â \r\n  This is a novel issue in our modern jurisprudence.\r\nHale\r\n  and her counsel sat on the plaintiff's side throughout the trial, beginning\r\n  with jury selection.Â  We\r\n  recognize that Hale filed a cross-claim against Ford, but that claim was\r\n  severed from this trial.Â  Hale's counsel declined to cross-examine any witness\r\n  called by Branham but one.Â  The one witness Hale cross-examined was Branham's\r\n  economic expert.Â  The question: &quot;[H]ow many millions are in a billion?&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  only bona fide defendant in this case was Ford.Â  The following is the\r\n  totality of Branham's closing argument concerning Hale:\r\n\r\n  I want to first talk with you just a minute about what\r\n    occurred in the wreck. . . .Â  Ms. Hale was going down Cromwell Road at a\r\n    relatively slow speed, 35 miles an hour, she looked in the back, went to the\r\n    edge of the road, she made--went to the right, made a steer to the left.Â Â  \r\n  Nobody\r\n    knows what that steering was because nobody has a picture of it.Â  We could\r\n    argue about that from now to eternity and nobody would know, because nobody can\r\n    know.Â  But she was driving ordinary, she wasn't doing anything--she wasn't out\r\n    there doing any reckless driving out there that day.Â  \r\n   .\r\n    . . . \r\n   Here,\r\n    Ms. Hale looked in the backseat; there's no question about that, she took her\r\n    eyes off the road.Â  But did she do something that was wrong.Â  She did what all\r\n    reasonable drivers would do, which was she tried to get back on the road.Â  She\r\n    made the turn to do it and the vehicle rolled over, at 35 miles an hour, under\r\n    those circumstances.\r\n\r\nTrial\r\n  judges in South Carolina have the authority to realign parties.Â  Beyond a court's\r\n  inherent authority to manage and conduct a trial, our Rule 21, SCRCP, regarding\r\n  joinder of parties is identical to the federal rule, Rule 21, FRCP.\r\n\r\n  Misjoinder\r\n    of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action.Â  Parties may be dropped or\r\n    added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at\r\n    any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.Â  Any claim against a\r\n    party may be severed and proceeded with separately.\r\n\r\nRule 21, SCRCP.\r\nFederal\r\n  courts rely on Rule 21 as authority to realign parties. See In-Tech Mktg.\r\n    Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., 685 F.Supp. 436, 442 n.19 (D.N.J. 1988) (noting that\r\n  Rule 21 &quot;permits [the District] Court, sua sponte to re-align any party at any time&quot;); First Nat'l Bank of Shawnee Mission v.\r\n    Roeland Park State Bank &amp; Trust Co., 357 F. Supp. 708, 711 (D. Kan.\r\n  1973) (noting that the District Court &quot;may order a realignment of the\r\n  parties 'on such terms as are just'&quot; pursuant to Rule 21).Â  Our sister\r\n  state of Georgia relies on Rule 21 in recognizing that &quot;a trial court does\r\n  have the discretion, 'at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just,'\r\n  . . . to realign the parties.&quot;Â  Cawthon v. Waco Fire &amp; Cas. Ins.\r\n    Co., 386 S.E.2d 32, 33 (Ga. 1989) (citing its codified version of Rule\r\n  21).Â  \r\n The Cawthon decision is instructive. At trial, the Cawthons made a motion to have a\r\n  co-defendant realigned as a plaintiff.Â  The &quot;Cawthons were concerned that\r\n  they would be forced to share jury strikes with the [co-defendant whose\r\n  interests were aligned with the plaintiffs].&quot;Â  Id. at 33.Â  The\r\n  trial court recognized the unfairness of the present alignment, &quot;but\r\n  [stated] that it had no authority to realign the parties.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Relying on its own version of Rule 21, the Georgia Supreme Court found the\r\n  trial court erred in &quot;concluding it did not have discretion to realign the\r\n  parties,&quot; and affirmatively held that trial courts have the right to\r\n  realign parties in the interests of justice.Â  Id.\r\nWe\r\n  adopt the reasoning of Cawthon, including the authority of a trial court\r\n  to realign parties &quot;at any stage of the action.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  decision whether to realign the parties lies within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of\r\n  discretion and resulting prejudice.Â  \r\nVI.\r\nThe\r\n  judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in part and the case\r\n  is remanded for a new trial.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting  in part in a separate opinion, in which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  While I agree that the\r\n  risk-utility test is the appropriate test for design defect cases, I do not\r\n  believe this Court has the power to simply discard the consumer expectations\r\n  test, expressly adopted by the General Assembly in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-73-10\r\n  through 30.Â  Furthermore, in my opinion, much of the evidence the majority\r\n  views as improper &quot;post-manufacture&quot; evidence was properly admissible\r\n  to prove (1) the foreseeable risk of harm posed by the Bronco II as produced,\r\n  (2) that the proposed alternative designs could have reduced or avoided the\r\n  foreseeable risk, and (3) that the Bronco II, absent the alternative designs,\r\n  was not reasonably safe.\r\nI. Risk-Utility\r\n  Test\r\nAs the majority notes, the General Assembly adopted the Restatement\r\n  (Second) of Torts Â§ 402A in 1974.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-73-10\r\n  through 30.Â  The comments to Â§ 402A, which form the basis for the consumer\r\n  expectations test, were expressly adopted as legislative intent.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-73-30.Â  The majority then notes that the American Law Institute has,\r\n  in the Restatement (Third) of Torts, moved away from the consumer expectations\r\n  test for design defects in favor of the risk-utility test and proposes that\r\n  this Court do the same.Â  While I agree with the majority that the risk-utility\r\n  test is the appropriate test for design defect cases, I do not believe that\r\n  this Court has the authority to simply reject the General Assembly's chosen\r\n  test, even if we believe that body would approve of the change.Â  See Benat\r\n  v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 286 S.C. 132, 333 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1985)\r\n  (&quot;It is the duty of this court to interpret the law.Â  We have no\r\n  legislative authority and cannot vary a statutory scheme and this is true no\r\nmatter how logical the basis of the variance.&quot;).\r\nHowever, I believe that this Court may effect the same result under the\r\n  existing statute by interpreting the consumer expectations test in the specific\r\n  context of design defect cases.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 provides that\r\n  &quot;[o]ne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably\r\n  dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  Comments to Â§ 402A explain that a product is in a &quot;defective\r\n  condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his\r\n  property&quot; when the product is in &quot;a condition not contemplated by the\r\n  ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him.&quot;Â \r\n  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 402A cmt. g.Â  A product is unreasonably\r\n  dangerous when it is &quot;dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be\r\n  contemplated by the ordinary consumer.&quot;Â  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§\r\n402A cmt. i.Â  These comments form the basis for the consumer expectations test.\r\nIn my view, given the complexity of many modern products, a consumer's\r\n  expectations are not directed to any specific characteristic of the design, but\r\n  rather to the manufacturer's design decision.Â  The ordinary consumer expects\r\n  that the manufacturer will weigh the foreseeable risks against the benefits and\r\n  only offer a product for sale to the general public if the latter outweighs the\r\n  former.Â  See 60 S.C. L. Rev. 1101.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I concur in the majority's decision to apply risk-utility\r\n  principles to design defect claims.Â  However, in my view, such change must be\r\n  achieved within the framework of existing statutory provisions.\r\n\r\nII. Post-Manufacture\r\n  Evidence\r\nI respectfully disagree with the majority's stance on\r\n  &quot;post-manufacture&quot; evidence.Â  The majority reverses the jury verdict\r\n  based, in part, on its finding that &quot;Ford was prejudiced by Branham's\r\n  unrelenting pursuit of post-manufacture evidence on the issue of\r\n  liability.&quot;Â  The opinion defines &quot;post-manufacture evidence&quot; as\r\n  &quot;evidence of facts neither known nor available at the time of\r\n  manufacture.&quot;Â  Such evidence is, in the majority's view, inadmissible\r\n  because &quot;[w]hen assessing liability in a design defect claim, the judgment\r\n  and ultimate decision of the manufacturer must be evaluated based on what was\r\n  known at the time of manufacture.&quot;Â  I believe the majority's rule sweeps\r\n  too broadly and absorbs within its ambit evidence which is properly admissible\r\n  in a design defect case.\r\n\r\nI note at the outset that the majority opinion may be read as barring\r\n  any evidence created after the date of manufacture.Â  If this is the\r\n  majority's view, I strongly disagree.Â  In my view, such a rule would deprive\r\n  the fact finder of relevant evidence regarding what the manufacturer knew or\r\n  should have known, design alternatives, and the risk inherent in the\r\nmanufacturer's design.\r\nIn a products liability action, the plaintiff must prove (1) that he\r\n  was injured by the product; (2) that the injury occurred because the product\r\n  was in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user; and (3) that\r\n  the product at the time of the accident was in essentially the same condition\r\n  as when it left the hands of the defendant.Â  See Bragg v. Hi-Ranger,\r\n  Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 539, 462 S.E.2d 321, 326 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Under the\r\n  risk-utility test for design defect cases, a plaintiff must prove the second\r\n  element, product defect, by showing that &quot;the foreseeable risks of harm\r\n  posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a\r\n  reasonable alternative design by the seller . . . and the omission of the\r\n  alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.&quot;Â  Restatement\r\n(Third) of Torts: Products Liability Â§ 2(b) (1998).\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    In seeking to meet his burden, the plaintiff introduced the following\r\n    evidence which the majority finds objectionable:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (1)\r\n      A memo dated\r\n  April 14, 1989, dealing with a meeting that three Ford engineers had with\r\n  representatives from Consumer Reports, discussing a comparative test of the\r\n  Bronco II and other similar cars, showing the Bronco II to have a higher fatal\r\n  rollover rate than the other cars.\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)\r\n      A film, taped\r\n  in 1989, showing &quot;J-tests&quot; comparing the Chevy Blazer and Bronco II,\r\n  and demonstrating that the Bronco II did not handle as well as the Blazer.\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (3)\r\n      A document that\r\n  compared a 1989 Bronco II to a prototype of the Ford Explorer, showing that the\r\n  handling strategy of the Bronco II makes the vehicle more sensitive to steering\r\n  over-corrections that seem to be part of most rollover scenarios.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  In finding the above evidence improper and inadmissible, the majority\r\n  notes that:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whether the 1987 Ford Bronco II was defectively\r\n    designed and in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous must be determined\r\n    as of the 1986 manufacture date of the vehicle.Â  Ford's 1986 design and\r\n    manufacture decision should be assessed on the evidence available at that time,\r\n    not the increased evidence of additional rollover data that came to light after\r\n    1986.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  While I agree in general with the majority's proposition, I note that when the reports were generated or tests conducted is of little consequence, since\r\n  testimony established that the vehicles tested were substantially the same as\r\n  the model involved in the accident, the testing methods were available to Ford\r\n  prior to the date of manufacture, and the rollover risk was known to Ford prior\r\n  to the date of manufacture.Â  In short, the date on which the evidence was\r\n  created is of little utility in determining the relevance of the evidence and a\r\n  broad rule barring evidence created &quot;post manufacture&quot; actually\r\n  serves to defeat the goals of the risk-utility test.\r\n\r\n  First, I believe the evidence was admissible to show foreseeable risk.Â \r\n  The risk-utility test, as set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Torts, speaks\r\n  not in terms of evidence of risk of which the manufacturer was actually aware, but in terms of foreseeable risk.Â  No party disputes that Ford\r\n    had the ability to test the 1987 Bronco II in the same way as was done in the\r\n    disputed evidence mentioned above.Â  In fact, Ford conducted such tests, the\r\n    results of which led some Ford engineers to conclude that the wheel base design\r\n    was flawed.[27]Â \r\n  Consequently, in my view, the memo, film, and document were properly admissible\r\n  to show foreseeable risk, an essential element of the plaintiff's burden of\r\n  proof in a design defect case.[28]\r\n\r\n  Second, I believe the video was admissible to show the viability of the\r\n  proposed reasonable alternative design.Â  To satisfy the risk-utility test, the\r\n  plaintiff must prove, in most instances, that the foreseeable risk could have\r\n  been avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design.Â  Restatement\r\n  (Third) of Torts: Products Liability, Â§ 2 cmt. d.Â  The alternative design must\r\nbe one that could have been practically adopted at the time of the sale.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n  The plaintiff proposed reasonable alternative designs that were\r\n  available at the time of manufacture, i.e. the MacPherson Strut suspension\r\n  system and SLA suspension system, and he was entitled to an opportunity to show\r\n  that the alternative designs could have reduced or avoided the foreseeable\r\n  risk.Â  Testimony at trial established that the Blazer used the SLA suspension\r\n  system and the video demonstrated that the SLA system remedied the alleged\r\n  rollover propensity of vehicles using the Twin I-Beam suspension system.Â  The\r\n  video was therefore, in my view, properly admitted.\r\n\r\n  Finally, I believe the memo, film, and document were properly\r\n  admissible to aid the plaintiff in proving the final element of the\r\n  risk-utility test: that &quot;the omission of the alternative design renders\r\n    the product not reasonably safe.&quot;Â  Though the &quot;post-manufacture&quot;\r\n  evidence dealt with Bronco II vehicles manufactured between 1987 and 1989,\r\n  testimony at trial established that there were no major changes to the Bronco\r\n  II after 1987.Â  The vehicles' rollover propensities are therefore relevant to\r\n    the issue of the reasonableness of Ford's choice of the Twin I-Beam suspension\r\n    system over the SLA or MacPherson system.\r\n  \r\n    For the reasons stated above, I concur in part and dissent in part.\r\nWALLER, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A document referenced during Hale's testimony indicates a purchase price\r\n  of $150. \r\n[2] This was the second trial of this case.Â  The first trial ended in a\r\n  mistrial when it was discovered that one or more jurors had been represented by\r\n  the law firm representing one of the parties.\r\n[3] Branham also alleged warranty claims in his complaint but did not pursue\r\n  these claims at trial, and the jury was not asked to consider these claims.Â Â  \r\n[4] The unusual verdict form is discussed in detail in Part III.D, infra.Â \r\n  Ford's request that the jury answer specific interrogatories related to the\r\n  multiple claims was denied.Â Â  \r\n[5] The converse of the\r\n  situation before us is more easily understood, that is, where the negligence\r\n  claim is dismissed and the strict liability survives, as questions of fact are\r\n  presented as to elements common to both claims yet the plaintiff fails to\r\n  present evidence of the absence of due care.Â Â Â  \r\n[6] On appeal, Branham seeks to challenge the trial court's dismissal of the\r\n  strict liability seatbelt claim.Â  Issue preservation rules aside, we have\r\n  reviewed the evidence concerning the seatbelt claim and conclude the trial\r\n  court properly directed a verdict. \r\n[7] This acronym stands for Design Verification Plan and Report.Â  In general\r\n  terms, it is a type of testing to verify the product works as designed.Â  \r\n[8] We discuss this issue in detail in Part III.A, infra. \r\n[9] One commentator has noted that, &quot;one simply cannot talk\r\n  meaningfully about a risk-[utility] defect in a product design until and unless\r\n  one has identified some design alternative (including any design omission) that\r\n  can serve as the basis for a risk-[utility] analysis.&quot;Â  Gary T.

Armstrong, the Texas Supreme Court made a similar observation,\r\n  noting that: &quot;[P]rolonged proof of what happened in other accidents cannot\r\n  be used to distract a jury's attention from what happened in the case at hand.&quot;Â \r\n  145 S.W.3d 131, 138 (Tex. 2004).Â  \r\n[20] Branham's evidence concerning the February 28,\r\n  1989 rollover, discussed above in Part III.A., is an example of evidence that\r\n  violates both rules.Â  First, it is post-manufacture evidence.Â  Second, the\r\n  purpose was to test a prototype braking system (the anti-lock braking system)\r\n  on ice.Â  According to Plaintiff's exhibit 275, &quot;[s]everal brake\r\n  application maneuvers were performed on the ice surface.&quot;Â  The 1989 Bronco\r\n  rolled over during the testing.Â  A rollover under these circumstances is so\r\n  patently dissimilar to the circumstances of Hale's June 17, 2001 accident that\r\n  no discussion is warranted.Â Â  \r\n[21] The cross-claim between Ford and Hale was\r\n  severed from the underlying trial.Â  The current version of the Contribution\r\n  Among Tortfeasors Act became effective for cases arising after July 1, 2005.Â \r\n  The 2005 amendment to the Act provides that a &quot;less than fifty percent&quot;\r\n  at-fault defendant &quot;shall only be liable for that percentage of the\r\n  indivisible damages determined by the jury.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-15(A) (Supp. 2008).Â  A provision applicable in 2001\r\n  provided that &quot;[i]n determining the pro rata\r\n  shares of tortfeasors in the entire liability . . . [,] their relative degrees\r\n  of fault shall not be considered.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-30 (2005).Â  \r\n[22] Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783\r\n  (1991). \r\n[23] For example, &quot;If you expect these vehicles\r\n  to last about twenty years, that's six hundred more people getting killed using\r\n  this vehicle as opposed to a Chevy S-10 Blazer.Â  That's serious. . . .Â  And\r\n  that doesn't count the paralyzed people, the quadriplegics, the people with\r\n  serious injuries, the thousands of people that have been in these events . . .\r\n  .Â  Jesse Branham is here today with a brain injury and six hundred other\r\n  people, or however many it is, lost their lives, and numerous others have brain\r\n  injuries or are paralyzed, quadriplegic, have extremely serious injuries.Â  We\r\n  believe you should tell Ford Motor Company what you think about this kind of\r\n  thing.&quot;Â  (Excerpts from Plaintiff's counsel's closing argument.)Â  Ford has\r\n  been told in other litigation that the Bronco II was defectively designed.Â  Ford\r\n    Motor Co. v. Ammerman, 705 N.E.2d 539 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999); Ford Motor\r\n      Co. v. Cammack, 999 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. App. 1998).Â  Due process forbids\r\n  punishing a tortfeasor multiple times for the same injury.\r\n[24] The $416 Billion per week figure is in the record, though the figure is\r\n  clearly a miscalculation given annual cash flow of $21 Billion.\r\n[25] In South Carolina, in a civil action, each side receives four\r\n  peremptory strikes and the strikes are made on a side-to-side basis until 12\r\n  jurors are seated.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1050 (1976).Â  Therefore,\r\n  Branham had four strikes and Ford and Hale each had two.\r\n[26] It appears Ford's motion to realign Hale was filed prior to jury\r\n  selection and initially handled off the record.Â  During jury selection, Ford's\r\n  counsel referred to his earlier motion concerning the &quot;alignment of the\r\n  partiesÂ  . . . [and] the issue of the number of strikes.&quot;Â  Ford's counsel\r\n  reiterated his concern by noting that Hale's counsel &quot;is sitting over\r\n  there with the plaintiff.&quot;Â  \r\n[27] Even\r\n  if the risk-utility test considered only the manufacturer's actual knowledge of the risk, introduction of the memo, film, and document would not\r\n  be prejudicial to Ford as this testimony demonstrates that Ford was aware of\r\n  the stability problems demonstrated in the &quot;post-manufacture&quot;\r\n  evidence.\r\n[28] I note that a rule barring any evidence created after the date of manufacture\r\n  would bar nearly all evidence created by a party other than the defendant\r\n  manufacturer, as it is the only party with access to the vehicle prior to the\r\n  date of manufacture.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26861","title":"State v.

Tindall was convicted of trafficking cocaine in excess\r\n  of four hundred grams, sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment, and\r\n  assessed a $250,000 fine.Â  On certiorari, he challenges the Court of Appeals\r\n  rulings affirming the trial court's denial of his motions to suppress the cocaine\r\n  and his statement to police.Â  State v. Tindall, 379 S.C. 304, 665 S.E.2d\r\n  188 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOne\r\n  morning in 2004, an officer stopped Tindall's vehicle for speeding, following\r\n  another vehicle too closely, and failure to maintain his lane.Â  The officer\r\n  asked Tindall to exit the vehicle and to have a seat in the patrol car.Â  The\r\n  officer questioned Tindall and, approximately fifteen to twenty minutes into\r\n  the stop, asked Tindall if he could search his car, to which he replied &quot;I\r\n  don't care&quot; or &quot;I don't mind.&quot;Â  The officer searched the vehicle\r\n  and discovered a large quantity of cocaine hidden beneath the rear bumper.[1]\r\nTindall\r\n  was placed in custody and given Miranda warnings, after which he gave a\r\n  statement to the officer admitting that he was being paid $1,500 to drive the\r\n  Jeep from Atlanta to Durham.Â  Tindall never admitted knowing that the cocaine\r\n  was in the vehicle.Â  At trial, Tindall moved to suppress the cocaine and his\r\n  statement to police.Â  The trial court denied the motions and Tindall was\r\n  convicted and sentenced.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed on direct appeal.Â  Â Â This\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn\r\n  appeals from a motion to suppress based on Fourth Amendment grounds, this Court\r\n  applies a deferential standard of review and will reverse if there is clear\r\n  error.Â  See State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 70, 572 S.E.2d\r\n  456, 459 (2002).Â  However, this deference does not bar this Court from\r\n  conducting its own review of the record to determine whether the trial judge's\r\n  decision is supported by the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States grants citizens the\r\n  right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure.Â  U.S. Const. amend.\r\n  IV.Â  Temporary detention of an individual in the course of a routine traffic\r\n  stop constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure, but where probable cause exists to\r\n  believe that a traffic violation has occurred, such a seizure is reasonable per\r\n  se.Â  See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769,\r\n  135 L.Ed. 89 (1996).Â  In carrying out a routine traffic stop, a law enforcement\r\n  officer may request a driver's license and vehicle registration, run a computer\r\n  check, and issue a citation. Â See United States v. Sullivan, 138\r\n  F.3d 126, 131 (4th Cir. 1998).Â  Any further detention for questioning is beyond\r\n  the scope of the stop and therefore illegal unless the officer has reasonable\r\n  suspicion of a serious crime.Â  Id.\r\nTindall\r\n  concedes that the initial traffic stop was legal but contends that the officer\r\n  exceeded the scope of the stop without reasonable suspicion that a serious crime\r\n  was afoot.Â  We agree.[2]\r\nThe\r\n  officer stopped Tindall for speeding, following too closely behind another\r\n  vehicle, and failing to maintain his lane.Â  He obtained Tindall's driver's\r\n  license, registration, proof of insurance, and a copy of the car rental\r\n  agreement and asked him to have a seat in the front passenger seat of his\r\n  patrol car.Â  The officer testified that as Tindall exited the vehicle, he did a\r\n  &quot;felony stretch,&quot; raising his hands in a stress relief action which\r\n  officers are taught to look for in criminal patrol classes.Â  He then\r\n  patted-down Tindall and Tindall took a seat in the patrol car.Â  A police dog\r\n  was in the back of the vehicle.\r\nThe\r\n  officer asked Tindall about his destination and he responded that he was\r\n  driving to Durham to meet with his brother.Â  The officer then called in the\r\n  driver's license and vehicle information.Â  Approximately three minutes later,\r\n  the dispatcher reported back that there were no problems with either the\r\n  license or vehicle and the officer informed Tindall that he would write him a\r\n  warning ticket.\r\nAt\r\n  this point, the purpose of the traffic stop was accomplished except for the\r\n  issuance of the warning ticket.Â  However, rather than issue the ticket, the\r\n  officer continued to question Tindall for an additional six to seven minutes,\r\n  inquiring as to where he was going, the purpose for the trip, what exit he\r\n  would take to get to Durham, whether he had ever been charged with any drug\r\n  crimes, what type of business he was in, and various questions about his\r\n  business.[3]Â \r\n  During this questioning, two other officers called in for back-up stood outside\r\n  of the patrol car door.\r\nWe\r\n  find the officer's continued detention of Tindall exceeded the scope of the\r\n  traffic stop and constituted a seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.Â  A\r\n  reasonable person in Tindall's position - seated in the front seat of the\r\n  patrol car with two officers standing at his door, another officer to his left,\r\n  and a police dog in the back seat - would not have felt free to terminate the\r\n  encounter.Â  See Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct.\r\n  2382, 2386, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (seizure for purposes of Fourth Amendment\r\n  where reasonable person would not feel free to disregard the police and go\r\n  about his business).\r\nThe\r\n  question therefore becomes whether the officer reasonably suspected a serious\r\n  crime at the point at which he chose not to conclude the traffic stop, despite\r\n  his stated intention to issue a warning ticket, instead opting to continue his\r\n  questioning.Â  See Sullivan, 138 F.3d at 131.Â  At that point, the\r\n  officer had ascertained the following information: (1) Tindall was driving to\r\n  Durham[4] to meet his brother; (2) Tindall was driving a rental car rented the previous\r\n  day by another individual which was to be returned to Atlanta on the day of the\r\n  stop; (3) Tindall did a &quot;felony stretch&quot; on exiting the vehicle; and\r\n  (4) Tindall seemed nervous.Â  We find these facts did not provide the officer\r\n  with a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that a serious crime was afoot.Â \r\n  Consequently, the continued detention was illegal and the drugs discovered\r\n  during the search of the vehicle must be suppressed. [5]\r\nThe\r\n  fact that Tindall &quot;consented&quot; to the search of the vehicle does not\r\n  alter our conclusion as the consent was the product of the unlawful detention.Â \r\n  &quot;Undoubtedly, a law enforcement officer may request permission to search\r\n  at any time.Â  However, when an officer asks for consent to search after an\r\n  unconstitutional detention, the consent procured is per se invalid unless it is\r\n  both voluntary and not an exploitation of the unlawful detention.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Adams, 377 S.C. 334, 339, 659 S.E.2d 272, 275 (Ct. App. 2008), citing State\r\n      v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 105, 623 S.E.2d 840, 851 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â \r\n  Having found the seizure violated the Constitution, we find nothing in the\r\n  record to rebut this presumption of invalidity.\r\nAs\r\n  we find that the cocaine was discovered after an unlawful detention and invalid\r\n  consent, we conclude that Tindall's statement should have been suppressed.Â  See State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 323, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996) (&quot;The\r\n  'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine provides that evidence must be excluded\r\n  if it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police,\r\n  and the evidence has been obtained by the exploitation of that illegality.&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the officer's actions after completion of the license and registration\r\n  computer check exceeded the scope of the initial traffic stop.Â  The continued\r\n  stop beyond this point, without reasonable suspicion, constituted an illegal\r\n  detention and the evidence and statement should have been suppressed.Â  The\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals, which upheld the trial court's denial of\r\n  Tindall's motions to suppress, is therefore\r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice John H. Waller, Jr., concur.Â  KITTREDGE, J., dissenting\r\n  in a separate opinion, in which Acting Justice James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Two guiding principles shape our State's\r\n  Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.Â  First, in a Fourth Amendment fact-based\r\n  challenge, we are constrained by the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of\r\n  review.Â  A trial court's ruling in Fourth Amendment search and\r\n  seizure cases must be upheld if there is any evidence to support the ruling. Â State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000) (&quot;[W]e will review the\r\n  trial court's ruling like any other factual finding and reverse if there is\r\n  clear error. We will affirm if there is any evidence to support the\r\n  ruling.&quot;).Â \r\n  Second, the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is &quot;reasonableness.&quot;Â  Michigan v. Fisher, 130\r\n  S. Ct. 546, 548 (2009) (&quot;'[T]he\r\n  ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\r\n  Amendment,' we have often\r\n  said, is 'reasonableness.'&quot;) (quoting Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006)).Â \r\n  Today's decision ignores\r\n  these principles.Â  The Court simply substitutes its preferred findings and\r\n  construes the Fourth Amendment in a manner that places unnecessary and\r\n  unreasonable constraints on law enforcement.Â  \r\nI. \r\n\r\n  Terry T. Tindall was paid $1,500 to transport a large quantity of\r\n  cocaine from Atlanta, Georgia, to Durham, North Carolina.Â  Tindall was\r\n  apprehended in Oconee County, South Carolina.Â  He was convicted and sentenced\r\n  for trafficking cocaine in excess of 400 grams.Â  The trial court denied\r\n  Tindall's motions to suppress the drugs and his statement to police.Â  The court\r\n  of appeals properly applied the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of review and\r\n  affirmed.Â  State v. Tindall, 379 S.C. 304, 309, 665 S.E.2d 188, 191 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008) (recognizing that a trial\r\n  court's factual rulings are reviewed under the &quot;clear error&quot; standard\r\n  and the appellate court will affirm if any evidence supports the ruling)\r\n  (citing Brockman, 339 S.C. at 66, 528\r\n  S.E.2d at 666).\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n  Sergeant Dale Colegrove of the Oconee County Sheriff's Office was\r\n  patrolling Interstate 85 the morning of April 15, 2004.Â  At 7:05 a.m.,\r\n  Colegrove conducted a traffic stop on a Jeep Cherokee traveling northbound on\r\n  the interstate after the vehicle crossed from Georgia into South Carolina, near\r\n  mile-marker three.Â  The vehicle was speeding and following another vehicle too\r\nclosely.Â  The vehicle was driven by Tindall.Â \r\n\r\n  As a result of Tindall's nervousness and delay in following initial\r\n  instructions, Colegrove, an experienced officer, &quot;sense[d] that something\r\n  wasn't right with what [Tindall] was thinking.&quot;Â  Colegrove's suspicions\r\n  grew when he learned Tindall was driving a rental car from Atlanta.Â  The car\r\n  had been rented by another individual, Lee Braggs, the day before and had to be\r\n  returned to Atlanta that day, April 15.Â  Tindall was named as a permissive user\r\n  in the rental agreement.\r\n\r\n  Colegrove promptly began the process of checking Tindall's driver's\r\n  license and vehicle registration, while engaging Tindall in conversation.Â \r\n  According to Colegrove, &quot;while waiting on the check to come back, I really\r\n    started just observing behavior changes.&quot;Â  Colegrove requested backup.Â \r\n  When Colegrove received information from dispatch that Tindall's driver's\r\n  license was valid at approximately 7:15 a.m., he informed Tindall that he would\r\n  receive a warning ticket.Â \r\n\r\n  Colegrove began to write the warning ticket while continuing to talk\r\n  with Tindall.Â  When the warning ticket was completed at 7:20 a.m. and the\r\n  ticket was issued to Tindall, Colegrove asked for, and received, Tindall's\r\n  consent to search the vehicle.Â  Fifteen minutes elapsed from the initial stop\r\n  to the issuance of the ticket to the search of the vehicle.Â  At 7:29 a.m.,\r\n  2,380 grams of cocaine were found hidden in three packages in the rear undercarriage\r\n  of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n  Tindall was placed in custody and given Miranda warnings at 7:34\r\n    a.m., after which he gave a statement to Colegrove.Â  Sergeant Colegrove\r\n    testified:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      [Tindall] stated that he was traveling to Durham, leaving Atlanta going to Durham for Lee Braggs.Â  He stated again that he was being\r\n      paid $1,500 - once his Miranda and everything else was read, he stated\r\n      to me he was being paid $1,500 to take that Jeep from Atlanta to Durham where\r\n      Mr. Braggs was flying to meet him in Durham to pick that vehicle up and that\r\n      his brother was going to return him back to Atlanta and that he was getting\r\n      $1,500 for driving that vehicle from Atlanta to Durham.Â  That's exactly what he\r\n      said.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Tindall was indicted for trafficking cocaine in excess of 400 grams.Â \r\n    He moved to suppress the cocaine and his statement to police.Â  The trial court\r\n    denied the motions, and Tindall was convicted and sentenced.Â  The court of\r\n    appeals applied the proper standard of review and affirmed in a thorough and\r\n    well-reasoned opinion.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThere is evidence to\r\n  support a finding that the officer had objectively reasonable and articulable\r\n  suspicion that Tindall was engaged in criminal activity.Â  This is the basis of\r\n  the court of appeals' affirmation.Â  Viewing the &quot;whole picture,&quot; I\r\n  join the court of appeals and would hold the standard of review requires an\r\n  affirmance.Â  More to the point, I cannot say that under the totality of the\r\n  circumstances there is no evidence to support the ruling of the trial court.\r\nIn addition,\r\n  contrary to the majority's implication, the Constitution does not foreclose\r\n  further conversation between a motorist and law enforcement during the process\r\n  of writing a traffic summons.Â  See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93 (2005) (holding mere police questioning while\r\n  individual was detained did not constitute an independent Fourth Amendment\r\n  violation and such questioning was not additional seizure within the meaning of\r\n  the Fourth Amendment). Â There is ample evidence to affirm the denial of\r\n  Tindall's Fourth Amendment challenge, as the court of appeals recognized. \r\nThe Fourth Amendment\r\n  is measured through a lens of reasonableness.Â  See Fisher, 130 S. Ct. at 548; Brigham City, Utah, 547 U.S. at 403.Â  Fourth\r\n  Amendment challenges are typically fact-intensive.Â  As observed in State v.\r\n    Pichardo, &quot;[r]easonableness is measured in\r\n  objective terms by examining the totality of the circumstances.Â  As a result,\r\n  the nature of the reasonableness inquiry is highly fact-specific.&quot;Â  367\r\n  S.C. 84, 101, 623 S.E.2d 840, 849 (Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted).Â  The fact-specific nature of the inquiry explains\r\n  why this Court determined the deferential &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of\r\n  review is appropriate in Fourth Amendment cases in Brockman.\r\nThe court of appeals\r\n  cited to what, prior to today, was a sound rule - &quot;Under the 'clear error' standard, an appellate court\r\n  will not reverse a trial court's finding of fact simply because it would have\r\n  decided the case differently.&quot;Â  Tindall, 379 S.C. at 309, 665\r\n  S.E.2d at 191 (citing Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 95-96, 623 S.E.2d at 846).Â \r\n  I vote to affirm the court of appeals.\r\nActing Justice\r\n  James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The entire encounter was captured on the officer's dash camera and there is no\r\n  genuine dispute as to the facts, only their interpretation.\r\n[2] We find, as did the Court of Appeals, that Tindall's arguments are properly\r\n  preserved for review.\r\n[3] Tindall stated that he had recently been laid off by Northwest Airlines and\r\n  that he and his wife were opening a day care center.Â  The officer then asked Tindall\r\n  questions about day care regulations, including the ratio of staff to children\r\n  and the amount of square footage provided per child.\r\n[4] The officer testified that Durham is a &quot;drug hub.&quot;Â  He also stated\r\n  that Greenville, Charlotte, Jacksonville, Raleigh, Spartanburg, and Oconee are\r\n  &quot;drug hubs.&quot;\r\n[5] We disagree with the dissent's contention that we fail to appropriately apply\r\n  the standard of review.Â  While we acknowledge that we review under the\r\n  deferential &quot;any evidence&quot; standard, this Court still must review the\r\n  record to determine if the trial judge's ultimate determination is supported by\r\n  the evidence.Â  See Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. at 70, 572 S.E.2d at\r\n  459.Â  In short, we must ask first, whether the record supports the trial\r\n  court's assumed findings, set forth above, and second, whether these facts\r\n  support a finding that that the officer had reasonable suspicion of a serious crime\r\n  to justify continued detention of Tindall.Â  On the facts before us, we must\r\n  answer the latter question in the negative.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26862","title":"Robinson v.

Estate of Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-647 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In this opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\n  circuit court order that granted summary judgment in favor of Debbie S. Dinovo on\r\n  the grounds Petitioners' action to set aside a 1966 quiet title action was\r\n  barred by the three-year statute of limitations as established by section\r\n  15-67-90 of the South Carolina Code,[1] Dinovo is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice pursuant\r\n  to the recording statute as established by section 30-7-10 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code,[2] and Petitioners' action was barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nI. Factual/Procedural History\r\nThis\r\n  action involves a portion of a 20-acre tract of land located on Fort Johnson\r\n  Road, in James Island, South Carolina.Â  The tract was formerly owned by Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney, who died intestate in 1921 and allegedly left a wife, Laura Pinckney,\r\n  and two sons, Ellis and Herbert Pinckney, as his heirs.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  land held by Simeon B. Pinckney originated from a conveyance to him by deed\r\n  executed in 1874 (and recorded in 1875) from Thomas Moore.Â  The property was\r\n  described as being 20 acres, more or less.Â  In 1888, Simeon B. Pinckney\r\n  conveyed 5 acres of this property to his wife, Isabella Pinckney, leaving\r\n  approximately 15 acres.Â  A survey conducted in 1923, however, found that\r\n  exactly 14.3 acres remained. \r\nIn\r\n  1946, Laura Pinckney, Ellis Pinckney, and Herbert Pinckney executed two cross-deeds\r\n  that divided the 14.3-acre parcel among themselves, creating a 4.3-acre tract and\r\n  a 10-acre tract.[3]Â \r\n  One of the 1946 cross-deeds conveyed the 4.3-acre tract to Herbert Pinckney and\r\n  the other deed conveyed the 10-acre tract to Ellis Pinckney.Â  In 1966, after\r\n  Herbert Pinckney died intestate, Laura Pinckney Heyward brought a successful action\r\n  to quiet title to the 4.3-acre tract held by Herbert.[4]Â \r\n  None of the Petitioners or their predecessors-in-interest filed responsive\r\n  pleadings in the 1966 proceeding. \r\nAs\r\n  the result of subsequent conveyances, the 4.3-acre tract was ultimately divided\r\n  into four lots.Â  The owners of these lots are as follows:Â  (1) The Converse\r\n  Company (Lot #1); (2) Martine A. Hutton (Lot #2); (3) David Savage and Lisa M.\r\n  Shogry-Savage (Lot #3); and (4) Debbie (Shogry) Dinovo (Lot #4).Â  The instant\r\n  case involves the interests of Dinovo (&quot;Respondent&quot;).Â  \r\nOn February\r\n  1, 2005, Petitioners filed an action to quiet title to several tracts of land\r\n  located on James Island, including the 4.3-acre tract at issue in the instant\r\n  case.Â  In their Complaint, Petitioners sought &quot;to establish their\r\n  legitimate relationship as lineal descendants and heirs&quot; of Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney.Â  The first twenty-five named Petitioners claimed they were heirs of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, and the remaining Petitioners claimed they purchased\r\n  interests in the property and were the legitimate owners of those interests.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of these claims, Petitioners alleged the 1946 deeds and 1966 action to\r\n  quiet title were fraudulent and were undertaken without consideration for the\r\n  rights or interests of Petitioners and other heirs.Â  Specifically, Petitioners asserted\r\n  the 4.3-acre tract was fraudulently conveyed to Herbert Pinckney in 1946 and,\r\n  thereafter, wrongly passed by inheritance to his mother Laura Pinckney Heyward at\r\n  Herbert's death.Â  Additionally, Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney Heyward fraudulently\r\n  procured the 1966 quiet title action to the 4.3-acre tract when neither she nor\r\n  Herbert Pinckney owned any interest in the tract.Â  Finally, Petitioners alleged\r\n  they did not become aware of the 1946 deeds, of the 1966 quiet title action, or\r\n  of any other action affecting their title to the property until 2004.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these allegations, Petitioners sought &quot;(a) a determination of all owners\r\n  of the four (4) tracts of property, . . . a determination of each owner's\r\n  respective rights and interests in said tracts, and the quieting of the titles\r\n  to these four (4) tracts and (b) the sale of the respective owners' interests\r\n  in these four (4) tracts.&quot;Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  answered and filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  In her answer, Respondent\r\n  raised a number of affirmative defenses, including the doctrines of laches,\r\n  estoppel, waiver, bona fide purchaser for value, res judicata,\r\n  collateral estoppel, and the applicable statute of limitations.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response to the motion for summary judgment, Petitioners argued their claim was\r\n  not barred by section 15-67-90 given the 1966 quiet title action was the result\r\n  of extrinsic fraud.Â  Because they offered affidavits supporting their claim\r\n  that the 1966 quiet title action was procured through fraud and forgery,\r\n  Petitioners contended their action was distinguishable from the case of Yarbrough\r\n    v. Collins, 301 S.C. 339, 391 S.E.2d 873 (Ct. App. 1990).[5]\r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent.Â  In\r\n  doing so, the court found Petitioners' claims were barred by: Â (1) the\r\n  three-year statute of limitations, codified in section 15-67-90, which\r\n  prohibits setting aside &quot;for any reason&quot; a judgment quieting title to\r\n  land; (2) Respondent is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice pursuant\r\n  to section 30-7-10, the recording statute; and (3) the doctrine of laches.Â \r\n  Because Petitioners were not parties to the 1966 quiet title action, the\r\n  circuit court judge found the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res\r\n    judicata were not applicable.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  appealed the circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  Â \r\nIn a\r\n  summary opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See Robinson v. Estate of Harris, Op.\r\n  No. 2008-UP-647 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In support of its\r\n  decision, the court cited: Â (1) the three-year statute of limitations as\r\n  codified in section 15-67-90; (2) Yarbrough as interpreting section\r\n  15-67-90; (3) Robinson v. Estate of Harris, 378 S.C. 140, 662 S.E.2d 420\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008), cert. granted (Apr. 10, 2009); and (4) Burnett v.\r\n    Holiday Brothers, Inc., 279 S.C. 222, 225, 305 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1983), to\r\n  reference the purpose of the recording statute as codified in section 30-7-10.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitioners' request for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals. \r\nII. Discussion\r\nA.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same\r\n  standard as that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).\r\nRule\r\n  56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial\r\n  court may grant a motion for summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;\r\n  Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot; Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006). \r\nB.\r\nIn essence, Petitioners contend summary judgment was\r\n  improperly granted given that significant and material questions of fact exist relating\r\n  to extrinsic fraud and forgery in the underlying 1966 quiet title action and\r\n  the 1946 cross-deeds upon which the action was based.\r\nIn support of this contention, Petitioners argue the\r\n  circuit court and the Court of Appeals erred in determining that section\r\n  15-67-90 constitutes an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to setting aside judgments\r\n  quieting title to land.Â  Because they submitted affidavits in support of their\r\n  claims of extrinsic fraud and forgery, Petitioners assert their cause of action\r\n  is distinguishable from Yarbrough and should not have been procedurally\r\n  barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  \r\nC.\r\nIn analyzing\r\n  Petitioners' arguments, we must determine whether section 15-67-90 constitutes\r\n  an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to Petitioners' action or whether Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud supersedes the application of this statute of\r\n  limitations.\r\n This determination\r\n  requires us to revisit our decision in Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 714 (2000). Â In Hagy, the biological parents brought an action in\r\n  1994 to set aside the 1992 adoption of their daughter on the ground that their\r\n  consent to the adoption was induced by fraudulent statements made by the\r\n  adoptive parents, who were also the biological mother's father and stepmother.Â  Id. at 428-29, 529 S.E.2d at 716.Â  In response, the adoptive parents\r\n  defended on the merits and asserted the action was time-barred by section\r\n  20-7-1800 of the South Carolina Code, which at the time provided:Â  &quot;No\r\n  final decree of adoption is subject to collateral attack for any reason after a\r\n  period of one year following its issuance.&quot;Â  Id. at 429, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 716.Â  The family court concluded the time bar did not apply to actions to\r\n  set aside an adoption for fraud.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the family\r\n  court's decision, finding section 20-7-1800 barred the action because it was\r\n  commenced more than one year after the final adoption decree was commenced.Â  Id. Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this Court affirmed as modified the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â \r\n  In so ruling, this Court considered the novel question of &quot;whether a\r\n  facially applicable statute of limitation will bar an action to set aside a\r\n  judgment procured by extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at 430, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n  717.[6]Â \r\n  The Court determined that a statute of limitations purporting to bar all\r\n  actions to set aside a judgment would not limit &quot;a court's inherent\r\n  authority to set aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â  However, because Hagy failed to prove her consent was\r\n  obtained by fraud, the Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  Id. at 433-34, 529 S.E.2d at 719.\r\nWe find Hagy supports Petitioners' contention that this Court, the Court of\r\n  Appeals, and the circuit court have the inherent authority to set aside the\r\n  1966 quiet title action and the underlying 1946 cross-deeds if in fact they were\r\n  procured as the result of extrinsic fraud.Â  Moreover, a broad reading of Yarbrough indicates that a court could consider the ground of extrinsic fraud, if\r\n  sufficiently proven, as affecting the application of section 15-67-90.Â  See Yarbrough, 301 S.C. at 341-42, 391 S.E.2d at 875 (concluding property\r\n  claimant's action to quiet title brought seven years after title clearance\r\n  action was barred by section 15-67-90 but implicitly recognizing that extrinsic\r\n  fraud, if proven, could operate to preclude application of the three-year\r\n  statute of limitations).[7]\r\nIn view of our conclusion,\r\n  the question becomes whether Petitioners' submission of the affidavits is sufficient\r\n  to withstand Respondent's motion for summary judgment based on Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud.\r\n&quot;A judgment\r\n  may be set aside on the ground of fraud only if the fraud is 'extrinsic' and\r\n  not 'intrinsic.'&quot;Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â \r\n  Extrinsic fraud is &quot;'fraud that induces a person not to present a case or\r\n  deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.'&quot;Â  Id. at 431,\r\n  529 S.E.2d at 717-18 (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)). Â Â &quot;[R]elief is\r\n  granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that by reason of the fraud\r\n  preventing a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there never has\r\n  been a real contest before the court of the subject matter of the\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 82, 579 S.E.2d\r\n  605, 610 (2003).Â  If a judgment procured by extrinsic fraud could have been\r\n  avoided if the challenging party exercised due diligence, a court generally\r\n  will not grant relief from the judgment.Â  Center v. Center, 269 S.C.\r\n  367, 373, 237 S.E.2d 491, 494 (1977).\r\nIntrinsic fraud is\r\n  fraud which was presented and considered at trial.Â  Chewning, 354 S.C.\r\n  at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  &quot;It is fraud which misleads a court in\r\n  determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the\r\n  fraud.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nConsidering\r\n  the facts of the instant case in the procedural posture of a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, Petitioners offered evidence that arguably created a material\r\n  question of fact regarding whether the 1946 cross-deeds and 1966 quiet title\r\n  action were procured by extrinsic fraud.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Petitioners' affidavits are very detailed, they essentially outlined\r\n  Petitioners' ancestry as direct descendants of Simeon B. Pinckney and his son\r\n  Samuel James Pinckney.Â  The affidavits indicate Laura Pinckney was not married\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney and that Herbert and Ellis Pinckney were of no relation\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  The affidavits also provide that several of\r\n  Petitioners' relatives had lived on the subject property prior to the\r\n  institution of the 2005 quiet title action.Â  Additionally, the affidavits state\r\n  Petitioners were unaware of the 1966 quiet title action and did not realize until\r\n  late 2003 that portions of the 4.3-acre tract were under construction because\r\n  the property was heavily wooded and the construction was &quot;off the\r\n  road.&quot;\r\nD.\r\nHowever,\r\n  even assuming Petitioners offered sufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud to\r\n  withstand Respondent's motion for summary judgment, this alone is not\r\n  dispositive of Petitioners' appeal.Â  Instead, this case presents a unique set\r\n  of circumstances that operate to preclude Petitioners' action.\r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by our decision in Hagy, this Court recognized that the\r\n  doctrine of laches would be applicable in determining whether an action is time-barred\r\n  even if extrinsic fraud is established.Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431 n.7, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 717 n.7 (discussing the one-year statute of limitations for a\r\n  collateral attack on an adoption decree and stating &quot;[a]lthough not an\r\n  issue in this case, the doctrine of laches will apply in determining whether\r\n  such an action is barred&quot;).Â  We believe the instant case presents such a\r\n  scenario.[8]\r\n&quot;Courts have the inherent power to do all things reasonably\r\n  necessary to ensure that just results are reached to the fullest extent\r\n  possible.&quot;Â  Jones v. Leagan, 384 S.C. 1, 19, 681 S.E.2d 6, 16 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  The equitable doctrine of laches is defined as &quot;neglect for\r\n  an unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n  195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  &quot;Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his\r\n  rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his\r\n  adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise\r\n  detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to\r\n  enforce those rights.&quot;Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for\r\n    Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993). Â The party\r\n  seeking to establish laches must show: Â (1) a delay, (2) that was unreasonable\r\n  under the circumstances, and (3) prejudice. Â Hallums, 296 S.C. at 199,\r\n  371 S.E.2d at 528.Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we find Respondent established\r\n  the requisite factors to bar Petitioners' action based on the doctrine of\r\n  laches.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to challenge the 1966 quiet title action.Â \r\n  Although Petitioners claim they did not have notice of the 1966 quiet title\r\n  action until 2004, their own affidavits appear to discount this claim.Â  In the\r\n  affidavits, Petitioners assert that one of their heirs paid the county property\r\n  taxes on the Fort Johnson Road properties until at least 1988.Â  If this was in\r\n  fact the case, Petitioners would have received county tax documents that\r\n  corresponded to the respective properties.Â  After the property was sold, the\r\n  subsequent purchasers would have then received these tax documents. Â In turn,\r\n  Petitioners' failure to receive tax documents should have served as notice\r\n  regarding a problem with their title to the property.Â  Thus, given that the\r\n  deeds and the quiet title action were publicly-recorded and documented, it was\r\n  an unreasonable length of time for Petitioners to delay in instituting the 2005\r\n  quiet title action.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Respondent would be undoubtedly prejudiced if Petitioners' claim is not barred\r\n  by laches given she purchased her lot for significant consideration and has\r\n  been in possession of it since 1997 and built a family residence in 2002.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching our decision, we have thoroughly considered and are empathetic to\r\n  Petitioners' plight.Â  However, given the specific facts of the instant case, we\r\n  are compelled to hold the doctrine of laches precludes Petitioners from pursuing\r\n  their claim.Â  Here, Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to assert their rights\r\n  regarding the 1966 quiet title action.Â  We find such a flagrant and egregious\r\n  delay represents the quintessential situation that the doctrine of laches was\r\n  intended to protect.Â  For this Court to hold otherwise, we would have to\r\n  affirmatively reject this well-established equitable doctrine.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  decision should not be construed as establishing a general rule.Â  Instead, we\r\n  believe under the proper facts a claim of extrinsic fraud could be utilized to\r\n  successfully circumvent the three-year statute of limitations as established by\r\n  section 15-67-90.[9]\r\nE.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Petitioners contend the Court of Appeals erred in relying on Robinson v.\r\n    Estate of Harris (Duggan), 378 S.C. 140, 662 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 2008), cert.\r\n      granted (Apr. 10, 2009), a case involving a .5-acre tract that was part of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney's original parcel.Â  Specifically, Petitioners assert the\r\n  Court of Appeals erred in applying section 15-39-870,[10] as the .5-acre tract at issue in the above-cited Duggan case was obtained by\r\n  defendant Daniel Duggan via a different chain of title than Respondents'\r\n  property.Â  Thus, Petitioners contend the Duggan case involved a tract of land\r\n  that was not the subject of the 1966 quiet title action, but rather was\r\n  foreclosed upon and sold to Duggan at a judicial sale pursuant to section\r\n  15-39-870.Â  Because the 4.3-acre tract at issue in the instant case was not\r\n  sold at a judicial sale, Petitioners assert the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  applying section 15-39-870 to Respondents' case. \r\nWe hold\r\n  Petitioners' argument to be without merit as the Court of Appeals cited Robinson,\r\n  the Duggan case, merely to establish the general prerequisites to institute the\r\n  protection of Respondent as bona fide purchaser for value.Â  Because the\r\n  requirements of a bona fide purchaser are the same in relation to section\r\n  30-7-10 or section 15-39-870, it is inconsequential that the Court of Appeals\r\n  cited Robinson which applied section 15-39-870.Â  See Spence v.\r\n    Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 117, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874-75 (2006) (outlining\r\n  well-established requirements to invoke protection as a bona fide purchaser for\r\n  value and discussing limitations of the status of a bona fide purchaser in\r\n  situations involving deeds that are void ab initio).Â  Moreover, a\r\n  determination as to the propriety of the Robinson citation is\r\n  unnecessary given our decision to affirm the grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Respondent based on the doctrine of laches.\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the circuit court properly granted Respondent's\r\n  motion for summary judgment. Even assuming Petitioners sufficiently established\r\n  their extrinsic fraud claim to avoid the three-year statute of limitations\r\n  provided for in section 15-67-90, we hold the doctrine of laches operates to\r\n  bar their claim.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE, J, Acting Justices James E. Moore and E. C. Burnett, III,\r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Section 15-67-90 provides:\r\n\r\n  No judgment or decree quieting title to land or determining the\r\n    title thereto, or adverse claims therein, shall be adjudged invalid or set\r\n    aside for any reason, unless the action or proceeding to vacate or set aside\r\n    such judgment or decree shall be commenced or application for leave to defend\r\n    be made within three years from the time of filing for record a certified copy\r\n    of such judgment or decree in the office of the clerk of court of the county in\r\n    which the lands affected by such judgment or decree are situated or, in case of\r\n    minors, within three years after coming of age.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-67-90 (2005).\r\n[2] Section 30-7-10 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  All\r\n    deeds of conveyance of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, either in fee simple\r\n    or for life . . . and generally all instruments in writing conveying an\r\n    interest in real estate required by law to be recorded . . . are valid so as to\r\n    affect the rights of subsequentÂ  . . . purchasers for valuable consideration\r\n    without notice, only from the day and hour when they are recorded in the office\r\n    of the register of deeds or clerk of court of the county in which the real\r\n    property affected is situated.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  30-7-10 (2007).\r\n[3]Â Petitioners gave a detailed account of their\r\n  family's lineage dating back to the death of Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  Essentially,\r\n  Petitioners alleged they were the true heirs and subsequent-interest holders of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, descended through his true heirs, Samuel James Pinckney and\r\n  Mary Pinckney.Â  Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney (who later assumed the\r\n  married name of Heyward) was Samuel James Pinckney's sister-in-law.Â  Based on\r\n  this allegation, Petitioners asserted Laura Pinckney Heyward obtained the 1946\r\n  deeds by falsely claiming to be the wife of Simeon B. Pinckney (instead of\r\n  Isabella Pinckney, Simeon B. Pinckney's &quot;true spouse&quot;) and claiming\r\n  that Simeon B. Pinckney's sole heirs were herself and her sons Herbert and\r\n  Ellis Pinckney.Â  According to Petitioners, Samuel James Pinckney was alive in\r\n  1946 and may have been living on a portion of the original 20-acre tract with\r\n  his wife and children.Â  However, Petitioners claimed that neither Samuel James\r\n  Pinckney nor any of the other legitimate heirs could read or write and, thus,\r\n  did not have notice of the 1946 deeds.Â  Â Â \r\n[4]Â By way of publication, Laura Pinckney Heyward served\r\n  the 1966 quiet title action to &quot;unknown persons.&quot;Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 10-2404 (1962) (precursor to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-40 (2005),\r\n  which provides for service by publication for &quot;unknown persons defendant&quot;\r\n  in an action to determine adverse claims to real property within this state); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-40 (2005) (&quot;Service of the\r\n  summons may be had upon all such unknown persons defendant by publication in\r\n  the same manner as against nonresident defendants, upon the filing of an\r\n  affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, stating the existence of a cause\r\n  of action to try adverse claims within this State.&quot;).\r\n[5]Â In Yarbrough, the property claimant filed an\r\n  action to vacate a seven-year-old judgment quieting title to approximately ten\r\n  acres of land.Â  Yarbrough claimed the judgment was procured through extrinsic\r\n  fraud.Â  Id. at 341, 391 S.E.2d at 874.Â  The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment to the defendants on the ground the action was time-barred by section\r\n  15-67-90.Â  Id. at 341, 391 S.E.2d at 875.Â  On appeal, the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.Â  In so ruling, the court found\r\n  that &quot;[n]othing in this record demonstrates Yarbrough's knowledge\r\n  regarding her claim of extrinsic fraud was any different in 1981 than it was in\r\n  1988.&quot;Â  Id. at 342, 391 S.E.2d at 875.Â Â  \r\n[6]Â The Court referenced Yarbrough but noted that\r\n  there was no comparable challenge to the statute of limitations in that case.Â  Hagy,\r\n  339 S.C. at 430 n.5, 529 S.E.2d at 717 n.5.\r\n[7]Â Based on our finding that section 15-67-90 is not an\r\n  &quot;absolute bar,&quot; we need not address Petitioners' issue as to whether\r\n  this statute violates the due process clauses of our state and federal\r\n  constitutions. Â See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3 (stating no person shall be deprived of life,\r\n  liberty, or property without due process of law).\r\n[8] The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's\r\n  order based on section 15-67-90 and Respondent's status as a bona fide\r\n  purchaser for value without notice.Â  Petitioners, however, failed to raise any\r\n  arguments in their petition for rehearing or initial brief to this Court regarding\r\n  the circuit court's ruling as to the doctrine of laches.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the doctrine of laches is the law of the case and this Court is justified in\r\n  affirming on that basis.Â  See Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168,\r\n  432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (recognizing that where a\r\n  decision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm\r\n  unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will\r\n  become the law of the case); see also Rule 242(d)(2), SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Only those questions raised in the Court of Appeals and in the petition\r\n  for rehearing shall be included in the petition for writ of certiorari as a\r\n  question presented to the Supreme Court.&quot;).Â  However, because this case\r\n  presents us with an opportunity to address the applicability of the doctrine of\r\n  laches to section 15-67-90, we have chosen to analyze the merits of this\r\n  doctrine rather than merely rely on procedural rules to reach our ultimate\r\n  disposition.\r\n[9] To conclude otherwise, we believe, would require\r\n  property owners to check the title to their property every three years.\r\n[10] Section 15-39-870 provides:\r\n\r\n  Upon\r\n    execution and delivery by the proper officer of the court of a deed for any property\r\n    sold at a judicial sale under a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction the\r\n    proceedings under which such sale is made shall be deemed res judicata as to\r\n    any and all bona fide purchasers for value without notice, notwithstanding such\r\n    sale may not subsequently be confirmed by the court.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Estate of Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-649 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In this opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\n  circuit court order that granted summary judgment in favor of David L. Savage\r\n  and Lisa M. Shogry-Savage on the grounds Petitioners' action to set aside a\r\n  1966 quiet title action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations as\r\n  established by section 15-67-90 of the South Carolina Code,[1] David L. Savage and Lisa M. Shogry-Savage are bona fide purchasers\r\n  for value without notice pursuant to the recording statute as established by\r\n  section 30-7-10 of the South Carolina Code,[2] and Petitioners' action was barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nThis\r\n  action involves a portion of a 20-acre tract of land located on Fort Johnson\r\n  Road, in James Island, South Carolina.Â  The tract was formerly owned by Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney, who died intestate in 1921 and allegedly left a wife, Laura Pinckney,\r\n  and two sons, Ellis and Herbert Pinckney, as his heirs.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  land held by Simeon B. Pinckney originated from a conveyance to him by deed\r\n  executed in 1874 (and recorded in 1875) from Thomas Moore.Â  The property was\r\n  described as being 20 acres, more or less.Â  In 1888, Simeon B. Pinckney\r\n  conveyed 5 acres of this property to his wife, Isabella Pinckney, leaving\r\n  approximately 15 acres.Â  A survey conducted in 1923, however, found that\r\n  exactly 14.3 acres remained. \r\nIn\r\n  1946, Laura Pinckney, Ellis Pinckney, and Herbert Pinckney executed two cross-deeds\r\n  that divided the 14.3-acre parcel among themselves, creating a 4.3-acre tract and\r\n  a 10-acre tract.[3]Â \r\n  One of the 1946 cross-deeds conveyed the 4.3-acre tract to Herbert Pinckney and\r\n  the other deed conveyed the 10-acre tract to Ellis Pinckney.Â  In 1966, after\r\n  Herbert Pinckney died intestate, Laura Pinckney Heyward brought a successful action\r\n  to quiet title to the 4.3-acre tract held by Herbert.[4]Â \r\n  None of the Petitioners or their predecessors-in-interest filed responsive\r\n  pleadings in the 1966 proceeding. \r\nAs\r\n  the result of subsequent conveyances, the 4.3-acre tract was ultimately divided\r\n  into four lots.Â  The owners of these lots are as follows:Â  (1) The Converse\r\n  Company (Lot #1); (2) Martine A. Hutton (Lot #2); (3) David Savage and Lisa M.\r\n  Shogry-Savage (Lot #3); and (4) Debbie (Shogry) Dinovo (Lot #4).Â  The instant\r\n  case involves the interests of David L. Savage and Lisa M. Shogry-Savage\r\n  (&quot;Respondents&quot;).Â  \r\nOn February\r\n  1, 2005, Petitioners filed an action to quiet title to several tracts of land\r\n  located on James Island, including the 4.3-acre tract at issue in the instant\r\n  case.Â  In their Complaint, Petitioners sought &quot;to establish their\r\n  legitimate relationship as lineal descendants and heirs&quot; of Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney.Â  The first twenty-five named Petitioners claimed they were heirs of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, and the remaining Petitioners claimed they purchased\r\n  interests in the property and were the legitimate owners of those interests.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of these claims, Petitioners alleged the 1946 deeds and 1966 action to\r\n  quiet title were fraudulent and were undertaken without consideration for the\r\n  rights or interests of Petitioners and other heirs.Â  Specifically, Petitioners asserted\r\n  the 4.3-acre tract was fraudulently conveyed to Herbert Pinckney in 1946 and,\r\n  thereafter, wrongly passed by inheritance to his mother Laura Pinckney Heyward at\r\n  Herbert's death.Â  Additionally, Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney Heyward fraudulently\r\n  procured the 1966 quiet title action to the 4.3-acre tract when neither she nor\r\n  Herbert Pinckney owned any interest in the tract.Â  Finally, Petitioners alleged\r\n  they did not become aware of the 1946 deeds, of the 1966 quiet title action, or\r\n  of any other action affecting their title to the property until 2004.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these allegations, Petitioners sought &quot;(a) a determination of all\r\n  owners of the four (4) tracts of property, . . . a determination of each\r\n  owner's respective rights and interests in said tracts, and the quieting of the\r\n  titles to these four (4) tracts and (b) the sale of the respective owners'\r\n  interests in these four (4) tracts.&quot;Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  answered and filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  In their answer and motion,\r\n  Respondents raised a number of affirmative defenses, including the doctrines of\r\n  laches, estoppel, waiver, bona fide purchaser for value, res judicata,\r\n  collateral estoppel, and the applicable statute of limitations.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response to the motion for summary judgment, Petitioners argued their claim was\r\n  not barred by section 15-67-90 given the 1966 quiet title action was the result\r\n  of extrinsic fraud.Â  Because they offered affidavits supporting their claim\r\n  that the 1966 quiet title action was procured through fraud and forgery,\r\n  Petitioners contended their action was distinguishable from the case of Yarbrough\r\n    v. Collins, 301 S.C. 339, 391 S.E.2d 873 (Ct. App. 1990).[5]\r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents.Â \r\n  In doing so, the court found Petitioners' claims were barred by: Â (1) the\r\n  three-year statute of limitations, codified in section 15-67-90, which\r\n  prohibits setting aside &quot;for any reason&quot; a judgment quieting title to\r\n  land; (2) Respondents are bona fide purchasers for value without notice pursuant\r\n  to section 30-7-10, the recording statute; and (3) the doctrine of laches.Â \r\n  Because Petitioners were not parties to the 1966 quiet title action, the\r\n  circuit court judge found the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res\r\n    judicata were not applicable.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  appealed the circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  Â \r\nIn a\r\n  summary opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See Robinson v. Estate of Harris, Op.\r\n  No. 2008-UP-649 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In support of its\r\n  decision, the court cited: Â (1) the three-year statute of limitations as\r\n  codified in section 15-67-90; (2) Yarbrough as interpreting section\r\n  15-67-90; (3) Robinson v. Estate of Harris, 378 S.C. 140, 662 S.E.2d 420\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008), cert. granted (Apr. 10, 2009); and (4) Burnett v.\r\n    Holiday Brothers, Inc., 279 S.C. 222, 225, 305 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1983), to\r\n  reference the purpose of the recording statute as codified in section 30-7-10.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitioners' request for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals. \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same\r\n  standard as that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  \r\nRule\r\n  56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial\r\n  court may grant a motion for summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;\r\n  Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot; Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006). \r\nB.\r\nIn essence, Petitioners contend summary judgment was\r\n  improperly granted given that significant and material questions of fact exist relating\r\n  to extrinsic fraud and forgery in the underlying 1966 quiet title action and\r\n  the 1946 cross-deeds upon which the action was based.\r\nIn support of this contention, Petitioners argue the\r\n  circuit court and the Court of Appeals erred in determining that section\r\n  15-67-90 constitutes an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to setting aside judgments\r\n  quieting title to land.Â  Because they submitted affidavits in support of their\r\n  claims of extrinsic fraud and forgery, Petitioners assert their cause of action\r\n  is distinguishable from Yarbrough and should not have been procedurally\r\n  barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  \r\nC.\r\nIn analyzing\r\n  Petitioners' arguments, we must determine whether section 15-67-90 constitutes\r\n  an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to Petitioners' action or whether Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud supersedes the application of this statute of\r\n  limitations.\r\nThis determination\r\n  requires us to revisit our decision in Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 714 (2000). Â In Hagy, the biological parents brought an action in\r\n  1994 to set aside the 1992 adoption of their daughter on the ground that their\r\n  consent to the adoption was induced by fraudulent statements made by the\r\n  adoptive parents, who were also the biological mother's father and stepmother.Â  Id. at 428-29, 529 S.E.2d at 716.Â  In response, the adoptive parents\r\n  defended on the merits and asserted the action was time-barred by section\r\n  20-7-1800 of the South Carolina Code, which at the time provided:Â  &quot;No\r\n  final decree of adoption is subject to collateral attack for any reason after a\r\n  period of one year following its issuance.&quot;Â  Id. at 429, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 716.Â  The family court concluded the time bar did not apply to actions to\r\n  set aside an adoption for fraud.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the family\r\n  court's decision, finding section 20-7-1800 barred the action because it was\r\n  commenced more than one year after the final adoption decree was commenced.Â  Id. Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this Court affirmed as modified the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â \r\n  In so ruling, this Court considered the novel question of &quot;whether a\r\n  facially applicable statute of limitation will bar an action to set aside a\r\n  judgment procured by extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at 430, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n  717.[6]Â \r\n  The Court determined that a statute of limitations purporting to bar all\r\n  actions to set aside a judgment would not limit &quot;a court's inherent\r\n  authority to set aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â  However, because Hagy failed to prove her consent was\r\n  obtained by fraud, the Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  Id. at 433-34, 529 S.E.2d at 719.\r\nWe find Hagy supports Petitioners' contention that this Court, the Court of\r\n  Appeals, and the circuit court have the inherent authority to set aside the\r\n  1966 quiet title action and the underlying 1946 cross-deeds if in fact they were\r\n  procured as the result of extrinsic fraud.Â  Moreover, a broad reading of Yarbrough indicates that a court could consider the ground of extrinsic fraud, if\r\n  sufficiently proven, as affecting the application of section 15-67-90.Â  See Yarbrough, 301 S.C. at 341-42, 391 S.E.2d at 875 (concluding property\r\n  claimant's action to quiet title brought seven years after title clearance\r\n  action was barred by section 15-67-90 but implicitly recognizing that extrinsic\r\n  fraud, if proven, could operate to preclude application of the three-year\r\n  statute of limitations).[7]\r\nIn view of our conclusion,\r\n  the question becomes whether Petitioners' submission of the affidavits is sufficient\r\n  to withstand Respondents' motion for summary judgment based on Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud.\r\n&quot;A judgment\r\n  may be set aside on the ground of fraud only if the fraud is 'extrinsic' and\r\n  not 'intrinsic.'&quot;Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â \r\n  Extrinsic fraud is &quot;'fraud that induces a person not to present a case or\r\n  deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.'&quot;Â  Id. at 431,\r\n  529 S.E.2d at 717-18 (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)). Â Â &quot;[R]elief is\r\n  granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that by reason of the fraud\r\n  preventing a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there never has\r\n  been a real contest before the court of the subject matter of the\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 82, 579 S.E.2d\r\n  605, 610 (2003).Â  If a judgment procured by extrinsic fraud could have been\r\n  avoided if the challenging party exercised due diligence, a court generally\r\n  will not grant relief from the judgment.Â  Center v. Center, 269 S.C. 367,\r\n  373, 237 S.E.2d 491, 494 (1977).\r\nIntrinsic fraud is\r\n  fraud which was presented and considered at trial.Â  Chewning, 354 S.C.\r\n  at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  &quot;It is fraud which misleads a court in\r\n  determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the\r\n  fraud.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nConsidering\r\n  the facts of the instant case in the procedural posture of a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, Petitioners offered evidence that arguably created a material\r\n  question of fact regarding whether the 1946 cross-deeds and 1966 quiet title\r\n  action were procured by extrinsic fraud.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Petitioners' affidavits are very detailed, they essentially outlined\r\n  Petitioners' ancestry as direct descendants of Simeon B. Pinckney and his son\r\n  Samuel James Pinckney.Â  The affidavits indicate Laura Pinckney was not married\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney and that Herbert and Ellis Pinckney were of no relation\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  The affidavits also provide that several of\r\n  Petitioners' relatives had lived on the subject property prior to the\r\n  institution of the 2005 quiet title action.Â  Additionally, the affidavits state\r\n  Petitioners were unaware of the 1966 quiet title action and did not realize until\r\n  late 2003 that portions of the 4.3-acre tract were under construction because\r\n  the property was heavily wooded and the construction was &quot;off the\r\n  road.&quot;\r\nD.\r\nHowever,\r\n  even assuming Petitioners offered sufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud to\r\n  withstand Respondents' motion for summary judgment, this alone is not\r\n  dispositive of Petitioners' appeal.Â  Instead, this case presents a unique set\r\n  of circumstances that operate to preclude Petitioners' action.\r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by our decision in Hagy, this Court recognized that the\r\n  doctrine of laches would be applicable in determining whether an action is time-barred\r\n  even if extrinsic fraud is established.Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431 n.7, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 717 n.7 (discussing the one-year statute of limitations for a\r\n  collateral attack on an adoption decree and stating &quot;[a]lthough not an\r\n  issue in this case, the doctrine of laches will apply in determining whether\r\n  such an action is barred&quot;).Â  We believe the instant case presents such a\r\n  scenario.[8]\r\n&quot;Courts have the inherent power to do all things reasonably\r\n  necessary to ensure that just results are reached to the fullest extent\r\n  possible.&quot;Â  Jones v. Leagan, 384 S.C. 1, 19, 681 S.E.2d 6, 16 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  The equitable doctrine of laches is defined as &quot;neglect for\r\n  an unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n  195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  &quot;Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his\r\n  rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his\r\n  adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise\r\n  detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to\r\n  enforce those rights.&quot;Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for\r\n    Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993). Â The party\r\n  seeking to establish laches must show: Â (1) a delay, (2) that was unreasonable\r\n  under the circumstances, and (3) prejudice. Â Hallums, 296 S.C. at 199,\r\n  371 S.E.2d at 528.Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we find Respondents established\r\n  the requisite factors to bar Petitioners' action based on the doctrine of\r\n  laches.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to challenge the 1966 quiet title action.Â \r\n  Although Petitioners claim they did not have notice of the 1966 quiet title\r\n  action until 2004, their own affidavits appear to discount this claim.Â  In the\r\n  affidavits, Petitioners assert that one of their heirs paid the county property\r\n  taxes on the Fort Johnson Road properties until at least 1988.Â  If this was in\r\n  fact the case, Petitioners would have received county tax documents that\r\n  corresponded to the respective properties.Â  After the property was sold, the\r\n  subsequent purchasers would have then received these tax documents. Â In turn,\r\n  Petitioners' failure to receive tax documents should have served as notice\r\n  regarding a problem with their title to the property.Â  Thus, given that the\r\n  deeds and the quiet title action were publicly-recorded and documented, it was\r\n  an unreasonable length of time for Petitioners to delay in instituting the 2005\r\n  quiet title action.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Respondents would be undoubtedly prejudiced if Petitioners' claim is not barred\r\n  by laches given they purchased their lot for significant consideration and have\r\n  been in possession of it since 1996 and built a family residence in 2002.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching our decision, we have thoroughly considered and are empathetic to\r\n  Petitioners' plight.Â  However, given the specific facts of the instant case, we\r\n  are compelled to hold the doctrine of laches precludes Petitioners from\r\n  pursuing their claim.Â  Here, Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to assert\r\n  their rights regarding the 1966 quiet title action.Â  We find such a flagrant\r\n  and egregious delay represents the quintessential situation that the doctrine\r\n  of laches was intended to protect.Â  For this Court to hold otherwise, we would\r\n  have to affirmatively reject this well-established equitable doctrine.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  decision should not be construed as establishing a general rule.Â  Instead, we\r\n  believe under the proper facts a claim of extrinsic fraud could be utilized to\r\n  successfully circumvent the three-year statute of limitations as established by\r\n  section 15-67-90.[9]\r\nE.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Petitioners contend the Court of Appeals erred in relying on Robinson v.\r\n    Estate of Harris (Duggan), 378 S.C. 140, 662 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 2008), cert.\r\n      granted (Apr. 10, 2009), a case involving a .5-acre tract that was part of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney's original parcel.Â  Specifically, Petitioners assert the\r\n  Court of Appeals erred in applying section 15-39-870,[10] as the .5-acre tract at issue in the above-cited Duggan case was obtained by\r\n  defendant Daniel Duggan via a different chain of title than Respondents'\r\n  property.Â  Thus, Petitioners contend the Duggan case involved a tract of land\r\n  that was not the subject of the 1966 quiet title action, but rather was\r\n  foreclosed upon and sold to Duggan at a judicial sale pursuant to section\r\n  15-39-870.Â  Because the 4.3-acre tract at issue in the instant case was not\r\n  sold at a judicial sale, Petitioners assert the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  applying section 15-39-870 to Respondents' case. \r\nWe hold\r\n  Petitioners' argument to be without merit as the Court of Appeals cited Robinson,\r\n  the Duggan case, merely to establish the general prerequisites to institute the\r\n  protection of Respondents as bona fide purchasers for value.Â  Because the\r\n  requirements of a bona fide purchaser are the same in relation to section\r\n  30-7-10 or section 15-39-870, it is inconsequential that the Court of Appeals\r\n  cited Robinson which applied section 15-39-870.Â  See Spence v.\r\n    Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 117, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874-75 (2006) (outlining\r\n  well-established requirements to invoke protection as a bona fide purchaser for\r\n  value and discussing limitations of the status of a bona fide purchaser in\r\n  situations involving deeds that are void ab initio).Â  Moreover, a\r\n  determination as to the propriety of the Robinson citation is\r\n  unnecessary given our decision to affirm the grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Respondents based on the doctrine of laches.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the circuit court properly granted Respondents'\r\n  motion for summary judgment. Even assuming Petitioners sufficiently established\r\n  their extrinsic fraud claim to avoid the three-year statute of limitations\r\n  provided for in section 15-67-90, we hold the doctrine of laches operates to\r\n  bar their claim.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE, J, Acting Justices James E.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n  30-7-10 (2007).\r\n[3]Â  Petitioners gave a detailed account of their\r\n  family's lineage dating back to the death of Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  Essentially,\r\n  Petitioners alleged they were the true heirs and subsequent-interest holders of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, descended through his true heirs, Samuel James Pinckney and\r\n  Mary Pinckney.Â  Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney (who later assumed the\r\n  married name of Heyward) was Samuel James Pinckney's sister-in-law.Â  Based on\r\n  this allegation, Petitioners asserted Laura Pinckney Heyward obtained the 1946\r\n  deeds by falsely claiming to be the wife of Simeon B. Pinckney (instead of\r\n  Isabella Pinckney, Simeon B. Pinckney's &quot;true spouse&quot;) and claiming\r\n  that Simeon B. Pinckney's sole heirs were herself and her sons Herbert and\r\n  Ellis Pinckney.Â  According to Petitioners, Samuel James Pinckney was alive in 1946\r\n  and may have been living on a portion of the original 20-acre tract with his\r\n  wife and children.Â  However, Petitioners claimed that neither Samuel James\r\n  Pinckney nor any of the other legitimate heirs could read or write and, thus,\r\n  did not have notice of the 1946 deeds.Â  Â Â \r\n[4]Â  By way of publication, Laura Pinckney Heyward served\r\n  the 1966 quiet title action to &quot;unknown persons.&quot;Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

Estate of Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-648 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In this opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\n  circuit court order that granted summary judgment in favor of The Converse\r\n  Company, LLC (&quot;Converse&quot;) on the grounds Petitioners' action to set\r\n  aside a 1966 quiet title action was barred by the three-year statute of\r\n  limitations as established by section 15-67-90 of the South Carolina Code,[1] Converse is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice\r\n  pursuant to the recording statute as established by section 30-7-10 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code,[2] and Petitioners' action was barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nThis\r\n  action involves a portion of a 20-acre tract of land located on Fort Johnson\r\n  Road, in James Island, South Carolina.Â  The tract was formerly owned by Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney, who died intestate in 1921 and allegedly left a wife, Laura Pinckney,\r\n  and two sons, Ellis and Herbert Pinckney, as his heirs.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  land held by Simeon B. Pinckney originated from a conveyance to him by deed\r\n  executed in 1874 (and recorded in 1875) from Thomas Moore.Â  The property was\r\n  described as being 20 acres, more or less.Â  In 1888, Simeon B. Pinckney\r\n  conveyed 5 acres of this property to his wife, Isabella Pinckney, leaving\r\n  approximately 15 acres.Â  A survey conducted in 1923, however, found that\r\n  exactly 14.3 acres remained. \r\nIn\r\n  1946, Laura Pinckney, Ellis Pinckney, and Herbert Pinckney executed two cross-deeds\r\n  that divided the 14.3-acre parcel among themselves, creating a 4.3-acre tract and\r\n  a 10-acre tract.[3]Â \r\n  One of the 1946 cross-deeds conveyed the 4.3-acre tract to Herbert Pinckney and\r\n  the other deed conveyed the 10-acre tract to Ellis Pinckney.Â  In 1966, after\r\n  Herbert Pinckney died intestate, Laura Pinckney Heyward brought a successful action\r\n  to quiet title to the 4.3-acre tract held by Herbert.[4]Â \r\n  None of the Petitioners or their predecessors-in-interest filed responsive\r\n  pleadings in the 1966 proceeding. \r\nAs\r\n  the result of subsequent conveyances, the 4.3-acre tract was ultimately divided\r\n  into four lots.Â  The owners of these lots are as follows:Â  (1) The Converse\r\n  Company, LLC (Lot #1); (2) Martine A. Hutton (Lot #2); (3) David Savage and\r\n  Lisa M. Shogry-Savage (Lot #3); and (4) Debbie (Shogry) Dinovo (Lot #4).Â  The\r\n  instant case involves the interests of Converse (&quot;Respondent&quot;).Â  \r\nOn February\r\n  1, 2005, Petitioners filed an action to quiet title to several tracts of land\r\n  located on James Island, including the 4.3-acre tract at issue in the instant\r\n  case.Â  In their Complaint, Petitioners sought &quot;to establish their\r\n  legitimate relationship as lineal descendants and heirs&quot; of Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney.Â  The first twenty-five named Petitioners claimed they were heirs of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, and the remaining Petitioners claimed they purchased\r\n  interests in the property and were the legitimate owners of those interests.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of these claims, Petitioners alleged the 1946 deeds and 1966 action to\r\n  quiet title were fraudulent and were undertaken without consideration for the\r\n  rights or interests of Petitioners and other heirs.Â  Specifically, Petitioners asserted\r\n  the 4.3-acre tract was fraudulently conveyed to Herbert Pinckney in 1946 and,\r\n  thereafter, wrongly passed by inheritance to his mother Laura Pinckney Heyward at\r\n  Herbert's death.Â  Additionally, Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney Heyward fraudulently\r\n  procured the 1966 quiet title action to the 4.3-acre tract when neither she nor\r\n  Herbert Pinckney owned any interest in the tract.Â  Finally, Petitioners alleged\r\n  they did not become aware of the 1946 deeds, of the 1966 quiet title action, or\r\n  of any other action affecting their title to the property until 2004.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these allegations, Petitioners sought &quot;(a) a determination of all\r\n  owners of the four (4) tracts of property, . . . a determination of each\r\n  owner's respective rights and interests in said tracts, and the quieting of the\r\n  titles to these four (4) tracts and (b) the sale of the respective owners'\r\n  interests in these four (4) tracts.&quot;Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  answered and filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  In its answer, Respondent\r\n  raised a number of affirmative defenses and counterclaims, including laches,\r\n  stale demand, equitable estoppel, waiver, bona fide purchaser for value, betterment,\r\n  acquiescence, adverse possession, presumption of grant, slander of title, and\r\n  the applicable statute of limitations.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  response to the motion for summary judgment, Petitioners argued their claim was\r\n  not barred by section 15-67-90 given the 1966 quiet title action was the result\r\n  of extrinsic fraud.Â  Because they offered affidavits supporting their claim\r\n  that the 1966 quiet title action was procured through fraud and forgery,\r\n  Petitioners contended their action was distinguishable from the case of Yarbrough\r\n    v. Collins, 301 S.C. 339, 391 S.E.2d 873 (Ct. App. 1990).[5]\r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent.Â \r\n  In so ruling, the circuit court relied on its previously-issued order granting\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Respondent's predecessor-in-interest Shogry-Savage.[6] Â Therefore, the circuit court found Petitioners' action was barred by the\r\n  operation of section 15-67-90, the fact that Respondent is a bona fide\r\n  purchaser for value without notice pursuant to section 30-7-10, and the\r\n  doctrine of laches.\r\nPetitioners\r\n  appealed the circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  Â \r\nIn a\r\n  summary opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See Robinson v. Estate of Harris, Op.\r\n  No. 2008-UP-648 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In support of its\r\n  decision, the court cited: Â (1) the three-year statute of limitations as\r\n  codified in section 15-67-90; and (2) Yarbrough as interpreting section\r\n  15-67-90.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitioners' request for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals. \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same\r\n  standard as that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  \r\nRule\r\n  56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial\r\n  court may grant a motion for summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;\r\n  Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot; Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006). \r\nB.\r\nIn essence, Petitioners contend summary judgment was\r\n  improperly granted given that significant and material questions of fact exist relating\r\n  to extrinsic fraud and forgery in the underlying 1966 quiet title action and\r\n  the 1946 cross-deeds upon which the action was based.\r\nÂ In support of this contention, Petitioners argue the\r\n  circuit court and the Court of Appeals erred in determining that section\r\n  15-67-90 constitutes an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to setting aside judgments\r\n  quieting title to land.Â  Because they submitted affidavits in support of their\r\n  claims of extrinsic fraud and forgery, Petitioners assert their cause of action\r\n  is distinguishable from Yarbrough and should not have been procedurally\r\n  barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  \r\nC.\r\nIn analyzing\r\n  Petitioners' arguments, we must determine whether section 15-67-90 constitutes\r\n  an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to Petitioners' action or whether Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud supersedes the application of this statute of\r\n  limitations.\r\nThis determination\r\n  requires us to revisit our decision in Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 714 (2000). Â In Hagy, the biological parents brought an action in\r\n  1994 to set aside the 1992 adoption of their daughter on the ground that their\r\n  consent to the adoption was induced by fraudulent statements made by the\r\n  adoptive parents, who were also the biological mother's father and stepmother.Â  Id. at 428-29, 529 S.E.2d at 716.Â  In response, the adoptive parents\r\n  defended on the merits and asserted the action was time-barred by section\r\n  20-7-1800 of the South Carolina Code, which at the time provided:Â  &quot;No\r\n  final decree of adoption is subject to collateral attack for any reason after a\r\n  period of one year following its issuance.&quot;Â  Id. at 429, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 716.Â  The family court concluded the time bar did not apply to actions to\r\n  set aside an adoption for fraud.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the family\r\n  court's decision, finding section 20-7-1800 barred the action because it was\r\n  commenced more than one year after the final adoption decree was commenced.Â  Id. Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this Court affirmed as modified the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â \r\n  In so ruling, this Court considered the novel question of &quot;whether a\r\n  facially applicable statute of limitation will bar an action to set aside a\r\n  judgment procured by extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at 430, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n  717.[7]Â \r\n  The Court determined that a statute of limitations purporting to bar all\r\n  actions to set aside a judgment would not limit &quot;a court's inherent\r\n  authority to set aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â  However, because Hagy failed to prove her consent was\r\n  obtained by fraud, the Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  Id. at 433-34, 529 S.E.2d at 719.\r\nWe find Hagy supports Petitioners' contention that this Court, the Court of\r\n  Appeals, and the circuit court have the inherent authority to set aside the\r\n  1966 quiet title action and the underlying 1946 cross-deeds if in fact they were\r\n  procured as the result of extrinsic fraud.Â  Moreover, a broad reading of Yarbrough indicates that a court could consider the ground of extrinsic fraud, if\r\n  sufficiently proven, as affecting the application of section 15-67-90.Â  See Yarbrough, 301 S.C. at 341-42, 391 S.E.2d at 875 (concluding property\r\n  claimant's action to quiet title brought seven years after title clearance\r\n  action was barred by section 15-67-90 but implicitly recognizing that extrinsic\r\n  fraud, if proven, could operate to preclude application of the three-year\r\n  statute of limitations).[8]\r\nIn view of our conclusion,\r\n  the question becomes whether Petitioners' submission of the affidavits is sufficient\r\n  to withstand Respondent's motion for summary judgment based on Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud.\r\n&quot;A judgment\r\n  may be set aside on the ground of fraud only if the fraud is 'extrinsic' and\r\n  not 'intrinsic.'&quot;Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â \r\n  Extrinsic fraud is &quot;'fraud that induces a person not to present a case or\r\n  deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.'&quot;Â  Id. at 431,\r\n  529 S.E.2d at 717-18 (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)). Â Â &quot;[R]elief is\r\n  granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that by reason of the fraud\r\n  preventing a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there never has\r\n  been a real contest before the court of the subject matter of the\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 82, 579 S.E.2d\r\n  605, 610 (2003).Â  If a judgment procured by extrinsic fraud could have been\r\n  avoided if the challenging party exercised due diligence, a court generally\r\n  will not grant relief from the judgment.Â  Center v. Center, 269 S.C. 367,\r\n  373, 237 S.E.2d 491, 494 (1977).\r\nIntrinsic fraud is\r\n  fraud which was presented and considered at trial.Â  Chewning, 354 S.C.\r\n  at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  &quot;It is fraud which misleads a court in\r\n  determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the\r\n  fraud.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nConsidering\r\n  the facts of the instant case in the procedural posture of a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, Petitioners offered evidence that arguably created a material\r\n  question of fact regarding whether the 1946 cross-deeds and 1966 quiet title\r\n  action were procured by extrinsic fraud.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Petitioners' affidavits are very detailed, they essentially outlined\r\n  Petitioners' ancestry as direct descendants of Simeon B. Pinckney and his son\r\n  Samuel James Pinckney.Â  The affidavits indicate Laura Pinckney was not married\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney and that Herbert and Ellis Pinckney were of no relation\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  The affidavits also provide that several of\r\n  Petitioners' relatives had lived on the subject property prior to the\r\n  institution of the 2005 quiet title action.Â  Additionally, the affidavits state\r\n  Petitioners were unaware of the 1966 quiet title action and did not realize until\r\n  late 2003 that portions of the 4.3-acre tract were under construction because\r\n  the property was heavily wooded and the construction was &quot;off the\r\n  road.&quot;\r\nD.\r\nHowever,\r\n  even assuming Petitioners offered sufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud to\r\n  withstand Respondent's motion for summary judgment, this alone is not\r\n  dispositive of Petitioners' appeal.Â  Instead, this case presents a unique set\r\n  of circumstances that operate to preclude Petitioners' action.\r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by our decision in Hagy, this Court recognized that the\r\n  doctrine of laches would be applicable in determining whether an action is time-barred\r\n  even if extrinsic fraud is established.Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431 n.7, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 717 n.7 (discussing the one-year statute of limitations for a\r\n  collateral attack on an adoption decree and stating &quot;[a]lthough not an\r\n  issue in this case, the doctrine of laches will apply in determining whether\r\n  such an action is barred&quot;).Â  We believe the instant case presents such a\r\n  scenario.[9]\r\n&quot;Courts have the inherent power to do all things reasonably\r\n  necessary to ensure that just results are reached to the fullest extent\r\n  possible.&quot;Â  Jones v. Leagan, 384 S.C. 1, 19, 681 S.E.2d 6, 16 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  The equitable doctrine of laches is defined as &quot;neglect for\r\n  an unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n  195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  &quot;Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his\r\n  rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his\r\n  adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise\r\n  detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to\r\n  enforce those rights.&quot;Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for\r\n    Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993). Â The party\r\n  seeking to establish laches must show: Â (1) a delay, (2) that was unreasonable\r\n  under the circumstances, and (3) prejudice. Â Hallums, 296 S.C. at 199,\r\n  371 S.E.2d at 528.Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we find Respondent established\r\n  the requisite factors to bar Petitioners' action based on the doctrine of\r\n  laches.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to challenge the 1966 quiet title action.Â \r\n  Although Petitioners claim they did not have notice of the 1966 quiet title\r\n  action until 2004, their own affidavits appear to discount this claim.Â  In the\r\n  affidavits, Petitioners assert that one of their heirs paid the county property\r\n  taxes on the Fort Johnson Road properties until at least 1988.Â  If this was in\r\n  fact the case, Petitioners would have received county tax documents that\r\n  corresponded to the respective properties.Â  After the property was sold, the\r\n  subsequent purchasers would have then received these tax documents. Â In turn,\r\n  Petitioners' failure to receive tax documents should have served as notice\r\n  regarding a problem with their title to the property.Â  Thus, given that the\r\n  deeds and the quiet title action were publicly-recorded and documented, it was\r\n  an unreasonable length of time for Petitioners to delay in instituting the 2005\r\n  quiet title action.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Respondent would be undoubtedly prejudiced if Petitioners' claim is not barred\r\n  by laches given it purchased the lot for significant consideration and has been\r\n  in possession of it since 2003.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching our decision, we have thoroughly considered and are empathetic to\r\n  Petitioners' plight.Â  However, given the specific facts of the instant case, we\r\n  are compelled to hold the doctrine of laches precludes Petitioners from pursuing\r\n  their claim.Â  Here, Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to assert their rights\r\n  regarding the 1966 quiet title action.Â  We find such a flagrant and egregious\r\n  delay represents the quintessential situation that the doctrine of laches was\r\n  intended to protect.Â  For this Court to hold otherwise, we would have to\r\n  affirmatively reject this well-established equitable doctrine.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  decision should not be construed as establishing a general rule.Â  Instead, we\r\n  believe under the proper facts a claim of extrinsic fraud could be utilized to\r\n  successfully circumvent the three-year statute of limitations as established by\r\n  section 15-67-90.[10]\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the circuit court properly granted Respondent's\r\n  motion for summary judgment. Even assuming Petitioners sufficiently established\r\n  their extrinsic fraud claim to avoid the three-year statute of limitations\r\n  provided for in section 15-67-90, we hold the doctrine of laches operates to\r\n  bar their claim.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE, J, Acting Justices James E. Moore and E. C. Burnett, III,\r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section 15-67-90 provides:\r\n\r\n\tNo judgment or decree quieting title to land or determining the\r\n  title thereto, or adverse claims therein, shall be adjudged invalid or set\r\n  aside for any reason, unless the action or proceeding to vacate or set aside\r\n  such judgment or decree shall be commenced or application for leave to defend\r\n  be made within three years from the time of filing for record a certified copy\r\n  of such judgment or decree in the office of the clerk of court of the county in\r\n  which the lands affected by such judgment or decree are situated or, in case of\r\n  minors, within three years after coming of age.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-67-90 (2005).\r\n[2] Â Section 30-7-10 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tAll deeds of conveyance of lands, tenements, or\r\n  hereditaments, either in fee simple or for life . . . and generally all\r\n  instruments in writing conveying an interest in real estate required by law to\r\n  be recorded . . . are valid so as to affect the rights of subsequentÂ  . . .\r\n  purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, only from the day and\r\n  hour when they are recorded in the office of the register of deeds or clerk of\r\n  court of the county in which the real property affected is situated.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  30-7-10 (2007).\r\n[3]Â  Petitioners gave a detailed account of their\r\n  family's lineage dating back to the death of Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  Essentially,\r\n  Petitioners alleged they were the true heirs and subsequent-interest holders of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, descended through his true heirs, Samuel James Pinckney and\r\n  Mary Pinckney.Â  Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney (who later assumed the\r\n  married name of Heyward) was Samuel James Pinckney's sister-in-law.Â  Based on\r\n  this allegation, Petitioners asserted Laura Pinckney Heyward obtained the 1946\r\n  deeds by falsely claiming to be the wife of Simeon B. Pinckney (instead of\r\n  Isabella Pinckney, Simeon B. Pinckney's &quot;true spouse&quot;) and claiming\r\n  that Simeon B. Pinckney's sole heirs were herself and her sons Herbert and\r\n  Ellis Pinckney.Â  According to Petitioners, Samuel James Pinckney was alive in\r\n  1946 and may have been living on a portion of the original 20-acre tract with\r\n  his wife and children.Â  However, Petitioners claimed that neither Samuel James\r\n  Pinckney nor any of the other legitimate heirs could read or write and, thus,\r\n  did not have notice of the 1946 deeds.Â  Â Â \r\n[4]Â  By way of publication, Laura Pinckney Heyward served\r\n  the 1966 quiet title action to &quot;unknown persons.&quot;Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 10-2404 (1962) (precursor to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-40 (2005),\r\n  which provides for service by publication for &quot;unknown persons defendant&quot;\r\n  in an action to determine adverse claims to real property within this state); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-40 (2005) (&quot;Service of the\r\n  summons may be had upon all such unknown persons defendant by publication in\r\n  the same manner as against nonresident defendants, upon the filing of an\r\n  affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, stating the existence of a\r\n  cause of action to try adverse claims within this State.&quot;).\r\n[5]Â  In Yarbrough, the property claimant filed an\r\n  action to vacate a seven-year-old judgment quieting title to approximately ten\r\n  acres of land.Â  Yarbrough claimed the judgment was procured through extrinsic\r\n  fraud.Â  Id. at 341, 391 S.E.2d at 874.Â  The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment to the defendants on the ground the action was time-barred by section\r\n  15-67-90.Â  Id. at 341, 391 S.E.2d at 875.Â  On appeal, the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.Â  In so ruling, the court found\r\n  that &quot;[n]othing in this record demonstrates Yarbrough's knowledge\r\n  regarding her claim of extrinsic fraud was any different in 1981 than it was in\r\n  1988.&quot;Â  Id. at 342, 391 S.E.2d at 875.Â Â  \r\n[6]Â  On June 2, 2006, the circuit court judge granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of David L. Savage and Lisa M. Shogry-Savage on the\r\n  grounds that:Â  (1) Petitioners' claims were barred by section 15-67-90, a\r\n  three-year statute of limitations that prohibits setting aside a judgment\r\n  quieting title to land &quot;for any reason&quot;; (2) Savage and Shogry-Savage are bona fide purchasers for value without notice\r\n  pursuant to the recording statute as established by section 30-7-10; and\r\n  (3) Petitioners' action was barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  Because\r\n  Petitioners were not parties to the 1966 quiet title action, the circuit court\r\n  judge found the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata were\r\n  not applicable.Â  This circuit court judge was the presiding judge on all four\r\n  cases involving the 4.3-acre tract.\r\n[7]Â  The Court referenced Yarbrough but noted that\r\n  there was no comparable challenge to the statute of limitations in that case.Â  Hagy,\r\n  339 S.C. at 430 n.5, 529 S.E.2d at 717 n.5.\r\n[8]Â  Based on our finding that section 15-67-90 is not an\r\n  &quot;absolute bar,&quot; we need not address Petitioners' issue as to whether\r\n  this statute violates the due process clauses of our state and federal\r\n  constitutions. Â See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3 (stating no person shall be deprived of life,\r\n  liberty, or property without due process of law).\r\n[9] Â The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's\r\n  order based on section 15-67-90.Â  Petitioners, however, failed to raise any\r\n  arguments in their petition for rehearing or initial brief to this Court regarding\r\n  the circuit court's ruling as to the doctrine of laches.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the doctrine of laches is the law of the case and this Court is justified in\r\n  affirming on that basis.Â  See Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168,\r\n  432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (recognizing that where a\r\n  decision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm\r\n  unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will\r\n  become the law of the case); see also Rule 242(d)(2), SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Only those questions raised in the Court of Appeals and in the petition\r\n  for rehearing shall be included in the petition for writ of certiorari as a\r\n  question presented to the Supreme Court.&quot;).Â  However, because this case\r\n  presents us with an opportunity to address the applicability of the doctrine of\r\n  laches to section 15-67-90, we have chosen to analyze the merits of this\r\n  doctrine rather than merely rely on procedural rules to reach our ultimate\r\n  disposition.\r\n[10]Â  To conclude otherwise, we believe, would require\r\n  property owners to check the title to their property every three years.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26865","title":"Robinson v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26865\r\nHeard May 26, 2010 - Filed August 16, 2010\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDonald\r\n  Higgins Howe, of Howe &amp; Wyndham, LLP, and Walter Bilbro, Jr., both of\r\n  Charleston, for Petitioners.\r\n\t\t\t\tLouis H.\r\n  Lang, of Callison Tighe &amp; Robinson, LLP, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tCharles\r\n  M.

Estate of Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-646 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In this opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\n  circuit court order that granted summary judgment in favor of Martine A. Hutton\r\n  on the grounds Petitioners' action to set aside a 1966 quiet title action was\r\n  barred by the three-year statute of limitations as established by section\r\n  15-67-90 of the South Carolina Code,[1] Hutton is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice pursuant\r\n  to the recording statute as established by section 30-7-10 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code,[2] and Petitioners' action was barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nThis\r\n  action involves a portion of a 20-acre tract of land located on Fort Johnson\r\n  Road, in James Island, South Carolina.Â  The tract was formerly owned by Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney, who died intestate in 1921 and allegedly left a wife, Laura Pinckney,\r\n  and two sons, Ellis and Herbert Pinckney, as his heirs.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  land held by Simeon B. Pinckney originated from a conveyance to him by deed\r\n  executed in 1874 (and recorded in 1875) from Thomas Moore.Â  The property was\r\n  described as being 20 acres, more or less.Â  In 1888, Simeon B. Pinckney\r\n  conveyed 5 acres of this property to his wife, Isabella Pinckney, leaving\r\n  approximately 15 acres.Â  A survey conducted in 1923, however, found that\r\n  exactly 14.3 acres remained. \r\nIn\r\n  1946, Laura Pinckney, Ellis Pinckney, and Herbert Pinckney executed two cross-deeds\r\n  that divided the 14.3-acre parcel among themselves, creating a 4.3-acre tract and\r\n  a 10-acre tract.[3]Â \r\n  One of the 1946 cross-deeds conveyed the 4.3-acre tract to Herbert Pinckney and\r\n  the other deed conveyed the 10-acre tract to Ellis Pinckney.Â  In 1966, after\r\n  Herbert Pinckney died intestate, Laura Pinckney Heyward brought a successful action\r\n  to quiet title to the 4.3-acre tract held by Herbert.[4]Â \r\n  None of the Petitioners or their predecessors-in-interest filed responsive\r\n  pleadings in the 1966 proceeding. \r\nAs\r\n  the result of subsequent conveyances, the 4.3-acre tract was ultimately divided\r\n  into four lots.Â  The owners of these lots are as follows:Â  (1) The Converse\r\n  Company (Lot #1); (2) Martine A. Hutton (Lot #2); (3) David Savage and Lisa M.\r\n  Shogry-Savage (Lot #3); and (4) Debbie (Shogry) Dinovo (Lot #4).Â  The instant\r\n  case involves the interests of Hutton (&quot;Respondent&quot;).Â  \r\nOn February\r\n  1, 2005, Petitioners filed an action to quiet title to several tracts of land\r\n  located on James Island, including the 4.3-acre tract at issue in the instant\r\n  case.Â  In their Complaint, Petitioners sought &quot;to establish their\r\n  legitimate relationship as lineal descendants and heirs&quot; of Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney.Â  The first twenty-five named Petitioners claimed they were heirs of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, and the remaining Petitioners claimed they purchased\r\n  interests in the property and were the legitimate owners of those interests.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of these claims, Petitioners alleged the 1946 deeds and 1966 action to\r\n  quiet title were fraudulent and were undertaken without consideration for the\r\n  rights or interests of Petitioners and other heirs.Â  Specifically, Petitioners asserted\r\n  the 4.3-acre tract was fraudulently conveyed to Herbert Pinckney in 1946 and,\r\n  thereafter, wrongly passed by inheritance to his mother Laura Pinckney Heyward at\r\n  Herbert's death.Â  Additionally, Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney Heyward fraudulently\r\n  procured the 1966 quiet title action to the 4.3-acre tract when neither she nor\r\n  Herbert Pinckney owned any interest in the tract.Â  Finally, Petitioners alleged\r\n  they did not become aware of the 1946 deeds, of the 1966 quiet title action, or\r\n  of any other action affecting their title to the property until 2004.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these allegations, Petitioners sought &quot;(a) a determination of all owners\r\n  of the four (4) tracts of property, . . . a determination of each owner's\r\n  respective rights and interests in said tracts, and the quieting of the titles\r\n  to these four (4) tracts and (b) the sale of the respective owners' interests\r\n  in these four (4) tracts.&quot;Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  answered and filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  In her answer, Respondent\r\n  raised a number of affirmative defenses, including the doctrines of laches,\r\n  stale demand, estoppel, waiver, bona fide purchaser for value, acquiescence, res\r\n    judicata, collateral estoppel, and the applicable statute of limitations.Â \r\n  In her motion for summary judgment, Respondent specifically relied on the\r\n  circuit court's previous grant of summary judgment as to predecessor-in-interest\r\n  Shogry-Savage.[5]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  response to the motion for summary judgment, Petitioners argued their claim was\r\n  not barred by section 15-67-90 given the 1966 quiet title action was the result\r\n  of extrinsic fraud.Â  Because they offered affidavits supporting their claim\r\n  that the 1966 quiet title action was procured through fraud and forgery,\r\n  Petitioners contended their action was distinguishable from the case of Yarbrough\r\n    v. Collins, 301 S.C. 339, 391 S.E.2d 873 (Ct. App. 1990).[6]\r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent.Â \r\n  In so ruling, the circuit court relied on its previously-issued order granting\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Shogry-Savage because: Â &quot;Hutton is in a\r\n  virtually identical position in regard to title to her property as was Ms.\r\n  Shogry-Savage.Â  Ms. Shogry-Savage is a bona fide purchaser for value without\r\n  notice.Â  Accordingly, so must be Hutton.&quot;Â  Therefore, the circuit court\r\n  found Petitioners' action was barred by the operation of section 15-67-90, the\r\n  fact that Respondent is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice pursuant\r\n  to section 30-7-10, and the doctrine of laches.\r\nPetitioners\r\n  appealed the circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  Â \r\nIn a\r\n  summary opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit\r\n  court. Â See Robinson v. Estate of Harris, Op.\r\n  No. 2008-UP-646 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 24, 2008).Â  In support of its\r\n  decision, the court cited: Â (1) the three-year statute of limitations as\r\n  codified in section 15-67-90; and (2) Yarbrough as interpreting section\r\n  15-67-90.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitioners' request for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals. \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same\r\n  standard as that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  \r\nRule\r\n  56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial\r\n  court may grant a motion for summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;\r\n  Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot; Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 563, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006). \r\nB.\r\nIn essence, Petitioners contend summary judgment was\r\n  improperly granted given that significant and material questions of fact exist relating\r\n  to extrinsic fraud and forgery in the underlying 1966 quiet title action and\r\n  the 1946 cross-deeds upon which the action was based.\r\nIn support of this contention, Petitioners argue the\r\n  circuit court and the Court of Appeals erred in determining that section 15-67-90\r\n  constitutes an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to setting aside judgments quieting\r\n  title to land.Â  Because they submitted affidavits in support of their claims of\r\n  extrinsic fraud and forgery, Petitioners assert their cause of action is\r\n  distinguishable from Yarbrough and should not have been procedurally\r\n  barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  \r\nC.\r\nIn analyzing\r\n  Petitioners' arguments, we must determine whether section 15-67-90 constitutes\r\n  an &quot;absolute bar&quot; to Petitioners' action or whether Petitioners' claim\r\n  of extrinsic fraud supersedes the application of this statute of limitations.\r\nThis determination\r\n  requires us to revisit our decision in Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 714 (2000). Â In Hagy, the biological parents brought an action in\r\n  1994 to set aside the 1992 adoption of their daughter on the ground that their\r\n  consent to the adoption was induced by fraudulent statements made by the\r\n  adoptive parents, who were also the biological mother's father and stepmother.Â  Id. at 428-29, 529 S.E.2d at 716.Â  In response, the adoptive parents\r\n  defended on the merits and asserted the action was time-barred by section\r\n  20-7-1800 of the South Carolina Code, which at the time provided:Â  &quot;No\r\n  final decree of adoption is subject to collateral attack for any reason after a\r\n  period of one year following its issuance.&quot;Â  Id. at 429, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 716.Â  The family court concluded the time bar did not apply to actions to\r\n  set aside an adoption for fraud.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the family\r\n  court's decision, finding section 20-7-1800 barred the action because it was\r\n  commenced more than one year after the final adoption decree was commenced.Â  Id. Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this Court affirmed as modified the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â \r\n  In so ruling, this Court considered the novel question of &quot;whether a\r\n  facially applicable statute of limitation will bar an action to set aside a\r\n  judgment procured by extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at 430, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n  717.[7]Â \r\n  The Court determined that a statute of limitations purporting to bar all\r\n  actions to set aside a judgment would not limit &quot;a court's inherent\r\n  authority to set aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â  However, because Hagy failed to prove her consent was\r\n  obtained by fraud, the Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  Id. at 433-34, 529 S.E.2d at 719.\r\nWe find Hagy supports Petitioners' contention that this Court, the Court of\r\n  Appeals, and the circuit court have the inherent authority to set aside the\r\n  1966 quiet title action and the underlying 1946 cross-deeds if in fact they were\r\n  procured as the result of extrinsic fraud.Â  Moreover, a broad reading of Yarbrough indicates that a court could consider the ground of extrinsic fraud, if\r\n  sufficiently proven, as affecting the application of section 15-67-90.Â  See Yarbrough, 301 S.C. at 341-42, 391 S.E.2d at 875 (concluding property\r\n  claimant's action to quiet title brought seven years after title clearance\r\n  action was barred by section 15-67-90 but implicitly recognizing that extrinsic\r\n  fraud, if proven, could operate to preclude application of the three-year\r\n  statute of limitations).[8]\r\nIn view of our conclusion,\r\n  the question becomes whether Petitioners' submission of the affidavits is sufficient\r\n  to withstand Respondent's motion for summary judgment based on Petitioners'\r\n  claim of extrinsic fraud.\r\n&quot;A judgment\r\n  may be set aside on the ground of fraud only if the fraud is 'extrinsic' and\r\n  not 'intrinsic.'&quot;Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â  Extrinsic\r\n  fraud is &quot;'fraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a\r\n  person of the opportunity to be heard.'&quot;Â  Id. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at\r\n  717-18 (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 294\r\n  S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)). Â Â &quot;[R]elief is granted for\r\n  extrinsic fraud on the theory that by reason of the fraud preventing a party\r\n  from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there never has been a real contest\r\n  before the court of the subject matter of the action.&quot;Â  Chewning v.\r\n    Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 82, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003).Â  If a judgment\r\n  procured by extrinsic fraud could have been avoided if the challenging party\r\n  exercised due diligence, a court generally will not grant relief from the\r\n  judgment.Â  Center v. Center, 269 S.C. 367, 373, 237 S.E.2d 491, 494\r\n  (1977).\r\nIntrinsic fraud is\r\n  fraud which was presented and considered at trial.Â  Chewning, 354 S.C.\r\n  at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  &quot;It is fraud which misleads a court in\r\n  determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the\r\n  fraud.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nConsidering\r\n  the facts of the instant case in the procedural posture of a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, Petitioners offered evidence that arguably created a material\r\n  question of fact regarding whether the 1946 cross-deeds and 1966 quiet title\r\n  action were procured by extrinsic fraud.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Petitioners' affidavits are very detailed, they essentially outlined\r\n  Petitioners' ancestry as direct descendants of Simeon B. Pinckney and his son\r\n  Samuel James Pinckney.Â  The affidavits indicate Laura Pinckney was not married\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney and that Herbert and Ellis Pinckney were of no relation\r\n  to Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  The affidavits also provide that several of\r\n  Petitioners' relatives had lived on the subject property prior to the\r\n  institution of the 2005 quiet title action.Â  Additionally, the affidavits state\r\n  Petitioners were unaware of the 1966 quiet title action and did not realize until\r\n  late 2003 that portions of the 4.3-acre tract were under construction because\r\n  the property was heavily wooded and the construction was &quot;off the\r\n  road.&quot;\r\nD.\r\nHowever,\r\n  even assuming Petitioners offered sufficient evidence of extrinsic fraud to\r\n  withstand Respondent's motion for summary judgment, this alone is not\r\n  dispositive of Petitioners' appeal.Â  Instead, this case presents a unique set\r\n  of circumstances that operate to preclude Petitioners' action.\r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by our decision in Hagy, this Court recognized that the\r\n  doctrine of laches would be applicable in determining whether an action is time-barred\r\n  even if extrinsic fraud is established.Â  Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431 n.7, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 717 n.7 (discussing the one-year statute of limitations for a\r\n  collateral attack on an adoption decree and stating &quot;[a]lthough not an\r\n  issue in this case, the doctrine of laches will apply in determining whether\r\n  such an action is barred&quot;).Â  We believe the instant case presents such a\r\n  scenario.[9]\r\n&quot;Courts have the inherent power to do all things reasonably\r\n  necessary to ensure that just results are reached to the fullest extent\r\n  possible.&quot;Â  Jones v. Leagan, 384 S.C. 1, 19, 681 S.E.2d 6, 16 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  The equitable doctrine of laches is defined as &quot;neglect for an\r\n  unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n  195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  &quot;Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his\r\n  rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his\r\n  adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise\r\n  detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to\r\n  enforce those rights.&quot; Â Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for\r\n    Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993). Â The party\r\n  seeking to establish laches must show: Â (1) a delay, (2) that was unreasonable\r\n  under the circumstances, and (3) prejudice. Â Hallums, 296 S.C. at 199,\r\n  371 S.E.2d at 528.Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we find Respondent established\r\n  the requisite factors to bar Petitioners' action based on the doctrine of\r\n  laches.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to challenge the 1966 quiet title action.Â \r\n  Although Petitioners claim they did not have notice of the 1966 quiet title\r\n  action until 2004, their own affidavits appear to discount this claim.Â  In the\r\n  affidavits, Petitioners assert that one of their heirs paid the county property\r\n  taxes on the Fort Johnson Road properties until at least 1988.Â  If this was in\r\n  fact the case, Petitioners would have received county tax documents that\r\n  corresponded to the respective properties.Â  After the property was sold, the\r\n  subsequent purchasers would have then received these tax documents. Â In turn,\r\n  Petitioners' failure to receive tax documents should have served as notice\r\n  regarding a problem with their title to the property.Â  Thus, given that the\r\n  deeds and the quiet title action were publicly-recorded and documented, it was\r\n  an unreasonable length of time for Petitioners to delay in instituting the 2005\r\n  quiet title action.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Respondent would be undoubtedly prejudiced if Petitioners' claim is not barred\r\n  by laches given she purchased her lot for significant consideration and has\r\n  been in possession of it since 2001.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching our decision, we have thoroughly considered and are empathetic to\r\n  Petitioners' plight.Â  However, given the specific facts of the instant case, we\r\n  are compelled to hold the doctrine of laches precludes Petitioners from pursuing\r\n  their claim.Â  Here, Petitioners waited thirty-nine years to assert their rights\r\n  regarding the 1966 quiet title action.Â  We find such a flagrant and egregious\r\n  delay represents the quintessential situation that the doctrine of laches was\r\n  intended to protect.Â  For this Court to hold otherwise, we would have to\r\n  affirmatively reject this well-established equitable doctrine.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  decision should not be construed as establishing a general rule.Â  Instead, we\r\n  believe under the proper facts a claim of extrinsic fraud could be utilized to\r\n  successfully circumvent the three-year statute of limitations as established by\r\n  section 15-67-90.[10]\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the circuit court properly granted Respondent's\r\n  motion for summary judgment. Even assuming Petitioners sufficiently established\r\n  their extrinsic fraud claim to avoid the three-year statute of limitations\r\n  provided for in section 15-67-90, we hold the doctrine of laches operates to\r\n  bar their claim.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE, J, Acting Justices James E.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n  30-7-10 (2007).\r\n[3]Â  Petitioners gave a detailed account of their\r\n  family's lineage dating back to the death of Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  Essentially,\r\n  Petitioners alleged they were the true heirs and subsequent-interest holders of\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney, descended through his true heirs, Samuel James Pinckney and\r\n  Mary Pinckney.Â  Petitioners claimed Laura Pinckney (who later assumed the\r\n  married name of Heyward) was Samuel James Pinckney's sister-in-law.Â  Based on\r\n  this allegation, Petitioners asserted Laura Pinckney Heyward obtained the 1946\r\n  deeds by falsely claiming to be the wife of Simeon B. Pinckney (instead of\r\n  Isabella Pinckney, Simeon B. Pinckney's &quot;true spouse&quot;) and claiming\r\n  that Simeon B. Pinckney's sole heirs were herself and her sons Herbert and\r\n  Ellis Pinckney.Â  According to Petitioners, Samuel James Pinckney was alive in\r\n  1946 and may have been living on a portion of the original 20-acre tract with\r\n  his wife and children.Â  However, Petitioners claimed that neither Samuel James\r\n  Pinckney nor any of the other legitimate heirs could read or write and, thus,\r\n  did not have notice of the 1946 deeds.Â  Â Â \r\n[4]Â  By way of publication, Laura Pinckney Heyward served\r\n  the 1966 quiet title action to &quot;unknown persons.&quot;Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 10-2404 (1962) (precursor to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-40 (2005),\r\n  which provides for service by publication for &quot;unknown persons defendant&quot;\r\n  in an action to determine adverse claims to real property within this state); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-40 (2005) (&quot;Service of the\r\n  summons may be had upon all such unknown persons defendant by publication in\r\n  the same manner as against nonresident defendants, upon the filing of an\r\n  affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, stating the existence of a\r\n  cause of action to try adverse claims within this State.&quot;).\r\n[5]Â  On June 2, 2006, the circuit court judge granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of David L. Savage and Lisa M. Shogry-Savage on the\r\n  grounds that:Â  (1) Petitioners' claims were barred by section 15-67-90, a\r\n  three-year statute of limitations that prohibits setting aside a judgment\r\n  quieting title to land &quot;for any reason&quot;; (2) Savage and Shogry-Savage are bona fide purchasers for value without notice\r\n  pursuant to the recording statute as established by section 30-7-10; and\r\n  (3) Petitioners' action was barred by the doctrine of laches.Â  Because\r\n  Petitioners were not parties to the 1966 quiet title action, the circuit court\r\n  judge found the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata were\r\n  not applicable.Â  This circuit court judge was the presiding judge on all four\r\n  cases involving the 4.3-acre tract.\r\n[6]Â  In Yarbrough, the property claimant filed an\r\n  action to vacate a seven-year-old judgment quieting title to approximately ten\r\n  acres of land.Â  Yarbrough claimed the judgment was procured through extrinsic\r\n  fraud.Â  Id. at 341, 391 S.E.2d at 874.Â  The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment to the defendants on the ground the action was time-barred by section\r\n  15-67-90.Â  Id. at 341, 391 S.E.2d at 875.Â  On appeal, the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.Â  In so ruling, the court found\r\n  that &quot;[n]othing in this record demonstrates Yarbrough's knowledge\r\n  regarding her claim of extrinsic fraud was any different in 1981 than it was in\r\n  1988.&quot;Â  Id. at 342, 391 S.E.2d at 875.Â Â  \r\n[7]Â  The Court referenced Yarbrough but noted that\r\n  there was no comparable challenge to the statute of limitations in that case.Â  Hagy,\r\n  339 S.C. at 430 n.5, 529 S.E.2d at 717 n.5.\r\n[8]Â  Based on our finding that section 15-67-90 is not an\r\n  &quot;absolute bar,&quot; we need not address Petitioners' issue as to whether\r\n  this statute violates the due process clauses of our state and federal\r\n  constitutions. Â See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3 (stating no person shall be deprived of life,\r\n  liberty, or property without due process of law).\r\n[9] Â The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's\r\n  order based on section 15-67-90.Â  Petitioners, however, failed to raise any\r\n  arguments in their petition for rehearing or initial brief to this Court regarding\r\n  the circuit court's ruling as to the doctrine of laches.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the doctrine of laches is the law of the case and this Court is justified in\r\n  affirming on that basis.Â  See Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168,\r\n  432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (recognizing that where a\r\n  decision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm\r\n  unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will\r\n  become the law of the case); see also Rule 242(d)(2), SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Only those questions raised in the Court of Appeals and in the petition\r\n  for rehearing shall be included in the petition for writ of certiorari as a\r\n  question presented to the Supreme Court.&quot;).Â  However, because this case\r\n  presents us with an opportunity to address the applicability of the doctrine of\r\n  laches to section 15-67-90, we have chosen to analyze the merits of this\r\n  doctrine rather than merely rely on procedural rules to reach our ultimate\r\n  disposition.\r\n[10]Â  To conclude otherwise, we believe, would require\r\n  property owners to check the title to their property every three years.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26866","title":"Huxfield Cemetery v.

We reverse the special referee's order and\r\n  hold Appellant has the right to maintain and control Huxfield Cemetery.\r\nI.\r\nIn 1881, William\r\n  Rowe conveyed a 500 acre tract of land to Samuel Wall by deed, excepting out\r\n  &quot;three acres near Carvers Bay Known as the Huxfield Graveyard to be used\r\n  as a Public Burying Ground.&quot;Â  From 1881 through 1999, Mount Zion Church\r\n  managed and maintained the land and used it, without challenge, as a cemetery\r\n  for its members. Â In 1999, at the request of the pastor for Mount Zion, who no\r\n  longer wished to maintain separate accounts, an association of relatives and\r\n  descendants of those buried in the cemetery assumed responsibility for\r\n  collecting and accounting for donations made towards Huxfield Cemetery.Â  \r\nIn March 2006, Respondent\r\n  Bobby L. Elliott sent a letter to local funeral homes stating that as the heirs\r\n  of R. L. Elliott, they were the owners of Huxfield Cemetery and would begin\r\n  charging $500 per burial plot.Â  In response, the association of relatives formally\r\n  incorporated as Appellant Huxfield Cemetery Association for the purpose of\r\n  preserving Huxfield Cemetery as a public burial ground.Â  Appellant filed its\r\n  articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State and designated Baylis E.\r\n  Elliott as its registered agent and president.[1]Â \r\n  Mount Zion issued a quit claim deed to Appellant transferring any property\r\n  rights it had in Huxfield Cemetery.Â  In 2007, Appellant filed a declaratory\r\n  judgment action seeking an order declaring the rights of the parties with\r\n  respect to Huxfield Cemetery. \r\nAt trial, Appellant\r\n  presented Renee Dean, a real estate paralegal, as an expert in the field of\r\n  title examination and abstract preparation to testify as to the chain of\r\n  title.Â  Dean testified that William Rowe transferred the deed conveying 500\r\n  acres, but carving out the three acre tract for Huxfield Cemetery, to Samuel Wall;\r\n  Wall transferred the property to Thomas Cribb; Cribb transferred the property\r\n  to W.F. Elliott; W.F. Elliott died intestate, and in 1893, the land was\r\n  partitioned.Â  Jacob Elliott obtained title to a portion of the partitioned\r\n  tract that surrounds Huxfield Cemetery.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1944, Jacob Elliott conveyed the property to Susan Elliott.Â  The next filing\r\n  found with regard to this property was a &quot;1956 map of 148 acres surveyed\r\n  for the Estate of Susan Elliott.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  Following Susan Elliott's death, her heirs brought a partition suit in which a\r\n  1961 map was filed.Â  The 1961 map divided Susan Elliott's property into four\r\n  tracts.Â  Huxfield Cemetery is shown as a separate parcel, but Tract One\r\n  surrounds it.Â  Tract One was conveyed to R.L. Elliott.Â  In 1978, a plat was\r\n  recorded stating it was a &quot;map of 2.25 acres of land in tax district no. 3\r\n  on which a cemetery is located - owned by R.L. Elliott.&quot;Â  In 1995, R.L.\r\n  Elliott issued a deed of distribution to Mary C. Elliott and Respondents\r\n  conveying certain property including &quot;The tract shown as CEMETERY on\r\n  that&quot; 1961 map.Â  Mount Zion is not mentioned or referenced in the chain of\r\n  title.Â  \r\nIn addition to\r\n  Dean's testimony, Appellant called Cyrus Snowden, who testified his mother\r\n  served as the secretary/treasurer of Mount Zion.Â  Snowden presented checks from\r\n  1964 and 1973 reflecting funds from Mount Zion's account that were used to\r\n  maintain Huxfield Cemetery.Â  Baylis Elliott testified he helped clean the\r\n  cemetery from the time he was a child and was reimbursed by Mount Zion for his\r\n  efforts.Â  On cross-examination, Baylis admitted he, on behalf of Mount Zion,\r\n  retained a lawyer in 1990 when they learned R.L. Elliott claimed he owned the\r\n  property.Â  The lawyer sent a letter to R.L. Elliott, in which the lawyer stated\r\n  he was aware R.L. Elliott obtained title to Huxfield Cemetery following the\r\n  partition suit of Susan Elliott's estate and requested a quit claim deed to\r\n  Huxfield Cemetery.Â  Baylis also admitted requesting Respondents' permission to\r\n  erect a marker honoring Confederate veterans.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Respondents did not present any witnesses or introduce any evidence, the special\r\n  referee ruled in their favor.Â  The special referee first found this was an\r\n  action to try title and that Huxfield Cemetery was a public burial ground.Â  He\r\n  found several statutes of limitations provided Respondents a defense to\r\n  Appellant's claim including S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-3-340, 350, 380 and 15-67-210,\r\n  220.Â  The special referee found that because Respondents had established\r\n  possession of the land under color of title, the burden shifted to Appellant to\r\n  prove a claim to title, which Appellant failed to prove.Â  See Cummings v.\r\n    Varn, 307 S.C. 37, 41, 413 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1992) (holding the defendant in\r\n  actual possession is regarded as the rightful owner until plaintiff proves\r\n  perfect title and the plaintiff must recover on strength of his title, not the\r\n  weakness of the defendant's title).Â  Accordingly, the special referee ruled\r\n  &quot;Huxfield Cemetery is a public burial ground and shall remain so in\r\n  perpetuity&quot; and that Respondents were entitled to maintain control of\r\n  Huxfield Cemetery and charge a burial fee.\r\nII.\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the special referee's order is based on an error of law.Â  We begin\r\n  with the parties' steadfast stipulation, which forms the basis for this\r\n  litigation: the property was dedicated to the public in 1881 to be used as a\r\n  public burying ground and the property may not (and will not) be used for any\r\n  other purposes.Â  Because this land is a cemetery, traditional property laws are\r\n  not applicable.Â  See 14 Am. Jur. 2d Cemeteries Â§ 2 (&quot;A cemetery is not subject to the laws of ordinary property.&quot;).Â \r\n  Thus, an overview of property laws governing cemeteries is instructive.\r\nLand\r\n  may be dedicated to the public for cemetery purposes and no particular form or\r\n  ceremony is required to accomplish such a dedication.Â  14\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Cemeteries Â§ 17.Â  &quot;The\r\n  intention of the owner of the land to dedicate it for a public cemetery,\r\n  together with the acceptance and use of the same by the public, or the consent\r\n  and acquiescence of the owner in the long-continued use of his or her lands for\r\n  such purpose, are sufficient.&quot;Â  Id. Â This principle of law on\r\n  public cemetery dedications mirrors our case law on all types of public\r\n  dedications.Â  See Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997) (holding in\r\n  order to effectuate a public dedication, the owner\r\n  must express in a positive and\r\n  unmistakable manner the intention to dedicate his property to public use and there\r\n  must be acceptance of such property by the public).Â  \r\nA\r\n  public dedication will either be a statutory dedication or a common-law\r\n  dedication.Â  A statutory dedication is a dedication\r\n  made in conformity with statutes providing for the dedication of lands to the\r\n  public. Â Â 26 C.J.S. Dedication Â§ 3. Â A\r\n  statutory dedication operates as a grant and results in a conveyance of title\r\n  to the grantee.Â  23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication Â§ 53.Â  On the other hand, a common law dedication is the setting apart of lands for\r\n  public use; it rests on public convenience and is based on public policy and\r\n  good faith.Â  26 C.J.S. Dedication Â§ 2.Â \r\n  A common-law dedication does not pass the fee,\r\n  but only an easement.Â  Frost v.\r\n    Columbia Clay Co., 130 S.C. 72, 124 S.E. 767 (1924).Â \r\n      That is, the public gets only an easement with the fee left in the dedicator.Â  Boyd v. Hyatt, 294 S.C. 360, 367, 364 S.E.2d 478, 482 (Ct. App. 1988).Â \r\n  As it applies to cemeteries, &quot;[a] common-law dedication of land for a\r\n  cemetery does not result in the extinguishment of the dedicator's title; the\r\n  fee remains in him or her with a possibility of reverter on the abandonment of\r\n  the cemetery . . . .&quot;Â  14 Am. Jur. 2d Cemeteries Â§ 17. \r\nAlthough our\r\n  jurisprudence is far from replete with cases concerning cemeteries, we have\r\n  recognized that traditional property law principles do not apply to\r\n  cemeteries.Â  In Kelly v. Tiner, 91 S.C. 41, 74 S.E. 30 (1912), the trial\r\n  court found the plaintiffs, whose family members were buried in a cemetery on\r\n  the defendant's property, could not maintain an action against the defendant.Â  This\r\n  Court reversed and recognized the principle that a landowner holding fee title to\r\n  the land does not have exclusive rights to use his land in any manner he\r\n  desires: &quot;One who has dedicated land to the public for burial purposes,\r\n  the dedication having been accepted, may be prohibited from defacing or\r\n  meddling with the graves thereon, at the suit of anyone having relatives or friends\r\n  buried there.&quot;Â  Id. at 50, 74 S.E. at 33 (citing Davidson v.\r\n    Reed, 111 Ill. 167 (1884)).Â  Also in Frost v. Columbia Clay Co., the\r\n  Court acknowledged &quot;as a general proposition, where ground has been\r\n  dedicated to the public for use as a cemetery, the owner cannot afterward\r\n  resume possession or remove the bodies interred therein, although he has\r\n  received no consideration for its use, and the interments were made merely by\r\n  his consent.&quot;Â  130 S.C. at 75, 124 S.E. at 768 (quoting Ex parte McCall\r\n    in re Little v. Presbyterian Church of Florence, 68 S.C. 489, 492, 47 S.E.\r\n  974, 974 (1904)).\r\nIII.\r\nThis review of\r\n  principles of law governing public cemeteries reveals that merely because an\r\n  individual holds fee title to property, he does not have the exclusive right to\r\n  control the land.Â  For the reasons reflected above, the public, and\r\n  specifically the heirs and descendants of the people buried on the property, have\r\n  substantive rights in Huxfield Cemetery.Â  &quot;Whether the right\r\n  of an heir to visit a cemetery is considered an easement, a license, or a privilege, it cannot be\r\n  extinguished by a subservient fee owner through a conveyance to another.&quot;Â  14 Am. Jur. 2d Cemeteries Â§ 38.Â \r\n  Furthermore, this right &quot;is a real right, not a servitude or usufruct, but\r\n  an implied contractual relationship that binds the owner irrevocably.&quot;Â  Faust\r\n    v. Mitchell Energy Corp., 437 So.2d 339, 342 (La. App. 1983).Â  For\r\n  these reasons, we hold the special referee erred in treating this matter as an\r\n  action to try title and ruling in Respondents' favor merely because he found\r\n  they had superior property rights in the land.Â \r\nAs\r\n  stated above, Appellant has an easement interest in Huxfield Cemetery.Â  The\r\n  determination of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in equity, and as such, a court may take its\r\n  own view of the evidence.Â  Tupper, 326 S.C. at 323, 487 S.E.2d at 190.Â \r\n  Moreover, a court's equity powers are properly used in order to protect\r\n  the rights of those owning lots in or having relatives buried in a cemetery.Â  14 Am. Jur. 2d Cemeteries Â§ 47.Â  We\r\n  make no ruling as to title or whether Respondents hold superior title.Â  Even\r\n  assuming Appellant does not hold fee title and assuming Respondents do, the\r\n  parties have stipulated to the facts necessary for us to make a determination\r\n  as to which party is entitled to maintain and control Huxfield Cemetery.Â \r\n  Specifically, the parties agree that the property was dedicated as a public\r\n  cemetery in 1881, that Mount Zion, and subsequently Appellant, assumed\r\n  responsibility for Huxfield Cemetery from 1881 through 2006, and that Appellant\r\n  is composed of relatives of those buried in Huxfield Cemetery.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  have found no South Carolina case on point,[3] however two cases from Alabama and Florida provide some guidance.Â  In Ebenezer\r\n    Baptist Church, Inc. v. White, 513 So.2d 1011 (Ala. 1987), Ebenezer Church\r\n  acquired title in 1909 to land on which a cemetery was located.Â  For years,\r\n  family members of persons buried in the cemetery had assumed the duties of\r\n  caring for the property.Â  In 1984, Ebenezer Church attempted to take\r\n  responsibility for the cemetery by clearing brush and announcing its intent to\r\n  charge a burial fee.Â  The circuit court granted the family members' request for\r\n  an injunction and prohibited the church from charging a burial fee and altering\r\n  the gravesites.Â  In affirming the injunction, the Alabama Supreme Court noted,\r\n  &quot;Ebenezer Baptist Church has permitted and acquiesced in an indiscriminate\r\n  use of the cemetery over the years. The church has never established rules and\r\n  regulations regarding the use of monuments, mounds, or footstones and has never\r\n  charged a burial fee.&quot;Â  Id. at 1014.Â  \r\nSimilarly, in Mingledorff\r\n  v. Crum, 388 So.2d 632 (Fla. App. 1980), family members of persons buried in\r\n  a cemetery on the defendant's property brought suit against the defendant\r\n  asking the court &quot;to declare a right . . . to enclose and properly\r\n  maintain the area and to have access&quot; to the cemetery.Â  The court reviewed\r\n  the applicable property law regarding cemeteries and observed &quot;[t]hese\r\n  authorities and equitable principles, together with a recognition of the\r\n  concern and sentiments of surviving descendents . . . dictate that the law\r\n  observe and protect the rights of those survivors.&quot;Â  Id. at 636.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the court held that the family members had a right to maintain the cemetery.Â \r\n  Importantly, however, the court also held &quot;[c]oupled with these rights is\r\n  a continual obligation to actually maintain the area and . . . otherwise abate\r\n  any conditions which render any part of the area unhealthy or offensive to the\r\n  senses.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nWe find\r\n  these cases persuasive and on point with the facts of this case.Â  We hold\r\n  Appellant is the proper party to maintain control over Huxfield Cemetery.Â \r\n  Appellant and Mount Zion, Appellant's predecessor, have served as the caretaker\r\n  for Huxfield Cemetery since 1881 without interruption or incident.Â  The record\r\n  reflects that Mount Zion took it upon itself to collect funds to maintain and\r\n  preserve the cemetery from the initial dedication.Â  No burial fee has ever been\r\n  assessed against individuals wishing to bury their family members in Huxfield\r\n  Cemetery.Â  Respondents never attempted to assert any rights or regulate this\r\n  cemetery in any way whatsoever until 2006 when they sent out notices declaring\r\n  that a $500 per plot burial fee would now be assessed.[4]Â \r\n  Furthermore, Appellant is a legitimate non-profit association formed for the\r\n  exclusive purpose of preserving and maintaining Huxfield Cemetery and has filed\r\n  the requisite documents with the Secretary of State establishing it as such.Â  As\r\n  a final matter, we follow the Mingledorff court's approach and hold that\r\n  along with the right to control and maintain the property, Appellant also has a\r\n  duty and responsibility to properly preserve and maintain Huxfield Cemetery.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, and&nbsp; HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Baylis Elliott is related to Respondents.Â  It appears a rift developed\r\n  between members of the Elliott family, which ultimately led to this litigation.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Huxfield Cemetery is identified on this map, but shown as a separate\r\n  parcel.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Although Kelly v. Tiner and Frost v. Columbia Clay Co. offer guidance, they are not on point.Â  In Kelly and Frost, the\r\n  plaintiffs alleged the defendants were desecrating gravesites, while the\r\n  defendants asserted the cemeteries had been abandoned.Â  In this case, however,\r\n  the parties are disputing the right to control the cemetery.Â  Respondents agree\r\n  the property must be used as a cemetery and there is absolutely no allegation Respondents\r\n  have caused damage to any gravesite.Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; Although there was some reference made indicating Respondents attempted\r\n  to pay taxes on the property beginning in 1995, we give this little weight and\r\n  view it as an attempt to posture for this litigation.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26867","title":"Estate of Stokes v.

Stokes consulted his family physician, Mark Steadman,\r\n  M.D., about a mass on his thigh.Â  Dr. Steadman diagnosed the mass as a\r\n  superficial venous thrombosis (SVT), also known as a blood clot.Â  In January\r\n  2002, Stokes's symptoms returned, and he again consulted Dr. Steadman, who ordered\r\n  a venous Doppler study.Â  Edward C. Floyd, M.D., read the Doppler results and also\r\n  concluded that Stokes was suffering from SVT.\r\nIn\r\n  July 2002, Dr. Steadman referred Stokes to a surgeon, Reginald S. Bolick, M.D.,\r\n  to determine whether surgery would alleviate Stokes's symptoms.Â  Dr. Bolick examined\r\n  Stokes and reviewed his records; he agreed that SVT was the proper diagnosis.Â  As\r\n  a precaution, Dr. Bolick ordered a CT scan of Stokes's chest and abdomen to\r\n  rule out the presence of a hidden malignancy.Â  The radiologist who read the CT scan\r\n  found no evidence of malignancy.Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  August 2002, Dr. Steadman referred Stokes to another surgeon, Arthur Cooler,\r\n  M.D., for a second opinion regarding treatment options. Â Dr. Cooler examined\r\n  Stokes, performed a Doppler study, diagnosed SVT, and advised Stokes that he\r\n  could remove the thrombosis. Â In March 2003, Dr. Cooler performed surgery and\r\n  the tissue was tested.Â  What multiple doctors had diagnosed as a thrombosis was\r\n  instead a &quot;malignant leiomyosarcoma.&quot; Â After the cancer was diagnosed\r\n  on March 20, 2003, Dr. Cooler referred Stokes to oncologists and surgeons at\r\n  MUSC for further treatment.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  August 2005, Stokes timely filed a medical malpractice action against Dr.\r\n  Steadman and his medical practice, Pee Dee Family Physicians.Â  Stokes's Complaint stated he &quot;was diagnosed with sarcoma cancer&quot; on March 20, 2003,\r\n  and it alleged that Dr. Steadman's failure to properly diagnose Stokes's\r\n  cancer was the proximate cause of his harm.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 12, 2006, Stokes died from complications related to the cancer.Â  The\r\n  probate court appointed Stokes's daughter, Jennifer Spell (Appellant), as\r\n  personal representative for the estate. Â In November 2007, Appellant moved to\r\n  amend the Complaint to add Dr. Bolick and Pee Dee Surgical Group, P.A. (Respondents)\r\n  as defendants and to assert a claim under the Wrongful Death Act.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Second Amended Complaint alleged:Â  \r\n\t6.&nbsp;&nbsp; At\r\n  all times prior to March 20, 2003, the Defendants treated [Stokes's] condition\r\n  as if it were a [SVT] or blood clot of the right thigh area.Â  \r\n\t7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants\r\n  failed to properly diagnose [Stokes's] condition which was ultimately diagnosed\r\n  as metastatic sarcoma.Â  \r\n\t8.&nbsp;&nbsp; At\r\n  the time [Stokes] was diagnosed with cancer, it had already spread and this\r\n  type of cancer is generally incurable.Â  \r\n\t9.&nbsp;&nbsp; On\r\n  or about March 20, 2003, [Stokes] was diagnosed with sarcoma cancer . . . .Â \r\n\t\r\n\t10. Michael\r\n  L. Stokes died on December 12, 2006.\r\n\r\nHolding\r\n  the three-year statute of limitations commenced on March 20, 2003, the trial\r\n  court dismissed as untimely the wrongful death claim against Respondents. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-545(A) (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  Appellant concedes the\r\n  medical malpractice three-year statute of limitations commenced on March 20,\r\n  2003, and acknowledges this limitation applies to Stokes.[1]Â \r\n  Appellant contends, however, that a decedent's estate may revive a previously\r\n  barred claim by invoking the three-year statute of limitations applicable to a\r\n  wrongful death action.Â  Appellant bases this argument on the following\r\n  statutory language: &quot;[In] an action under Sections 15-51-10 to 15-51-60\r\n  for death by wrongful act, the period [] begin[s] to run upon the death of the\r\n  person on account of whose death the action is brought.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-3-530(6) (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nII.\r\n\r\n\tThe Wrongful Death Act provides:\r\n\tWhenever\r\n  the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default\r\n  of another and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had\r\n    not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover\r\n    damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable, if death had\r\n    not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the\r\n  death of the person injured . . . . Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-10 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nA\r\n  wrongful death action may be brought by the estate for the benefit of the decedent's\r\n  heirs. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-20 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  Our jurisprudence\r\n  makes clear that if the decedent was barred from recovering damages for his\r\n  injuries, the bar passes to the decedent's estate.Â  Succinctly stated, if the\r\n  decedent had no claim at his death, the estate has no claim.Â  In one of our\r\n  earlier cases, we construed the wrongful death statute as requiring that the decedent,\r\n  prior to death, not be &quot;debarred&quot; from recovery: \r\n\r\n\tIt seems\r\n  to us that . . . the capacity of the deceased to maintain an action, based upon\r\n  the injury which caused his death, is made the test of the right of the\r\n  administrator to maintain the action provided for by the statute. Â Hence if the\r\n  deceased has debarred himself by his contributory negligence, or by any other\r\n  cause, from maintaining his action, based upon the injury which caused his\r\n  death, it follows, necessarily, that his administrator is likewise barred of\r\n  his right of action, which would otherwise be secured to him by\r\n  the statute. Â In all cases . . . the controlling question, therefore, is\r\n    whether the deceased, if he had not died, could have maintained the action.\r\n\r\nPrice v. Richmond &amp;\r\n  Danville R.R. Co., 33 S.C. 556, 560,\r\n  12 S.E. 413, 413-14 (1890) (emphasis added). Â \r\nAlthough\r\n  our precedent has not spoken directly to the statute of limitations issue, our\r\n  law has remained steadfast to the principle of limiting the right of recovery\r\n  under the wrongful death statute to those cases in which the party injured\r\n  would have been entitled to recover if death had not ensued.Â  See Nix v.\r\n    Mercury Motor Express, Inc., 270 S.C. 477, 482-83, 242 S.E.2d 683, 685\r\n  (1978) (citations omitted), overruled on other grounds, Farmer v.\r\n    Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003) (&quot;Under both the Virginia and South Carolina\r\n  wrongful death statutes the test of the right of an administrator to maintain\r\n  an action for wrongful death is whether the deceased could have maintained an\r\n  action for the injury had he survived. . . . If [the] plaintiff's decedent had no right, at time of death, to\r\n  maintain an action for personal injuries, then the right to maintain the\r\n  present action could not be transmitted to her personal representative.&quot;); Maxey v. Sauls, 242 S.C. 247, 250, 130 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1963) (quoting Scott\r\n    v. Greenville Pharm., Inc., 212 S.C. 485, 489, 48 S.E.2d 324, 326 (1948))\r\n  (observing that &quot;if the deceased never had a cause of action, none accrues\r\n  under the wrongful death statute&quot;); Scott, 212 S.C. at 489,\r\n  48 S.E.2d at 326 (&quot;Of course, if the deceased never had a cause of action,\r\n  none accrues under the wrongful death statute.Â  The condition that the action\r\n  be one which could have been maintained by the deceased if death had not ensued\r\n  has reference to the circumstances attending the injury, and the nature of the\r\n  wrongful act or omission which is made the basis of the action.&quot;); Rish\r\n    v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 106 S.C. 143, 145, 90 S.E. 704, 704-05 (1916)\r\n  (holding the wrongful death statute &quot;limited the right of recovery to\r\n  those cases in which the party injured would have been entitled to recover if\r\n  death had not ensued&quot;).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  United States District Court of South Carolina, sitting in diversity, has\r\n  addressed the very issue before us.Â  In Quattlebaum v. Carey Canada, Inc., the\r\n  honorable and learned judge, Joe F. Anderson, Jr., correctly applied South Carolina law and dismissed a wrongful death claim because the decedent possessed no\r\n  claim at his death.Â  685 F. Supp. 939 (D.S.C. 1988).Â  Judge Anderson examined South Carolina's Wrongful Death Act, as well as the Act's historical derivation from Lord\r\n  Campbell's Act.Â  In granting summary judgment to the defendant, Judge Anderson\r\n  reasoned:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  right to bring a wrongful death claim is thus conditioned upon the decedent's\r\n  right to maintain a claim or action.Â  Under the terms of the wrongful death\r\n  statute, the representative has no statutory right to pursue a wrongful death\r\n  claim if the decedent's cause of action was barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations. \r\n\t.Â Â Â Â \r\n  .Â Â Â Â  .\r\n\tThe South Carolina court would no doubt find that the\r\n  wrongful death statute contains language establishing a condition precedent to\r\n  the right to bring a wrongful death claim.Â  Therefore, a new statutory right is\r\n  created by Â§ 15-51-10 in the personal representative of the decedent which can\r\n  only be maintained if the decedent, had he lived, could have maintained such an\r\n  action. . . . Furthermore, anything that would have defeated the decedent's\r\n  recovery had he survived the accident, 'such as contributory negligence, a\r\n  valid release, or similar acts on his part,' would defeat the right of recovery\r\n  in behalf of his family in case of his death.Â  It follows logically that the\r\n  decedent's failure to file a timely claim against Carey Canada is an act, or\r\n  omission, on his part which should defeat the right of recovery of his personal\r\n  representative.\r\n\r\nId. at 940-42\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  Quattlebaum was correctly decided and adheres to\r\n  the principle that a decedent's estate may maintain an action only when the\r\n  decedent would have been entitled to maintain an action had he survived.Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  reaffirm today that a claim under the Wrongful Death Act lies in the decedent's\r\n  estate only when the decedent possessed the right of recovery at his death.Â \r\n  Appellant's reliance on the separate wrongful death statute of limitations is\r\n  misplaced, for the wrongful death statute of limitations does not serve to revive\r\n  a previously barred claim.[2]Â \r\n  Section 15-3-530(6) is triggered only where it is first established that the\r\n  decedent had a right of recovery at the time of death.Â  If the decedent had a right\r\n  of recovery at the time of death, then the wrongful death action must be filed\r\n  within three years, which begins\r\n  to run &quot;upon the death of the person on account of whose death the action\r\n  is brought.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(6). \r\nIII.\r\nBecause\r\n  the decedent's claim against Respondents was barred at the time of his death,\r\n  the trial court properly dismissed the claims against Respondents.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The commencement of the statute of limitations,\r\n  on March 20, 2003, is unchallenged as concerns Stokes's claims and is the law\r\n  of the case.Â  The statute of limitations\r\n  begins to run on the date the injury resulting from the alleged wrongful\r\n  conduct &quot;either is discovered or may be discovered by the exercise of\r\n  reasonable diligence.&quot;Â  Garner v. Houck, 312 S.C. 481, 485, 435\r\n  S.E.2d 847, 849 (1993).Â  It was unchallenged that the statute of limitations\r\n  for all claims related to the misdiagnosis of Stokes's cancer began to run on\r\n  March 20, 2003.Â  It was also undisputed that on March 20, 2003, Stokes knew\r\n  that Dr. Bolick was among the physicians who had misdiagnosed the cancer.Â \r\n  &quot;The date when a plaintiff learns of a potential new defendant has absolutely no bearing on the timing of the statute of\r\n  limitations.&quot;Â  Gillman v.

and was pointing a gun at him.Â  Appellant testified\r\n  he shot Bill, then he turned and shot Jared.Â  \r\nThe defense called\r\n  Jody to testify.Â  On direct examination, Jody testified that Jared pulled a gun\r\n  on him and asked him: &quot;[W]here is the dope?&quot; Â Jared told Jody he\r\n  would kill him.Â  Jody testified that Bill took the gun from Jared, and then\r\n  Appellant shot them.Â  On cross-examination, Jody admitted that Appellant\r\n  unexpectedly arrived at his house and asked Jody to come back to his house to\r\n  &quot;watch his back&quot; because he was having trouble with Bill and Jared.Â \r\n  Appellant asked Jody if he had a gun with him, but Jody said he did not. Jody\r\n  testified when he and Appellant arrived at the house, Appellant immediately\r\n  went into the bedroom and began fumbling around.Â  Jody maintained that Jared\r\n  charged at him with the gun, but stated Bill took the gun from Jared and\r\n  everyone calmed down.Â  Jody testified Appellant came out of the bedroom and\r\n  fired three shots at Bill and then fired at Jared.Â  Jody demanded Appellant\r\n  take him home.[4]\r\nThe trial court\r\n  charged the jury on murder and self-defense, but refused to charge voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  The jury found Appellant guilty of both murders.Â  In the\r\n  sentencing phase, the trial court gave three statutory aggravating\r\n  circumstances charges: 1) the defendant committed the murders while in the\r\n  commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon; 2) the defendant\r\n  committed the murders while in the commission of larceny while armed with a\r\n  deadly weapon; and 3) two or more persons were murdered by the defendant by one\r\n  act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.Â  Additionally, the trial\r\n  court gave four statutory mitigating circumstances: 1) the defendant had no\r\n  significant criminal history; 2) the victims were participants in the defendant's\r\n  conduct or consented to the act; 3) the defendant acted under duress or\r\n  domination of another person; and 4) the defendant was provoked by the victims\r\n  into committing the murders.Â  The jury found the existence of all three\r\n  aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and recommended the death\r\n  penalty.Â  \r\nII.\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the law of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  We disagree.Â  Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in\r\n  sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Wharton,\r\n  381 S.C. 209, 214, 672 S.E.2d 786, 788 (2009).Â  \r\nTo\r\n  warrant the court eliminating the charge of manslaughter, there must be no\r\n  evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.Â  Id.Â  If there is any evidence from which it could be inferred the lesser, rather\r\n  than the greater, offense was committed, the defendant is entitled to such\r\n  charge.Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 371, 610 S.E.2d 812, 815\r\n  (2005).\r\nWe\r\n  have consistently held that both heat of passion and sufficient legal\r\n  provocation must be present at the time of the killing.Â  Wharton, 381\r\n  S.C. at 215, 672 S.E.2d at 788.Â  A defendant is not entitled to a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge merely because he was in a heat of passion.Â  See id.\r\n  (holding the State's request for a voluntary manslaughter charge was not\r\n  warranted where there was no evidence of sufficient legal provocation, although\r\n  the defendant may have been acting under heat of passion).Â  Conversely, a\r\n  defendant is not entitled to voluntary manslaughter merely because he was\r\n  legally provoked.Â  See State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 576, 647 S.E.2d 144,\r\n  170 (2007) (holding although sufficient legal provocation arguably existed,\r\n  there was no evidence the defendant was in a heat of passion).Â  Moreover, there\r\n  must be evidence that the heat of passion was caused by sufficient legal\r\n  provocation.Â  \r\nAppellant bases his\r\n  entitlement to a voluntary manslaughter charge on his testimony that when Bill\r\n  pointed a gun at him, he felt threatened and was in fear.Â  Appellant argues the\r\n  threat of an imminent deadly assault was sufficient to entitle him to a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge.Â  Appellant cites to several cases from this Court to\r\n  support this argument.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State, which concedes the propriety of the self-defense charge, counters that\r\n  our case law should not be read so broadly as to sanction a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge that is based upon the mere testimony that the defendant\r\n  was &quot;afraid.&quot;Â  While acknowledging that self-defense and voluntary\r\n  manslaughter are not mutually exclusive, the State asserts &quot;it does not\r\n  follow that manslaughter should be charged simply because a defendant claiming\r\n  self-defense testifies he was afraid.&quot;Â  The State claims there was no\r\n  evidence Appellant shot the victims in the heat of passion, and therefore, the\r\n  trial court correctly refused to charge voluntary manslaughter.\r\nWhether a voluntary manslaughter charge is warranted turns on the\r\n  facts.Â  If the facts disclose any basis for the charge, the charge must be\r\n  given.Â  Given Appellant's argument, which takes our case law and turns\r\n  primarily fact-driven holdings into broad statements of law, we take this\r\n  opportunity to clarify the law regarding how a defendant's fear following an\r\n  attack or a threatening act relates to voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nTrial courts often\r\n  struggle with the difficult interplay between murder and the lesser-included\r\n  offense of voluntary manslaughter,[5] especially where a\r\n  defendant claims he acted in self-defense.Â  This struggle may be due to this\r\n  Court's opinions which, when taken out of the evidentiary context, appear to\r\n  set no boundaries as to what circumstances give rise to &quot;sudden heat of\r\n  passion upon sufficient legal provocation.&quot;Â  For example, in a particular\r\n  fact setting, we have held an unprovoked attack with a deadly weapon or an\r\n  overt threatening act can constitute sufficient legal provocation.Â  See\r\n    State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 307, 555 S.E.2d 391, 397 (2001) (&quot;There\r\n  can be little argument that an unprovoked knife attack constitutes sufficient\r\n  legal provocation to warrant the requested [voluntary manslaughter]\r\n  charge.&quot;); Pittman, 373 S.C. at 573, 647 S.E.2d at 168 (&quot;This Court has previously held that an overt,\r\n  threatening act or a physical encounter may constitute sufficient legal\r\n  provocation.&quot;).Â  \r\nWe also\r\n  have held that fear resulting from an attack can constitute a basis for\r\n  voluntary manslaughter.Â  See State\r\n    v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 549,\r\n  500 S.E.2d 489, 495 (1998) (&quot;[F]ear\r\n  can constitute a basis for voluntary manslaughter.&quot;).Â  Yet the presence of\r\n  fear does not end the inquiry regarding the propriety of a voluntary manslaughter\r\n  instruction.Â  We have consistently held that sudden heat of passion upon\r\n  sufficient legal provocation is defined as an act or event that &quot;must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason,\r\n  and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and\r\n  produce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable\r\n  impulse to do violence.&quot; Â Pittman, 373 S.C. at 572, 647\r\n  S.E.2d at 167.Â  While the act or event &quot;need not dethrone\r\n  the reason entirely, or shut out knowledge and\r\n  volition,&quot; it must cause a person to lose control.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe reaffirm the principle\r\n  that a person's fear immediately following an attack or threatening act may cause\r\n  the person to act in a sudden heat of passion.Â  However, the mere fact that a\r\n  person is afraid is not sufficient, by itself, to entitle a defendant to a\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Consistent with our law on voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, in order to constitute &quot;sudden heat of passion upon\r\n  sufficient legal provocation,&quot; the fear must be the result of sufficient\r\n  legal provocation and cause the defendant to lose control and create an\r\n  uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  Succinctly stated, to warrant a\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge, the defendant's fear must manifest itself in an\r\n  uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  \r\nA person may act in a deliberate, controlled manner,\r\n  notwithstanding the fact that he is afraid or in fear.Â  Conversely, a person\r\n  can be acting under an uncontrollable impulse to do violence and be incapable\r\n  of cool reflection as a result of fear.Â  The latter situation constitutes\r\n  sudden heat of passion, but the former does not.Â  Evidence that fear caused a person to kill another\r\n  person in a sudden heat of passion will mitigate a homicide from murder to manslaughter\r\n  - it will not justify it.Â  This is the distinction between voluntary\r\n  manslaughter and self-defense.Â  We reiterate that evidence of self-defense and\r\n  voluntary manslaughter may coexist and that a charge on self-defense and voluntary manslaughter may be warranted.Â  See State v. Gilliam, 296\r\n  S.C. 395, 373 S.E.2d 596 (1988) (holding\r\n  the evidence supported both a self-defense charge and a voluntary manslaughter\r\n  charge). \r\nTurning to the\r\n  facts of this case, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n  Appellant, there is no evidence to support a voluntary manslaughter charge.Â \r\n  Appellant testified when he turned around and saw Bill pointing a gun at him,\r\n  &quot;I shot Bill Welborn and then turned and shot Jared Champlin.&quot;Â  He added,\r\n  &quot;I was scared and I was frightened.Â  When Jared pulled the gun on Jody, it\r\n  scared me.&quot;Â  While this testimony is evidence that Appellant was in fear,\r\n  there is no evidence Appellant was out of control as a result of his fear or\r\n  was acting under an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  The only evidence in the record is that Appellant deliberately and\r\n  intentionally shot Jared and Bill and that he either shot the men with malice\r\n  aforethought or in self-defense.Â  \r\nAgain,\r\n  we emphasize self-defense and voluntary manslaughter are not mutually\r\n  exclusive, and had there been evidence to support a finding of heat of passion\r\n  upon sufficient legal provocation, Appellant would have been entitled to a\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  The record is simply devoid of such evidence.Â \r\n  In our view, to hold that Appellant was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter\r\n  charge under the facts of this case would impermissibly blend the elements of\r\n  voluntary manslaughter and self-defense.Â  In effect, such a holding would\r\n  render voluntary manslaughter a lesser-included offense of self-defense, for\r\n  where there is an intentional killing based on fear alone, a defendant would be\r\n  entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge.\r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we hold the trial court properly refused to charge voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.\r\nIII.\r\nAppellant asks this Court to create a per se rule\r\n  prohibiting capital defendants from representing themselves and to overturn State\r\n    v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998) and State v. Brewer, 328\r\n  S.C. 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997) (both holding\r\n  the defendant had a right to represent himself at his capital trial).Â  We\r\n  decline to do so.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Constitution provides that every criminal defendant has the right to represent\r\n  himself and makes no distinction between capital and non-capital defendants.Â  See S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 14.Â  Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has\r\n  interpreted the United States Constitution as providing a right to\r\n  self-representation.Â  See Farretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 821\r\n  (1975) (&quot;The Sixth Amendment, when naturally\r\n  read, thus implies a right of self-representation.&quot;).Â  The right to\r\n  self-representation, however, is not absolute.Â  The Constitution allows states\r\n  to prohibit defendants from waiving their right to counsel if they are not\r\n  competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.Â  See Indiana v.\r\n    Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008) (holding a defendant may be competent\r\n  enough to stand trial but not competent enough to waive his Sixth Amendment\r\n  right to counsel and represent himself).Â \r\n  Nevertheless, we believe a per se ruling forbidding capital defendants\r\n  from representing themselves would violate both the South Carolina and United\r\n  States Constitutions.Â  Therefore, we decline Appellant's request to adopt such\r\n  a rule in South Carolina.\r\nIV.\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel during\r\n  the sentencing phase of his trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to waive the right to counsel, the accused must be (1)\r\n  advised of his right to counsel, and (2) adequately warned of the dangers of\r\n  self-representation.Â  Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 424, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990)\r\n  (citing Faretta, 422 U.S. 806).Â Â  \r\nAppellant's waiver of counsel was addressed several times prior to\r\n  trial.Â  In the initial pre-trial hearing regarding Appellant's motion to\r\n  proceed pro se, the record indicates the trial court methodically and\r\n  carefully explained the dangers of self-representation and ensured that\r\n  Appellant understood the various issues that would arise at trial.Â  The trial\r\n  judge inquired into Appellant's mental state and his knowledge of numerous\r\n  aspects of a trial, including procedural rules, elements of the charges against\r\n  him, and available defenses.Â  After engaging in the thorough Farretta colloquy,\r\n  the trial judge granted Appellant's request.Â  At subsequent hearings, Appellant\r\n  first withdrew his motion to proceed pro se, then made a motion for\r\n  hybrid representation, and finally moved again to proceed pro se.Â  At\r\n  the third and final hearing on the motion, the trial judge again sternly warned\r\n  Appellant of the dangers of self-representation.[6]\r\nWe find Appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to\r\n  counsel.Â  Appellant was well aware of procedures in a death penalty case and\r\n  knew he would be representing himself in both the guilt phase and the\r\n  sentencing phase of trial.Â  This was Appellant's second capital trial, and he\r\n  specifically indicated to the trial court during a pre-trial hearing that he\r\n  knew the trial could only proceed to the penalty phase if the jury returned a\r\n  guilty verdict for murder.\r\nAppellant thoroughly questioned potential jurors during voir\r\n  dire and explained to them that a jury would first have to find him guilty\r\n  before they reached the penalty phase.Â  Appellant made reasonable and\r\n  persuasive arguments to the trial court resulting in the qualification of\r\n  several jurors, specifically citing to a United States Supreme Court opinion\r\n  for support.[7]Â \r\n  Additionally, during the State's case in chief, Appellant made proper and valid\r\n  objections and conducted thorough cross-examinations of witnesses.Â  In the presentation\r\n  of his defense, Appellant called several witnesses, including the waitress who\r\n  overheard Bill's threatening comments to Appellant, two witnesses who claimed\r\n  they snorted methamphetamines and crystal meth with Bill three days before the\r\n  killings, and Jared's fiancÃ©e who testified Bill was carrying a gun on the\r\n  night of the killings.[8]Â  Finally, in\r\n  the mitigation phase of the trial, Appellant called several correctional\r\n  officers to testify as to Appellant's good behavior, two ministers, several personal\r\n  friends, and his mother.Â  \r\nWe find Appellant had a clear understanding of the dangers of\r\n  self-representation in the guilt phase and the sentencing phase of his trial, as\r\n  the trial court repeatedly questioned him about his decision to represent himself.Â  See Wroten v. State, 301\r\n  S.C. 293, 294, 391 S.E.2d 575, 576 (citing Fitzpatrick v. Wainwright,\r\n  800 F.2d 1057, 1065 (11th Cir. 1986)) (recognizing\r\n  that the ultimate test regarding the waiver of counsel is not the trial judge's\r\n  advice; rather it is the defendant's understanding of the dangers inherent in\r\n  self-representation).Â  Accordingly, we hold Appellant knowingly and voluntarily\r\n  waived his right to counsel.Â  \r\nV.\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), we\r\n  have conducted a proportionality review.Â  We find the death\r\n  sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of similar cases illustrates that imposing the\r\n  death sentence in this case would be neither excessive nor disproportionate in\r\n  light of the crime.Â  See State v. Vazsquez, 364 S.C.\r\n  293, 613 S.E.2d 359 (2005) (involving a double murder\r\n  committed in the course of a robbery); State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000) overruled on\r\n    other grounds by Rosemond v.

Wharton, 381 S.C.\r\n  209, 214, 672 S.E.2d 786, 788 (2009).Â  &quot;In determining whether the act\r\n  which caused death was impelled by heat of passion or by malice, all the\r\n  surrounding circumstances and conditions are to be taken into consideration,\r\n  including previous relations and conditions connected with the tragedy, as well\r\n  as those existing at the time of the killing.&quot;Â  See State v.\r\n    Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 104, 64 S.E.2d 130, 134 (1951). â€œTo warrant the court\r\n  in eliminating the offense of manslaughter it should very clearly appear that\r\n  there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to\r\n  manslaughter.â€Â  Wharton, 381 S.C. at 214, 672 S.E.2d at 788.\r\nAt trial, the\r\n  following evidence was presented from which the jury might have determined that\r\n  Appellant committed manslaughter:Â Â  testimony that, earlier in the day, Bill\r\n  approached Appellant from behind, grabbed his throat, and put a metal object to\r\n  his head; testimony that Bill said in Appellant's presence that he was going to\r\n  take Appellant out on Platt Springs Road &quot;and blow his F'in brains\r\n  out;&quot; Appellant's testimony that Bill and Jared were under the influence\r\n  of methamphetamine on the night in question; and Appellantâ€™s testimony that\r\n  Bill pointed a gun at Appellant just before Appellant shot him.Â Additionally,\r\n  Appellant testified that he &quot;didn't kill [Bill and Jared] with malice\r\n  aforethought, with premeditation. . . . I was scared and I was\r\n  frightened.&quot;\r\nIn my view, given\r\n  the above evidence, it cannot be said that there was clearly &quot;no evidence\r\n  whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.&quot;Â  The\r\n  jury could infer from the evidence that Appellant's fear resulted in an\r\n  uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  Compare State v. Wiggins,\r\n  330 S.C. 538, 549, 500 S.E.2d 489, 495 (1998) (holding that judge properly\r\n  charged jury on voluntary manslaughter where defendant testified he was in fear\r\n  of the threat of physical assault).\r\nThe majority\r\n  apparently decides that the evidence does not yield an inference that\r\n  Appellant's fear resulted in an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  This is\r\n  not an unreasonable conclusion but, as some evidence tending to establish the\r\n  offense of manslaughter was presented at trial, it is a conclusion that the\r\n  jury, not this Court, must reach.\r\nI do\r\n  not suggest that a voluntary manslaughter instruction must be given whenever\r\n  the defendant testifies that he was in fear.Â  However, in light of all the\r\n  evidence presented here, Appellant met the standard to warrant the charge.Â  Wharton,\r\n  381 S.C. at 214, 672 S.E.2d at 788.Â  I would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This was\r\n  Appellant's second trial.Â  We reversed Appellant's convictions and death\r\n  sentence from his first trial due to the trial court's failure to give certain\r\n  jury instructions.Â  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 531 S.E.2d 907\r\n  (2000).Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; Appellant\r\n  testified the object could have been a gun or a cigarette lighter.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; This employee\r\n  testified for the defense and confirmed that Bill made this remark.Â  She\r\n  further testified she had heard a scuffle in the bathroom prior to this remark,\r\n  which was apparently the earlier exchange between Bill and Appellant.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Jody was convicted\r\n  of two counts of accessory to murder.Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; We acknowledge\r\n  courts have also struggled with the interplay of murder and involuntary\r\n  manslaughter, especially when there is evidence of self-defense or accident.Â  \r\n[6]&nbsp; The trial court\r\n  appointed the two lawyers who had represented Appellant at his first trial as\r\n  stand-by counsel.Â  \r\n[7]&nbsp; In Wainwright v. Witt, the United States Supreme Court\r\n  held the critical issue regarding the disqualification of a juror in a capital\r\n  case is &quot;whether the juror's views would 'prevent or substantially impair\r\n  the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions\r\n  and his oath.'&quot; 469 U.S. 412, 433 (1985) (quoting Adams v. Texas,\r\n  448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980)).Â  The State sought to disqualify those jurors who\r\n  indicated they were more inclined to impose a life sentence.Â  Appellant\r\n  rebutted the State's request for disqualification by arguing, pursuant to Wainwright,\r\n  these jurors did not say they could never give the death penalty and,\r\n  therefore, should be qualified.Â  \r\n[8]&nbsp; Jared's fiancÃ©e\r\n  first testified she did not remember whether Jared had a gun with him on the\r\n  night of the killings.Â  Appellant impeached her testimony by providing her with\r\n  a copy of the transcript from Appellant's first trial in which she testified\r\n  Jared was carrying a gun.Â  See Rule 613(b), SCRE (providing conditions\r\n  where a prior inconsistent statement may be admitted).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26869","title":"Grinnell Corporation v.

Wood, 378 S.C. 458, 663\r\n  S.E.2d 61 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nWe now turn to the\r\n  facts surrounding the offer of additional UM and UIM coverage to Grinnell.Â  Gerald\r\n  M. Goetz (Goetz), in his capacity as Vice President of Risk Management for Tyco\r\n  and its subsidiaries, procured the policy of insurance at issue in this\r\n  matter.Â  It is undisputed that Goetz was well educated and experienced in the\r\n  areas of insurance and risk management.Â  Goetz has a bachelor's degree from\r\n  Seton Hall University, an associates degree in Risk Management from The\r\n  Insurance Institute, and has taken graduate courses at the College of\r\n  Insurance.Â  He has worked in risk management for Tyco since 1978.Â  The\r\n  procurement of automobile policies for the company and its subsidiaries has\r\n  been part of his job description since he began employment with Tyco.Â \r\n  Moreover, Goetz's duties with Tyco include the procurement of all its global\r\n  insurance policies and overseeing the risk management programs for the\r\n  company.Â  Goetz estimates that at the time he procured the policy at issue he\r\n  procured twenty-two policies of insurance annually.Â  \r\nGoetz\r\n  considers himself to be a sophisticated purchaser with regard to insurance\r\n  policies.Â  Further, he believes his educational and professional experience\r\n  gave him a clear understanding of the liability coverage he intended to acquire\r\n  for Grinnell.Â  \r\nConcerning\r\n  the process of procuring the policy at issue, Tyco had been insured by AIG\r\n  member companies, such as American Home, for some time.Â  Goetz met with Tyco's\r\n  broker to discuss renewal of its policy.Â  Further, after the renewal meeting, Goetz\r\n  oversaw Tyco's risk management department as it gathered exposure data and\r\n  turned it over to the insurer to be used in the renewal process.Â  Goetz\r\n  testified that at the renewal meetings he specifically discussed Tyco's desire\r\n  to limit optional UM and UIM coverage within the policies across all states.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the time of the execution of the policy at issue, Goetz was fully aware of the\r\n  options related to UM and UIM coverage.Â  Goetz understood that in South\r\n  Carolina he could purchase UM and UIM coverage up to liability limits.Â \r\n  However, Goetz intended to decline optional UM and UIM coverage as part of his\r\n  risk management strategy for Tyco.Â  Goetz did not want optional UM and UIM\r\n  coverage because it would have exposed Tyco to an additional $500,000 deductible\r\n  per claim for UM and UIM.[1]Â \r\n  Additionally, Goetz surmised that the individuals most likely to make UM or UIM\r\n  claims would be employees, thus covered by workers' compensation for any actual\r\n  injury.Â  In short, Goetz intended to deny the offer of optional UM and UIM\r\n  coverage because it would unnecessarily expose Tyco to additional liability.Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  Goetz's expressed desire to decline optional UM and UIM coverage, he admittedly\r\n  failed to correctly execute the denial form.Â  Additionally, the form did not comply\r\n  with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A).Â  Nonetheless, Goetz testified that he\r\n  understood American Home's offer of additional UM and UIM and, in his view, the\r\n  manner in which he rejected it conveyed that he did not wish to purchase such\r\n  coverage.Â  \r\nIssues\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted a writ of certiorari and the parties present the following issue\r\n  for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the court of appeals err in holding American Home\r\n  did not make a meaningful offer of UM and UIM insurance coverage?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming\r\n    v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the\r\n  moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Id.; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â \r\n  When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\nAnalysis\r\nGrinnell\r\n  and American Home argue the court of appeals erred in finding no meaningful\r\n  offer of additional UM and UIM coverage was made and thus committed error in\r\n  affirming the trial court's reformation of the insurance policy.Â  We agree.\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 requires an insurer to offer UM and UIM coverage to the\r\n  insured.[2]Â \r\n  An insurer's offer of UM and UIM coverage must be &quot;meaningful.&quot;Â  See\r\n    Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 262-63, 626 S.E.2d 6, 12\r\n  (2005).Â  Critically, &quot;[t]he purpose of requiring automobile insurers to\r\n  make a meaningful offer of additional UM or UIM coverage 'is for insureds to\r\n  know their options and to make an informed decision as to which amount of\r\n  coverage will best suit their needs.'&quot;Â  Id. (citing Progressive\r\n    Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 352, 608 S.E.2d 569, 573 (2005)).Â \r\n  All law with respect to a meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM coverage\r\n  must be applied so as to effectuate this stated purpose.Â Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 354\r\n  S.E.2d 555 (1987), this Court enunciated a four-part test that is applied to\r\n  determine whether an offer of UM and UIM was meaningful.Â  See Wannamaker,\r\n  291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556.Â  The four criteria an insurer must meet in\r\n  order for the offer to be considered meaningful are:\r\n\r\n\t(1)&nbsp; the\r\n  insurer's notification process must be commercially reasonable,Â  whether oral\r\n  or in writing;\r\n\t(2)&nbsp; the insurer\r\n  must specify the limits of optional coverage and notÂ  merely offer additional\r\n  coverage in general terms;\r\n\t(3)&nbsp; the insurer\r\n  must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage;\r\n  and \r\n\t(4)&nbsp; the insured\r\n  must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.\r\n\r\nId. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556. \r\nIn response to the Wannamaker decision, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-77-350, which establishes certain requirements for forms used by insurers in\r\n  making offers of optional insurance coverages.Â  Section 38-77-350(A) states:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  director or his designee shall approve a form that automobile insurers shall\r\n  use in offering optional coverages required to be offered pursuant to law to\r\n  applicants for automobile insurance policies.Â  This form must be used by\r\n  insurers for all new applicants.Â  The form, at a minimum, must provide for each\r\n  optional coverage required to be offered:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\ta brief and\r\n  concise explanation of the coverage;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2)\r\n\t\t\ta list of\r\n  available limits and the range of premiums for the limits;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\ta space for\r\n  the insured to mark whether the insured chooses to accept or reject the\r\n  coverage and a space for the insured to select the limits of coverage he\r\n  desires; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)\r\n\t\t\ta space for\r\n  the insured to sign the form which acknowledges that he has been offered the\r\n  optional coverages;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5) \r\n\t\t\tthe mailing\r\n  address and telephone number of the Insurance Department which the applicant\r\n  may contact if the applicant has any questions that the insurance agent is\r\n  unable to answer.Â \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-77-350(A).Â  If the insurer's form complies with these requirements, section\r\n  38-77-350(B) provides a conclusive presumption in favor of the insurer that the\r\n  insured made a knowing waiver of the option to purchase additional coverages.[3]Â  \r\nNonetheless,\r\n  failure to comply with section 38-77-350(A) does not automatically require\r\n  judicial reformation of a policy.Â  Rather, even where an insured is not\r\n  entitled to the presumption that it made a meaningful offer, it may prove the\r\n  sufficiency of its offer by showing that it complied with Wannamaker.Â  See\r\n    Croft v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 420, 618 S.E.2d 909, 918\r\n  (2005) (holding whether a meaningful offer was made depends on the facts and\r\n  circumstances of a particular case).Â  Further, &quot;evidence of the insured's\r\n  knowledge or level of sophistication is relevant and admissible when analyzing,\r\n  under Wannamaker, whether an insurer intelligibly advised the insured of\r\n  the nature of the optional UM or UIM coverage.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nAs\r\n  stated previously, the requirement of a meaningful offer of additional UM and\r\n  UIM coverage is intended to protect an insured.Â  A meaningful offer of\r\n  additional UM and UIM makes as certain as possible that an insured has actual\r\n  knowledge of his options with respect to such coverages and is therefore able\r\n  to make an informed decision with respect to his desired coverage.Â  Floyd,\r\n  367 S.C. at 262-63, 626 S.E.2d at 12 (citing Progressive Cas. Ins. Co.,\r\n  362 S.C. at 352, 608 S.E.2d at 573 (&quot;The purpose of requiring automobile\r\n  insurers to make a meaningful offer of additional UM or UIM coverage 'is for\r\n  insureds to know their options and to make an informed decision as to which\r\n  amount of coverage will best suit their needs.'&quot;)).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that, under the particular facts of this case, American Home made a\r\n  meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM coverage to Grinnell and thus the\r\n  court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment\r\n  to Wood and GEICO.Â  \r\nAmerican\r\n  Home concedes that its form did not comply with the requirements of section\r\n  38-77-350(A) and it is thus not entitled to the presumption that it made a\r\n  meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM to Grinnell.Â  If the only evidence\r\n  presented in this record were the statutorily deficient and incorrectly\r\n  executed offer form, the court of appeals opinion would have to be affirmed.Â \r\n  However, the record presented in this case is replete with uncontroverted\r\n  evidence that the insured knew its options with respect to additional UM and\r\n  UIM coverage in South Carolina and made an informed decision as to the amount\r\n  of coverage that best suited its needs.Â  Because Goetz testified that he knew\r\n  his options with respect to additional UM and UIM coverage in South Carolina\r\n  and knowingly declined the offer, the court of appeals decision creates an\r\n  absurd result. \r\nThe\r\n  record in this matter contains evidence that a meaningful offer was made under Wannamaker.Â \r\n  First, the record contains ample evidence that Goetz knew his options with\r\n  respect to additional UM and UIM coverage, thus, based on the sophistication of\r\n  the parties, American Home made a commercially reasonable offer to Tyco. Â Second,\r\n  the offer form listed five different split limits for optional coverage and\r\n  also included an additional line where Goetz could have elected to insert an\r\n  amount other than those listed. Â Third, American Home discussed the nature of\r\n  optional coverage with Goetz at each renewal period and Goetz specifically\r\n  expressed his understanding of optional coverage. Â Fourth, the offer form\r\n  indicated coverage was available at an additional premium.Â  Therefore, given the\r\n  facts of this case with respect to the parties' level of sophistication, we\r\n  find that American Home made a meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM\r\n  coverage to Grinnell.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the court of appeals' decision affirming the trial court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment because, under the particular facts and circumstances of this\r\n  case, American Home made a meaningful offer of UM and UIM coverage to\r\n  Grinnell.Â  \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority's decision to reverse the\r\n  grant of summary judgment against American Home.Â  As explained in my concurring\r\n  opinion in Ray v. Austin, Op. No. 26858 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 16,\r\n  2010)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32 at __), it is my opinion that where the insured\r\n  does not dispute that the insurer made a meaningful offer of underinsured\r\n  and/or uninsured motorist coverage as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160\r\n  (2002), any request for reformation of the insurance contract must fail as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  In my opinion, in a situation such as the one presented here,\r\n  where the insured's agent maintains he made a knowing and informed decision to\r\n  reject additional coverage, there is no need to resort to the Wannamaker[4] factors or to determine whether American Home's form complied with S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 38-77-350 (2002 and Supp. 2009).Â  The purpose of requiring a meaningful\r\n  offer is to protect the insured.Â  See Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 608 S.E.2d 569 (2005).Â  In my view, a declaration\r\n  by the insured that it made its decision, knowing all of its options, ends the\r\n  inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Tyco had a $500,000 deductible on all claims made against this policy of\r\n  insurance.Â  Claims for UM and UIM would not have been covered by this\r\n  deductible, thus exposing Tyco to additional liability.Â  \r\n[2] In pertinent part, this section\r\n  states:\r\n\r\n\tAutomobile\r\n  insurance carriers shall offer, at the option of the insured, uninsured\r\n  motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured's liability coverage in\r\n  addition to the mandatory coverage prescribed by section 38-77-150.Â  Such\r\n  carriers shall also offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist\r\n  coverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage\r\n  in the event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits\r\n  carried by an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any\r\n  damages cap or limitation imposed by statute.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.

Coggiola, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tJoshua\r\n  Snow Kendrick, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Following\r\n  an investigation and hearing, a Hearing Panel of the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct (Panel) found that Samuel Crews (Respondent) committed numerous acts of\r\n  misconduct and recommended that Respondent be disbarred, ordered to pay costs\r\n  of the proceedings, and ordered to pay restitution to clients and the Lawyers'\r\n  Fund for Client Protection.Â  Respondent now challenges the Panel's\r\n  recommendation. Â As recommended by the Panel; we disbar Respondent, order him\r\n  to pay restitution, and order him to pay the costs of the proceedings.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  charges in this matter stem primarily from the complaints of two former clients.Â \r\n  With respect to these matters, Respondent misappropriated client funds, put\r\n  clients' personal property to his own use, and engaged in various self-dealing\r\n  transactions with regard to clients' real estate.\r\nI.&nbsp; Client A\r\nRespondent\r\n  was referred to Client A by friends who were concerned about his state of\r\n  health.Â  Client A wished to execute a power of attorney (POA) so as to allow\r\n  Respondent to handle his affairs while Client A was being treated for medical\r\n  problems.Â  At the time, assets owned by Client A or his father's estate[1] included a residence on Oceola Street (Oceola Street) in Columbia, three\r\n  Certificates of Deposit, and various personal property.\r\n(1) Oceola Street\r\nIn\r\n  July 2001, Respondent filed an Inventory and Appraisment of the Probate Estate\r\n  of Client A's father, which listed the appraised value of Oceola Street as\r\n  $80,000.Â  Client A inherited the property and, in February 2002, Respondent\r\n  signed a Contract for Sale on Client A's behalf, with Client A as seller and\r\n  MDR Properties, Inc. (MDR) as the buyer.Â  Michael Reynolds, Respondent's office\r\n  manager, was the president and sole owner of MDR.Â  Client A testified that he\r\n  was not informed that the property was being sold to Respondent's office\r\n  manager.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Contract set the purchase price at $68,000 to include a $500 deposit, a\r\n  certified check payable at closing for $33,500, and a second mortgage in the\r\n  amount of $34,000 payable over fifteen years.Â  In May 2002, Respondent used his\r\n  power of attorney to sign a deed transferring the property from Client A to\r\n  MDR.Â  Respondent recorded the deed that same month.\r\nSix\r\n  months later, on November 7, 2002, Respondent's office manager, Michael Reynolds,\r\n  resold the Oceola Street property for $92,000 on behalf of his corporations.Â \r\n  From the proceeds of the sale, $68,000 was deposited that same day into\r\n  Respondent's trust account for the benefit of Client A.Â  Also on November 7,\r\n  Respondent paid himself $7,500 in attorney's fees and $8,273.12 in &quot;expenses&quot;\r\n  from the trust account, leaving $52,226.88 from the sale in the trust account\r\n  for the benefit of Client A.Â  That same day, MDR paid $15,000 to Main\r\n  Properties, LLC (Main Properties), which is owned by Respondent.Â  The following\r\n  day, Respondent paid $15,000 to himself from the Main Properties account.Â  None\r\n  of these transactions were made known to or approved by Client A.Â  Â Â \r\n(2) Chateau de Ville Property\r\nAgain\r\n  using his power of attorney, Respondent entered into a contract to purchase a\r\n  condominium in Chateau de Ville in Columbia on behalf of Client A for $67,500.Â \r\n  At the time, Respondent represented both Client A and the seller, an Estate.Â \r\n  There is no evidence that either Client A or the heirs of the Estate were\r\n  advised of the conflict. \r\nIn\r\n  connection with the sale, $4,725 was paid to Sunvest Properties, Inc., as a\r\n  real estate commission, and Sunvest then issued a check for $3,375 to Reynolds\r\n  as his commission for the sale.Â  Reynolds's commission was based on an\r\n  exclusive right to sell contract signed on the same day that the contract to\r\n  purchase was signed.Â  The right to sell contract provided for a commission of\r\n  seven percent.\r\nIn\r\n  May 2002, Respondent signed a deed on the Chateau de Ville property on behalf\r\n  of Client A, conveying the property from Client A to Main Properties.Â  The deed\r\n  specified consideration as $69,000.Â  Respondent signed a note on behalf of Main\r\n  Properties promising to pay Client A $69,000 plus interest.[2]Â \r\n  Client A testified that he never received any such payment.Â  After the sale,\r\n  Respondent rented the property and collected at least $16,000 in rent.Â  He\r\n  deposited $3,000 of rent into his trust account for the benefit of Client A and\r\n  $13,000 into the checking account for Main Properties.Â  Also after the sale,\r\n  Respondent paid $3,189.10 from the trust account funds for Chateau de Ville\r\n  regime fees.\r\nRespondent\r\n  paid $11,500 from trust account funds to Carolina Trucking, which performed\r\n  demolition work for Respondent on several properties.Â  The reference on the\r\n  payment is &quot;Portion of Chateauâ€¦&quot;Â  The owner of Carolina Trucking\r\n  testified that he did not recall doing work at Chateau de Ville for Respondent,\r\n  but Client A had no interest in any of the properties listed on the receipt.\r\n(3) Accounting\r\nAfter\r\n  Client A filed a grievance with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, Respondent\r\n  was asked on a number of occasions to provide an accounting.Â  In January 2004,\r\n  Respondent was served with a subpoena requiring him to produce the accounting\r\n  ledger for Client A no later than February 9, 2004.Â  Respondent provided a\r\n  client ledger for funds passing through the trust account on behalf of Client A\r\n  and accounting journals for money market and checking accounts.\r\nClient\r\n  A's new attorney also requested a final accounting in January 2004.Â  In December\r\n  2004, Respondent presented Client A with an affidavit for his signature which\r\n  provided that Client A had been given a complete accounting on many occasions.Â \r\n  Client A testified that Respondent brought the document by his home in the\r\n  evening and read the document to him, though he would not allow Client A to\r\n  read it.Â  Nonetheless, Client A signed the affidavit.Â  The following day,\r\n  Respondent filed an accounting with the Probate Court.Â  Client A was given an\r\n  opportunity to review the accounting and indicated that he was satisfied with\r\n  the accounting.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Client B\r\nIn\r\n  January 2002, Respondent was retained by Client B to probate the estate of his\r\n  deceased wife. Â Client B agreed to pay Respondent $175 per hour and $75 per\r\n  hour for paralegal work.Â  In February 2002, Respondent drafted a durable power\r\n  of attorney naming himself as attorney-in-fact for Client B.Â  The document\r\n  included a provision empowering Respondent to deal with himself in his own\r\n  individual capacity &quot;in buying and selling of assets, in lending and\r\n  borrowing money, and in all other transactions, irrespective of the occupancy\r\n  of the same person of dual positions[.]&quot;Â  ODC alleges that Respondent used\r\n  his authority as attorney-in-fact to put Client B's funds and property to\r\n  Respondent's own personal use.\r\n(1) H&amp;R Block Account\r\nIn\r\n  March 2003, Respondent, acting under the power of attorney, withdrew\r\n  $330,431.49 from Client B's investment account at H&amp;R Block.Â  Respondent\r\n  deposited the full amount into his trust account.Â  Respondent explained to ODC\r\n  that the funds were reinvested at Client B's request and direction.Â  However,\r\n  Respondent instead withdrew the funds and put them to his own personal use.Â \r\n  Trust account records show payments from the trust account to the Crews Law\r\n  Firm, Main Properties, and Respondent.Â  Respondent also used trust account\r\n  funds to satisfy various personal obligations.\r\n(2) EverHome Mortgage Equity Line of Credit\r\nIn\r\n  February 2004, Respondent used his power of attorney to obtain a line of credit\r\n  at EverHome Mortgage Company for $100,000, secured by Client B's residence in\r\n  Georgia.Â  In the following months, Respondent deposited three checks totaling\r\n  $92,500 from the equity line into the trust account and then issued checks from\r\n  the trust account for his own benefit.Â  Respondent explained that he obtained\r\n  the funds with the consent of Client B for the purpose of qualifying Client B\r\n  for a tax deduction, yet produced no evidence showing such consent. \r\n(3) Hummingbird Drive\r\nIn\r\n  January 2002, in connection with the probate of the estate of Client B's\r\n  deceased wife, Respondent filed an Inventory and Appraisment of the residence\r\n  on Hummingbird Drive in Lexington, South Carolina.Â  The document listed the appraised\r\n  value of the property as $182,000.Â  Almost two months later, in March 2002, Client\r\n  B signed a contract of sale for the Hummingbird Drive property, listing the\r\n  purchase price as $65,000.[3]Â \r\n  In May 2002, the parties signed a deed conveying the property from Client B to\r\n  Main Properties for consideration of $62,000.Â  In September 2002, Respondent\r\n  filed an Amended Inventory and Appraisement with the Probate Court listing the\r\n  appraised value of the Hummingbird Drive property as $65,000.Â  Respondent\r\n  admitted that he did not have an appraisal done prior to entering into the\r\n  contract of sale.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Respondent admitted that the terms of payment set forth in the contract of sale\r\n  were not complied with.Â  The contract provided that Main Properties was to pay\r\n  $500 earnest money in the transaction, which would be held by the purchaser.Â \r\n  The document also provided that Main Properties would pay $15,000 in cash or\r\n  certified check at the closing.Â  Respondent admitted that this payment was not\r\n  made.Â  Finally, the contract of sale provides that Main Properties would pay\r\n  $49,500 on a note and mortgage.Â  Respondent admitted that no such note or\r\n  mortgage was prepared.Â  Respondent asserted that &quot;payments were made to [Client\r\n  B]&quot; but could provide no way to identify such payments.\r\nRespondent\r\n  used $4,285.16, which was held in trust for the benefit of Client B, to pay for\r\n  repairs and upkeep of the Hummingbird Drive property during the time that the\r\n  property was owned by Main Properties.Â  During this same time period, Main\r\n  Properties rented the property and collected $5,173.96 in income.Â  In June\r\n  2004, Main Properties sold the Hummingbird Drive property for $122,000 and Main\r\n  Properties left the closing with $103,561.59.\r\n(4) Mallard Apartments\r\nIncluded\r\n  in the estate of Client B's wife was an apartment complex on Howell Avenue in\r\n  Columbia, which Respondent listed in a January 2002 Inventory and Appraisement\r\n  at $560,000.Â  Respondent and his office manager, Michael Reynolds, filed\r\n  Articles of Incorporation establishing Mallard Apartments, LLC in February\r\n  2002.Â  In March 2002, Thomas Watts &amp; Associates completed an appraisal\r\n  report for Palmetto State Bank in which it appraised the property at $840,000.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May 2002, Client B signed a contract of sale for the apartments as the personal\r\n  representative of his wife's estate.Â  Reynolds signed on behalf of the\r\n  purchaser, MDR.Â  The purchase price was originally listed as $650,000, but was\r\n  at some point reduced to $525,000.Â  A third version of the contract, marked &quot;revised\r\n  contract&quot; set the purchase price at $450,000 and listed the purchaser as\r\n  Mallard Apartments, LLC. \r\nRespondent\r\n  obtained a $277,000 loan with which to purchase the property on which Client B\r\n  signed a personal guaranty.Â  Before advancing the funds, the bank required\r\n  Respondent to pay an existing personal loan of $25,105.Â  Respondent paid the\r\n  personal loan off with funds from the new loan.\r\nOf\r\n  the funds remaining after payment of Respondent's personal loan, $102,000 was\r\n  placed in the Crews Law Firm Trust Account on behalf of Client B, Respondent\r\n  received $100,000 in legal fees, and $2,055 was paid to directly to Client B.Â  The\r\n  HUD-1 form filed for the sale listed settlement charges to the Seller of\r\n  $39,442.50 and $102,000 paid to Seller.Â  The form listed the amount of the\r\n  $450,000 purchase price not covered by the loan and &quot;settlement charges,&quot;\r\n  approximately $308,000, as paid as &quot;legal fee to Crews Law firm for Estate\r\n  and other matters.&quot;Â  Respondent later admitted signing a note to Client B\r\n  in the amount of $300,000 representing the unpaid amount from the Mallard\r\n  Apartments transaction.Â  Respondent testified that he made &quot;some payments&quot;\r\n  to Client B for the purchase of Mallard Apartments but did not know how much.Â \r\n  In 2004, Respondent made three payments of $6,218 each to Client B from the\r\n  trust account, which the Panel designated as payments for Mallard Apartments.\r\nRespondent\r\n  filed an amended inventory and appraisement with the Probate Court in September\r\n  2002.Â  The following year, though Client B no longer owned the property,\r\n  Respondent used $8,604.41 of Client B's funds from the trust account to pay\r\n  property taxes on the Mallard Apartments property.Â  \r\n(5) Promissory Notes\r\nIn\r\n  addition to the $300,000 note referenced above, Respondent prepared and signed\r\n  seven promissory notes payable to Client B for amounts totaling $99,935.Â  The\r\n  notes matched payments or loans Respondent made to himself, his law firm, or\r\n  Main Properties from the Client B funds in Respondent's trust account.[4]Â \r\n  Respondent testified that he repaid some of this amount, but did not know how\r\n  much.\r\n(6) Credit Card\r\nBeginning\r\n  in February 2003 and continuing through February 2004, Respondent was in\r\n  possession of a Mastercard belonging to Client B.Â  This was the same time\r\n  period in which Client B was in the hospital and an assisted living facility.Â \r\n  Though he had nothing in writing, Respondent explained that Client B told him\r\n  to use the credit card &quot;any way [Respondent] wanted to.&quot;Â  Respondent\r\n  admitted using the card to benefit Client B but also admitted using the card\r\n  for his own personal uses.Â  Respondent also admitted to allowing employees at\r\n  his office use of the card, though he contended that such use was authorized\r\n  only while transporting Client B.Â  In all, Respondent charged over $19,000 to\r\n  the card for personal and office expenses.[5]Â \r\n  Respondent kept no written record of the purchases and paid the credit card\r\n  bills with funds held in trust for Client B.\r\n(7) Will\r\nRespondent\r\n  prepared and presented a will to Client B in which Respondent was named as a\r\n  primary beneficiary and residual beneficiary.Â  The will named Respondent as\r\n  Personal Representative with Reynolds as substitute Personal Representative.\r\n(8) Other\r\nWhile\r\n  Client B was hospitalized or living in an assisted living facility, Respondent\r\n  removed items of personal property from a residence in Baxley, Georgia and from\r\n  Hummingbird Drive.Â  Respondent admitted putting some of these items to personal\r\n  use.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  also purchased a new 2002 Cadillac Escalade for $47,000.Â  Though he paid the\r\n  purchase price with proceeds from Client B's H&amp;R Block investment account,\r\n  the vehicle was titled in the name of Mallard Apartments, LLC.Â  Respondent and\r\n  his staff used the vehicle to transport Client B to various places at his\r\n  request, but also made personal use of the Cadillac.Â  Respondent later had the\r\n  title and registration of the vehicle transferred to his own name and\r\n  eventually transferred title to Client B, though using Respondent's office\r\n  address. Â Respondent paid the taxes and fees on the vehicle using funds held in\r\n  his trust account for Client B and paid for gas and maintenance using Client B's\r\n  credit card.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  also paid $550 per month and a total of $3,300 from Client B's funds to Main\r\n  Properties as rent for property on Wilmot Avenue.Â  During this time, Client B\r\n  was a resident of an assisted living facility.\r\nRespondent\r\n  wrote a number of checks from the trust account to R. Sims Tompkins, DMD and\r\n  Jay Longnecker.Â  Tompkins verified that Client B is not a patient of his and\r\n  Respondent's firm employed a Jay D. Longnecker.Â  \r\n(9) Legal Fees\r\nRespondent\r\n  provided ODC with legal fee invoices to Client B totaling $45,127.Â  Respondent's\r\n  records show that he received from Client B or paid himself from trust account\r\n  funds $273,750 in legal fees.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Client C\r\nIn\r\n  an additional matter, Respondent failed to diligently pursue Client C's probate\r\n  matter, to properly supervise an associate to whom he had assigned the case,\r\n  and to adequately communicate with Client C.Â  Client C was not available to\r\n  testify at the hearing and the Panel declined ODC's request to leave the record\r\n  open to allow her deposition to be taken at a later date.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Panel Findings\r\nThe\r\n  Panel found numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) and\r\n  recommended that Respondent be disbarred, ordered to pay costs, and ordered to\r\n  pay restitution.Â  Based on the above, the Panel found the following\r\n  violations:Â  Rule 1.7, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, (conflict of interest with current\r\n  client); Rule 1.8(a), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, (lawyer shall not enter into a\r\n  business transaction with client); 1.5, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, (lawyer shall not\r\n  collect an unreasonable fee); Rule 1.15, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, (safekeeping of\r\n  client property); Rule 8.4(b), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, (misconduct for lawyer to\r\n  commit criminal act reflecting adversely on lawyer's honesty); Rule 8.4(d),\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR, (misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); Rule 8.1, RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, (lawyer in connection with disciplinary matter shall not knowingly make\r\n  false statement of material fact; fail to cooperate with investigation); Rule\r\n  1.8(c), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, (lawyer shall not solicit any substantial gift\r\n  from client, including a testamentary gift); and Rule 417, SCACR, Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) (financial recordkeeping).\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe findings of the\r\n  Panel are entitled to great weight; however, this Court may make its own\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law and is not bound by the Panel's\r\n  recommendation. In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 371, 520 S.E.2d 804, 806\r\n  (1999).Â  This Court has the ultimate authority to discipline attorneys and the\r\n  manner in which the discipline is given rests entirely with this Court. In\r\n    re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 112, 551 S.E.2d 586, 587 (2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn\r\n  review, Respondent raises a number of procedural arguments and contends that\r\n  the Panel erred in finding there was clear and convincing evidence of such\r\n  misconduct that disbarment was warranted.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Panel's consideration of\r\n  ODC's proposed report.\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues that the Panel erred in considering the proposed report submitted by ODC\r\n  because it was untimely.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  the close of the hearing, Respondent's counsel and ODC counsel proposed waiving\r\n  closing arguments and submitting proposed reports within thirty days of receipt\r\n  of the transcript of the proceedings, to which the Chairman agreed.Â  The\r\n  transcript was filed with the Commission on January 5, 2009 and ODC's proposed\r\n  panel report was filed with the Commission on April 9, 2009 - outside of the\r\n  30-day window.Â  Nevertheless, the Panel adopted ODC's proposed report.Â \r\n  Respondent contends that this Court is required to strike the Panel\r\n  Recommendation due to ODC's untimely submission and to adopt Respondent's\r\n  proposed report as it was the only timely submission.Â  Respondent cites no\r\n  authority for the remedy he proposes.Â  \r\nRule\r\n  14(b)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, provides the chair of the Commission broad\r\n  powers to extend or shorten time periods in disciplinary hearings.Â  We find\r\n  that whether to accept the proposed report was within the Panel's discretion\r\n  and the Panel did not abuse that discretion here.\r\nII.&nbsp; Testimony of Barbara\r\n  Seymour\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues that the admission of Barbara Seymour's testimony before the Panel\r\n  hearing was erroneous.Â  We disagree.\r\n(1) No\r\n  error in allowing testimony\r\nSeymour\r\n  acted as an investigator and prosecuting attorney in the time leading up to the\r\n  hearing.Â  When ODC called Seymour to testify, Respondent objected based on Rule\r\n  3.7, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Rule 3.7 prohibits a lawyer from acting as an\r\n  advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness\r\n  unless certain exceptions are met.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  our view, a respondent at an investigative hearing may not ask the Panel to\r\n  adjudicate an opposing attorney's compliance with the Rules of Ethics.Â  An\r\n  independent grievance filing may be made, but the Panel is not the correct\r\n  forum.Â  In any event, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the\r\n  Chairman.Â  Seymour was included on Respondent's witness list submitted prior to\r\n  trial and her testimony at trial was limited to presentation of facts,\r\n  documents, and statements by Respondent obtained in the course of the\r\n  investigation.Â  Thus, we find no error in the admission of Seymour's testimony\r\n  at the hearing.\r\n(2) No error in not\r\n  allowing Respondent's counsel access to Seymour's investigative file.\r\nRespondent\r\n  argued that he was entitled to access to Seymour's investigative file once she\r\n  was presented as a witness.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule\r\n  25, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, provides for the exchange of certain basic information\r\n  regarding witnesses and for the exchange of other material &quot;only upon good\r\n  cause shown to the chair of the hearing panel.&quot;Â  Rule 25(b), RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  Whether to order the exchange of further information was therefore\r\n  within the discretion of the Chair.Â  Given that Seymour's testimony was limited\r\n  to presentation of facts, documents, and statements by Respondent obtained in\r\n  the course of the investigation, and that she was not permitted to testify as\r\n  to her observations, opinions, or conclusions, we find that the Chair did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in finding no good cause for production of the investigative\r\n  file.\r\n(3) No error in denying Respondent\r\n  a continuance and right to depose Seymour.\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues he had a right to a continuance and to depose Seymour once she was\r\n  presented as a witness.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule\r\n  25(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, addresses depositions and provides that\r\n  depositions &quot;shall only be allowed if agreed upon by the disciplinary counsel\r\n  and the respondent or if the chair of the hearing panel . . . grants permission\r\n  to do so based on a showing of good cause.&quot;Â  Rule 25(c), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  The Chairman acted within his discretion in refusing to allow\r\n  Respondent to depose Seymour.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Hearsay Documents\r\nDuring\r\n  Seymour's testimony, certain documents produced in the course of the\r\n  investigation were admitted.Â  Respondent argues that particular documents, each\r\n  submitted to ODC by his counsel, were hearsay.Â  We disagree.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  Respondent objected to the admission of the following: (1) a trust account\r\n  ledger for the Client A account; (2) a statement for an account for Client A\r\n  maintained outside of the trust account; (3) a statement for the Client A\r\n  checking account; and (4) a list of outstanding balances owed to Client A's\r\n  doctors. Â We find that the Panel did not err in refusing to bar the admission\r\n  of the documents as hearsay.Â  Respondent provided the documents in response to\r\n  a subpoena requiring him to submit, among other things, an accounting ledger\r\n  for Client A maintained in compliance with Rule 417 of the South Carolina\r\n  Appellate Court Rules.Â  The exhibits in question are, therefore, presumably\r\n  what Respondent represents as his own work and records. Â The work product of\r\n  Respondent is not hearsay.Â  See Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE, (&quot;A statement\r\n  is not hearsay if . . . (2) The statement is offered against a party and is (A)\r\n  the party's own statement in either an individual or a representative\r\n  capacity[.]&quot;).Â  Moreover, because Respondent prepared and submitted the\r\n  documents, Respondent arguably asserted a belief in their validity.Â  See Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE, (&quot;A statement is not hearsay if . . . (2) The\r\n  statement is offered against a party and is . . . (B) a statement of which the\r\n  party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth[.]&quot;).\r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we find that the Panel did not err in admitting the documents.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Evidence to Warrant\r\n  Disbarment\r\nRespondent\r\n  contends that there is no clear and convincing evidence to warrant disbarment.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nRespondent\r\n  notes that the burden of proof rests with ODC and contends that ODC failed to\r\n  meet its burden.Â  We find overwhelming evidence to warrant disbarment.Â  ODC\r\n  showed through the presentation of numerous documents that Respondent drafted\r\n  agreements containing inherent conflicts, put client property to his own\r\n  personal use, misappropriated funds, engaged in improper real estate\r\n  transactions with clients, failed to maintain proper records of receipt and disbursements\r\n  of client funds, and failed to maintain records of his handling of client real\r\n  and personal property.Â  This Court has disbarred attorneys for similar\r\n  misconduct.Â  See, e.g., In the Matter of Cunningham, 371 S.C. 503, 640\r\n  S.E.2d 461 (2007) (disbarment warranted for attorney who misappropriated\r\n  $70,000.00 from estate while acting as personal representative and failed to\r\n  maintain accounts); In the Matter of Murphy, 367 S.C. 338, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  333 (2006) (disbarment appropriate for attorney who misappropriated $65,000.00\r\n  from trust account).\r\nV.&nbsp; Restitution to Clients and\r\n  Reimbursement to Lawyers' Fund\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues that the Panel erred in recommending restitution to Client A and Client\r\n  B where both have resolved malpractice actions against Respondent.Â  Respondent\r\n  also objects to the Panel's recommendation that he pay the Lawyers' Fund for Client\r\n  Protection.Â  We disagree with Respondent as to both arguments.\r\n(1) Res\r\n  Judicata and Collateral Estoppel\r\nThe\r\n  Panel recommended that Respondent be required to pay $127,137.97 to Client A\r\n  and $1,221,769.80 to Client B.Â  The Panel noted that Respondent should receive\r\n  a credit towards restitution for the amount he paid to satisfy the civil\r\n  judgment Client A obtained against him in his malpractice action.Â Â Â Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  Client A and Client B filed civil actions against Respondent asserting claims\r\n  of legal malpractice, fraud, and conversion.Â  A jury awarded Client A\r\n  $40,215.56 on the legal malpractice claims.Â  Following Client B's death, his\r\n  estate elected not to pursue the claim and the case was dismissed.Â  Respondent\r\n  contends that the Panel is &quot;barred by the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel from awarding additional damages to the parties in this\r\n  proceeding.&quot; \r\nRes\r\n  judicata is a rule that a final\r\n  judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is\r\n  conclusive as to the rights of the parties and, as to them, constitutes an\r\n  absolute bar to a subsequent action.Â  Black's Law Dictionary 1174 (5th ed.\r\n  1979).Â  To establish res judicata, the following elements must be shown:\r\n  (1) identities of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3)\r\n  adjudication of the issue in the former suit.Â  See Riedman Corp. v.\r\n    Greenville Steel Structures, Inc., 308 S.C. 467, 469, 419 S.E.2d 217, 218\r\n  (1992).Â  We note that Respondent proposes the use of the doctrine of res\r\n    judicata, not to bar an action, but to bar certain damages.Â  Res\r\n      judicata is not the proper vehicle for the remedy Respondent seeks.Â \r\n  Moreover, Respondent has failed to establish the requisite elements for res\r\n    judicata.Â  Specifically, Respondent has failed to establish similarity of\r\n  the parties, as Client A and Client B are not parties to the instant case, and similarity\r\n  of issues, as the instant action focuses on misconduct.Â  Matter of Babilis,\r\n  951 P.2d 207, 217 (Utah 1997) (&quot;Because enforcement of attorney discipline\r\n  matters implicates public interests that transcends the personal interests of\r\n  [the clients], the Bar is not acting on behalf of [the clients] but is acting\r\n  to enforce sanctions in its own right.&quot;).Â  Consequently, res judicata does not apply to bar restitution in this matter.\r\nRespondent\r\n  also argues that restitution to Client A and Client B is barred by collateral\r\n  estoppel.Â  Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prohibits a court from\r\n  adjudicating an issue that was actually litigated and determined by a valid and\r\n  final judgment in a prior suit.Â  See Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132,\r\n  135, 666 S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008).Â Â  As noted above, the issue in the instant\r\n  case is Respondent's alleged misconduct, and restitution is a sanction that\r\n  follows from a finding of misconduct.Â  See In re Ruffin, 382 S.C. 598,\r\n  677 S.E.2d 25 (2009) (&quot;We hold disbarment without retroaction, costs, and\r\n  restitution are warranted sanctions.&quot;); see also Rule 7(b)(7), RLDE,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, (recognizing restitution as a sanction for misconduct).Â  The\r\n  issue of alleged misconduct could not have been litigated in the legal\r\n  malpractice action as &quot;the duty of adjudging the professional conduct of\r\n  members of the Bar and taking appropriate disciplinary action rests exclusively\r\n  with this Court.&quot;Â  In re Ruffin, 382 S.C. at 604, 677 S.E.2d at 28\r\n  (citing In the Matter of Hines, 275 S.C. 271, 273, 269 S.E.2d 766, 767\r\n  (1980)).Â  Consequently, collateral estoppel does not apply to bar restitution\r\n  in this matter.\r\nWe\r\n  find that the amount of restitution recommended by the Panel to be made to\r\n  Client A and Client B is appropriate.Â  Respondent challenged the\r\n  appropriateness of restitution, not the amount of restitution recommended by\r\n  the Panel.Â  Thus, finding no bar to ordering Respondent to make restitution, we\r\n  adopt the recommendation of the Panel in so far as it concerns restitution to\r\n  Client A and Client B.[6]Â  \r\n(2) Restitution\r\n  to the Lawyers' Fund\r\nIn\r\n  addition to restitution to Client A and Client B, the Panel Report recommended\r\n  restitution should be made to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers'\r\n  Fund) for funds paid from Respondent's trust accounts for commission on the\r\n  sale of Chateau de Ville and funds paid to Client B for the sale of Mallard\r\n  Apartments. \r\nRespondent\r\n  objects to the recommended restitution to the Lawyers' Fund because he claims\r\n  he did not have knowledge of the payments or an opportunity for a hearing\r\n  before payments were made.Â  However, as noted by ODC, the Panel Report makes no\r\n  finding that the Lawyers' Fund made payments to Client A and Client B.Â  Instead,\r\n  the Panel recommended that Respondent be ordered to deposit with the Lawyers'\r\n  Fund an amount equal to the payments he made to Sunvest Properties as\r\n  commission for the sale of Chateau de Ville and to Client B for the sale of\r\n  Mallard Apartments.Â  ODC notes that these payments were made from Crews's trust\r\n  account from unidentified funds and &quot;[s]ince this money has not been\r\n  identified, it is appropriate to require Respondent to make an equivalent\r\n  deposit with the Lawyers' Fund in the event claims are filed on behalf of the\r\n  client or clients to whom it belongs.&quot;Â  \r\nPursuant\r\n  to Rule 7(b)(10), RLDE, this Court has\r\n  broad powers to impose sanctions.[7] Â We find that, due to the severity of Respondent's misconduct and the possibility\r\n  that a claim will be made against the Lawyers' Fund for the funds at issue,\r\n  requiring him to pay restitution to the Lawyers' Fund in the amount recommended\r\n  by the Panel is appropriate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis\r\n  matter involved the aggravated misconduct of an attorney who engaged in\r\n  egregious, predatory behavior, taking advantage of and causing great detriment\r\n  to his clients.Â  Respondent took vast, yet unchecked, power over the affairs of\r\n  the clients at issue.Â  Respondent used these powers for his benefit, but to the\r\n  detriment of the clients.Â  When a lawyer acquires fiduciary duties over his\r\n  clients' affairs, as is the case in this matter, he must meticulously account\r\n  for his handling of the client's real and personal property.Â  Respondent failed\r\n  to keep account of his handling of his clients' financial transactions, hiding\r\n  the great detriment he caused them.Â  Any friendship Respondent gave to the\r\n  clients at issue here, as he claims to have provided them, is no substitute for\r\n  the great harm he caused them.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we adopt the Panel's recommendation to disbar Respondent.Â \r\n  Further, we order him to pay restitution in the following amounts: $86,922.41[8] to Client A, $1,221,769.80 to Client B, and $23,379.00 to the Lawyers' Fund for\r\n  Client Protection.Â  Finally, we order Respondent to pay the costs of the\r\n  proceedings.Â  \r\nWithin\r\n  ninety (90) days of the date of this opinion, the Commission and Respondent\r\n  shall enter into a restitution agreement which complies with the directives of\r\n  this order.Â  Further, within (30) days of the date of this opinion, Respondent\r\n  is ordered to reimburse the Commission and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  for costs incurred in this matter.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J. not\r\n  participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Client A's father died around the time he contacted Respondent.Â  Client A stood\r\n  to inherit under the will.\r\n[2] Just over two months later, Respondent represented in documents submitted while\r\n  applying for a loan that he owned the Chateau de Ville property but owed no\r\n  money on it.\r\n[3] Barbara Seymour testified at the hearing that ODC received one version of the\r\n  contract for sale in the first set of documents sent by Crews's attorney.Â \r\n  After ODC asked for any conflict waivers or disclosures, it received the second\r\n  version of the contract for sale, which included the following language: &quot;The\r\n  Escrow Agent hereinabove referred to shall be Crews Law Firm.Â  Seller is\r\n    aware Sam Crews owns Main Properties, LLC and approves this sale.&quot;Â \r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  The signature page appears to be the same on both\r\n  documents.Â  Respondent testified that he did not know if the page containing\r\n  the conflict waiver was ever presented to Client B.Â  Aside from this document,\r\n  no evidence was presented to show that Client B consented to the conflict.\r\n[4] For example, in March 2003, Respondent signed a promissory note and personal\r\n  guarantee for $35,000.Â  He then issued a check to himself for $35,000 from the\r\n  trust account and deposited it in the Main Properties account.Â  \r\n[5] Charges to the card included office supplies, criminal background checks\r\n  associated with other client matters, clothing for Respondent and his family,\r\n  pool supplies, dog supplies, repairs to his personal vehicles, garden supplies\r\n  for Respondent's wife, meals, groceries, a camera, gun supplies, dental care,\r\n  and a haircut.\r\n[6] Even if Respondent had challenged the amount of restitution recommended by the\r\n  Panel, we see nothing in the record to indicate he kept sufficient records to\r\n  support such an argument.Â  See In the Matter of Miles, 335 S.C. 242,\r\n  247, 516 S.E.2d 661, 663 (1999) (&quot;When disciplinary counsel\r\n  presents clear and convincing evidence of trust account violations or other\r\n  inadequate recordkeeping a lawyer's records must be sufficiently detailed to\r\n  overcome the allegations.&quot;).Â  \r\n[7] See Rule 7(b)(10), RLDE (&quot;Misconduct shall be grounds for one or\r\n  more of the following sanctions: . . . (9) any other sanction or requirement as\r\n  the Supreme Court may determine is appropriate&quot;).\r\n[8] The Panel recommended that Respondent be ordered to pay $127,137.97 in\r\n  restitution to Client A, yet be credited the amount Client A received as a\r\n  result of a civil suit against Respondent.Â  The amount Client A received in the\r\n  civil suit against Respondent was $40,215.56.Â  The amount we order Respondent\r\n  to pay Client A in restitution reflects this credit.Â  Additionally, however,\r\n  credited to the amount Respondent pays to Client A in restitution should be the\r\n  amount, if any, the Lawyers' Fund may have paid to Client A with respect to\r\n  this matter. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26871","title":"State v.

Bixby was\r\n  charged with the murder of Abbeville County Deputy Sheriff Danny Wilson and\r\n  Abbeville County Magistrate's Constable Donnie Ouzts.Â  Bixby was tried by a\r\n  jury on two counts of murder and related charges.Â  The jury found him guilty of\r\n  all charges and recommended that he be sentenced to death.Â  The trial judge\r\n  imposed the death penalty.Â  This appeal followed.Â  We affirm. \r\nFacts/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn December 2003,\r\n  while working on a construction project in Abbeville County, officials from the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) encountered the Bixby\r\n  family.Â  In order to expand SC-72, the SCDOT planned to take advantage of a\r\n  right of way it held across the Bixbys' property.Â  The Bixbys did not believe\r\n  that the SCDOT held a right of way across their property and, beginning on\r\n  December 4, 2003, threatened violence to prevent any construction on their\r\n  land.Â  These threats culminated in the murders of Deputy WilsonÂ  and Constable\r\n  Donnie Ouzts on Monday, December 8, 2003. \r\nThe following is a chronological\r\n  description of the events which resulted in the murders:\r\nThursday, December 4, 2003\r\nOn the morning of\r\n  December 4, 2003, SCDOT officials first met the Bixby family after discovering\r\n  someone had tampered with the surveyor's stakes on the family's property.Â \r\n  SCDOT Construction Superintendent Glen McCaffrey approached the Bixby home to\r\n  discuss the road widening project.Â  McCaffrey was accompanied by fellow SCDOT\r\n  employees Dale Williams and Mike Hannah.Â  \r\nSuperintendent McCaffrey\r\n  showed the construction plans to Appellant, his mother, Rita Bixby, and father,\r\n  Arthur Bixby, and attempted to persuade them that the SCDOT held a right of way\r\n  across their property.Â  The Bixbys responded with threats of violence and\r\n  claimed they would fight to the death if anyone tried to do any construction\r\n  work on the property.[1]Â \r\n  Right of Way Agent Williams told them that SCDOT officials would have to get\r\n  the Sheriff involved, to which the Bixbys responded that they would kill law\r\n  enforcement officials if anyone &quot;trespassed&quot; on their property.\r\nSCDOT\r\n  officials McCaffrey, Williams, and Hannah went to the Sheriff's department,\r\n  reported the encounter, and conveyed that there was a &quot;serious\r\n  situation&quot; at the Bixby home.Â  Because these men feared the Bixbys'\r\n  threats, they requested that an officer be assigned to mediate the situation.\r\nFriday, December 5, 2003\r\nAround noon on Friday, December 5, 2003,\r\n  Appellant discussed the road construction project with Dr. Mark Horton, a\r\n  dentist whose office was near the Bixby home.Â  Steven Bixby and Dr. Horton\r\n  talked about dealings with the SCDOT.Â  Horton told Steven Bixby that he had hired\r\n  an attorney and that Dr. Horton, his lawyer, and the SCDOT had set a time to\r\n  discuss the construction's impact on Horton's property.Â  Describing his\r\n  conversation with Appellant, Horton testified as follows: \r\n\r\n\t. . . first\r\n  he told me that he was from New Hampshire and he said that, you know, their\r\n  motto was something like, you know, if I can't - I'd rather be dead if I can't\r\n  be free, something like that.Â  And at one point he said that, I've got\r\n  something that's going to blow this whole project out of the water, and I took\r\n  that to mean that he had some information or something.Â  But he was becoming\r\n  somewhat agitated and I kept telling him that, well, I thought it best if he'd\r\n  get an attorney and look over his situation and see if they could resolve it.Â \r\n  So basically I wished him well and told him that you need to get an attorney,\r\n  that I had to get one, and I hoped that things would get resolved.Â  But you\r\n  know, he did seem agitated and he said at one point I think that, they'll take\r\n  my land over my cold, dead body.Â  \r\n\r\nAt approximately\r\n  3:30 p.m., SCDOT Superintendent McCaffrey contacted Rita Bixby, informing her\r\n  that he had documents concerning the right of way.Â  Also on the phone with\r\n  McCaffrey were Williams, Hannah, and Joe McCurry, a fellow SCDOT employee.Â \r\n  McCaffrey requested that the Bixbys and SCDOT officials meet the following\r\n  Monday (December 8, 2003) to discuss the right of way.Â  Rita responded by\r\n  saying, &quot;Anything you got is lies.&quot;Â  Although eventually agreeing to\r\n  the December 8, 2003 meeting, Rita said that if the men wanted to show her the\r\n  documents they could meet her at the family's home in five minutes.Â  Three of\r\n  the SCDOT officials left to meet with Rita.Â  Williams, however, refused to go\r\n  because he feared the situation might become violent.\r\nWhen the SCDOT\r\n  officials arrived at the Bixby home, Rita told them that the documents were\r\n  forgeries and threatened that her family &quot;would fight till the last breath\r\n  and there would be hell to pay.&quot;Â  She demanded that no construction take\r\n  place.Â  McCaffrey said they would have to come back with a deputy.Â  Rita\r\n  replied that the Sheriff's department had no authority over them on private\r\n  property.Â  \r\nSunday, December 7, 2003\r\nOn the evening of\r\n  December 7, 2003, Appellant, Steven Bixby went to a social gathering at the\r\n  home of Alane Taylor, his former girlfriend.Â  Appellant told Alane,\r\n  &quot;Tomorrow is the day.&quot;Â  Alane asked Steven to explain and he said,\r\n  &quot;We have all the guns loaded in my dad's house and if anybody comes in the\r\n  yard we will shoot and if the shooting starts I won't come out alive.&quot;Â  Steven\r\n  also said that this had been planned for some time and that his mother Rita\r\n  planned to take his brother to Steven's apartment while Steven and Arthur\r\n  stayed at the house.Â  Alane attempted to talk Steven out of his planned\r\n  violence.Â  \r\nAdditionally, while\r\n  at Alane's house, Appellant told Alane's daughter, Dana Newton, he intended to\r\n  shoot law enforcement if they came on his parents' property.Â  Newton testified\r\n  that Appellant said, &quot;I will, I'll blow their mother f****** heads off if\r\n  they step one step onto my parent's property.Â  I will.&quot;Â  \r\nAlane and Dana\r\n  called Abbeville Deputy Barry New, a relative, and told him about Steven Bixby's\r\n  comments.Â  They said they were concerned that harm would come to anyone that\r\n  went to the Bixby home.Â  Deputy New called his supervisor and left a message\r\n  conveying the warnings.Â  \r\nMonday, December 8, 2003\r\nAt 8:30 a.m. on\r\n  Monday, December 8, 2003, Deputy Wilson met with SCDOT officials McCaffrey,\r\n  Williams, and Hannah to discuss SCDOT's prior confrontation with the Bixbys and\r\n  plan for that morning's meeting with the family.Â  After discussing the matter,\r\n  Deputy Wilson headed straight to the Bixby home.Â  SCDOT officials Williams and\r\n  Hannah left shortly thereafter.Â  \r\nAs Williams and\r\n  Hannah approached the Bixby home in their vehicle, they noticed that Deputy\r\n  Wilson's car was in the driveway.[2]Â \r\n  However, Deputy Wilson was nowhere to be seen.Â  Williams and Hannah drove past\r\n  the Bixby home for fear that it was not safe.Â  They drove past again and\r\n  noticed that the blinds were closed but peep holes were cut into them.Â  The\r\n  third time they drove past the house they saw Appellant standing in the doorway\r\n  holding a pistol in one hand and a rifle in the other.\r\nAt around 9:30\r\n  a.m., Appellant placed a phone call to his mother, Rita, who was at Appellant's\r\n  apartment with his brother.Â  Appellant informed Rita that the shooting had\r\n  begun.Â  Rita placed phone calls to the Governor's office, the Attorney General's\r\n  office, and Dr. Craig Gagnon, a family friend and local chiropractor.Â  Dr. Gagnon\r\n  went to the Bixby residence. \r\nArriving at the\r\n  Bixby home at approximately 9:40 a.m., Dr. Gagnon saw two law enforcement\r\n  officers standing in the front yard of the Bixby home.Â  He heard a shot come\r\n  from the home and saw Constable Ouzts fall to the ground, mortally wounded.Â  As\r\n  news of the confrontation spread, several officers arrived and were able to\r\n  retrieve Constable Ouzts's body.Â  Additionally, the South Carolina Law\r\n  Enforcement Division (SLED) dispatched approximately fifty agents and tactical\r\n  support.Â  \r\nAfter determining Rita's\r\n  whereabouts, David Alford, an investigator with the Abbeville County Sheriff's\r\n  Department, apprehended her at Appellant's apartment and transported her to a\r\n  temporary command center near the Bixby home.Â  While at the command center,\r\n  Rita refused to help Alford and the SLED agents diffuse the situation stating,\r\n  &quot;Why would I want to help you, I wanted to be inside with them today but\r\n  they made me stay outside to tell the world why they died.&quot;Â  All other\r\n  attempts to contact Appellant and his father inside the home were unsuccessful. \r\nAt approximately\r\n  7:30 p.m., SLED sent robots equipped with cameras toward the house where they\r\n  were able to peer through a window.Â  The cameras captured footage of Deputy\r\n  Wilson, who was face down on the floor of the Bixbys' living room with his\r\n  hands cuffed behind him.Â  He was dead.Â  A team of officers entered the home and\r\n  retrieved Deputy Wilson's body, which was already stiff from rigor mortis. \r\nAt approximately\r\n  8:55 p.m., SLED sent another robot into the Bixby home.Â  Arthur fired a shot at\r\n  the robot, and he and Appellant began firing at the officers outside the\r\n  house.Â  The officers returned fire and shot tear gas into the home.Â  \r\nThe gun fight\r\n  continued until at approximately 9:25 p.m. when Appellant surrendered and\r\n  notified police that Arthur was wounded.Â  Again, a robot was sent into the\r\n  house.Â  Video transmitted by the robot confirmed that Arthur had been shot and\r\n  was sitting on the bathroom floor surrounded by weapons.Â  At approximately\r\n  11:00 p.m., Arthur crawled into the living room and surrendered to\r\n  authorities.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  August 2004, Appellant was indicted by an Abbeville County Grand Jury on one count\r\n  of conspiracy to commit murder, one count of kidnapping, two counts of murder,\r\n  one count of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime, and twelve counts of assault with intent to kill.Â  The State\r\n  sought the death penalty for the murders of Deputy Wilson and Constable Ouzts. \r\nA jury trial began\r\n  on February 14, 2007.Â  On February 18, 2007, the jury returned a verdict of\r\n  guilty as charged on each count.Â  At the end of the penalty phase, the jury\r\n  recommended that Appellant be sentenced to death.Â  The trial judge sentenced\r\n  Appellant to death finding the evidence warranted the penalty and the sentence\r\n  was not imposed as a result of prejudice, passion, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor.[3]Â  \r\nIssues\r\n\r\n\tAppellant\r\n  presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\nGuilt

Carolina Constitution?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nGenerally,\r\n  &quot;[i]n criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is\r\n  bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly\r\n  erroneous.&quot;Â  State v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305, 312, 642 S.E.2d 582,\r\n  586 (2007).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Qualification\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  that the trial judge abused his discretion when he did not allow defense\r\n  counsel to probe jurors concerning the definition of &quot;murder&quot; because\r\n  this ruling prevented him from ascertaining each potential juror's\r\n  qualification with regard to their views on capital punishment.Â  We disagree. \r\nJury\r\n  qualification began on February 5, 2007 and was completed on February 12,\r\n  2007.Â  As part of this qualification, each potential juror completed extensive\r\n  juror questionnaires designed to elicit general, personal information, and\r\n  probe for bias and predisposition.Â  The questionnaires contained specific\r\n  questions concerning each potential juror's view on the death penalty.Â  \r\nCounsel\r\n  received the answers to these questionnaires, was present during the trial\r\n  court's questioning of the potential jurors, and was permitted to ask questions\r\n  of each potential juror.Â  During the first portion of defense counsel's\r\n  questioning of the potential jurors, counsel instructed each person on the\r\n  definition of murder, as opposed to self-defense.Â  Over counsel's objection,\r\n  the trial judge instructed him to cease instructing each potential juror as to\r\n  the definition of murder.Â  \r\nWith\r\n  regard to the jury actually impaneled, defense counsel did not move to\r\n  disqualify any of the named jurors during individual panel qualification and,\r\n  critically, defense counsel used only seven of the ten available strikes during\r\n  jury selection.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  scope of voir dire and the manner in which it is conducted are generally\r\n  left to the sound discretion of the trial court.&quot;Â  State v. Stanko,\r\n  376 S.C. 571, 575, 658 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2008).Â  Furthermore, &quot;[i]t is well\r\n  established that a trial court has broad discretion in conducting the voir\r\n    dire of the jury and particularly in phrasing the questions to be\r\n  asked.&quot;Â  United States v. Jones, 608 F.2d 1004, 1009 (4th Cir.\r\n  1979).Â  &quot;To constitute reversible error, a limitation on questioning must\r\n  render the trial fundamentally unfair.&quot;Â  Stanko, 376 S.C. at 576,\r\n  658 S.E.2d at 97.Â  \r\nProcedurally Barred\r\nWhere\r\n  counsel fails to exhaust all strikes, appellate review of juror qualification\r\n  issues is barred.Â  See State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 163, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  260, 264 (1996) (holding &quot;[f]ailure to exhaust all of a defendant's\r\n  peremptory strikes will preclude appellate review of juror qualification\r\n  issues&quot;).Â Â  Because defense counsel used only seven of the ten available\r\n  strikes during jury selection, review of this issue is barred.Â  \r\nActual Jurors Were\r\n  Qualified Without Objection\r\nNonetheless, even\r\n  if this issue is not procedurally barred because of Appellant's failure to\r\n  exhaust all of his peremptory strikes, his arguments concerning jury\r\n  qualification are without merit.Â  \r\n&quot;[A]ny\r\n  claim that a jury was not impartial must focus on the juror who ultimately sat\r\n  at the trial.&quot;Â  Tucker, 324 S.C. at 162-63, 478 at 264 (citing Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 81 (1988)).Â  As mentioned previously, defense\r\n  counsel did not move to disqualify any of the jurors actually impaneled.Â  In\r\n  our view, the qualification of jurors was extensive and defense counsel did not\r\n  challenge the qualification of the impaneled jurors because he had sufficient\r\n  information from both their answers to the detailed questionnaires and his\r\n  questioning to determine that each was qualified.Â  Thus, Appellant's argument\r\n  is without merit and, in addition, is barred because he failed to raise any\r\n  issue with respect to the qualification of the impaneled jurors.\r\nWith\r\n  respect to Appellant's arguments concerning voir dire, the dissent reasons that\r\n  the trial judge committed reversible error because counsel was not given sufficient\r\n  latitude to instruct the potential jurors as to the legal definition of\r\n  murder.Â  We are not persuaded by this position because such information is\r\n  disseminated to jurors by way of jury instructions, not questioning on voir\r\n  dire.[4]Â \r\n  For these reasons, we find that the trial judge did not commit reversible error\r\n  when he refused to allow defense counsel to probe jurors concerning the definition\r\n  of murder. \r\nII.&nbsp; Title Abstract Witness\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to allow a defense\r\n  witness to testify about his search for records concerning the right of way at\r\n  issue.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  attempted to present the testimony of Patrick White (White), who was retained\r\n  by Appellant to conduct a title abstract on the Bixby property.Â  Appellant\r\n  wanted to establish, through White's testimony, that he had a good faith belief\r\n  that there was no right of way on the Bixby property.Â  Further, Appellant\r\n  wanted to rebut the State's argument that the records concerning the right of\r\n  way were easily accessible to the public.Â  The State objected to the witness's\r\n  testimony as irrelevant.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  an in camera hearing, title abstractor White's testimony was proffered\r\n  to the trial judge.Â  White said that he found no record of any easements,\r\n  encroachments, or rights-of-way pertaining to the Bixby property filed at the\r\n  Abbeville County Clerk of Court's office.Â  The trial judge asked White if he\r\n  was familiar with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-570 (1993), which requires that copies\r\n  of highway plans with right of way designation be maintained in the tax\r\n  assessor's office for each county.Â  White replied that he was not familiar with\r\n  this statutory provision and that he did not search the tax assessor's office\r\n  for a record of the right of way.Â  The trial judge ruled that White's testimony\r\n  was irrelevant and inadmissible because White was unaware of section 57-5-570\r\n  and did not conduct a complete search for the public record of the\r\n  rights-of-way on the Bixby property.[5]\r\n&quot;'Relevant\r\n  evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  White's\r\n  testimony was not relevant to the defense's position because he only looked for\r\n  records of the right of way at the Abbeville County Clerk of Court's office.Â \r\n  Because White did not search for a record of the right of way in the county tax\r\n  assessor's office where S.C. Code Â§ 57-5-570 requires that they be maintained,\r\n  his testimony did not have the tendency to make it more or less probable that\r\n  1) Appellant had a good faith belief that there was no right of way on his\r\n  family's land, and 2) the records concerning the right of way were not easily\r\n  accessible to the public.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  any event, even if White's testimony were relevant, its exclusion by the trial\r\n  court was appropriate pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, because it would have misled\r\n  the jury.[6]Â \r\n  White's testimony that he did not find any record of the right of way at the\r\n  court house would only lead the jury to believe that a right of way should have\r\n  been recorded at the clerk of court's office, which is contrary to state law.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Court of Appeals' Order\r\nAt\r\n  trial, SLED Chief Robert Stewart (Chief Stewart) testified that during the\r\n  standoff he &quot;called Chief Justice Jean Toal and Circuit Court Judge\r\n  Johnson to get the necessary authority to begin intercepting any calls that\r\n  were coming into or out of the [Bixby] house to try to determine what was going\r\n  on in the house.&quot;Â  Judge Johnson made the following notation on his\r\n  calendar for December 8, 2003:\r\n\r\n\tTalked\r\n  to Chief Stewart, 2:48.Â  [Illegible] 2 different.Â  Mother and brother somewhere\r\n  else.Â  Steven Vernon Bixby w/father.Â  &amp; mother &amp; brother somewhere.Â \r\n  Authorized 2 wiretaps.\r\n\r\nSLED initiated the\r\n  wiretap at 4:54 p.m.Â  At approximately 8:55 p.m. the line became open and\r\n  recorded heavy gun fire and Appellant's eventual surrender.Â  Consistent with\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-95 (2002), on December 10, 2003, Judge Johnson entered\r\n  an order authorizing the emergency interception of wire and electronic\r\n  communications.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  filed a motion in the trial court to suppress the evidence obtained from the\r\n  wiretap.Â  This motion was denied.Â  Appellant then petitioned the court of\r\n  appeals for a motion to suppress the evidence and requested an evidentiary\r\n  hearing on the matter.Â  The court of appeals declined to conduct an evidentiary\r\n  hearing and denied Appellant's motion to suppress.Â  At trial, the tape\r\n  recording of gun fire and Appellant's surrender obtained by the wiretap was\r\n  played for the jury.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the court of appeals erred when it 1) ruled that the South Carolina\r\n  wiretap statute does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States\r\n  Constitution or the right to privacy in the South Carolina Constitution, 2) ruled\r\n  that SLED complied with the notification requirements in the South Carolina\r\n  wiretap statute, and 3) denied Appellant's request for an evidentiary hearing\r\n  on his motion to suppress the evidence gathered in the wiretap.Â  As to all of\r\n  these arguments, we disagree.\r\nConstitutionality of\r\n  Wiretap Statute\r\n\r\n\tAppellant argues\r\n  that the court of appeals erred when it determined the emergency provisions of\r\n  the South Carolina wiretap statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-95 (2002), do not\r\n  violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\r\n  Section 10 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Appellant argues that the\r\n  emergency provisions are unconstitutional because they allow a judge to approve\r\n  a wiretap without a probable cause determination.Â  Section 17-30-95 states:\r\n\t(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of\r\n  this chapter, any agent of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division\r\n  specifically designated by the Attorney General or his designated Assistant\r\n  Attorney General may intercept the wire, oral, or electronic communication if\r\n  an application for an order approving the interception is made within\r\n  forty-eight hours after the interception begins to occur, and the agent\r\n  determines that more likely than not: \r\n\t(1) an emergency exists that involves an\r\n  offense provided for in Section 17-30-70[7] and an immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or\r\n  the danger of escape of a prisoner and requires that a wire, oral, or\r\n  electronic communication be intercepted before an order authorizing the\r\n  interception can, with due diligence, be obtained; and \r\n\t(2) there are grounds upon which an order\r\n  could be entered under this chapter to authorize the interception. \r\n\t(B) In the absence of an order, the\r\n  interception must immediately terminate when the communication sought is\r\n  obtained or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier.\r\n  If the application for approval is denied, or in any other case in which the\r\n  interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents of\r\n  any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted must be treated as\r\n  having been obtained in violation of Section 17-30-20, and an inventory must be\r\n  served as provided for in Section 17-30-100(E) on the person named in the\r\n  application. \r\n\t(C) Agents of the South Carolina Law\r\n  Enforcement Division designated to intercept wire, oral, or electronic\r\n  communications pursuant to this section must have completed training provided\r\n  by SLED pursuant to Section 17-30-145. \r\n\t(D) A judge of competent jurisdiction must\r\n  be notified orally of the intent to begin the interception of any wire, oral,\r\n  or electronic communication when an emergency exists pursuant to the provisions\r\n  of this section before any interception is conducted. The judge must make a\r\n  written record of this notification. \r\n\r\nAppellant does\r\n  not argue that the emergency circumstances contemplated by the statute did not\r\n  exist.Â  He argues that section 17-30-95(D) is unconstitutional because it\r\n  allows a wiretap to begin upon oral notification of a &quot;judge of competent\r\n  jurisdiction.&quot;[8]Â Â  \r\nAppellant's argument has no merit because the commencement of a\r\n  wiretap after oral notification of a judge of competent jurisdiction is akin to\r\n  a warrantless search conducted when exigent circumstances demand immediate\r\n  action, a practice the United States Supreme Court and this Court have\r\n  established is constitutional.Â  See Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499, 509\r\n  (1978) (recognizing that &quot;warrantless entry by criminal law enforcement\r\n  official may be legal when there is compelling need for official action and no\r\n  time to secure a warrant&quot;); State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 586, 347\r\n  S.E.2d 882, 884 (1986) (opining that &quot;[t]he exigent circumstances doctrine\r\n  is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's protection against searches conducted\r\n  without prior approval by a judge or magistrate&quot;). Â Because the\r\n  commencement of a wiretap upon oral notification of a judge is only allowed in\r\n  the emergency circumstances specifically outlined in the statute, the wiretap\r\n  statute is constitutional under the exigent circumstances doctrine. \r\nSLED Compliance\r\n  with Notification Procedures\r\nAlternatively,\r\n  Appellant argues that the court of appeals erred in ruling that SLED complied\r\n  with the notification requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-95 (2002).Â \r\n  Specifically, Appellant argues that SLED did not follow the procedures of the\r\n  wiretap statute because there is no evidence in the record that Chief Justice\r\n  Toal designated Judge Johnson as a &quot;judge of competent jurisdiction&quot;\r\n  to authorize an emergency wiretap.Â  Appellant's argument is without merit.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  17-30-95(D) states, &quot;[a] judge of competent jurisdiction must be notified\r\n  orally of the intent to begin the interception of any wire, oral, or electronic\r\n  communication when an emergency exists pursuant to the provisions of this\r\n  section before any interception is conducted.&quot;Â  A &quot;judge of competent\r\n  jurisdiction&quot; is defined as a circuit court judge designated by the Chief\r\n  Justice.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-15(8) (2002).Â  At the time he was\r\n  notified of SLED's intent to commence a wiretap at the Bixbys' property, Judge\r\n  Johnson was assigned, by order of the Chief Justice, to be Chief Administrative\r\n  Judge of the Eight Judicial Circuit.[9]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-5-350 provides:\r\n\r\n\t. . . judges shall have at chambers in any county within the\r\n  circuit in which . . . they are assigned to hold court all powers and\r\n  jurisdiction which they have and exercise in open court in any county within\r\n  such circuit. . . . \r\n\r\nAbbeville County,\r\n  where the wiretap occurred, is in the Eighth Judicial Circuit.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Judge Johnson was designated by Chief Justice Toal as a judge of competent\r\n  jurisdiction for the purposes of notification under section 17-30-95(D).Â Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Appellant argues that SLED did not follow the procedures of the wiretap statute\r\n  because it could have received written authorization from Judge Johnson who was\r\n  holding court nearby in Greenwood.Â  Simply put, written authorization is not\r\n  required by the statute when emergency circumstances exist.Â  The record makes\r\n  clear that the situation was an emergency as contemplated by the statute;\r\n  therefore, this argument is without merit.Â  \r\nDenial of\r\n  Evidentiary Hearing\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred when it declined to conduct an\r\n  evidentiary hearing concerning the validity of the wiretap.Â  When it issued its\r\n  order in this matter, the court of appeals was serving as a &quot;reviewing\r\n  authority&quot; pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-110(A) (2002), which\r\n  provides that a &quot;reviewing authority may, in its discretion, conduct a\r\n  hearing and require additional testimony or documentary evidence.&quot;Â \r\n  Appellant claims that there are certain factual issues that the pleadings\r\n  failed to resolve.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues the court of appeals should\r\n  have conducted fact finding with respect to the designation of Judge Johnson to\r\n  receive oral notification under section 17-30-95(D) and whether SLED could have\r\n  received written authorization to conduct the wiretap at issue.\r\nAppellant's\r\n  argument in this respect is without merit.Â  First, as is made clear above,\r\n  Judge Johnson was the Chief Administrative Judge for the Eighth Judicial\r\n  Circuit.Â  Therefore, it cannot be said that the court of appeals abused its\r\n  discretion by declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing with respect to this\r\n  issue.Â  Second, it is clear from the record that the situation at the Bixby\r\n  residence was an emergency as contemplated by the statute.Â  Appellant argues\r\n  that SLED had enough personnel in the area to drive to Greenwood where Judge\r\n  Johnson was holding court and receive written authorization to conduct a\r\n  wiretap.Â  The statute simply did not require written authorization in this\r\n  situation.Â  Therefore, Appellant's argument is entirely without merit. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Rita Bixby's Experience in\r\n  New Hampshire\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to allow Rita to\r\n  testify concerning her experience handling property disputes in New Hampshire.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  part of its case-in-chief in the guilt phase, the State presented evidence that\r\n  the Bixby family never hired an attorney to act as their agent in the dispute\r\n  with SCDOT.Â  At trial, Rita testified that she had enough experience to deal\r\n  with the legal aspects of the situation on her own, thus she did not need an\r\n  attorney.Â  Defense counsel then asked Rita to explain her prior &quot;experience&quot;\r\n  handling property disputes.Â  The State objected to this question as irrelevant\r\n  and the trial court sustained the objection.\r\n&quot;'Relevant\r\n  evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  We find\r\n  that evidence concerning the details of Rita's handling of property disputes in\r\n  New Hampshire is irrelevant to why her family did not hire an attorney to act\r\n  as their agent in the dispute with the SCDOT.Â  When the State made an issue out\r\n  of the fact that the Bixbys could have hired an attorney but did not, it was\r\n  certainly relevant for counsel to ask Rita if she thought she was capable of\r\n  handling the dispute and, if so, why.Â  This question was posed to Rita and she\r\n  answered it.Â  \r\nNonetheless,\r\n  Appellant argues that Rita should have been able to testify concerning the\r\n  details of the matters in which she was involved in New Hampshire.Â  The record\r\n  demonstrates that Rita simply wanted to testify as to her views of government\r\n  and the Constitution, a matter that is not relevant to the question of why she\r\n  did not hire an attorney.Â Â  Â Â \r\nV.&nbsp; Admission of Rita Bixby's\r\n  Out-of-Court Statements\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  that the trial court erred when it allowed Deputy Alford; Appellant's former\r\n  girlfriend, Alane Taylor; and Sheriff Goodwin to testify about certain\r\n  out-of-court statements made by Rita.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 613(b), SCRE,\r\n  states:\r\n\tExtrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by\r\n  a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of\r\n  the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom\r\n  it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the\r\n  State failed to lay a proper foundation pursuant to Rule 613(b), SCRE, for the\r\n  testimony of Deputy Alford, Ms. Taylor, and Sheriff Goodwin.Â  Appellant's\r\n  argument is without merit.\r\nAlford\r\nDeputy Alford was\r\n  one of the law enforcement officers who apprehended Rita at Appellant's\r\n  apartment and spoke with her at the temporary command center.Â  At trial, the\r\n  State questioned Rita with respect to her interaction with Deputy Alford.Â  Rita\r\n  denied speaking to Deputy Alford on the morning of the murders.Â  Additionally,\r\n  she denied knowing who Deputy Alford was and denied telling anyone that she was\r\n  not in the house at the time of the murders because she needed &quot;to tell\r\n  the world&quot; why Appellant and Arthur were killed.Â  \r\nThe State called\r\n  Deputy Alford to testify concerning his interaction with Rita on the morning of\r\n  the murders.Â  Alford testified:\r\n\r\n\tAnd\r\n  during the course of the conversation back and forth with Mrs. Bixby one of the\r\n  officers - I believe it was one of the SLED agents - asked her, said, ma'am,\r\n  would you please just pick up the phone, call the house, and try to help us\r\n  out.Â  Tell them to come out, enough hurt's been done, just put the guns down\r\n  and come out.Â  And her exact statement was, and I quote, why would I want to\r\n  help you, I wanted to be inside with them today but they made me stay outside\r\n  to tell the world why they died, unquote.\r\n\r\nAppellant's\r\n  argument is without merit because the State laid a proper foundation for Deputy\r\n  Alford's testimony under Rule 613(b).Â  The series of questions asked of Rita\r\n  concerned the substance of the statement, the time and place it was made, and\r\n  the person to whom it was made.Â  Once Rita denied making the statement, the\r\n  State had laid a foundation to ask Alford about the statement.Â  \r\nTaylor\r\nAlane Taylor was\r\n  Appellant's former girlfriend.Â  The record indicates that Alane spoke with Rita\r\n  on the telephone the morning of the murders at issue. \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, the State asked Rita if she recalled receiving a phone call\r\n  from Alane.Â  Rita admitted that she received this phone call.Â  The State\r\n  specifically asked if she recalled making the following statements to Alane\r\n  during that phone call:\r\n\r\n\t1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant told her to take his\r\n  brother and leave the home,\r\n\t2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant had shot a deputy,\r\n\t3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was proud of Appellant for\r\n  standing up for her rights,\r\n\t4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted to be present for the\r\n  shooting, and\r\n\t5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would have shot someone if she\r\n  had been at her home.\r\n\r\nRita denied making each of\r\n  these statements.\r\nThe State called Alane\r\n  as an impeachment witness.Â  The trial judge found the State laid a proper\r\n  foundation under Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  Taylor testified that she tape recorded\r\n  the phone conversation with Rita.Â  After the tape was played for the jury, Alane\r\n  testified that it was genuine and Rita actually said all of the aforementioned\r\n  things to her.Â  \r\nThe record clearly\r\n  reflects that Rita admitted having the conversation at issue but specifically\r\n  denied making the statements later testified to by Taylor.Â Â  Thus, the State\r\n  laid a proper foundation under Rule 613(b), SCRE, and we find that Appellant's\r\n  argument is entirely without merit.\r\nSheriff Goodwin\r\nThe record\r\n  indicates that Rita spoke to Sheriff Goodwin from Dr. Gagnon's phone on the\r\n  morning of the incident.Â  The State questioned Rita concerning this\r\n  conversation.Â  Rita admitted speaking with Sheriff Goodwin from Dr. Gagnon's\r\n  phone.Â  However, she denied that the Sheriff begged her &quot;to call Arthur\r\n  and Steven and ask them to come out.&quot;Â  Rita claimed that the phone\r\n  conversation was &quot;cut off&quot; due to a &quot;dead spot&quot; and denied\r\n  hanging up on the Sheriff.Â  \r\nOver Appellant's\r\n  objection, Sheriff Goodwin testified concerning the telephone conversation with\r\n  Rita on December 8, 2003.Â  He said:\r\n\r\n\tAfter\r\n  arriving at the scene on - at 4 - at the Bixby resident [sic] and after talking\r\n  to some bystanders there, Doctor Craig Gagnon, I made a call to the resident\r\n  [sic] of the Bixby with no answer.Â  Mr. Gagnon, Doctor Gagnon said to me I can\r\n  get her on the telephone.Â  I talked to Mrs. Rita Bixby.Â  And after talking to\r\n  Mrs. Rita Bixby I asked her and pleaded with her would she please call the\r\n  resident [sic] where [Appellant] and Arthur Bixby was and asked her would she\r\n  ask [Appellant] and Arthur to come out and let's talk about what was going on\r\n  out there on this particular day.Â  And after talking to Mrs. Bixby for a while,\r\n  she got calling me - that she had called the Attorney General's Office, she had\r\n  called the other office.Â  But I stated to Mrs. Bixby, I said, Mrs. Bixby, but\r\n  you never called the Abbeville County Sheriff office, would you please call\r\n  [Appellant] and Arthur and ask them to come out and let's talk about what's\r\n  going on at the resident [sic] at the time . . . She hung up the telephone on\r\n  me.\r\n\r\nAppellant does not\r\n  contest that Rita was apprised of the time and place of the statement or to\r\n  whom it was made.Â  Nonetheless, Appellant argues that Rita was not apprised of\r\n  the substance of the statement she made to Sheriff Goodwin and thus a proper\r\n  foundation was not laid under Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  \r\nRita\r\n  was specifically asked, &quot;[d]id Sheriff Goodwin not beg you to call Arthur\r\n  and Steven and ask them to come out?&quot;Â  Rita denied that she was ever asked\r\n  this question by Sheriff Goodwin.Â  Additionally, Rita was asked &quot;[d]idn't\r\n  you really hang up on him?&quot;Â  Rita denied that she hung up on Sheriff\r\n  Goodwin.Â  Sheriff Goodwin's testimony concerning Rita's statements to him was\r\n  limited to the fact that he asked her to call Steven and Arthur and that Rita\r\n  hung up on him.Â  Therefore, the record clearly indicates that Rita was apprised\r\n  of the substance of the statement at issue and therefore Appellant's argument\r\n  is without merit.Â Â Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp; Jury Charge on Self-Defense\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  that the trial court erred when it declined to charge the jury that the State\r\n  had the burden of disproving each element of self-defense.Â  We disagree. \r\nOnce raised by the defense, the State must\r\n  disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350\r\n  S.C. 252, 260, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).Â  There are four elements required by\r\n  law to establish a case of self-defense.Â  State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 46, 317 S.E.2d 452, 453 (1984). The four\r\n  elements are:\r\n\r\n\tFirst, the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the\r\n  difficulty. Second, the defendant must have actually believed he was in\r\n  imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he\r\n  actually was in such imminent danger. Third, if his defense is based upon his\r\n  belief of imminent danger, a reasonably prudent man of ordinary firmness and\r\n  courage would have entertained the same belief. If the defendant actually was\r\n  in imminent danger, the circumstances were such as would warrant a man of\r\n  ordinary prudence, firmness and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to\r\n  save himself from serious bodily harm or losing his own life. Fourth, the\r\n  defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his own\r\n  life or sustaining serious bodily injury than to act as he did in this\r\n  particular instance. If, however, the defendant was on his own premises he had\r\n  no duty to retreat before acting in self-defense. \r\n\r\nId. Â &quot;When self-defense is properly\r\n  submitted to the jury, the defendant is entitled to a charge, if requested,\r\n  that the State has the burden of disproving self-defense by proof beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.&quot;Â  Burkhart, 350\r\n  S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303.Â  The trial judge charged the jury on\r\n  self-defense as follows:\r\n\r\n\tNow the\r\n  issue of self-defense has been raised in this case.Â  Self-defense is a complete\r\n  defense, and if it is established you must find the defendant not guilty of\r\n  murder.Â  The State has the burden of proof in this case, and this includes\r\n  proving the absence of the elements of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBecause all the\r\n  elements are required to establish self-defense, we are not persuaded by\r\n  Appellant's argument. Â It is an axiomatic principle of law that the defense has\r\n  not been established if any one element is disproven.Â  A jury charge on this\r\n  issue should state 1) the State has the burden of disproving self-defense and\r\n  2) this burden is carried by disproving any one of the four elements by proof\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  We find that the charge issued by the trial judge\r\n  complied with these requirements. Â Â \r\nVII.&nbsp; Funeral Videotape\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the trial court erred when, during the sentencing phase of his trial, it\r\n  admitted a seven minute video showing portions of Deputy Wilson's funeral.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe video at issue\r\n  here contained footage that showed the folding of an American flag over the\r\n  closed coffin; the playing of &quot;Taps&quot; on a trumpet; footage of\r\n  mourners; and a recording of a fictional 911 call in which Deputy Wilson is\r\n  given permission to &quot;return home,&quot; a tradition at law enforcement\r\n  funerals.Â  Over Appellant's objection, the trial judge concluded that the video\r\n  was admissible because it went to the question of the victim's uniqueness,\r\n  showed the harm committed by Appellant, and showed the impact of the victim's\r\n  death on his family and the community.Â  \r\n&quot;A\r\n  trial judge has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of\r\n  evidence and his ruling will not be disturbed absent a showing of probable\r\n  prejudice.&quot;Â  State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 378, 505 S.E.2d 328, 332\r\n  (1998).Â  Nonetheless, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) establishes that a death\r\n  sentence must be vacated if it was &quot;imposed under the influence of\r\n  passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the admission of the video introduced an arbitrary factor into the\r\n  sentencing phase of his trial in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1)\r\n  and the Eight Amendment. See State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 873 (2007) (finding that the prosecution's improper closing argument\r\n  that utilized a dramatic, mock funeral warranted a new trial).Â  In reply, the\r\n  State relies on Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), and argues that\r\n  the video was admissible as &quot;victim impact&quot; evidence and did not unduly\r\n  prejudice Appellant.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTurning to\r\n  Appellant's argument, in Northcutt, this Court vacated Northcutt's death\r\n  sentence holding that a staged funeral procession in which the solicitor draped\r\n  a large, black shroud over a baby crib and dramatically wheeled it out of the\r\n  courtroom introduced an arbitrary factor into the sentencing phase of the\r\n  defendant's trial.Â  The instant matter is distinguishable from Northcutt for one major reason: the video showed events that actually took place, whereas\r\n  the Northcutt funeral was a staged dramatization.[10]Â \r\n  A staged funeral procession in which a solicitor dramatically and in person\r\n  drapes a shroud over a baby's crib has more of a tendency to elicit passion and\r\n  prejudice than a videotape showing excerpts from a victim's actual funeral. \r\nTurning to the\r\n  State's argument, a State may conclude that victim impact evidence &quot;is\r\n  relevant to the jury's decision as to whether or not the death penalty should\r\n  be imposed.&quot;Â  Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. Â Victim impact evidence\r\n  demonstrates &quot;the loss to the victim's family and to society which has\r\n  resulted from the [victim]'s homicide.&quot;Â  Id. at 822.Â  We find the\r\n  videotape at issue was victim impact evidence because it showed the traditional\r\n  trappings of a law enforcement officer's funeral, demonstrating the general\r\n  loss suffered by society.Â  Additionally, the video showed footage of actual\r\n  mourners, displaying for the jury the specific impact of the murder on\r\n  particular members of society.Â  Thus, we hold the video was victim impact\r\n  evidence pursuant to Payne.\r\nNonetheless, this\r\n  evidence is subject to Rule 403, SCRE, which states that even relevant evidence &quot;may be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\n  cumulative evidence.&quot;Â  We find the probative value of the videotape was\r\n  not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  As the trial\r\n  judge ruled, the videotape was relevant to show the uniqueness of the victim,\r\n  the harm committed by Appellant, and the impact of the victim's death on his\r\n  family and society.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  deference is due to the trial court's admission of the evidence.Â  After all,\r\n  &quot;[a] trial judge has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility\r\n  of evidence and his ruling will not be disturbed absent a showing of probable\r\n  prejudice.&quot;Â  Ard, 332 S.C. at 378, 505 S.E.2d at 332.Â  In our view,\r\n  it is not probable that Appellant was prejudiced by the State's presentation of\r\n  the videotape at issue to the jury.\r\nThe\r\n  dissent would reverse Appellant's capital sentence because the video was moving\r\n  and could have caused the jurors to feel sympathy for the mourners and\r\n  &quot;outrage at the person who inflicted the suffering.&quot;Â  Under the law,\r\n  simply saying that evidence such as this was &quot;moving&quot; is not enough\r\n  to require reversal of a capital sentence.Â  Addressing this issue before, we\r\n  have said:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  appellant has the burden of showing that any alleged error deprived him of a\r\n  fair trial.Â  The relevant question is whether the solicitor's action so\r\n  infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial\r\n  of due process.Â  The Court must review the argument in the context of the\r\n  entire record.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Finklea, Op. No. 26843 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 26, 2010)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 66) (citing State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C.\r\n  207, 222, 641 S.E.2d 873, 881 (2007)).Â  In our view, there is no evidence in\r\n  the record sufficient to establish a finding of prejudice.Â  Thus, we are not\r\n  persuaded by the dissent's reasoning and affirm the decision of the trial\r\n  court.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nVIII.&nbsp; Mental Evaluation\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court's order compelling\r\n  him to submit to a mental evaluation violated his Fifth Amendment right against\r\n  self-incrimination.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPrior to the\r\n  sentencing phase of the trial, defense counsel indicated that Appellant\r\n  intended to present mitigation evidence concerning his mental health.Â  Upon the\r\n  State's motion, the trial court ordered Appellant to submit to a mental health\r\n  examination pursuant to State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420\r\n  (2000).Â  In order to protect Appellant, the trial court ordered that 1) the\r\n  report would be sealed from the State until evidence concerning Appellant's\r\n  mental state was presented by him in the sentencing phase, 2) defense counsel\r\n  was allowed to be present during the evaluation and he could object to any\r\n  question posed to Appellant by the examiner, and 3) any inculpatory statements\r\n  made by Appellant during the evaluation would not be revealed in the report.\r\nSelf-Incrimination\r\nA\r\n  criminal defendant has a right against self-incrimination.Â  U.S. Const. amend.\r\n  V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12.Â  Additionally, a capital defendant has a federal\r\n  constitutional right to present any relevant mitigation evidence.Â  Lockett\r\n    v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604-05 (1978).Â  Accordingly, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-20(C)(b) (2007) provides that evidence which tends to establish or rebut\r\n  any mitigating factors[11] may be offered during the sentencing phase of a capital proceeding.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court has established that when a defendant indicates that he intends to offer\r\n  evidence concerning his mental health during the guilt phase of his trial, he\r\n  has opened the door to the issue.Â  See Locklair, 341 S.C. at 365,\r\n  535 S.E.2d at 427.Â  Further, where a trial court is under the impression that a\r\n  criminal defendant's mental condition will be an issue at trial, it has the\r\n  inherent authority to order an independent mental evaluation of that\r\n  defendant.Â  Id. at 364, 535 S.E.2d at 427.Â  Under such circumstances,\r\n  ordering a criminal defendant to submit to a mental evaluation does not violate\r\n  his right against self-incrimination.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that Locklair does not apply to the instant matter because the\r\n  facts of that case concerned mental health relative to competency to stand trial,\r\n  not the statutory mitigating factors at issue in a sentencing phase.Â  Appellant\r\n  is correct.Â  Nonetheless, we must address whether a court can order a criminal\r\n  defendant to submit to a mental health evaluation where that defendant\r\n  indicates his intent to introduce evidence concerning his mental health during\r\n  the sentencing phase of his trial.Â  This is a novel issue in South Carolina.Â \r\n  We answer the question in the affirmative.Â  We find persuasive the reasoning of\r\n  the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Sartin, 561 Pa. 522,\r\n  751 A.2d 1140 (2000).\r\nIn Sartin,\r\n  the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld a trial court's order compelling a\r\n  criminal defendant to submit to a mental health evaluation after he indicated\r\n  an intent to present evidence concerning his mental health in his mitigation\r\n  case during the sentencing phase of his trial.Â  Sartin, 561 Pa. at 529,\r\n  751 A.2d at 1144.Â  The Court recognized that a court ordered mental evaluation\r\n  in such circumstances could potentially tread upon a defendant's Fifth\r\n  Amendment right.Â  Id.Â  Thus, the Court held that certain procedural\r\n  safeguards should be utilized to protect the defendant and ordered that the\r\n  results of the ordered evaluation be placed under seal until the commencement\r\n  of the penalty phase.Â  Id. at 525, 751 A.2d at 1141.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of this case, we find that the trial court's order compelling\r\n  Appellant to submit to a mental evaluation did not violate his Fifth Amendment\r\n  right against self-incrimination because 1) he indicated an intent to present\r\n  mental health evidence during the sentencing phase and 2) the trial court\r\n  utilized procedural safeguards to protect against any self-incrimination.Â  \r\nTransactional Immunity\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  that he is entitled to transactional immunity because the trial court ordered\r\n  him to participate in a mental health evaluation and compelled him to answer\r\n  questions about the facts of his case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe term\r\n  &quot;transactional immunity&quot; describes an agreement by the government not\r\n  to prosecute an individual for particular crimes in exchange for\r\n  self-incriminating testimony or information.Â  See Piccirillo v. New York,\r\n  400 U.S. 548 (1971).Â  Appellant's argument relies solely on his reading of State\r\n    v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 301 S.E.2d 341 (1994) (holding that the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution requires that a person compelled to provide the\r\n  government with self-incriminating testimony be granted immunity from any\r\n  prosecution for a transaction or offense to which the person's testimony\r\n  relates).Â  In Thrift, this Court opined:\r\n\r\n\tIf the government desires to obtain a statement from a citizen\r\n  which might incriminate him, the government has two options. First, it may\r\n  obtain from the citizen a voluntary waiver of his right of silence. . . . The\r\n  second option the government has if it desires to require a citizen to testify\r\n  against himself is to grant the citizen immunity from prosecution.\r\n\r\n312\r\n  S.C. at 297, 301 S.E.2d at 350.Â  \r\nThis matter is\r\n  clearly distinguishable from Thrift.Â  In Thrift, the defendants\r\n  were actually compelled to testify against themselves before a state grand\r\n  jury. Here, however, Appellant was not compelled to offer self-incriminating\r\n  testimony during his mental evaluation, thus transactional immunity cannot\r\n  exist.Â  Appellant's attorney was present at his mental evaluation and was able\r\n  to object to any questions.Â  Furthermore, by order of the court, any\r\n  inculpatory statements which may have been in the report were redacted.Â  Because\r\n  Appellant was not compelled to testify against himself, the court-ordered\r\n  mental evaluation did not confer transactional immunity upon him.Â Â  Â \r\nProportionality\r\n  Review\r\nPursuant\r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), we have conducted a proportionality\r\n  review.Â  We find the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice,\r\n  or any other arbitrary factor.&nbsp; Furthermore, a review of other decisions\r\n  demonstrates that Appellantâ€™s sentence is neither excessive nor\r\n  disproportionate. &nbsp;See, e.g., State v. Tucker, 324\r\n  S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260&nbsp;(1996).&nbsp; \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the\r\n  aforementioned reasons, we affirm Appellant's death sentence.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in\r\n  which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would reverse appellant's\r\n  capital sentences.Â  I find reversible error in the trial judge's limitation of\r\n  voir dire and in his decision to admit the funeral video.Â  I would therefore\r\n  reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\nI.&nbsp; Voir Dire\r\nAppellant contends\r\n  the trial judge committed reversible error when, mid-voir dire, he refused to\r\n  allow counsel to continue to explore the potential jurors' understanding of the\r\n  definition of murder.Â  The majority first holds this issue is not preserved\r\n  because appellant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges.Â  I disagree with this\r\n  preservation ruling: appellant's contention is that the trial court's\r\n  limitation of voir dire denied him the information necessary to decide whether\r\n  to challenge a juror for cause, or whether to exercise a peremptory challenge\r\n  should it be necessary.Â  See State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 282 (2001) (purpose of voir dire is not only to determine whether a\r\n  juror is subject to a challenge for cause, but also to allow the parties to\r\n  elicit information which will allow them to intelligently exercise their\r\n  peremptory strikes).Â  Appellant's failure to exhaust his strikes cannot be a\r\n  procedural bar where his contention is that the trial judge's ruling deprived\r\n  him of the very information he needed to intelligently exercise these strikes.\r\nThe\r\n  issue was preserved when appellant objected to the curtailment of voir dire,\r\n  and the number of peremptory challenges used is irrelevant.Â  The majority also\r\n  appears to hold that all jurors seated were qualified based upon their answers\r\n  to the pretrial questionnaire and because the questioning permitted by the\r\n  trial judge was sufficient.Â  I disagree.\r\nWhile the scope of voir dire is generally left to the trial judge's discretion, it is reversible\r\n  error to limit questions in a manner that renders the trial fundamentally\r\n  unfair.Â  State v. Stanko, 376 S.C. 571, 658 S.E.2d 94 (2008) citing Mu'Min\r\n    v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415 (1991).Â  A prospective juror in a capital case\r\n  must be excused for cause when his beliefs or attitudes against capital\r\n  punishment would render him unable to return a verdict according to law, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(E) (2003), or when his views on capital punishment would\r\n  prevent or substantially impair his ability to act in accordance with his oath\r\n  and the judge's instructions.Â  State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  904 (2007) (internal citations omitted).\r\nAs we have\r\n  acknowledged, a juror may affirmatively answer the inquiry &quot;whether she\r\n  would consider all the evidence before deciding the appropriate sentence,&quot;\r\n  butÂ  upon further inquiry reveal that the only evidence that would cause her to\r\n  return a life sentence would be that the killing was done unintentionally or in\r\n  self-defense.Â  State v. Evins, supra.Â  The early voir dire in\r\n  this case, where the judge permitted the potential jurors to be questioned\r\n  about their understanding of the definition of murder, led to a number of\r\n  jurors being dismissed for cause despite their initial indication that they\r\n  could return either a life or a death sentence.[12]Â \r\n  There can be no question but that this jury pool contained a number of\r\n  individuals who equated all killings with murder, but who upon learning that\r\n  murder was not an accident, a killing in self-defense, or a &quot;passion\r\n  killing,&quot; were not willing to entertain the possibility of a life\r\n  sentence.Â  Once the trial judge refused to allow appellant to define murder for\r\n  these venirepersons, and declined appellant's request that the trial judge\r\n  himself define that term, appellant was left without the means to make informed\r\n  decisions about challenges for cause or the exercise of his peremptory\r\n  challenges.\r\nIn Morgan v.\r\n  Illinois, 504 U.S. 719 (1992), the Supreme Court held that a capital\r\n  defendant was constitutionally entitled to challenge for cause any juror who\r\n  would automatically vote for death.Â  The Court held:\r\n\r\n\tWe deal\r\n  here with petitioner's ability to exercise intelligently his complementary\r\n  challenge for cause against those biased persons on the venire who as jurors\r\n  would unwaveringly impose death after a finding of guilt.Â  Were voir dire not available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner's challenge for cause\r\n  against those prospective jurors who would always impose death following\r\n  conviction, his right not to be tried by such jurors would be rendered as\r\n  nugatory and meaningless as the State's right, in the absence of questioning,\r\n  to strike those who would never do so.\r\n\r\nThe Court recognized that\r\n  voir dire was the only method by which these jurors could be detected,\r\n  explicitly rejecting the state's contention that &quot;general fairness&quot;\r\n  and &quot;follow the law&quot; questions were sufficient:\r\n\r\n\tAs to\r\n  general questions of fairness and impartiality, such jurors could in all truth\r\n  and candor respond affirmatively, personally confident that such dogmatic views\r\n  are fair and impartial, while leaving the specific concern unprobed.Â  More\r\n  importantly, however, the belief that death should be imposed ipso facto upon conviction of a capital offense reflects directly on that individual's\r\n  inability to follow the law.Â  Any juror who would impose death regardless of\r\n  the facts and circumstances of conviction cannot follow the dictates of law.Â \r\n  See Turner v. Murray, 476 U.S., at 34-35, 106 S.Ct., at 1687-1688\r\n  (plurality opinion).Â  It may be that a juror could, in good conscience, swear\r\n  to uphold the law and yet be unaware that maintaining such dogmatic beliefs\r\n  about the death penalty would prevent him or her from doing so.Â  A defendant on\r\n  trial for his life must be permitted on voir dire to ascertain whether\r\n  his prospective jurors function under such misconception.Â  The risk that such\r\n  jurors may have been empaneled in this case and &quot;infected petitioner's\r\n  capital sentencing [is] unacceptable in light of the ease with which that risk\r\n  could have been minimized.&quot;Â  Id., at 36, 106 S.Ct., 1688 (footnote\r\n  omitted).Â  Petitioner was entitled, upon his request, to inquiry discerning\r\n  those jurors who, even prior to the State's case in chief, had predetermined\r\n  the terminating issue of his trial, that being whether to impose the death\r\n  penalty.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  trial judge's mid-voir dire ruling, denying appellant the opportunity to\r\n  discern which jurors would in fact be able to follow their oath and\r\n  instructions, denied appellant his right to a fair sentencing proceeding, and\r\n  requires that we reverse his capital sentences.Â  It is not reasonable to expect\r\n  that laypersons in the venire enter the courtroom with an understanding the\r\n  legal definition of &quot;murder.&quot;\r\nII.&nbsp; Funeral Videotape\r\nThe majority\r\n  affirms because it finds the video tape of Deputy William's funeral was\r\n  properly admitted as victim impact evidence under Payne v. Tennessee,\r\n  501 U.S. 808 (1991), and because it finds the dramatization of the 911 call\r\n  admitted as evidence less inflammatory than a staged funeral procession\r\n  conducted during the State's closing argument.Â  Compare State v.\r\n    Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 641 S.E.2d 873 (2007).Â  I would reverse.\r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  video did not demonstrate anything about the victim's uniqueness, or the impact\r\n  of his loss on his family or friends or on community groups with which he had\r\n  been involved.Â  Instead, the video contains a staged 911 call which, we are\r\n  informed, is standard at law enforcement funerals and thus not related to\r\n  Deputy Wilson as an individual.Â  Moreover, video of unidentified mourners does\r\n  not demonstrate the impact of Deputy Wilson's death on his family or friends,[13] but rather reflects the affect of unidentified persons attending the funeral.Â  Payne evidence is intended to show the lasting consequences of victim's death, while\r\n  a funeral video merely preserves the visible expressions of grief exhibited by\r\n  persons attending the service.\r\nUnder Payne, the jury is constitutionally permitted to consider &quot;the\r\n  specific harm caused by the crime in question&quot; through the introduction of\r\n  &quot;evidence about the victim and about the impact of the murder on the\r\n  victim's family.&quot;Â  In my view, Payne evidence must be presented\r\n  through testimony of those who have suffered as a result of the victim's\r\n  death.Â  Cf. Humphries v. State, 351 S.C. 362, 570 S.E.2d 160\r\n  (2002) (Payne permits victim impact evidence in the form of testimony).Â \r\n  I find the video tape, including the staged 911 call, did not constitute Payne evidence.\r\nUnlike\r\n  the majority, I find appellant suffered prejudice as the result of this\r\n  improper evidence.Â  I venture to say there are few individuals who could view\r\n  this video without themselves being moved both by sympathy for the mourners and\r\n  by outrage at the person who inflicted this suffering.Â  Even if appellant did\r\n  not suffer prejudice, I would hold the admission of this video violated the\r\n  statutory prohibition of a death sentence &quot;imposed under the influence of\r\n  passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor,&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-25(C)(1) (2003), and thus requires that we reverse the sentencing\r\n  proceeding.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI would reverse\r\n  appellant's capital sentences and remand for a new sentencing proceeding, at\r\n  which the funeral video would not be admissible.\r\n\r\nWALLER, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] With respect to this encounter, McCaffrey testified:\r\n\r\n\t. . . their issue, what they told\r\n  me, was that nobody was going to come near their property, nobody was going to\r\n  do any work in that area there.Â  They said that it was their property; they\r\n  would - they started cursing at that time stating that they would fight till the\r\n  last breath and there'd be hell to pay if anybody stepped on their property\r\n  and/or try to do any work, construction work, on their property.\r\n\r\n[2] The men could tell the car was running because they could see exhaust in the\r\n  cold morning air.\r\n[3] The trial judge also imposed five consecutive ten year sentences for Appellant's\r\n  convictions of assault with intent to kill, a five year sentence for conspiracy,\r\n  to run consecutive to the assault convictions, and seven concurrent ten year\r\n  sentences for the remaining assault with intent to kill convictions.Â  \r\n[4] Even if we agreed with its position on this issue, curiously, the dissent would\r\n  remand the matter for a new sentencing phase only.Â  When an error occurs in\r\n  juror selection, ordinarily it requires a reversal of the guilt as well as the\r\n  penalty phase.Â  \r\n[5] Specifically, the trial judge, said, &quot;the witness didn't go to the\r\n  maintenance shed so he doesn't know if its public knowledge or it's available.&quot;Â  \r\n[6] &quot;Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if\r\n  its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\n  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\n  cumulative evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\n[7] Relevant offenses included in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-70(1) (2002) are murder,\r\n  assault and battery with intent to kill, kidnapping, and voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  \r\n[8] A &quot;judge of competent jurisdiction&quot; is &quot;a circuit court judge\r\n  designated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of South\r\n  Carolina.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-30-15(8) (2002).Â  \r\n[9] Administrative Order of the Chief Justice, September 23, 2002. \r\n[10] Appellant correctly asserts that the 911 call played at Deputy Wilson's funeral\r\n  was a dramatization.Â  However, unlike the solicitor's dramatization at issue in Northcutt, the dramatized 911 call was part of Deputy Wilson's funeral\r\n  service and is relevant to victim impact.Â Â Â  \r\n[11] In the instant case, the trial judge ordered the\r\n  jury to consider, among others, the following statutory mitigating factors:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tThe murder was committed while the defendant was \r\n\t\t\tunder the influence of mental or emotional disturbance.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tThe defendant acted under the duress or domination \r\n\t\t\tof another person.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tThe capacity of the defendant to appreciate the \r\n\t\t\tcriminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the \r\n\t\t\trequirements of the law was substantially impaired.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tThe defendant's adaptability to prison life.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThese factors come directly\r\n  from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b) (2007).\r\n[12] E.g., Mr. Ellifrits affirmed to the trial judge that he could return either a\r\n  life or a death sentence.Â  On appellant's voir dire, after having murder\r\n  defined, he stated that all cold blooded murderers, i.e. those who did not kill\r\n  in self-defense or by accident, deserved death.Â  Mr. Rollings also affirmed to the\r\n  trial judge that he could return either sentence.Â  On voir dire, however, after\r\n  having murder defined and distinguished from other types of killings, he\r\n  testified that all murderers deserve a death sentence.\r\n[13] The majority holds the video demonstrated the impact of Deputy Wilson's death\r\n  on the community.Â  In my opinion, this is a misapprehension of victim impact\r\n  evidence. It is permissible to present evidence, through the testimony of the\r\n  deceased's friends or family, of the impact of the decedent's loss, including\r\n  the loss to the community.Â  There is no general &quot;community impact\r\n  loss&quot; component of victim impact evidence under Payne.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26833","title":"Chester v.

Tinsley, of Gooding and Gooding, of Allendale, and Robert Norris Hill, of\r\n  Newberry, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tLisa\r\n  A. Reynolds, of Anderson &amp;Sequi, of Charleston; R. Morrison M. Payne and Christy\r\n  Scott, both of Scott &amp; Payne, of Walterboro; and Roy Pearce Maybank, of\r\n  Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant contends the trial judge erred\r\n  in ordering her, the plaintiff in this Tort Claims Act (TCA) suit brought\r\n  against three state agencies (respondents), to join other alleged joint\r\n  tortfeasors as defendants at respondents' request, in order to effectuate the\r\n  respondents' right to a proportionate verdict under S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-100(c) (2005).Â  The trial judge agreed with respondents that he could\r\n  require appellant to add party defendants, but ultimately dismissed the action\r\n  because these co-tortfeasors could not be joined since the appellant had\r\n  already settled with them.Â  See Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  We agree with appellant\r\n  that the trial judge lacks the authority to require her to sue additional\r\n  alleged co-tortfeasors, and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant's\r\n  decedent was killed in a multiple vehicle accident caused when heavy smoke from\r\n  a fire allegedly obstructed visibility on Interstate 95.Â  As a result of the\r\n  number of vehicles involved and the alleged negligence of three different state\r\n  agencies, there are numerous potential defendants.Â  A number of passengers in\r\n  these vehicles or their estates brought actions in Hampton County naming\r\n  appellant as a defendant.Â  Appellant then brought this suit against the three TCA defendants in Dorchester County, and subsequently received settlements from\r\n  a number of other defendants in the original Hampton suits.Â  The Dorchester TCA\r\n  defendants contended, and the trial judge agreed, that they were entitled to\r\n  have the judge order appellant to join other alleged tortfeasors (including\r\n  many with whom appellant had already settled in Hampton County) as defendants\r\n  under Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  The statute upon which the respondents and the trial\r\n  judge relied provides:\r\n\r\n\tIn all actions brought pursuant to this chapter when an alleged\r\n  joint tortfeasor is named as party defendant in addition to the governmental\r\n  entity, the trier of fact must return a special verdict specifying the\r\n  proportion of monetary liability of each defendant against whom liability is\r\n  determined.\r\n\tÂ§15-78-100(c).\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nCan a TCA defendant require the plaintiff to sue other alleged\r\n  tortfeasors?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIt is\r\n  well-settled that a plaintiff has the sole right to determine which\r\n  co-tortfeasor(s) she will sue.Â  E.g., Doctor v. Robert Lee, Inc.,\r\n  215 S.C. 332, 55 S.E.2d 68 (1949); South Carolina Dep't of Health and\r\n    Envior. Control v. Fed. Serv. Indus., Inc., 294 S.C. 33, 362 S.E.2d 311\r\n  (Ct. App.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1987).Â  A ruling that a TCA defendant can compel a plaintiff to join\r\n  other alleged tortfeasors as defendants in that suit would overturn this firmly\r\n  entrenched common law principle.Â  Moreover, a concomitant ruling that where\r\n  these defendants cannot be joined because they have already settled with the\r\n  plaintiff, the action must be dismissed, would thwart our strong public policy\r\n  favoring the settlement of disputes.Â  E.g., Poston v. Barnes, 294\r\n  S.C. 261, 363 S.E.2d 888 (1987).Â  We are not persuaded that the General\r\n  Assembly, in enacting Â§ 15-78-100(c), giving a TCA defendant the right to a\r\n  proportionate verdict &quot;when an alleged tortfeasor is named a party\r\n  defendant,&quot; intended to abrogate the tort plaintiff's right to choose her\r\n  defendant, nor to effectively force the plaintiff to choose between settling\r\n  with some parties and thereby forego her right to sue a TCA defendant, or going\r\n  to trial against all co-tortfeasors. Compare Wade v. Berkeley County,\r\n  348 S.C. 224, 559 S.E.2d 586 (2002).\r\nWhere,\r\n  as here, the plaintiff has settled with some co-tortfeasors the TCA defendants\r\n  are not without a remedy.Â  First, if the jury returns a verdict finding more\r\n  than one respondent liable, then it will be required to apportion liability among\r\n  these respondents.Â  Â§ 15-78-100(c).Â  Moreover, under the procedure outlined in Smalls\r\n    v. South Carolina Dep't of Educ., 339 S.C. 208, 528 S.E.2d 682 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000), any respondent found liable will be entitled to an equitable set-off\r\n  against the settlements appellant has already received.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge erred in holding that under Rule 19, SCRCP, he could require\r\n  appellant to join other co-tortfeasors in order to afford the respondents their\r\n  potential right to proportionate liability under Â§ 15-78-100(c).\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

Â Client A\r\n  paid respondent a $1,000.00 retainer.Â  Respondent failed to keep Client A\r\n  reasonably informed regarding the status of the matter and also failed to\r\n  promptly comply with Client A's reasonable requests for information.Â  \r\nOn August 6, 2009, Client A terminated\r\n  respondent's representation and requested a refund of her retainer fee.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to timely refund that portion of Client A's fee which had not\r\n  yet been earned.Â  \r\nBy letter dated August 26, 2009, ODC\r\n  informed respondent of Client A's complaint and requested he file a response\r\n  within fifteen days.Â  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate\r\n  with ODC in response to the August 26, 2009, letter. \r\nOn September 15, 2009, ODC sent\r\n  respondent a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514,\r\n  290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), again requesting a response.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  respond or otherwise communicate with ODC following the mailing of the Treacy letter.Â  \r\nRespondent was served with a Notice of\r\n  Full Investigation which required a response within thirty days.Â  Respondent failed\r\n  to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation.Â  Respondent did make an\r\n  appearance before ODC pursuant to Rule 19(c)(3), RLDE.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nThe South Carolina Bar Resolution of Fee\r\n  Disputes Board (the Board) ordered respondent to pay Client B $500.00.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to pay the ordered amount to the client.Â  As a result, the\r\n  Board issued a Certificate of Non-Compliance on November 19, 2009.Â  \r\nOn February 17, 2010, ODC mailed\r\n  respondent a Notice of Investigation requesting a response within fifteen\r\n  days.Â  After no response was received, ODC sent respondent a letter dated March\r\n  12, 2010, pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id., requesting a\r\n  response within thirty days.Â  Respondent failed to make an appearance pursuant\r\n  to Rule 19(c)(3), RLDE.Â  \r\nOn or about May 5, 2010, respondent\r\n  contacted ODC.Â  He issued a written response dated May 20, 2010, which was\r\n  received by ODC on May 28, 2010.Â  Respondent represents he failed to pay the\r\n  ordered fee to Client B due to personal economic hardship.Â  \r\nRespondent has no prior disciplinary\r\n  history.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent acknowledges\r\n  that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for\r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\n  shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(10) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  willfully fail to comply with a final decision of the Resolution of Fee\r\n  Disputes Board).Â  Further, respondent admits his misconduct violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR,\r\n  particularly Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n  reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of\r\n  representation, lawyer shall take steps to extent reasonably practicable to\r\n  protect client's interests Â such as refunding any advance payment of fee or\r\n  expense that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly\r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary\r\n  authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Further, within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\n  this order, respondent shall enter into a restitution plan with the Commission\r\n  on Lawyer Conduct in which he shall agree to pay $1,000.00 to Client A and\r\n  $500.00 to Client B. Â Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26873","title":"Hill v.

Wayne Hill (&quot;Hill&quot;)\r\n  was issued a notice of violation by the South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control, Bureau of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management\r\n  (&quot;DHEC&quot;) for constructing a bulkhead that was not in compliance with\r\n  a Critical Area Permit issued by the agency.Â  DHEC and an intervenor, the South\r\n  Carolina Coastal Conservation League (&quot;League&quot;), now appeal from a\r\n  circuit court order that reversed an administrative law judge's\r\n  (&quot;ALJ&quot;) determination that Hill had violated the terms of the permit.Â \r\n  We reverse.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nHill\r\n  owns Lot 1, Block S2, on 55th Avenue in the Heritage Shores Subdivision of\r\n  Cherry Grove in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  Hill's lot is a narrow\r\n  parcel that is bounded to the south and to the west by a man-made canal that\r\n  runs through the residential subdivision.Â  In July 2002, Hill filed a Permit\r\n  Application with DHEC for the construction of a 110' bulkhead[1] for erosion control and 4' x 12' walkway (with handrails) leading to a 3' x 15'\r\n  ramp and a 10' x 12' floating private residential dock.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 19, 2002, DHEC issued a Critical Area Permit to Hill for the\r\n  construction of the bulkhead, walkway, ramp, and dock as requested by Hill\r\n  (OCRM-02-668).Â  The permit listed ten Special Conditions, including Special\r\n  Condition 1, &quot;that the proposed bulkhead is located within 1.5' from [the]\r\n  escarpment.&quot;Â  \r\nWork on the\r\n  bulkhead began on or about July 15, 2003.Â  DHEC inspected the site in July 2003\r\n  and asked Hill to cease all work after finding the bulkhead was not being\r\n  constructed in accordance with Special Condition 1 of the issued permit.Â  Hill\r\n  stopped for approximately one week and then resumed construction, completing\r\n  the bulkhead by August 4, 2003.Â  Hill admittedly also &quot;proceeded to backfill\r\n  the area behind the newly constructed bulkhead.&quot;Â  \r\nDHEC\r\n  sent Hill a Notice of Violation, which stated the bulkhead as constructed was\r\n  not in compliance with the permit issued for the tidelands critical area and\r\n  was in &quot;potential violation of the South Carolina Coastal Zone Management\r\n  Act [CZMA], S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§&nbsp;48-39-10 et seq. (Supp. 2000).&quot;Â  Hill\r\n  denied the violation, but offered to restore an area to offset any loss of\r\n  wetlands that might have occurred during the construction of the bulkhead.Â  DHEC\r\n  thereafter sent Hill an Admissions Letter, along with Proposed Findings of\r\n  Fact.Â  Hill responded by denying any violation and asserting the bulkhead was\r\n  constructed in accordance with the permit and applicable law.Â  \r\nDHEC\r\n  issued an Administrative Enforcement Order in 2003, finding Hill had\r\n  constructed a bulkhead in the tidelands critical area too far channelward and\r\n  out of compliance with the issued permit.Â  DHEC ordered Hill (1) to pay an\r\n  administrative fine of $1,000; (2) to submit a work plan to DHEC within 30 days\r\n  of the date of the order for the removal and re-installation of the bulkhead in\r\n  accordance with Special Condition 1 of the issued permit; and (3) to complete\r\n  re-installation of the bulkhead in accordance with the permit within 90 days from\r\n  the date of the order.Â  It was further provided that if Hill did not either\r\n  appeal the order or comply with it &quot;within 30 days of receipt\r\n  hereof,&quot; DHEC would file an action in the circuit court to enforce the\r\n  order.\r\nShortly\r\n  thereafter, Hill filed a notice with DHEC seeking to challenge the\r\n  Administrative Enforcement Order, and the matter was submitted for a hearing\r\n  before an ALJ.Â  The ALJ granted Marlon Weaver and the League permission to\r\n  intervene.[2]Â  The ALJ sustained the\r\n  Administrative Enforcement Order, requiring Hill to relocate the bulkhead to\r\n  comply with the terms of the permit and to pay an administrative fine of\r\n  $1,000.Â  The ALJ found that, &quot;because the tidal marshland between the high\r\n  ground of [Hill's] lot and the adjoining canals is a critical area within the\r\n  coastal zone of the state, [Hill] was required to obtainâ€”and did obtainâ€”a\r\n  permit from OCRM [DHEC] before constructing a bulkhead in that\r\n  marshland.&quot;Â  The ALJ stated Hill's permit allowed him to construct a\r\n  bulkhead 110' in length that would be within 1.5' of the escarpment on Hill's\r\n  property.Â  However, the bulkhead Hill constructed was actually 145' in length\r\n  and was erected at distances ranging from 6.5' to 31' from the existing\r\n  escarpment, which was &quot;significantly out of compliance with the permit he\r\n  was issued by [DHEC]&quot; and in violation of the CZMA.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALJ further found that Hill's actions had &quot;resulted in the improper\r\n  filling of over 1000 square feet of marshland&quot; and that &quot;[t]his\r\n  filling is considered a major violation of the&quot; CZMA.Â  The ALJ found Hill\r\n  had &quot;used the bulkhead and the accompanying backfill to significantly\r\n  increase the size of his residential lot, far exceeding the amount necessary\r\n  for erosion control.&quot;Â  The ALJ concluded DHEC's decision to assess a\r\n  $1,000 fine and to require Hill to reconstruct the bulkhead so as to be in\r\n  compliance with his issued permit and the CZMA &quot;is an appropriate remedy\r\n  for those violations.&quot;Â  \r\nHill\r\n  filed a petition for review of the ALJ's order with the South Carolina Coastal\r\n  Zone Management Appellate Panel (&quot;Appellate Panel&quot;).Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel issued a written Final Administrative Order affirming the order of the\r\n  ALJ and adopting the Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law contained\r\n  therein.Â Â Â  \r\nHill next sought\r\n  review from the circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed the order of the ALJ\r\n  and simultaneously quashed DHEC's Administrative Enforcement Order.Â  As an\r\n  initial matter, the circuit court ruled the ALJ lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear Hill's appeal of DHEC's Administrative Enforcement\r\n  Order.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court further ruled the ALJ erred in (1) failing or refusing to address\r\n  the issue of the impact of a quit-claim deed executed in favor of Hill's\r\n  predecessor-in-title, which granted certain rights to dredge and deposit spoil\r\n  material above an agreed high water mark; (2) using an incorrect Critical Area\r\n  Line and in finding Hill had constructed the bulkhead too far into the critical\r\n  area; and (3) failing or refusing to address Hill's argument that DHEC's\r\n  Administrative Enforcement Order violated Hill's equal protection rights based\r\n  on the allegation DHEC took no steps to remove the docks of neighboring\r\n  property owners who would likewise be in violation if Hill's bulkhead was\r\n  deemed in violation.Â  \r\nDHEC\r\n  and the League now appeal from the circuit court's order.Â  &quot;DHEC&quot;\r\n  will be used hereinafter to refer to both the agency individually and\r\n  collectively to the agency and its co-appellant, the League, where appropriate.\r\n\r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case involved\r\n  multiple levels of review.Â  Under the APA, the ALJ presides as the fact-finder\r\n  in contested cases.Â  Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002).Â  The proceeding before the ALJ was a de\r\n  novo hearing, which included the presentation of evidence and testimony.Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnder the review procedure then in effect,[3] the Appellate Panel could\r\n  not make its own findings of fact and was authorized to reverse the ALJ only if\r\n  the ALJ's findings were not supported by substantial evidence or were\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Dorman v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 350 S.C. 159, 565 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThe circuit court's\r\n  review, as well as this Court's, is limited to determining whether the findings\r\n  were supported by substantial evidence or were controlled by an error of law.Â  Responsible\r\n    Econ. Dev. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 371 S.C. 547, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 425 (2007); Jones v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  384 S.C. 295, 682 S.E.2d 282 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nIn determining\r\n  whether the ALJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence, this Court\r\n  need only find, looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence from which\r\n  reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion that the ALJ reached.Â  Jones,\r\n  384 S.C. at 304, 682 S.E.2d at 287.Â  &quot;The mere possibility of drawing two\r\n  inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding from\r\n  being supported by substantial evidence.&quot; Id. (quoting DuRant v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d\r\n  704, 707 (Ct. App. 2004)).\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, DHEC raises\r\n  four issues concerning the circuit court's decision.Â  In addition, Hill raises\r\n  two points that warrant separate consideration.\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp; Findings of the ALJ\r\nDHEC first contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in improperly making new findings of fact and in overturning\r\n  the ALJ's findings of fact in violation of the applicable standard of review.Â  \r\nSpecifically, DHEC\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in &quot;overturn[ing] the ALJ's findings that\r\n  the area between Hill's property and adjoining canals is tidal marsh; that OCRM\r\n  accurately measured the alleged violations; that Hill improperly filled in\r\n  excess of 1,000 square feet of critical area marsh; that Hill erected his\r\n  bulkhead too far channelward of the escarpment; and that Hill's actions\r\n  resulted in a permanent loss of productivity from the estuary.&quot;Â  DHEC\r\n  asserts each of the ALJ's findings was fully supported by substantial evidence\r\n  and these findings support the ALJ's conclusion that Hill violated the CZMA and\r\n  the terms of his permit.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found &quot;[t]he ALJ's conclusions and findings were in error because, as a\r\n  prerequisite to any of the findings or conclusions, the record must reflect\r\n  that [DHEC] proved the existence and location of a lawfully established\r\n  Critical Area Line.Â  [DHEC] did not.Â  Without first establishing a valid\r\n  Critical Area Line, [DHEC] cannot demonstrate that it had any regulatory\r\n  jurisdiction over [Hill's] property.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court, citing section 48-39-210 of the South Carolina Code, stated\r\n  critical lines expire after three years and in this case DHEC had relied upon a\r\n  critical line that was over three years old.Â  The circuit court further stated\r\n  that even if DHEC has jurisdiction over Hill's property, DHEC's failure to\r\n  establish a valid critical area is dispositive of whether it met its burden of\r\n  proof in establishing Hill's alleged violations.Â  The circuit court\r\n  additionally found even with a valid critical line, DHEC's environmental\r\n  manager could not interpret the drawings that were attached to the permit, and\r\n  the permit provided the bulkhead was to be constructed in conformity with the\r\n  drawings.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the circuit court erred in overturning the findings of the ALJ and in\r\n  determining any issues regarding the location of the critical line would\r\n  preclude establishing a violation in this case.\r\nThe\r\n  ALJ considered the import of the critical line as well as the alleged ambiguity\r\n  of the drawings.Â  As to the critical line, the ALJ found Hill's &quot;concern\r\n  with [DHEC's] current inability to pinpoint the location of the critical area\r\n  line and escarpment as they existed on [Hill's] property prior to the\r\n  completion of his bulkhead is misplaced.&quot;Â  The ALJ stated Hill's violation is based on the measurements\r\n  of the distance between the bulkhead and the escarpment, as set forth in the\r\n  permit, and these measurements were documented by a DHEC employee during\r\n  construction.[4]\r\nAs\r\n  to the permit drawings, the ALJ found Hill's &quot;permit was not ambiguous\r\n  with regard to the size and location of his bulkhead.&quot;Â  The ALJ observed,\r\n  &quot;While the drawings showing the bulkhead's location are not clean, precise\r\n  documents, nothing in those drawings contradicts the clear, precise, and\r\n  specific language in the permit limiting the bulkhead to 110' in length and\r\n  requiring the bulkhead to be no more than 1.5' from the existing escarpment.&quot;Â  \r\nDHEC\r\n  notes Hill's own expert witness, Dr. Wayne Beam, testified that the critical\r\n  area line did not expire until November 6, 2003 due to an extension agreement,\r\n  and this date was after the date construction of the bulkhead was\r\n  completed.Â  DHEC asserts section 48-39-210(B) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  provides that an expired critical area plat does not affect DHEC's critical\r\n  area jurisdiction.[5]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, DHEC asserts there is no indication that the location of the critical\r\n  area line makes any difference that is favorable to Hill because the\r\n  substantial evidence showed that, if the critical line has changed, the\r\n  movement would be landward due to continuing erosion.Â  \r\nSteve\r\n  Brooks, DHEC's Chief of Enforcement and Compliance, testified that when he observed\r\n  the bulkhead Hill was constructing, it was obviously &quot;significantly higher\r\n  in elevation than the surrounding marsh area.&quot;Â  Brooks stated the bulkhead\r\n  was &quot;significantly . . . channelward of the location indicated on the\r\n  critical area line shown on the plat&quot; and he &quot;confirm[ed] that the\r\n  bulkhead was constructed in excess of the 1.5' channelward of the, in this\r\n  case, the critical line or the bluff line, assuming the two are the\r\n  same.&quot;Â  \r\nCindy\r\n  Fitzgerald, an environmental manager with DHEC, testified she was the staff\r\n  member who issued the Critical Area Permit to Hill.Â  Fitzgerald conducted an\r\n  inspection of Hill's bulkhead on July 24, 2003 during construction in response\r\n  to an anonymous complaint and determined it was being built too far into the\r\n  critical area.Â  Fitzgerald documented the alleged violation with photographs\r\n  showing that Spartina alterniflora, grass which is indicative of a\r\n  critical area, had been cut down and destroyed landward of the bulkhead.Â  She\r\n  also took measurements every five feet to document that the bulkhead had\r\n  exceeded the length and location requirements specified in the permit.Â  \r\nWe hold the ALJ's\r\n  findings were supported by substantial evidence, and the fact that the circuit\r\n  court might have disagreed with these findings does not prevent them from being\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.Â  The circuit court was not sitting as the\r\n  fact-finder and under its limited scope of review, it erred in overturning the\r\n  ALJ's findings that Hill's bulkhead did not comply with the terms of the permit\r\n  that he had been issued. \r\nB.&nbsp; Exclusion of\r\n  Evidence\r\nDHEC next argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in ruling the ALJ should have admitted a quit-claim\r\n  deed into evidence and should have heard arguments on whether DHEC has\r\n  regulatory authority over Hill's property in light of the existence of the\r\n  deed.Â  DHEC states, &quot;The quit-claim deed is related to a settlement\r\n  between C.D. Nixon [Hill's predecessor-in-title] and the State of South\r\n  Carolina in which Nixon quit-claimed lands that are or become below the mean\r\n  high water mark to the State and the State quit-claimed all lands above the\r\n  mean high water mark to Nixon.&quot;Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found the quit-claim deed granted certain rights and privileges to dredge and\r\n  deposit spoil material above an agreed high water mark and noted Hill had\r\n  asserted during the ALJ hearing that the quit-claim deed &quot;may have\r\n  usurped [DHEC's] regulatory authority.&quot;Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  The circuit\r\n  court concluded the ALJ &quot;erred by failing and refusing to address this\r\n  issue.&quot;Â  \r\nDHEC asserts the\r\n  ruling is flawed for two reasons.Â  First, DHEC's authority over the critical\r\n  area adjoining Hill's property is expressly granted by the CZMA, which requires\r\n  a permit to utilize critical areas in the coastal zone.[6]Â \r\n  DHEC asserts Hill did not dispute the ALJ's factual finding that the area\r\n  filled in by Hill was tidal marshland containing Spartina alterniflora,\r\n  the primary productivity plant in estuarine ecosystems, which is subject to the\r\n  state's regulatory authority under the CZMA.Â  DHEC argues the deed is not\r\n  relevant to its authority, which derives from statute, and a deed executed\r\n  prior to passage of the CZMA cannot usurp the state's regulatory authority.Â \r\n  Second, the deed itself recognizes DHEC's authority over the critical area, as\r\n  it recites that a permit from the State must be obtained before any dredging\r\n  occurs. \r\n&quot;The admission or exclusion\r\n  of evidence is a matter within the sound discretion\r\n  of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.&quot;Â  Gamble\r\n    v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996).Â  Even\r\n  a finding of an abuse of discretion does not end the analysis, however, &quot;because to warrant reversal based on the\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence, the appealing party must show both the\r\n  error of the ruling and prejudice.&quot;Â  Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 557, 658 S.E.2d 80, 86&nbsp;(2008).\r\n  Prejudice is a reasonable probability that the fact-finder's determination was influenced by the challenged\r\n  evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Id.\r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the ALJ, Cindy Fitzgerald, DHEC's\r\n  environmental manager, testified during cross-examination that the property\r\n  seaward of Hill's bulkhead was public trust property as evidenced by the fact\r\n  that it contained salt marsh vegetationâ€”Spartina alterniflora that grows\r\n  only in critical areas with salt content.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, Hill's attorney sought to introduce the quit-claim deed to rebut the\r\n  testimony that this was public trust property.Â  However, in offering the deed,\r\n  counsel acknowledged that he could not tell from the deed whether it was public\r\n  trust property or not. Â The ALJ agreed to accept the deed as an &quot;offer of\r\n  proof,&quot; but declined to admit it into evidence, stating it was incumbent\r\n  upon Hill's attorney to set forth evidence.Â  The ALJ explained that he would be\r\n  looking to &quot;see if in fact the bulkhead is within 1.5 feet of the\r\n  escarpment/critical area&quot; as required by the permit.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the circuit court erred in finding the ALJ abused his discretion in this\r\n  regard.Â  Hill's attorney expressly conceded at the hearing that he did not know\r\n  whether the property was public trust property or not and that he could not\r\n  tell from the proffered deed.Â  Counsel stated he was, nevertheless, offering\r\n  the deed &quot;for what it's worth.&quot;Â  Thus, the deed did not establish the\r\n  point in question and Hill's counsel conceded as much.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  Hill has not shown any resulting prejudice from exclusion of the deed, and both\r\n  error and resulting prejudice must be shown by the party complaining of the\r\n  exclusion of evidence.Â  See, e.g., Fields, 376 S.C. at 557, 658\r\n  S.E.2d at 86 (stating both error and prejudice are necessary for reversal of a\r\n  decision to exclude evidence).Â  Therefore, the\r\n  circuit court incorrectly found the ALJ committed error in this regard.\r\nC.&nbsp; Subject Matter Jurisdiction \r\nDHEC next contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the ALJ did not have subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to consider an appeal of agency enforcement proceedings, i.e.,\r\n  Hill's challenge of the Administrative Enforcement Order issued by DHEC.Â  \r\nUnder the procedures\r\n  then in effect,[7] South Carolina law\r\n  provided no person could use a critical area without first obtaining a permit\r\n  from DHEC.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-130(A) (Supp. 2003).Â Â  \r\nAnyone\r\n  having a permit denied or who was adversely affected by the granting of a permit could directly appeal a decision of the ALJ to the Appellate\r\n  Panel.Â  Id. Â§ 48-39-150(D).Â  Although it is not specified in this\r\n  particular statute, the matter would first come before the ALJ as a contested\r\n  case hearing.Â  The APA defines a &quot;contested case&quot; as &quot;a\r\n  proceeding including, but not restricted to, ratemaking, price fixing,\r\n  and licensing, in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by law to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for\r\n  hearing.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 1-23-310(3) (emphasis added).Â  The contested case\r\n  hearing would allow the parties to dispute a permit denial and determine the\r\n  rights of the parties. \r\nUnder\r\n  section 1-23-600(B), the ALJ presides over all contested case hearings.Â  See id. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (&quot;An administrative law judge . . . shall preside\r\n  over all hearings of contested cases as defined in Section 1-23-310 involving\r\n  the departments of the executive branch of government in which a single hearing\r\n  officer is authorized or permitted by law or regulation to hear and decide such\r\n  cases . . . .&quot;); Marlboro Park Hosp. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp;\r\n    Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 573, 577, 595 S.E.2d 851, 853&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (&quot;The ALJ presides\r\n  over all hearings of contested DHEC permitting cases.&quot;). \r\nSection\r\n  48-39-180 provided that any applicant whose permit application had been finally\r\n  denied, revoked, suspended, or approved subject to conditions of DHEC by the\r\n  Appellate Panel, or any person adversely affected by the permit, could seek\r\n  review in the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-180 (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe foregoing\r\n  provisions concern a landowner's challenge to DHEC's decision to deny a permit\r\n  in the first instance, as well as to challenges by others who might be\r\n  adversely affected by the granting of a permit application, such as neighboring\r\n  landowners. \r\nOnce\r\n  a permit has already been issued and there has been an alleged violation of the\r\n  permit, section 48-39-170(C) provided that upon the finding of a permit\r\n  violation, DHEC could (1)&nbsp;issue an administrative order requiring\r\n  compliance and impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per day of violation, (2)\r\n  bring a civil enforcement action under this section, or (3) seek injunctive\r\n  relief under section 48-39-160.Â  Id. Â§ 48-39-170(C).\r\nSection 48-39-160,\r\n  governing injunctive relief, allowed DHEC or any person adversely affected to\r\n  obtain an injunction from the circuit court to restrain violations and to\r\n  recover the cost of any restoration to the affected area.Â  Id. Â§\r\n  48-39-160.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing all of the pertinent provisions, the circuit court concluded\r\n  &quot;the ALJ lacked the requisite subject matter jurisdiction to hear and\r\n  decide [Hill's] appeal.&quot;Â  The circuit court essentially found that section\r\n  48-39-170(C) provides DHEC may bring a civil enforcement action or seek\r\n  injunctive relief in the circuit court; therefore, the action should have been\r\n  heard in the circuit court.Â  \r\nWe hold the circuit\r\n  court erred in concluding this administrative enforcement matter should have\r\n  been brought in the circuit court and that the ALJ did not have jurisdiction to\r\n  conduct a contested case hearing to review the propriety of the Administrative\r\n  Enforcement Order.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  CZMA envisions two avenues for addressing violations.Â  Under section\r\n  48-39-170(C), whenever DHEC determines there has been a violation of any\r\n  permit, regulation, or statutory requirement, DHEC may bring a civil\r\n  enforcement action and seek injunctive relief.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-170(C).Â \r\n  The circuit court has jurisdiction to hear DHEC's civil enforcement action and\r\n  has the authority to restrain any violations.Â  Id. Â§ 48-39-160.Â  Matters\r\n  under this avenue of review follow judicial procedures. \r\nIn\r\n  addition, section 48-39-170(C) provides DHEC may issue Administrative\r\n  Enforcement Orders requiring compliance with its issued permits and may\r\n  additionally impose a civil fine upon the violator up to a maximum of $1,000\r\n  per day.Â  Id. Â§ 48-39-170(C).Â  Matters brought under this procedure are\r\n  administrative in nature and are, therefore, governed by the procedures of the\r\n  APA.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  1-23-600(B) provided that persons aggrieved by an agency order were entitled to\r\n  seek review of the agency's enforcement order by the ALJ by means of a\r\n  contested case hearing.Â  In addition, such review was provided by DHEC\r\n  regulations.[8]Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  review of the agency's enforcement order and its imposition of a civil\r\n  fine is an administrative matter that falls squarely within the ambit of a\r\n  contested case as defined in the APA.Â  It is a proceeding in which the rights,\r\n  duties, and privileges of a party are required to be determined by an agency after\r\n  the opportunity for a hearing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;1-23-310(3).\r\nIn\r\n  the current case, Hill sought to challenge DHEC's Administrative Enforcement\r\n  Order that imposed a civil fine and required relocation of the bulkhead before DHEC sought to enforce it by means of a civil suit in the circuit court.Â  Thus,\r\n  this was an administrative proceeding in which Hill sought to have the parties'\r\n  rights, duties, and privileges determined in a contested case hearing by the\r\n  ALJ as provided by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B).Â  Accordingly, the ALJ had\r\n  jurisdiction to hear this matter and the circuit court's ruling to the contrary\r\n  is in error. \r\nD.&nbsp; Equal Protection\r\nDHEC next argues\r\n  the circuit erred in ruling Hill's equal protection rights had been violated.Â \r\n  DHEC asserts Hill failed to present any evidence of disparate treatment to\r\n  justify this finding.\r\nAt the end of a\r\n  lengthy hearing, Hill's attorney summarily brought up the issue of equal\r\n  protection, stating that there had been testimony that no other enforcement\r\n  orders had been issued in this subdivision, but other landowners &quot;have\r\n  fill material added and [have built] further seaward than one and a half feet\r\n  from the escarpment line.&quot;Â  The ALJ's order did not specifically mention\r\n  the issue of equal protection, but it did contain the following catch-all\r\n  provision:Â  &quot;Pursuant to ALC Rule 29(C), any issues raised in these\r\n  proceedings, but not addressed in this Order, are deemed denied.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the circuit court, Hill argued the ALJ erred in failing to consider his\r\n  argument that the Administrative Enforcement Order violated his equal\r\n  protection rights.Â  The circuit court agreed and found &quot;that the ALJ erred\r\n  by failing and refusing [to] rule upon [Hill's] constitutional objections to\r\n  [DHEC's] administrative enforcement order.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court then went on to find Hill's equal protection rights had been\r\n  violated, citing Weaver v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 368,\r\n  423 S.E.2d 340 (1992).Â  In that case, Weaver was denied a permit for a boat\r\n  dock after the Coastal Council (DHEC's predecessor) had granted several other\r\n  permits in error but had not yet taken any enforcement action.Â  This Court\r\n  concluded the Coastal Council violated the equal protection and due process\r\n  rights of Weaver by treating her differently from the other permit applicants,\r\n  thereby denying her a benefit granted to others similarly situated.Â  Id. at 375, 423 S.E.2d at 343-44.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, DHEC argues Hill's assertion of an equal protection violation and the\r\n  circuit court's ruling &quot;both suffer from a distinct lack of proof,&quot;\r\n  citing Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d\r\n  388 (1995).Â  In Grant, we observed, &quot;The sine qua non of an equal protection claim is a showing\r\n  that similarly situated persons received disparate treatment.&quot; Â Id. at 354, 461 S.E.2d at 391.\r\nDHEC\r\n  acknowledges that the aerial photograph it introduced into evidence\r\n  &quot;appears to show that other nearby property owners may have filled\r\n  critical areas as part of bulkhead construction&quot;; however, DHEC's\r\n  cartographer, Fritz Aichele, and enforcement manager, Steve Brooks, had\r\n  testified that the photograph had just been prepared the day before the hearing,\r\n  and Brooks further testified that he is currently conducting compliance\r\n  investigations and that the agency intends to pursue enforcement actions where\r\n  violations are found to have occurred as soon as that information is compiled\r\n  and synthesized.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the circuit court's finding of an equal protection violation is reversible\r\n  for several reasons.Â  First, the circuit court found the ALJ erred in failing\r\n  to rule on the equal protection allegation.Â  However, it was incumbent upon\r\n  Hill to show that he had clearly raised the issue to the ALJ and asked for a\r\n  specific ruling in that regard in order to preserve the issue for review by the\r\n  circuit court.Â  See Home Med. Sys. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 382\r\n  S.C. 556, 562-63, 677 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2009) (observing issue preservation is\r\n  required in administrative appeals and a circuit court sitting in an appellate\r\n  capacity may not consider issues not raised to and ruled upon by the ALC; the\r\n  Court held that &quot;Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions are permitted in ALC\r\n  proceedings&quot;).Â  \r\nSecond,\r\n  even if the circuit court was correct in determining the ALJ erred in failing\r\n  to rule on this issue, a remand would have been the appropriate remedy because\r\n  the circuit court's limited scope of review does not authorize it to make its\r\n  own factual findings.Â  The ALJ's order did contain a statement that all claims\r\n  not expressly covered were denied.Â  However, such an indirect ruling would not\r\n  effectively give a reviewing court anything to evaluate.[9]Â  See Brown v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,&nbsp;348\r\n  S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002) (holding where the ALJ's order was silent on an\r\n  issue and thus gave no finding to effectively review, the Board lacked the\r\n  authority to make its own findings of fact and should have remanded the matter\r\n  to the ALJ for an order clarifying this point rather than ruling on the issue in\r\n  the first instance); S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 610 S.E.2d 482 (2005) (stating a\r\n  reviewing court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to\r\n  the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may remand the matter to\r\n  the agency for a determination of the issue).Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  DHEC properly notes that Hill had the burden of proof in this regard and he did\r\n  not set forth anything to support his allegation other than noting the\r\n  testimony of a DHEC witness that as of the time of the hearing, no other\r\n  enforcement orders had been issued.Â  This mere fact, standing alone, is\r\n  insufficient as a matter of law to establish an equal protection violation.Â \r\n  Hill did not provide any evidence as to the identity of the neighboring\r\n  landowners and their alleged transgressions, so he did not show that he was\r\n  similarly situated.Â  See Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 359\r\n  S.C. 85, 96, 596 S.E.2d 917, 922 (2004) (stating even if a governmental entity\r\n  does not enforce a provision equally, &quot;the fact that there is some unequal\r\n  treatment does not necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional equal\r\n  protection violation&quot;).Â  Since Hill offered no evidence that his situation\r\n  is indistinguishable from others and no evidence of bias or discrimination, the\r\n  circuit court erred in ruling Hill had established a violation of his equal\r\n  protection rights.\r\nE.&nbsp; Timeliness of\r\n  Appeal\r\nHill\r\n  has enumerated seven arguments in the &quot;Statement of the Issues on\r\n  Appeal&quot; of his Respondent's Brief, most of which respond to the merits of\r\n  DHEC's appellate issues.Â  However, Hill does set forth two arguments that\r\n  warrant separate consideration, the first of which concerns the alleged\r\n  untimeliness of this appeal.\r\nHill\r\n  initially states the circuit court order &quot;dated June 28, 2007 was served\r\n  on the Appellant[10] and OCRM on July 23,\r\n  2007.Â  The Appellant gave notice of appeal on August 22, 2007.&quot;Â  Hill asserts\r\n  the appeal is untimely, however, because a party must file a motion to alter or\r\n  amend when an issue has been raised, but not ruled upon, in order to preserve\r\n  it for review, and none of the four issues raised by DHEC were asserted in a\r\n  post-trial motion.Â  Hill states, &quot;Neither OCRM nor the Appellant filed a\r\n  Motion for Amendment under Rule 52(b), SCRCP or a Motion for Reconsideration\r\n  under Rule 59(e), SCRP with the Circuit Court before giving notice of\r\n  appeal.&quot;Â  Hill maintains the appeal is, therefore, untimely as it was not\r\n  &quot;perfected,&quot; and this &quot;is fatal to the jurisdiction of this\r\n  [Court] to hear the matter.&quot; \r\nHill's\r\n  assertion is without merit.Â  Hill appears to have overlapped the concepts of\r\n  issue preservation and timely service of a notice of appeal.Â  Under the South\r\n  Carolina Appellate Court Rules, a notice of appeal from an order or judgment of\r\n  the circuit court must be served within thirty days after receipt of written\r\n  notice of entry of the order or judgment.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  The service\r\n  of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and the time for service\r\n  may not be extended by this Court.Â  Camp v. Camp, 386 S.C. 571, 689\r\n  S.E.2d 634 (2010).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, to preserve an issue for appellate review, a matter may not be raised\r\n  for the first time on appeal, but must have been both raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731\r\n  (1998).Â  The failure to preserve an issue for appeal does not deprive an\r\n  appellate court of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the circuit court's order was signed on June 28, 2007 and is stamped\r\n  to indicate that it was actually filed with the Horry County Clerk of Court on\r\n  July 24, 2007.Â  The Notice of Appeal was served on August 22, 2007, and it\r\n  states the order was received &quot;no earlier than July 26, 2007.&quot;Â \r\n  Therefore, the appeal was properly noticed within thirty days and was timely so\r\n  as to confer jurisdiction on this Court.Â  There is no fatal defect or lack of\r\n  jurisdiction to hear this appeal.[11]Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nF.&nbsp; Standing To Appeal\r\nHill next asserts\r\n  &quot;[t]he League is the Appellant in this case&quot; and that it lacks\r\n  standing to pursue the appeal.Â  \r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  a party must be a real party in interest to the litigation to have standing.&quot;Â  Sloan v. Friends of the Hunley, Inc.,&nbsp;369\r\n  S.C. 20, 28, 630 S.E.2d 474, 479&nbsp;(2006).Â  &quot;A real party in interest\r\n  is a party with a real, material, or substantial interest in the outcome of the\r\n  litigation.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;When an organization is involved, the\r\n  organization has standing on behalf of its members if one or more of its members will suffer an individual injury by\r\n  virtue of the contested act.&quot;Â  Sea Pines Ass'n for the Protection of\r\n    Wildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 600-01, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 287, 291&nbsp;(2001). Â &quot;South Carolina case law has specifically recognized an injury to one's aesthetic and recreational interests in enjoying\r\n  and observing wildlife is a judicially cognizable injury in fact.&quot;Â  Id. at 601-02, 550 S.E.2d at 291-92.\r\nHill\r\n  states the League was not an original party to the enforcement action commenced\r\n  by DHEC, and it has not asserted a separate cause of action.Â  Rather, the\r\n  League was allowed to appear as an intervenor, as was Marlon Weaver, a\r\n  neighboring property owner.Â  Hill maintains he &quot;did not consent to the\r\n  intervention of either the League or Mr. Weaver.&quot;Â  Hill asserts the ALJ's\r\n  order granting the motions of the League and Weaver to intervene &quot;contains\r\n  no mention of the basis for allowing the intervention by the League,&quot; and\r\n  at the hearing before the ALJ, the League &quot;presented no evidence\r\n  concerning its standing, called no witnesses, and submitted no testimony or\r\n  evidence of any kind concerning the issue in dispute.&quot;Â  \r\nCiting\r\n  Rule 24(a), SCRCP (governing intervention), as well as Beaufort Realty Co.\r\n    v. Beaufort County, 346 S.C. 298, 551 S.E.2d 588 (Ct. App. 2001)[12] and Rule 201(b), SCACR,[13] Hill argues the\r\n  interests of the League in the permitting process or in environmental issues\r\n  are &quot;coincident with those of the general public, which OCRM [DHEC]\r\n  represented.&quot;Â  Hill states there is nothing that &quot;gave [the] League a\r\n  right to intervene,&quot; and it has shown no individualized injury to itself\r\n  or its members.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Hill states that he &quot;did not consent&quot; to the League's intervention,\r\n  he does not state that he ever objected at the time the League's motion to\r\n  intervene was granted by the ALJ.Â  In fact, the ALJ's order specifically states\r\n  that &quot;no objection to the proposed interventions has been received&quot;\r\n  and the intervenors had satisfied all of the necessary requirements.Â \r\n  Consequently, Hill should not be allowed to belatedly and indirectly pursue\r\n  what is, in essence, an attack upon the ruling allowing the League to intervene\r\n  under the guise of challenging the League's &quot;standing&quot; to maintain an\r\n  appeal after it was allowed to intervene without objection.Â  See Sea\r\n    Cove Dev., L.L.C. v. Harbourside Cmty. Bank, 387 S.C. 95, 691 S.E.2d 158\r\n  (2010) (stating a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue\r\n  for appellate review); Gissel v. Hart, 382 S.C. 235, 676 S.E.2d 320\r\n  (2009) (holding the defendants would not be allowed to complain on appeal of an\r\n  alleged error where they never disputed the issue below).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing before the ALJ, Hill's attorney did move for intervenor Weaver to\r\n  be dismissed from the action for lack of standing.Â  After some discussion, the\r\n  ALJ denied the motion.Â  However, Hill did not contemporaneously argue the\r\n  League did not have standing and in fact contended Weaver's interests could be\r\n  represented by &quot;the other intervenors [sic] in the suit&quot; (i.e., the\r\n  League) and by DHEC.Â  Thus, he is precluded from raising this issue now.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  as noted above, the League is not the only appellant in this matter; rather,\r\n  DHEC, the agency, is a co-appellant along with the League, as is clearly stated\r\n  in the parties' Notice of Appeal.Â  It is undisputed that DHEC has a real,\r\n  material, and substantial interest in upholding the Administrative Enforcement\r\n  Order it issued to remedy permit violations that occurred in the critical area\r\n  it oversees.Â  Therefore, the appeal is not subject to dismissal for lack of a\r\n  viable appellant.Â  \r\n\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the ALJ correctly found Hill had violated the terms of his\r\n  permit by building a bulkhead more than 1.5' from the escarpment and that the\r\n  ALJ had subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  A bulkhead is &quot;a retaining wall designed to\r\n  retain fill material but not to withstand wave forces on an exposed\r\n  shoreline.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-270(1)(b) (2008).\r\n[2] Â Marlon Weaver, who owned Lot 3 adjoining Hill's\r\n  property, contended Hill had improperly filled in wetlands area in order to\r\n  make his lot a buildable lot and that this had an adverse impact upon his\r\n  (Weaver's) property. He has since withdrawn from participation in this case.Â \r\n  The League asserted Hill had improperly filled in a portion of tidelands\r\n  critical area and that his actions had an adverse effect upon the environment\r\n  to the detriment of its members who used the area for recreational and other\r\n  purposes.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The review procedure under the APA was changed by\r\n  2006 South Carolina Laws Act No. 387, which eliminated the review of the ALJ's decision\r\n  by the Appellate Panel.Â  Chem-Nuclear Sys. v. S.C. Bd. of Health &amp;\r\n    Envtl. Control, 374 S.C. 201, 648 S.E.2d 601 (2007).Â  However, this appeal\r\n  continues under the prior procedure.\r\n[4]Â  The ALJ stated:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  regulatory and permitting violation committed by [Hill] involved the distance\r\n  between his bulkhead and the escarpment on his property, not the critical line,\r\n  and, while that escarpment cannot now be located, it was readily apparent at\r\n  the time Ms. Fitzgerald took her measurements of the distance between the\r\n  bulkhead and the escarpment and determined that the bulkhead was being\r\n  constructed too far from the escarpment.Â  See Finding of Fact #3(A).Â \r\n  Further, while the term &quot;escarpment&quot; is not defined in the\r\n  regulations, its meaning is not obscure and the term provides sufficient\r\n  guidance to permittees for the proper placement of an erosion-controlled\r\n  bulkhead.Â  See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 395 (10th\r\n  ed. 1993) (defining an escarpment as a &quot;steep slope separating two\r\n  comparatively level or more gently sloping surfaces and resulting from erosion\r\n  or faulting&quot;).Â  \r\n\r\n[5]Â  Section 48-39-210(B) (Supp. 2003) provided in part\r\n  as follows:Â  &quot;Critical areas by their nature are dynamic and subject to\r\n  change over time.Â  By generally delineating the permit authority of the Coastal\r\n  Council [the predecessor to DHEC's OCRM], the Coastal Council in no way waives\r\n  its right to assert permit jurisdiction at any time in any critical area on the\r\n  subject property, whether shown hereon or not.&quot;\r\n[6] Â See S.C. Code Ann.

Starkey, 380 S.C. 590,\r\n  671 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1995, petitioner\r\n  executed a durable power of attorney naming her daughter, defendant Starkey, as\r\n  her attorney-in-fact.Â  In 1996, petitioner opened an investment account with\r\n  J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. (Bradford).Â  In June 2004, the power of attorney was\r\n  properly recorded.Â  UBS became the successor-in-interest to Bradford, and in\r\n  September 2004, petitioner executed an investment service contract with UBS,\r\n  which included this arbitration clause:\r\n\r\n\tBY\r\n  SIGNING BELOW, I UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREEâ€¦that in accordance with the\r\n  last paragraph of the Master Account Agreement entitled 'Arbitration[,]' I am\r\n  agreeing in advance to arbitrate any controversies which may arise withâ€¦UBS\r\n  Financial Services in accordance with the terms outlined therein[.]\r\n\t(Emphasis\r\n  in original).\r\n\r\nThe arbitration clause of the\r\n  Master Account Agreement provides, in part,\r\n\r\n\tClient\r\n  agreesâ€¦that any and all controversies which may arise between UBS Financial\r\n  Services, any of UBS Financial Services' employees or agents and Client\r\n  concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, performance\r\n  or breach of this Agreement or any other agreementâ€¦shall be determined by\r\n  arbitration.\r\n\r\nPetitioner's\r\n  daughter, defendant Starkey, was an employee of UBS.Â  Starkey removed over\r\n  $129,000 from petitioner's account, and used this money for her own benefit.Â \r\n  Petitioner brought this suit against Starkey and UBS, and both defendants\r\n  sought to compel arbitration.Â  The trial court denied both requests, but only\r\n  UBS appealed.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, and held UBS was\r\n  entitled to arbitration.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  Court of Appeals err in finding that petitioner's claims against UBS should be\r\n  arbitrated?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner concedes\r\n  that the transaction at issue here, that is, Starkey's removal of funds from\r\n  petitioner's UBS account is within the scope of the parties' arbitration\r\n  agreement.Â  She contends, however, that UBS's failure to prevent Starkey from\r\n  removing the funds was outrageous and thus she should not be required to\r\n  arbitrate her dispute.Â  We disagree.\r\nArbitration\r\n  clauses are not applicable to &quot;'illegal and outrageous acts' unforeseeable\r\n  to a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.&quot;Â  Partain\r\n    v. Upstate Auto. Group, ____ S.C. ____, 689 S.E.2d 602, 605 (2010).Â  We\r\n  agree that, in the abstract, it is probable that where an employee of an\r\n  investment company steals money from an investor's account, that illegal act\r\n  would not be found to be foreseeable from the investor's standpoint, and thus\r\n  the transaction would not be subject to arbitration.Â  Compare Aiken\r\n    v. World Fin. Corp., 373 S.C. 144, 644 S.E.2d 705 (2007) (not foreseeable\r\n  that company's employees would steal client's identity). Â \r\nHere, however, we\r\n  do not have a theft of funds from petitioner's account.Â  Instead, petitioner's\r\n  complaint alleges that &quot;Starkey utilized the authority granted to her\r\n  under [petitioner's] power of attorneyâ€¦[by] removing [petitioner's]funds and\r\n  assets from accounts at UBS and transferring the same to Starkey's own\r\n  accountsâ€¦.&quot;Â  That Starkey was also a UBS employee does not make the\r\n  transaction carried out by Starkey in her capacity as her mother's\r\n  attorney-in-fact &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;outrageous.&quot;Â  There is nothing\r\n  in this complaint that would support a finding that UBS did anything illegal or\r\n  outrageous in permitting Starkey, an individual acting pursuant to a durable\r\n  power of attorney, access to the funds and assets in petitioner's account.Â  \r\nStarkey's\r\n  actions may well be found to be outrageous and/or illegal at her trial, but her\r\n  alleged misconduct in removing the funds and assets was not the result of her\r\n  professional relationship with UBS, but rather was the result of her mother's\r\n  decision to make Starkey her attorney in fact.Â  Under the facts of this case,\r\n  there is no allegation susceptible of a construction that UBS acted either\r\n  illegally or outrageously.Â  Accordingly, UBS's arbitration request should be\r\n  honored.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and E. C.\r\n  Burnett, III, concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: I\r\n  respectfully dissent.Â  Petitioner argues that the court of appeals erred in\r\n  reversing the trial court's order denying UBS's request for arbitration of her\r\n  claims.Â  I agree, and would reverse the court of appeals' decision.\r\nIn my view, this case is on all fours with this\r\n  Court's decision in Aiken v. World Fin. Corp..Â  373 S.C. 144, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  705 (2007).Â  In Aiken, we held that an employee's theft of a client's\r\n  identity was not a foreseeable risk contemplated by the contract.Â  An\r\n  arbitration clause does not cover every potential suit between the signing\r\n  parties; instead, it only applies to those claims foreseeably arising from the\r\n  contractual relationship.Â  Because the harm to the client was not foreseeable,\r\n  we held the claim was not subject to the agreed upon arbitration clause.Â  Id.,\r\n  373 S.C. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709.Â Â  \r\nThe facts of this case are analogous to those in Aiken.\r\n  Â In her complaint, Petitioner claims UBS breached its fiduciary duty by\r\n  allowing its employee, Petitioner's daughter, to steal Petitioner's money and\r\n  by failing to adopt, implement, and enforce policies and procedures to prevent\r\n  employees from stealing and misappropriating clients' funds.Â  In my view, even\r\n  though Petitioner's daughter was her attorney-in-fact, her theft of the funds\r\n  at issue was allegedly made possible because of her access to the accounts as\r\n  an employee of UBS.Â  The fact that Petitioner would be injured by UBS's failure\r\n  to enforce or implement policies and procedures to prevent the misappropriation\r\n  of funds by its employees was not foreseeable to Petitioner at the time she\r\n  entered into the contract with UBS.Â  Therefore, in my view, Petitioner's claims\r\n  against UBS are not subject to the arbitration clause.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor this reason, I would reverse the court of appeals decision.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Jonathan L.B.
