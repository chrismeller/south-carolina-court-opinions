Solomon, of Gergel, Nickles &amp; Solomon, P.A. and TonyÂ  Dessausure, of The Dessausure Law Firm, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        J. R. Murphy and Adam J. Neil, both of Murphy &amp; Grantland, P.A., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This is a negligence action against a commercial landlord arising out of a shooting which occurred inside the leased premises.Â  The trial court granted the landlordâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We certified the case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRonald O. Swinson, Jr. and his wife each own a fifty-percent share of Swordfish Investments, LLC (â€œSwordfishâ€), a limited liability company which Swinson set up to own real estate.Â  Swinson is employed by C.B. Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate and brokerage firm.[1]Â  C.B. Richard Ellis is the leasing agent for properties owned by Swordfish.Â  \r\nSwordfish owns the Columbia East Shopping Center in Columbia.Â Â  Uptop Management , Inc. (â€œUptopâ€), a South Carolina corporation, leased a portion of the shopping center for use as a nightclub.Â  The lease dated December 21, 2000, was signed by Swinson on behalf of Swordfish and by Pearl Ingram on behalf of Uptop.Â Â  Swinson testified he believed Uptop subsequently entered into a management agreement with Dance, Inc. (â€œDanceâ€) over its portion of the shopping center during the term of Uptopâ€™s lease.Â  When operated by Dance, Uptopâ€™s nightclub was known by various names, including Club Voodoos.Â  \r\nDuring the operation of the various nightclub establishments in Uptopâ€™s leased portion of the shopping center, numerous crimes, including narcotics violations, assaults, and various instances of disorderly conduct, were committed on the premises.Â  Ingram requested security be provided by either Swordfish or C.B. Richard Ellis on Swordfishâ€™s behalf.Â  Swordfish agreed to provide security in the common areas, first by employing off-duty deputies and later employing a private security company. \r\nLarry Capall, director of property management for C.B. Richard Ellis, testified Swordfish switched from the off-duty officers to the private security company because the club owners complained about the cost to employ the off-duty deputies.Â  Although Swordfish arranged for the security in the common areas, it charged the tenants for the cost of maintaining the security.Â  Swordfish considered security â€œadditional rentsâ€ under the lease to be paid by the tenant.Â  Prior to November 3, 2001, Swordfish, because of the failure of payment by Uptop, discontinued the security in the common areas.Â  \r\nOn November 3, 2001, Octavia M. Jackson (Appellant) and several friends entered Club Voodoos.Â  While Appellant was in the club, two altercations occurred.Â  One involved a male patron who was escorted from the club.Â  Soon thereafter Appellant and her party decided to leave and began exiting the club.Â  At that time, the male patron re-entered the club with a gun and began shooting in the air and indiscriminately into the crowd.Â  Appellant was shot multiple times.Â  \r\nAppellant argues Swordfish had a duty to protect her from the criminal activity in the club by providing adequate security on or in the vicinity of the property where Appellant was shot.Â  The trial court granted Swordfishâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in granting Swordfishâ€™s motion for summary judgment?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  CafÃ© Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 406 S.E.2d 162 (1991).Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Middleborough Horizontal Property Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison, 320 S.C. 470, 465 S.E.2d 765 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Further, summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, if there is a dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn therefrom.Â  MacFarlane v. Manly, 274 S.C. 392, 264 S.E.2d 838 (1980).Â  An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show the (1) defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission (3) defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury and (4)Â  the plaintiff suffered injury or damages.Â  Dorrell v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp., 361 S.C. 312, 318, 605 S.E.2d 12, 15 (2004).Â Â  Whether the law recognizes a particular duty is an issue of law to be determined by the court.Â  Ellis v. Niles, 324 S.C. 223, 479 S.E.2d 47 (1996).\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in concluding Swordfish had no duty to protect her from the criminal acts of her assailant inside the leased premises.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn Cramer v. Balcor Property Management, Inc., 312 S.C. 440, 441 S.E.2d 317 (1994), we concluded, on a certified question from the federal district court, that residential landlords do not owe a general duty to protect tenants from criminal activity of third parties.Â  We agreed with the federal district court opinion in Cooke v. Allstate Management Corp., 741 F.Supp. 1205 (D.S.C. 1990), which found the residential landlord/tenant relationship to be fundamentally different from the relationships for which South Carolina law will impose a duty to protect against criminal activity. \r\nIn the present case, Appellant argues that as the sub-lesseeâ€™s invitee, Swordfish had a common law duty to protect her from the criminal acts of a third party.Â  Appellantâ€™s status as an invitee does not, under the facts of this case, create a duty on the part of Swordfish to protect her from the criminal acts of third parties inside the leased premises, an area which Swordfish did not control or possess.[2] \r\nIn Cramer, we explained that even though South Carolina law does not impose a duty on a landlord to protect a tenant from the criminal acts of third parties, a plaintiff is not precluded from asserting a general negligence principle.Â  A duty may arise under the particular circumstances of an individual case based upon a showing of negligence constituting the proximate cause of the loss, even though the law does not impose a general duty on landlords to protect tenants or their guests from the criminal acts of third parties.Â  Cramer, 312 S.C. at 443, 441 S.E.2d at 319.Â  \r\nAppellant argues the applicability of two exceptions to the traditional rule of non-liability of landlords.Â  The exceptions are the â€œaffirmative actsâ€ exception and the â€œcommon areasâ€ exception.Â  We conclude neither exception is applicable in this case.\r\nUnder the common law, even where there is no duty to act but the defendant voluntarily undertakes the act, the defendant assumes a duty to use due care.Â  Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 406 S.E.2d 338 (1991).Â Â  Appellant argues that once Swordfish acted to provide security, it was obligated to maintain adequate security.Â  \r\nAlthough Swordfish agreed to arrange for security in the common areas at the tenantâ€™s expense, there is no evidence in the record Swordfish ever agreed to provide security inside the club.Â  Swordfish had neither possession nor control over the activities inside the club when Appellant was shot.Â  Therefore, no duty arose, under the affirmative acts exception, on the part of Swordfish to protect its tenants or their patrons from the criminal acts of third parties occurring inside the club. \r\nAppellant next argues Swordfish, as owner of the property, had a duty to maintain common areas in a safe and secure manner.Â  Because Appellantâ€™s assailant was able to re-enter the club, Appellant argues Swordfish breached its duty under the common areas exception.Â  \r\nIn a case presenting different facts, we might well agree with the dissent that a commercial landlord has a duty to reasonably protect invitees from foreseeable criminal acts in areas under the commercial landlordâ€™s control.Â  Assuming, without deciding, Swordfish had a duty under the lease to provide security in the common areas, Appellant has failed to present any evidence demonstrating a breach of this duty.Â  Appellant has presented no evidence of any alleged criminal or suspicious activity occurring outside the club before Appellantâ€™s assailant re-entered the club.Â  There simply is no evidence in the record suggesting the assailantâ€™s activities outside the club would have alerted security personnel in the common areas of the assailantâ€™s impending criminal conduct inside the club.Â Â  \r\nFinally, our resolution of this issue is dispositive and we need not address Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues regarding proximate causation.Â  Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissents in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: &nbsp;I respectfully dissent.&nbsp; In my opinion, Swordfish had a duty to reasonably secure the common areas of the premises, and there are genuine issues of material fact concerning breach and causation.\r\nBy emphasizing the fact that Appellant was injured inside the club, an area over which Swordfish purportedly had no control, the majority avoids Appellant&rsquo;s argument that Swordfish had a duty to provide reasonable security measures in the common areas outside the nightclub, which were under Swordfish&rsquo;s control, and that the failure to do so allowed the assailant to return to the club and injure Appellant. &nbsp;That Appellant was shot inside the club relates to causation, which in my opinion, is not here a proper element of negligence on which to base summary judgment.&nbsp; \r\nI agree with Appellant that a commercial landlord, under circumstances here appearing, has a duty to reasonably protect invitees from foreseeable criminal acts in areas under the landlord&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; Compare Cramer v. Balcor Prop. Mgmt., Inc., 312 S.C. 440, 441 S.E.2d 317 (1994) (holding that a residential landlord has no duty to protect invitees from foreseeable criminal acts), with Bullard v. Ehrhardt, 283 S.C. 557, 559, 324 S.E.2d 61, 62 (1984) (holding that a store owner has a duty to protect invitees from foreseeable criminal acts), and Munn v. Hardee&rsquo;s Food Sys., Inc., 274 S.C. 529, 531, 266 S.E.2d 414, 414-15 (1980) (same), and Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 484, 238 S.E.2d 167, 169 (1977) (same).&nbsp; \r\nSwordfish is a commercial landlord which expects members of the general public to utilize the common areas as patrons of Swordfish&rsquo;s tenants.&nbsp; If a landlord like Swordfish should reasonably anticipate that the paying public will be exposed to society&rsquo;s criminal element, then it is appropriate that the landlord be expected to take measures to protect the patrons.&nbsp; As the party in control of the common areas, the landlord is in the best position to bear the burden with respect to those areas.&nbsp; See Cramer, 312 S.C. at 442-43, 441 S.E.2d at 318-319 (distinguishing store owners, who invite the general public to their premises, from residential landlords, who do not invite the general public to their premises) (relying on Cooke v. Allstate Mgmt. Corp., 741 F. Supp. 1205 (D.S.C. 1990)). \r\nThe question, then, is whether Swordfish should have foreseen criminal behavior taking place in the common areas of its property.&nbsp; The evidence in the record is overwhelming that long before Appellant was shot, drug use, violence, and other criminal behavior were rampant in the common areas surrounding the nightclub.&nbsp; Swordfish was fully aware of the situation, and I would therefore hold that a duty to reasonably secure the common areas arose prior to the shooting at issue.\r\nA jury [3]  must determine whether Swordfish breached its duty after considering evidence relating to what security measures, if taken, would have fulfilled that duty.&nbsp; I find summary judgment not properly based on this element of negligence.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLikewise, there remain for further factual development matters relating to causation.&nbsp; Assuming a breach of Swordfish&rsquo;s duty in the common areas, it remains to be determined whether such breach was a proximate cause of the assailant&rsquo;s access to the club while armed.&nbsp; \r\nFurther, I disagree with the circuit court that proximate cause is absent as a matter of law. &nbsp;The circuit court held that there was no question but that the shooting was an unforeseeable, intervening act that broke the causal link between any breach by Swordfish and Appellant&rsquo;s injury.&nbsp; This determination is irreconcilable with Swordfish&rsquo;s duty arising from the foreseeability of criminal conduct.&nbsp; Like the presence of cause in fact, the presence of proximate cause would depend on the jury&rsquo;s decision on breach.&nbsp; It is impossible at this point to determine as a matter of law that a breach by Swordfish did not cause Appellant&rsquo;s injury.&nbsp; \r\nOn these grounds, the grant of summary judgment to Swordfish should be reversed, and the case remanded for trial.\r\nIn addition, and notwithstanding the previous discussion, the case must be remanded for a determination whether Swordfish had a contractual duty to secure the common areas.&nbsp; Appellant argued to the circuit court and this Court that Swordfish assumed such a duty in its lease with Up-Top.&nbsp; The circuit court did not interpret the lease, however, because the court held that Appellant&rsquo;s &ldquo;negligence claim [could not] lie if it [were] based on a breach of contract between Swordfish and Up-Top in the absence of a duty independent of the contract.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was error.&nbsp; Even when a duty to the plaintiff does not otherwise exist, a duty may arise out of the alleged tortfeasor&rsquo;s contract with a third party.&nbsp; Andrade v. Johnson, 356 S.C. 238, 245, 588 S.E.2d 588, 592 (2003).&nbsp; Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment should be reversed and the case remanded so that the circuit court can interpret the lease.&nbsp; Were the court to find that the lease imposed a duty on Swordfish, then breach and causation would depend on the nature and extent of that contractual duty, which could differ from the common-law duty discussed above.\r\nFor the reasons I have stated, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for trial.&nbsp; \r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Swinson is a partner in C.B. Richard Ellis and is employed to run the overall operations of the company.Â  He is not a commercial real estate broker. \r\n[2] Appellant argues Cramer is inapposite because Swordfish is a commercial landlord and Cramer addressed a landlordâ€™s duty only in the residential setting.Â  We decline to address the issue of a commercial landlordâ€™s duty under the facts of this case, in which the crime occurred inside leased premises not under the landlordâ€™s control, and Appellant presented no evidence of any alleged criminal or suspicious activity occurring in areas under the landlordâ€™s control.\r\n[3] In her complaint, Appellant requested a jury trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26038","title":"In the Matter of Newberry Cty Magistrate Beckman","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26038","description":"This is an opinion suspending a magistrate.","date":"2005-09-19","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Newberry\r\n        County Magistrate\r\n        Joseph Griffin\r\n        Beckham,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26038\r\nSubmitted July 6, 2005 - Filed September 19, 2005\r\n\r\nSUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B. Richardson, Jr.,\r\n        Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia,\r\n        for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        W. Chadwick Jenkins, of\r\n        Newberry, for respondent.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp;&nbsp; In\r\nthis judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant\r\nto Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.&nbsp; In the Agreement, respondent admits\r\nmisconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition, public reprimand, or\r\nsuspension not to exceed ninety (90) days pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; We accept the Agreement and suspend respondent for sixty (60)\r\ndays.&nbsp; The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nI.\r\nA defendant was charged with\r\ncriminal domestic violence (CDV).&nbsp; When the matter came to trial before\r\nrespondent neither the victim nor the arresting officer were present to offer\r\nany testimony against the defendant.&nbsp; The defendant was present but did not\r\nplead guilty.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, respondent found the\r\ndefendant guilty of CDV.&nbsp; The only information in support of this finding\r\nwas the law enforcement incident report.&nbsp;\r\nThereafter, the defendantâ€™s\r\nattorney contacted respondent over the telephone.&nbsp; During the ex parte\r\nconversation, the attorney convinced respondent that he had erroneously found\r\nthe defendant guilty.\r\nDuring the telephone conversation,\r\nrespondent told the attorney that if he filed a motion to reopen the case, he\r\nwould grant the motion.&nbsp; It appears respondent agreed to grant the motion\r\nto reopen without notice or opportunity to be heard being afforded the State or\r\nthe victim and, for purposes of this Agreement, respondent does not deny these\r\nfacts.&nbsp; However, respondent represents it is possible he checked with law\r\nenforcement to see if the State objected to the reopening or that the attorney\r\ntold respondent he had talked with law enforcement representatives and they had\r\nno objection.&nbsp; The matter was reopened and the defendant was found not\r\nguilty.\r\nA representative of the Sheriffâ€™s\r\nDepartment signed the Ishmell[1]\r\norder after respondent told the attorney he would grant the motion to\r\nreopen.&nbsp; The Ishmell order designates the reason for its issuance as\r\nâ€œsigned off in error.â€&nbsp; Respondent now recognizes this was not an\r\naccurate statement since he had not found the defendant guilty as the result of\r\nclerical error, but as the result of judicial error.&nbsp;\r\nAfter discussing this matter with\r\nODC and his own attorney, respondent now recognizes he was in error in finding\r\nthe defendant guilty under the circumstances and, in fact, his actions\r\nconstituted judicial misconduct, albeit unintentional.&nbsp; Respondent now\r\nrecognizes and acknowledges that his ex parte conversation with\r\nthe defendantâ€™s attorney and, additionally, his ruling on a motion without\r\ngiving the State an opportunity to be heard constituted misconduct.&nbsp; In\r\nmitigation, respondent represents he agreed to reopen the matter as he did\r\nbecause it was so very clear to him that he had committed reversible error in\r\nhis handling of the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent acknowledges that the\r\ninaccurate statement on the Ishmell order constitutes judicial\r\nmisconduct.&nbsp; After discussing this matter with ODC, respondent is now aware\r\nthat Ishmell orders are authorized only under limited circumstances to\r\ncorrect clerical errors and the use of such orders under the circumstances here\r\nconstituted judicial misconduct.\r\nFor quite some time and long prior\r\nto respondentâ€™s magisterial appointment, it was standard practice in the\r\nNewberry County Magistrateâ€™s Court for a representative of the Sheriffâ€™s\r\nDepartment to appear at bench trials in criminal cases in lieu of the appearance\r\nof the arresting officer and/or complaining witness(es).&nbsp; In addition,\r\nunless the defendant was represented by counsel, it was standard practice to\r\nhave the Sheriffâ€™s Department representative (who had no first hand knowledge\r\nof the case) to testify for the State by reading the information from the\r\nincident report.&nbsp; If the defendant was represented by an attorney, the case\r\nwould be continued until the arresting officer and/or the complaining witness(es)\r\ncould be present.[2]\r\nRespondent represents he followed\r\nthe procedure described above as it was used by his predecessors and by current Newberry County magistrates.&nbsp; Respondent correctly asserts that hearsay\r\nevidence is not inadmissible per se, but is admissible unless an\r\nobjection is made in a timely fashion.&nbsp; ODC does not dispute this\r\ncontention.&nbsp;\r\nAfter discussing the Newberry County\r\nMagistrate Courtâ€™s procedure and related legal principles with ODC and his own\r\nattorney, respondent now recognizes that the Magistrateâ€™s Court was, in\r\neffect, depriving pro se defendants of the constitutionally\r\nguaranteed right to confront their accusers.&nbsp; This practice constituted\r\njudicial misconduct, albeit unintentional.&nbsp; Respondent warrants that, in\r\nthe future, he will cease allowing defendants to plead guilty or be convicted\r\nsolely on the basis of incident reports.\r\nODC does not contend that it\r\nis judicial misconduct for a judge to allow hearsay testimony into a proceeding\r\nwhere there is no objection, even in cases where a defendant is pro se,\r\nbut, instead, contends that fundamental principles of jurisprudence require some\r\nadmissible evidence of the commission of a crime as a prerequisite to proceeding\r\nwith a criminal case.&nbsp; In addition, ODC contends Magistrateâ€™s Court\r\nshould not accommodate the prosecution and deprive pro se\r\ndefendants of basic constitutional rights.&nbsp;\r\nThe Court emphasizes that while a\r\ncriminal defendant may plead guilty without any evidence of his guilt being\r\nsubmitted, a defendant who pleads not guilty cannot be convicted solely on the\r\nbasis of a police incident report.&nbsp; The burden is on the government to\r\nprove a defendantâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on competent\r\nevidence.&nbsp;\r\nII.\r\nFor many years, respondent had been\r\npersonal friends with both a law enforcement officer (Officer) and a public\r\nofficial (Official).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy which would constitute a\r\npromotion for the Officer became available.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Official, while not formally the\r\npromoting authority, had sufficient input in the selection process such that, in\r\nall likelihood, &nbsp;his recommendation would be followed.&nbsp; Respondent met\r\nwith the Official for the purpose of recommending the Officer for the\r\npromotion.&nbsp; Respondent admits that, under the circumstances, he improperly\r\nlent the prestige of his judicial office for the purpose of benefiting\r\nanother.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nIII.\r\nIt is standard practice in the\r\nNewberry County Magistrateâ€™s Court system not to have scheduled bond hearings\r\nbut, instead, to have bond hearings as needed.&nbsp; Instead, a magistrate or\r\nmagistrateâ€™s employee telephones the detention center several times a day to\r\ndetermine if a bond hearing is necessary.&nbsp; If a hearing is necessary, a\r\nhearing is held by a magistrate for the entire detention center population\r\nawaiting bond hearings.&nbsp; This procedure was being used before respondentâ€™s\r\nmagisterial appointment, is used by the Chief Magistrate, and respondent assumed\r\nthe procedure met published requirements.&nbsp;\r\nAs a result of discussions with ODC,\r\nrespondent is now aware that the procedure is not in strict compliance with\r\nprocedures for bond hearings as set out in the Chief Justiceâ€™s administrative\r\norder dated November 28, 2000.&nbsp; The Chief Justiceâ€™s order requires bond\r\nhearings to be scheduled at least two times a day.&nbsp; The order is\r\nincluded in the instruction course given to all magistrates by South Carolina\r\nCourt Administration prior to assuming magisterial duties and a copy is included\r\nin the Bench Book provided by South Carolina Court Administration to all\r\nmagistrates and other summary court judges.&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges that\r\nfailure to follow a court order constitutes judicial misconduct.\r\nODC does not contend that the\r\nforegoing procedure prejudiced any individual defendants, but only that the\r\nprocedure does not strictly conform to the Chief Justiceâ€™s directives.&nbsp;\r\nIn mitigation, respondent was in a dilemma because the instructions from the\r\nchief magistrate were at variance with the provisions of the Chief Justiceâ€™s\r\norder.[3]&nbsp;\r\nIV.\r\nRespondent is married to the\r\ndaughter of William Frank Partridge, Jr. (Father-in-law).&nbsp; Father-in-law is\r\nan attorney.&nbsp; His offices are in Newberry and, on occasion, he defends\r\ncases in Newberry County Magistrateâ€™s Court (but not before respondent),\r\nprosecutes cases in family court for the Solicitor in Newberry County (thereby\r\nrepresenting the State), and serves as a part-time municipal judge.&nbsp;\r\nFather-in-law has a son, William Franklin â€œTroupâ€ Partridge, III\r\n(Brother-in-law), who is also an attorney with his principle office in Columbia.&nbsp;\r\nFor purposes of this Agreement, the\r\nparties believe that Brother-in-law was a friend of Eric Boland.&nbsp; Mr.\r\nBolandâ€™s son, Matthew Boland (Matthew), received a speeding ticket from South\r\nCarolina Highway Patrol Trooper M.K. Horne.&nbsp; Trooper Horne issued a ticket\r\nto Matthew alleging he was driving 85 M.P.H. in a 55 M.P.H. zone (a six point\r\nviolation).&nbsp; Mr. Boland contacted Brother-in-law and Brother-in-law\r\ncontacted his father, Father-in-law, about representing, assisting, and/or\r\nadvising Matthew in connection with the ticket.&nbsp;\r\nAt a regularly scheduled weekly\r\nluncheon between respondent and Father-in-law, Father-in-law told respondent he\r\nneeded to speak to Trooper Horne about Matthewâ€™s ticket and asked respondent\r\nto convey that message to Trooper Horne.&nbsp; Thereafter,&nbsp; respondent\r\ndelivered Father-in-lawâ€™s message to Trooper Horne during a conversation in\r\nrespondentâ€™s office.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent represents Trooper Horne\r\nspontaneously volunteered something to the effect â€œtell Father-in-law not to\r\nworry about it [Matthewâ€™s ticket], Iâ€™ll mark it not guilty.â€&nbsp;\r\nRespondent further represents he did not ask Trooper Horne to provide any\r\nassistance to Father-in-law or Brother-in-Law and, instead, only passed on the\r\nmessage that Father-in-law wanted to talk with Trooper Horne about Matthewâ€™s\r\nticket. ODC has no basis upon which to contest this representation.&nbsp;\r\nThe Chief Magistrate called Matthewâ€™s\r\ncase for trial on the occasion specified on the ticket and contends he found\r\nMatthew â€œguiltyâ€ in his absence, notwithstanding that neither Matthew nor\r\nTrooper Horne were present.[4]&nbsp;\r\nThe Chief Magistrate marked the ticket â€œNRVCâ€ which is a standard notation\r\nto indicate the defendant failed to appear or post bond and the administrative\r\nprocess should suspend the defendantâ€™s driverâ€™s license in accordance with\r\napplicable law.&nbsp;\r\nAt some point, someone checked a box\r\non Matthewâ€™s ticket indicating Matthew did appear before the Chief Magistrate\r\nwhen Matthew did not appear in court on the occasion specified.&nbsp; Someone\r\nalso checked a â€œnot guiltyâ€ box on the ticket.&nbsp; â€œNot guiltyâ€ is\r\ninconsistent with the NRVC notation made by the Chief Magistrate. The ticket was\r\nforwarded to the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).&nbsp;\r\nDMV sent Matthew an official notice\r\nsuspending his driverâ€™s license for failure to pay the traffic ticket.&nbsp;\r\nThereafter, Mr. Boland contacted Brother-in-law about the matter and, in turn,\r\nBrother-in-law contacted respondent.&nbsp; Respondent states that â€œ[Brother-in-law]\r\nbasically called and said that [Matthew] called him or something of that nature,\r\nor his dad.&nbsp; Somebody called him saying that the boy in question had a NRVC\r\nNotice on the ticket, which it was found guilty, whatever it was done.â€\r\nRespondent then asked a magisterial\r\nemployee to check on the matter.&nbsp; The employee reported to respondent that\r\nthe charge shown on the computer was â€œguilty,â€ but the ticket was marked â€œnot\r\nguilty.â€ &nbsp;The employee spoke with the Chief Magistrate about the matter\r\nand reported back to respondent that the Chief Magistrate â€œsaid it was guilty.â€&nbsp;\r\nRespondent reported the foregoing to Brother-in-law.&nbsp;\r\nSubsequently, Brother-in-law\r\napproached respondent while respondent was holding night court and requested to\r\nsee the file on Matthewâ€™s ticket.&nbsp; Respondent provided Brother-in-law\r\nwith copies of information he requested from the Magistrate Courtâ€™s files concerning the ticket.&nbsp; The\r\ninformation respondent furnished to Brother-in-law were matters of public\r\nrecord.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nODC contends that Brother-in-law\r\nthen called the Chief Magistrate on the telephone about Matthewâ€™s ticket and\r\nexplained that the ticket was supposed to have been â€œnot guiltyâ€ and that it\r\nhad been sent to DMV due to a clerical error. &nbsp;The Chief Magistrate told\r\nBrother-in-law that there was no error, that it was his intention to find\r\nMatthew guilty, and that no change could be made concerning the disposition of\r\nthe ticket.\r\nBrother-in-law then asked\r\nFather-in-law to assist Matthew in the matter.&nbsp; Father-in-law prepared an\r\naffidavit for Matthewâ€™s signature, a motion for an ex parte order\r\nand ex parte order, and an order and rule to show cause, all\r\nstyled â€œEx Parte [Matthew].â€ &nbsp;Circuit Court Judge Wyatt\r\nSaunders signed Father-in-lawâ€™s orders, including an order that the Chief\r\nMagistrate appear before the judge the next business day.&nbsp; Brother-in-law\r\nhad previously served as a law clerk to Judge Saunders.\r\nJudge Saunders and Brother-in-law\r\nhave represented to ODC that Brother-in-law happened by the judgeâ€™s chambers\r\nto say â€œhelloâ€ after the orders had been signed and the judge asked\r\nBrother-in-law to contact the sheriff to have the orders served upon the Chief\r\nMagistrate that evening.&nbsp; Brother-in-law went to Father-in-lawâ€™s home and\r\ntelephoned the Newberry County Sheriff in the presence of Father-in-law and\r\nrequested the orders be served on the Chief Magistrate.&nbsp; A deputy sheriff\r\nretrieved the orders from Brother-in-law at Father-in-lawâ€™s home and served\r\nthe order on the Chief Magistrate that evening.&nbsp;\r\nODC further represents that the\r\norders do not have a docket number, that no summons was attached to the orders,\r\nthat no filing fee was paid to the Clerk of Court, even though they bear a â€œdate\r\ntimeâ€ stamp, that no motion fee was paid, that the Sheriffâ€™s Department\r\nprovided no one with proof of service of the orders, and no fee was paid to the\r\nSheriffâ€™s Department for service of the pleadings and order.[5]&nbsp;\r\nThe next business day, a hearing was\r\nheld before Judge Saunders. &nbsp;Mr. Boland, Matthew, and the Chief Magistrate\r\nwere present.&nbsp; The State had not been served with a copy of the pleadings\r\nand was not represented at the hearing.&nbsp; At the hearing, Matthew testified\r\nthat he â€œ. . . believed for some time that he had been found not guiltyâ€ and\r\nâ€œwas under the impression [he] was found not guilty for sometime.â€&nbsp; At\r\nsome point during the proceeding, the Chief Magistrate volunteered he would â€œ.\r\n. . help on the ticket. . . .â€\r\nJudge Saunders allowed the Chief\r\nMagistrate and Matthew to discuss the matter so that, in his words, â€œ. . .\r\ntoward the end of perhaps using [the Chief Magistrateâ€™s] good office to assist\r\nyou.â€&nbsp; The Chief Magistrate and Matthew discussed the matter, which\r\nresulted in the Chief Magistrate, with the consent of a passing Sheriffâ€™s\r\nDepartment official, reopening the ticket and accepting bond forfeiture for a\r\ntwo point violation.&nbsp;\r\nODCâ€™s investigations revealed the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Trooper Horne advised ODC he had\r\n    intended to cause Matthewâ€™s ticket to be marked â€œnot guiltyâ€ due to a\r\n    request from someone, but he could not remember who made that request.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Judge Saunders reported the\r\n    pleadings and orders were on his desk when he arrived at work and he does\r\n    not know how they came to be placed there.&nbsp; He further stated he did\r\n    not know how Mr. Boland and Matthew came to be before him to get the\r\n    pleadings and orders, that he would have held a hearing for any other\r\n    citizen under like circumstances, and it was only a coincidence his former\r\n    law clerk appeared in his chambers to be available to assist him in having\r\n    the pleadings served on the Chief Magistrate that evening.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    The Newberry County Clerk of\r\n    Court stated she could not locate the original or any copies of the\r\n    pleadings in her office and states that, under normal circumstances, her\r\n    office would not clock copies of legal documents without giving them a\r\n    docket number and retaining the originals.&nbsp; The originals of the\r\n    pleadings cannot be located in the Magistrateâ€™s Office or anywhere else by\r\n    ODC.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    The day after the hearing,\r\n    Father-in-law appeared before the Chief Magistrate on two other traffic\r\n    tickets issued to Matthew.&nbsp; The Chief Magistrate reduced one of the\r\n    tickets to a two point violation and dismissed the other ticket.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespondent has no direct knowledge\r\nof the four above-itemized representations by ODC, but has no basis to contest\r\nthe validity of the representations.&nbsp; For purposes of this Agreement, these\r\nitemizations are treated as the facts.&nbsp;\r\nWhile respondent represents he was\r\nonly conveying a message from Father-in-law to Trooper Horne about Matthewâ€™s\r\nticket, respondent now recognizes that, even if only so doing, the\r\ncommunications to Trooper Horne from respondentâ€™s Father-in-law was likely to\r\nbe interpreted as a request to provide special treatment to Matthew.&nbsp; In so\r\ndoing, respondent committed judicial misconduct.&nbsp;\r\nIn his initial response to the\r\nNotice of Full Investigation, respondent stated:\r\n\r\n  At the request of a citizen who\r\n  had received a ticket, I reviewed the outcome of the court proceedings for\r\n  him.&nbsp; In speaking with [a Magistrate Court employee] I realized that the ticket was marked as\r\n  â€œNot Guiltyâ€ but [the employee] had also sent the ticket in as â€œNRVC.â€&nbsp;\r\n  I notified [the employee] of this apparent computer error immediately.&nbsp;\r\n  After this discussion with [the employee], I had nothing further to do with\r\n  this matter.&nbsp; I never told [the employee] that the Attorney General had\r\n  called and I have never spoken to the Attorney General.&nbsp; The Attorney\r\n  Generalâ€™s office should have call logs, etc., which would show no such\r\n  conversation ever took place.\r\n  As to the allegations of my\r\n  speaking with the trooper, I do speak to law enforcement on a regular basis\r\n  but no improprieties occur in our conversations.&nbsp; I may have spoken to\r\n  the issuing officer but I do not recall any specifics\r\n  of our conversation. &nbsp;(Emphasis in original).&nbsp;\r\n  [The Chief Magistrate] handled all\r\n  matters concerning this ticket and I did not adjudicate it in any\r\n  manner.&nbsp; I am unaware of any other matters involving [Matthew] and I did\r\n  not know my father in law, as\r\n  a private attorney, represented [Matthew] until\r\n  receiving the Notice of Full Investigation\r\n  in this matter.&nbsp; (Emphasis in original).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThereafter, respondent filed a\r\nSupplemental Response to the Notice of Full Investigation.&nbsp; In this\r\nresponse, respondent represented:\r\n\r\n  After careful review and\r\n  consideration of this matter, I remembered additional details regarding the\r\n  allegations in Paragraph 14.&nbsp; I would like to amend my response to\r\n  Paragraph 14 of the Notice as follows:&nbsp;\r\n  [Father-in-law] spoke to me\r\n  regarding a traffic ticket [Matthew] had received.&nbsp; I indicated that I\r\n  would convey this information to the Highway Patrolman who issued the ticket\r\n  and believe that I did so on the court date.&nbsp; Although I am uncertain\r\n  about the details, I believe that the trooper came into my office and I\r\n  indicated that [Father-in-law] had spoke (sic) to me about the ticket and the\r\n  Patrolman volunteered that this would not be a problem and that he would\r\n  simply â€œnot guiltyâ€ the ticket.&nbsp; I assumed that this matter was\r\n  handled before [the Chief Magistrate], the presiding judge that day.&nbsp;\r\n  (Emphasis in original).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges that his\r\ninitial response omitted reference to relaying the message from Father-in-law to\r\nTrooper Horne.&nbsp; Respondent represents he did not remember that conversation\r\nuntil some time until after filing his initial response to the Notice of Full\r\nInvestigation and, after he did, he filed the Supplemental Response.&nbsp; ODC\r\nhas no basis to contest this representation.&nbsp; Respondent concedes that the\r\ninconsistencies in these two responses, even if due to faulty memory,\r\nconstituted judicial misconduct since the initial response contained information\r\nrespondent now recognizes was inaccurate and incomplete.&nbsp;\r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits\r\nhe has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\nSCACR:&nbsp; Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A\r\n(judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high\r\nstandards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the\r\nintegrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge\r\nshall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities);\r\nCanon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times\r\nin a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of\r\nthe judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not lend the prestige of judicial office\r\nto advance the private interests of others); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the\r\nduties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3B(2) (judge shall\r\nbe faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon 3B(7)\r\n(judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte\r\ncommunications); Canon 3B(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters\r\npromptly, efficiently, and fairly); Canon 4 (judge shall conduct his\r\nextra-judicial activities to minimize the risk of conflict with judicial\r\nobligations); and Canon 4A(3) (judge shall conduct his extra-judicial activities\r\nso as not to interfere with the proper performance of his judicial\r\nduties).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy violating the Code of Judicial\r\nConduct, respondent admits he has also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for\r\nJudicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.&nbsp; In addition, he admits\r\nhe violated Rule 7(a)(7), RJDE, by willfully violating a valid court order\r\nissued by a court of this state.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\nwarrants a suspension from judicial duties.&nbsp; We therefore accept the\r\nAgreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent for sixty (60)\r\ndays.&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s request that the suspension be made retroactive to\r\nthe date of his interim suspension is denied.[6]&nbsp;\r\nSUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER,\r\nBURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See Ishmell v. South Carolina Highway Department,\r\n264 S.C. 340, 215 S.E.2d 201 (1975).&nbsp;\r\n[2] The Newberry County Magistrateâ€™s Court recognized that, if the\r\ndefendant was represented by counsel, counsel would likely offer a hearsay\r\nobjection to the admission of information in the incident report (unless the\r\nreport was introduced by the officer who prepared the report) and the objection\r\nwould have to be sustained.&nbsp;\r\n[3] The Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order provides that a Chief\r\nMagistrate may request that the Chief Justice approve a bond hearing schedule\r\nwhich deviates from the twice daily bond hearings required by the order.&nbsp;\r\nThe Newberry County Magistrateâ€™s Office did not have the Chief Justiceâ€™s\r\napproval to deviate from her order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[4] Presumably, Trooper Horneâ€™s response was relayed by someone back\r\nto Father-in-law and, eventually, by someone to Matthew because Matthew posted\r\nno bond and did not appear at trial on the date specified on the ticket.\r\n[5] Because the matter was criminal in nature, not all of these\r\nprocedures were required.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[6] On April 8, 2005, respondent was placed on interim\r\nsuspension.&nbsp; The interim suspension was based on allegations unrelated to\r\nthe matters addressed by this opinion.&nbsp; The parties have agreed the\r\nAgreement concludes not only the matters addressed in the Agreement, but also\r\nthe complaint from which the interim suspension arose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26039","title":"Davis v.

Hershey, William W. Nivens, Jr., and Theresa L. Varas\r\n(Appellants) are employed by the District as continuing contract teachers.[1]&nbsp; Appellants have been employed\r\nby the District since at least the 1999-2000 school year.&nbsp; Appellants are\r\nlicensed by the South Carolina Board of Education.\r\nIn 1997,\r\nthe General Assembly enacted a statute giving a monetary incentive to teachers\r\nwho completed the national board certification process.[2]&nbsp; Since 2000, the state has paid teachers an\r\nannual bonus of $7,500 for acquiring this certification.&nbsp; In addition, the\r\nstate has reimbursed the teachers for the certification fee.&nbsp; Further, some\r\nschool districts, including the District, have offered additional â€œbonusesâ€\r\nor â€œincentivesâ€ or â€œsupplementsâ€[3]\r\nto teachers who complete the certification process. &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt the\r\nbeginning of the 1999-2000 school year, the Greenwood County School Board (the\r\nBoard) adopted an incentive program to encourage teachers to become national\r\nboard certified.&nbsp; Teachers becoming certified would receive a ten percent\r\nincrease in their annual salary.[4]&nbsp;\r\nDuring that same school year, the District superintendent, Dr. Kinlaw, traveled\r\nto various schools in the District to talk about national board certification\r\nand the incentive program. &nbsp;The parties dispute how the program was\r\nportrayed, but all written documentation from the teachersâ€™ meetings reflects\r\nthat Dr. Kinlaw told the teachers that they would receive a ten percent increase\r\nsubject to the Boardâ€™s approval each year.\r\nDuring\r\nthe 2002-03 year, however, the District had a budget shortfall.&nbsp; At the\r\nsame time, the number of national board certified teachers had increased.&nbsp;\r\nTo deal with the financial dilemma, the Board decided to offer a flat-rate\r\nincentive of $3,000 instead of a ten percent salary increase.&nbsp;\r\nAppellants\r\nfiled suit claiming that the District should be estopped from changing the\r\nincentive policy.&nbsp; Appellants also alleged breach of contract, breach of\r\nfiduciary duty, and violation of the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court granted the Districtâ€™s motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; This\r\nappeal followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\nfollowing issue has been raised for review:\r\n\r\n  Did\r\n  the trial court err in granting summary judgment for the District?\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nSummary\r\nJudgment\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary\r\njudgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial\r\ncourt.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860\r\n(2002).&nbsp; Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493, 567 S.E.2d at\r\n860.&nbsp; When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nnon-moving party.&nbsp; Id. at\r\n493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;Breach of Contract\r\nAppellants\r\nargue that the District is liable for breach of contract.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nIn order\r\nfor a contract to be valid and enforceable, the parties must have a meeting of\r\nthe minds as to all essential and material terms of the agreement.&nbsp; Player\r\nv. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1989).&nbsp; In\r\naddition, the Statute of Frauds requires that a contract that cannot be\r\nperformed within one year be in writing and signed by the parties.&nbsp; S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 32-3-10 (1991).\r\nIn the\r\npresent case, Appellants are continuing contract teachers.&nbsp; Each year, the\r\nDistrict offers the teacher a new contract for the following school year\r\nonly.&nbsp; Appellants entered into a new contract every year subject to any\r\nchanges in terms.&nbsp; Because the terms of the contract were subject to the\r\napproval of the Board each year, we hold that the District is not bound to the\r\nten percent per year incentive program.&nbsp; Even if an agreement existed, it\r\nwould be void under the Statute of Frauds because the alleged agreement was not\r\nin writing or signed by the parties.\r\nAccordingly,\r\nwe hold that the District was not liable for breach of contract.\r\nB.\r\nPromissory Estoppel\r\nAppellants\r\nargue that they are entitled to relief under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.\r\nPromissory estoppel requires a\r\nclaimant to prove: (1) the presence of an unambigous promise; (2) the promisee\r\nreasonably relied upon the promise; (3) the reliance was expected and\r\nforeseeable by promisor; and (4) the promisee was injured as a result of\r\nreliance upon the promise.&nbsp; Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 484,\r\n570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn the present case, Appellants\r\nclaim that they relied upon Dr. Kinlawâ€™s promise that they would receive a pay\r\nincrease for becoming national board certified.&nbsp; We hold that Appellants\r\nhave failed to show that their reliance on Dr. Kinlawâ€™s statement was\r\nreasonable.&nbsp; The record indicates that Dr. Kinlaw informed Appellants on\r\nseveral occasions that the incentive was subject to the Boardâ€™s\r\napproval.&nbsp; Therefore, it was unreasonable for Appellants to rely upon Dr.\r\nKinlawâ€™s statement that they would receive a ten-percent salary increase if\r\nthey became national board certified.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nAs a result, we affirm the decision\r\nof the trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of the District on the\r\nissue of promissory estoppel.\r\nC.&nbsp;\r\nFiduciary Duty\r\nAppellants\r\nargue that the District breached a fiduciary duty owed to the teachers.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nA confidential or fiduciary\r\nrelationship exists when one imposes a special confidence in another, so that\r\nthe latter, in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with\r\ndue regard to the interests of the one imposing the confidence.&nbsp; Hendricks\r\nv. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 459, 578\r\nS.E.2d 711, 716 (2003).&nbsp; A school district has a position of confidence\r\nwith regard to its employees and therefore, a fiduciary duty exists between a\r\nschool district and its employees.&nbsp; Armstrong v. Sch. Dist. Five of Lexington\r\nand Richland Counties, 26 F.Supp.2d 789, 797 (D.S.C. 1998).&nbsp; One standing\r\nin a fiduciary relationship with another is subject to liability to the other\r\nfor harm resulting from a breach of duty imposed by the relation.&nbsp; Moore\r\nv. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 253, 599 S.E.2d 467, 473 (Ct.

Singleton v. Horry County Sch. Dist., 289 S.C. 223,\r\n227-28, 345 S.E.2d 751, 753-54 (1986) (citing Law v. Richland Sch. Dist.

Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E. Underwriters Risk Retention Group,\r\n353 S.C. 249, 251, 578 S.E.2d 8, 9 n.1 (2003) (holding that a ruling not\r\nchallenged on appeal is the law of the case, regardless of the correctness of\r\nthe ruling).&nbsp; We therefore address only the inverse-condemnation claim.\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the circuit court erred in\r\ngranting summary judgment for the City on Byrdâ€™s inverse-condemnation claim.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a grant of summary\r\njudgment, we apply the same standard as the circuit court.&nbsp; Osborne v.\r\nAdams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).&nbsp; Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\r\njudgment as a matter of law.â€&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; â€œ[T]he evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party.â€&nbsp; Osborne, 346 S.C. at 7, 550\r\nS.E.2d at 321.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nBoth the United States Constitution\r\nand the South Carolina Constitution provide that if the government takes private\r\nproperty for public use, then it must compensate the owner for the value.[6]&nbsp; While the government typically\r\ntakes property through an eminent-domain proceeding,[7] a taking may occur without such a\r\nproceeding.&nbsp; That is called â€œinverse condemnation.â€&nbsp; See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church\r\nof Glendale v. County of Los\r\nAngeles, 482 U.S.  304,\r\n316, 107 S. Ct. 2378, 2386, 96 L. Ed. 2d 250, 265\r\n(1987).&nbsp; An inverse condemnation may result from the governmentâ€™s\r\nphysical appropriation of private property, or it may result from\r\ngovernment-imposed limitations on the use of private property.&nbsp;\r\nWhether physical or regulatory, this\r\nCourt has held that there are four elements to inverse condemnation: (1)\r\naffirmative conduct of a government entity; (2) the conduct effects a taking;\r\n(3) the taking is for public use; and (4) the taking has some degree of\r\npermanence.&nbsp; See, e.g., Berryâ€™s On Main, Inc. v. City of\r\nColumbia, 277 S.C. 14, 15, 281 S.E.2d 796, 797 &amp; n. 2 (1981).&nbsp; We\r\ntake this opportunity to modify and clarify that test.\r\nFirst, we remove the element â€œsome\r\ndegree of permanence,â€ for it conflicts with the principle that the government\r\nmust compensate for even a temporary taking.&nbsp; See First English,\r\n482 U.S.  at 318, 107 S. Ct.\r\nat 2388, 96 L. Ed. 2d at 266 (stating that temporary takings are â€œnot\r\ndifferent in kind from permanent takings, for which the [United States]\r\nConstitution clearly requires compensationâ€).\r\nSecond, the element requiring the\r\ntaking be for â€œpublic useâ€ does not apply to regulatory-takings cases.&nbsp;\r\nTahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regâ€™l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. \r\n302, 326, 122 S. Ct. 1465, 1481, 152 L. Ed. 2d 517, 542-43\r\n(2002) (emphasizing that â€œneither a physical appropriation nor a public use\r\nhas ever been a necessary component of a â€˜regulatory takingâ€™â€).&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, there are only two elements to a regulatory inverse condemnation:\r\naffirmative conduct and a taking.&nbsp; In this case, Byrd has alleged a\r\nregulatory inverse condemnation, so summary judgment is appropriate only if\r\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to the Cityâ€™s\r\naffirmative conduct or the taking of the City Tract.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI.&nbsp; Affirmative Conduct\r\nByrd has presented evidence of\r\naffirmative conduct on the part of the City in ruling on the zoning\r\npetitions.&nbsp; But for the Cityâ€™s zoning ordinances, the petitions would\r\nhave been unnecessary.&nbsp; Regulatory delay is part of the regulatory process,\r\nso indeed it is the product of governmental action.\r\nByrd is incorrect, however, in\r\nasserting that the City engaged in a single course of conduct - a\r\nthirteen-month delay of a decision to rezone his property.&nbsp; Byrdâ€™s\r\nargument overlooks that there was a three-month gap between the Cityâ€™s\r\ngranting the petition to rezone the Small Parcel and the filing of the petition\r\nto rezone the rest of the City Tract.&nbsp; The City engaged in two separate\r\ncourses of conduct, one being the eleven-month delay of the decision whether to\r\nrezone the Small Parcel; the other being the two-month delay of the decision\r\nwhether to rezone the remainder of the City Tract.&nbsp; We separately address\r\nthe takings issue with respect to these two delays.\r\nII.&nbsp; Taking\r\nFirst, we find that this case is\r\ngoverned by Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York, 438 U.S. \r\n104, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1978).&nbsp; We then address the nature\r\nof the Penn Central inquiry in the context of regulatory delay.&nbsp;\r\nLast, we find that Byrd is unable to prove a\r\ntaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA.&nbsp; Penn Central\r\nGoverns This Case\r\nByrdâ€™s\r\nregulatory-inverse-condemnation action is governed by Penn Central\r\nbecause it stems from Byrdâ€™s having suffered a temporary denial of less than\r\nall economically viable use of his property.[8]&nbsp; Until recently, there might have been some confusion as to\r\nwhether a case like Byrdâ€™s was governed by Penn Central, Agins v.\r\nCity of Tiburon, 447 U.S. \r\n255, 100 S. Ct. 2138, 65 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1980), or\r\nboth.&nbsp; In light of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Lingle\r\nv. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., which overruled Agins,\r\nit is clear that Penn Central controls.&nbsp; No. 04-163 (decided May 23,\r\n2005), 73 USLW 4343, 2005 WL 1200710.&nbsp; To the extent that some of our\r\nprevious cases have applied Agins alone or both Agins and Penn\r\nCentral, we overrule them.&nbsp; Infra, note 9.&nbsp;\r\nThe general rule is that\r\nregulatory-takings cases require â€œessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,â€\r\nbalancing all relevant circumstances to determine whether the government has\r\ntaken property.&nbsp; Penn Central, 438 U.S. \r\nat 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 648.&nbsp; Two\r\ncircumstances are especially important: (1) â€œthe economic impact on the\r\nclaimant, and, particularly, the extent to which the [government] has interfered\r\nwith distinct investment-backed expectations;â€ and (2) â€œthe character of the\r\ngovernmental action.â€&nbsp; Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at\r\n2659, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 648;[9] see\r\nalso Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 359 S.C. 85, 98-99, 596\r\nS.E.2d 917, 924 (2004); Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Assâ€™n v. City\r\nof North Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 418, 430, 548 S.E.2d 595, 601 (2001). &nbsp;\r\nWhen, however, it has been factually\r\ndetermined that a property owner has been deprived of all economic use of his\r\nproperty, there is a taking per se.[10]&nbsp; Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003,\r\n1014-19, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 2892-95, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 812-15 (1992).&nbsp;\r\nBecause Byrdâ€™s loss was only temporary, and because Byrd was able to farm his\r\nproperty, no taking per se occurred here.\r\nIn Tahoe-Sierra Preservation\r\nCouncil, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the Court held that Lucas\r\ndoes not apply when the property owner has suffered a temporary loss of all\r\neconomically viable use.&nbsp; 535 U.S.  302, 331-32, 122 S.\r\nCt. 1465, 1484, 152 L. Ed. 2d 517, 546-47 (2002).&nbsp; Because time is a\r\ncomponent of an interest in property, the property owner in that situation has\r\nsuffered a partial loss, not a total one.&nbsp; Once the temporary restriction\r\nis lifted, value will return.&nbsp; Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. \r\nat 331-32, 122 S. Ct. at 1484, 152 L. Ed. 2d at 546.&nbsp;\r\nIn such a case, the court must apply Penn Central to determine whether\r\nthere has been a taking.\r\nThe City argues that Byrdâ€™s case\r\nis distinguishable from Tahoe-Sierra in that Byrd has not alleged a\r\ntemporary loss of all economically viable use.&nbsp; As a matter of law,\r\nthe City asserts, there is no taking if the property owner has suffered a\r\ntemporary loss of only part of the economically viable use of the\r\nproperty.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; While this case might be factually different\r\nfrom Tahoe-Sierra, there the United States Supreme Court expressly\r\nrejected the adoption of categorical rules in the context of regulatory\r\ntakings.&nbsp; If Lucas does not apply, then Penn Central does.[11]&nbsp; That is the case\r\nhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp; Penn Central\r\nAnd Regulatory Delay\r\nIn the context of regulatory delay,\r\nthe Penn Central inquiry is whether the delay ever became\r\nunreasonable.&nbsp; Byrd is not entitled to compensation merely because he had\r\nto obtain a zoning change to develop his property.&nbsp; See Tahoe-Sierra,\r\n535 U.S. at 334-35, 122 S. Ct. at 1485, 152 L. Ed. 2d at 548 (stating that â€œnormal\r\ndelays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances,\r\nand the like â€¦ have long been considered permissible exercises of the police\r\npowerâ€) (quotation omitted); Sea Cabins, 345 S.C. at 436, 548 S.E.2d at\r\n604.[12]&nbsp; Until regulatory\r\ndelay becomes unreasonable, there is no taking.&nbsp; See First\r\nEnglish, 482 U.S.  at\r\n320, 107 S. Ct. at 2388, 96 L. Ed. 2d at 267; Agins, 447 U.S.  at 263, 100 S. Ct. at\r\n2143, 65 L. Ed. 2d at 113 n. 9.&nbsp; The length of the delay alone is not\r\ndeterminative.&nbsp; Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. \r\nat 342, 122 S. Ct. at 1489, 152 L. Ed. 2d at 553.&nbsp;\r\nRather, we consider all relevant circumstances, including the reasons for the\r\ndelay and the economic impacts on Byrd.&nbsp; And under the â€œparcel as a wholeâ€\r\ndoctrine, we must consider those impacts in relation to Byrdâ€™s entire interest\r\nin the City Tract.[13]&nbsp; See\r\nTahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 331, 122 S. Ct. at 1483, 152 L. Ed. 2d at 546; Penn\r\nCentral, 438 U.S. at 130-31, 98 S. Ct. at 2662, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 652; Beard\r\nv. S.C. Coastal Council, 304 S.C. 205, 207-08, 403 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1991).\r\nC.&nbsp; The Eleven-Month Delay\r\nAs mentioned above, for eleven\r\nmonths the City delayed action on the petition to zone the Small Parcel for\r\ncommercial use.&nbsp; Byrd has presented no evidence that this delay effected a\r\ntaking of the City Tract.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPreserving the NHL designation was a\r\nlegitimate governmental interest,[14]\r\nand delaying the zoning decision was a reasonable means of furthering that\r\ninterest.&nbsp; Commercial development might have caused the National Park\r\nService to remove the designation.[15]\r\nFurther, there is no evidence that\r\nthe Cityâ€™s interest ever became disproportionate to the economic impacts on\r\nByrd.[16]&nbsp; First, the delay\r\ndid not affect the use to which Byrd was putting the City Tract before the\r\nrezoning petition was filed.&nbsp; The land was zoned for agricultural use, and\r\nByrdâ€™s ability to farm the land was never disturbed.&nbsp; See Penn\r\nCentral, 438 U.S.  at 136, 98 S. Ct. at\r\n2665, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 656 (calling the existing use of the property the ownerâ€™s\r\nâ€œprimary expectationâ€).&nbsp; Second, Byrdâ€™s only investment-backed\r\nexpectation concerned the sale of the Small Parcel.&nbsp; The delayâ€™s\r\ninterference with this expectation arguably impacted the value of the entire\r\nCity Tract, but even with the evidence viewed in a light most favorable to Byrd,\r\nany such impact was too slight to render the delay unreasonable.&nbsp;\r\nIn sum, there is no issue of\r\nmaterial fact regarding the legitimacy of the Cityâ€™s conduct or the slight\r\nnature of the economic impact on Byrd.&nbsp; Byrd therefore cannot demonstrate\r\nthat the delay ever became unreasonable, which means that he cannot demonstrate\r\na taking.&nbsp;\r\nD.&nbsp; The Two-Month Delay\r\nSimilarly, there is no evidence that\r\nthe two-month delay of the decision to rezone the rest of the City Tract ever\r\nbecame unreasonable.&nbsp; Byrd does not even argue that the City should\r\ngenerally grant a zoning petition in less than two months.&nbsp; Further, it is\r\nundisputed that the delay did not affect Byrdâ€™s ability to farm the property\r\nor that Byrd had no investment-backed expectations with which the delay\r\ninterfered.&nbsp; Consequently, Byrd cannot demonstrate that the two-month delay\r\neffected a taking.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe evidence presented demonstrates\r\nthat no material issue of fact exists and that the City is entitled to judgment\r\nas a matter of law.&nbsp; Byrd cannot demonstrate that the City inversely\r\ncondemned his property through regulatory delay.&nbsp; Accordingly, the grant of\r\nsummary judgment for the City is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: &nbsp;I\r\nrespectfully dissent. &nbsp;The majority asserts that the City acted reasonably\r\nin delaying Appellantâ€™s investment-backed zoning request for a period totaling\r\neleven months.&nbsp; I disagree.\r\nBoth the Fifth and Fourteenth\r\nAmendments to the United States Constitution recognize that the government has\r\nthe authority to interfere with a private citizenâ€™s property rights to promote\r\nthe common good. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994)\r\n(recognizing the governmentâ€™s powers of eminent domain).&nbsp; However, when\r\nthe government interferes with a private citizenâ€™s property rights and this\r\ninterference is not related to any legitimate public interest, the government\r\nhas acted beyond the scope of its authority. Lucas v. South\r\nCarolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S.  1003, 1016 (1980).\r\nIn my opinion, the Cityâ€™s decision\r\nto delay the landâ€™s rezoning was ultra vires and unreasonable.&nbsp;\r\nThe record indicates that rezoning the land for commercial purposes would not\r\nhave affected the NHL status of the land.&nbsp; In addition, the City had ample\r\nopportunity to determine that rezoning the land would not have affected the landâ€™s\r\nNHL status.&nbsp;\r\nThe majority focuses on the Cityâ€™s\r\nconcern that the rezoning would likely cause the land to lose its NHL\r\nstatus.&nbsp; In my opinion, under the facts of this case, eleven months was\r\nmore than enough time for the City to investigate and determine whether it had a\r\nlegitimate public interest in delaying rezoning.&nbsp; In my view, according to\r\nthe facts of this case and the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in Penn\r\nCent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), Appellant is\r\nentitled to just compensation for the temporary, regulatory taking of his\r\nland.&nbsp; I would therefore reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision and award\r\nreasonable compensation accordingly.\r\n\r\n[1] The National Park Service, a division of the United States\r\nDepartment of the Interior, has authority over NHL designations.\r\n[2] According to the unsworn statements of two employees of the\r\nNational Park Service, NHL status does not prohibit the property owner from\r\ndeveloping the property, but the service might remove the designation if\r\ndevelopment changes â€œthe integrity of the designation.â€&nbsp; These\r\nemployees also stated that the National Park Service might assist a property\r\nowner who wants to retain NHL status and also improve his property.&nbsp; The\r\nparties stipulated that these unsworn statements would be admissible at a trial\r\nof this case.\r\n[3] The flags stated: â€œNâ€™tl Park Ser. Ord/No Per Or Deeds Issued.â€&nbsp;\r\n[4] The County settled with Byrd.\r\n[5] The circuit court relied on the provision that a â€œgovernmental\r\nentity is not liable for loss resulting from: employee conduct â€¦ which\r\nconstitutes â€¦ intent to harm â€¦.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(17)\r\n(Supp. 2003).\r\n[6] The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution provides â€œnor shall private property be taken for public use,\r\nwithout just compensation.â€&nbsp; U.S. Const. amend.

Const. art. I, Â§ 13.&nbsp; Takings\r\nanalysis under South Carolina law is the same as the analysis under federal\r\nlaw.&nbsp; Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v.

Â§Â§ 28-2-10 through\r\n28-2-510 (1991 and Supp. 2004).\r\n[8] It was less than all use because Byrd was able, and periodically\r\ndid, farm his property throughout the delay.&nbsp; This use was permitted\r\nbecause the land was then zoned for agricultural use.&nbsp;\r\n[9] Agins was decided two years after Penn Central, and\r\nthe Agins Court used different language to\r\ndescribe the takings test.&nbsp; The Court held that a taking was effected if:\r\n(1) a legitimate state interest was not substantially advanced; or (2) the\r\nlandowner was denied economically viable use of his or her property.&nbsp; Agins,\r\n447 U.S.  at 260, 100 S.\r\nCt. at 2141, 65 L. Ed. 2d at 112.\r\nAfter Agins was decided, some\r\ncourts separately applied Penn Central and Agins to determine\r\nwhether a taking had occurred.&nbsp; See, e.g., Main v. Thomason,\r\n342 S.C. 79, 88, 535 S.E.2d 918, 922 (2000) (stating that federal courts use Penn\r\nCentral, while the â€œSouth Carolinaâ€ test is Agins, and applying\r\nthe two separately) (subsequent history omitted); Westside Quik Shop, Inc.,\r\n341 S.C. at 305-06, 534 S.E.2d at 274 (applying the two separately).&nbsp; Other\r\ncourts found that the tests were essentially the same and made only one\r\ninquiry.&nbsp; See, e.g., Santini v. Conn. Hazardous Waste Mgmt. Serv.,\r\n342 F.3d 118, 132 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting that â€œAgins is easily\r\nreconciled with Penn Centralâ€), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 104,\r\n160 L. Ed. 2d 126 (2004).&nbsp; As noted above, the United States Supreme Court\r\nhas now overruled Agins and clarified that Penn Central is the\r\ntest to be applied when no per se taking is involved.&nbsp; Lingle v.\r\nChevron U.S.A.,\r\nInc., No. 04-163 (decided May 23, 2005), 73 USLW 4343, 2005 WL 1200710.\r\n[10] There is an exception: the government need not compensate for a\r\ntotal economic loss if â€œthe proscribed use interests were not part of [the\r\nownerâ€™s] title to begin with.â€&nbsp; Lucas, 505 U.S.  at 1027, 112 S. Ct. at\r\n2899, 120 L. Ed. 2d at 820; see also Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council,\r\n309 S.C. 424, 424 S.E.2d 484 (1992) (finding on remand that the exception did\r\nnot apply to the case).\r\n[11] We overrule our prior suggestions that a property owner cannot\r\ndemonstrate a taking unless he has been denied all economically viable use of\r\nhis property.&nbsp; See Glover v. County of Charleston 361 S.C.\r\n634, 640, 606 S.E.2d 773, 777 (2004) (holding that the property owners involved\r\ncould not demonstrate a taking because they had not been, â€œeven temporarily,\r\ndenied all economically viable use of their landâ€); Greenville County v.\r\nKenwood Enterprises, Inc., 353 S.C. 157, 176, 577 S.E.2d 428, 438 (2003)\r\n(holding that that there was no taking because the property owner had not been\r\ndeprived of â€œall economically viable use of its landâ€).&nbsp; Nevertheless,\r\nthe results reached in these cases were correct.&nbsp;\r\n[12] We can thus immediately dispose of Byrdâ€™s claim that a taking\r\ncommenced when the petition to rezone the Small Parcel was filed.\r\n[13] The City argues that under the parcel-as-a-whole doctrine, the\r\nCourt should treat the City Tract and the portion of Byrdâ€™s property in the\r\nCounty as one tract because the two were contiguous.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nThe City had no jurisdiction over the property in the County.&nbsp;\r\n[14] In fact, preserving landmark status was the interest involved in Penn\r\nCentral, and the landowners did not challenge the legitimacy of the\r\ninterest.&nbsp; 438 U.S.  at\r\n128-29, 98 S. Ct. at 2661-62, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 651-52.\r\n[15] The dissent raises valid concerns regarding government\r\ninterference with private property that is related to no legitimate\r\ninterest.&nbsp; In our view, however, preserving the NHL designation was a\r\nlegitimate interest.&nbsp; Further, a careful review of the record reveals that\r\nByrd has presented no evidence that at any point during the eleven-month delay,\r\nthe Cityâ€™s fear of losing the NHL designation was unreasonable.&nbsp; In fact,\r\nthe only evidence in the record is to the contrary.&nbsp;\r\nIn addition, contrary to Byrdâ€™s\r\nclaim, there is no evidence that the delay was the result of bad faith on the\r\npart of the City.&nbsp; See, e.g., Bass Enter. Prod. Co. v. United\r\nStates, 381 F.3d 1360&nbsp; (Fed. Cir. 2004) (noting\r\nthat a relevant consideration under Penn Central is whether the\r\ngovernment has acted in bad faith).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[16] The dissent focuses on the duration of the delay without\r\nconsidering the economic impact, as required under Penn Central.&nbsp; As\r\nexplained above, the duration of the delay is not determinative.&nbsp; Tahoe-Sierra,\r\n535 U.S.  at 342, 122 S.

Tinkler, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n        Jon A. Mersereau, of Charleston, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: At issue\r\nin this case is whether Appellant Sean Callen (Sean) and Respondent Page Durkee\r\nCallen (Page) entered into a common-law marriage.&nbsp; Page filed an action for\r\ndivorce, and Sean answered that the parties were never married.&nbsp; The family\r\ncourt bifurcated the case and held a hearing to determine whether a common-law\r\nmarriage existed.&nbsp; The court ruled that there was a marriage and, further,\r\nthat Page was entitled to attorney fees.&nbsp; Sean appealed, and we certified\r\nthe case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.&nbsp; We reverse the family courtâ€™s\r\ndecision and remand the case for a new hearing.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nSean and Pageâ€™s relationship began\r\nin Florida when the parties were in college, about fifteen years before\r\nPage brought the divorce action.&nbsp; During the relationship, Sean and Page\r\nhad two children.&nbsp; The first was born at a fairly early point in the\r\nrelationship, and the second was born five years later.\r\nAccording to Page, the parties\r\nconsidered themselves married almost from the beginning.&nbsp; Sean denies that\r\nthey ever did.&nbsp; According to Sean, the relationship was purely sexual until\r\nthey conceived their first child.&nbsp; He says that thereafter, sharing\r\nchildren was the only reason that the parties maintained any relationship.\r\nThroughout the course of the\r\nrelationship, Sean lived in various jurisdictions, including Florida, New York, Massachusetts, and Ireland.&nbsp; Page claims that she lived with\r\nSean in all of these places.&nbsp; Sean says that he lived alone in each and\r\nthat Page just visited him from time to time. &nbsp;\r\nEventually, Sean purchased a\r\nresidence in Savannah, Georgia.&nbsp;\r\nPage asserts that Sean did this so that he had a place to stay when he was\r\nworking there. &nbsp;According to Page, Sean was actually residing with her and\r\nthe children in Florida.&nbsp;\r\nConversely, Sean argues that his residence in Savannah was\r\npermanent and that he never lived with Page and the children in Florida.\r\nIn August 2000, Page and the\r\nchildren moved from Florida to Charleston.&nbsp;\r\nPage claims that Sean moved to Charleston with them and that they lived together\r\nthere as a family.&nbsp; Sean denies this, saying that he maintained his\r\nresidence in Savannah and that any time spent in Charleston was for visiting his children.\r\nThe family court ruled that Sean and\r\nPage had a common-law marriage, meaning that Page could proceed with the divorce\r\naction.&nbsp; The family court also ordered Sean to pay Page $113,405.98 as\r\nattorney fees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whether the family court erred\r\n    in finding that Sean and Page entered into a common-law marriage.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Whether the family court erred\r\n    in admitting the testimony of witnesses\r\n    whose names were not disclosed in answers to interrogatories.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Whether the family court erred\r\n    in awarding attorney fees to Page.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWhether a common-law marriage exists\r\nis a question of law.&nbsp; Campbell\r\nv. Christian, 235 S.C. 102, 104, 110 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1959).&nbsp; The proponent\r\nof the alleged marriage has the burden of proving the elements by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Ex parte Blizzard, 185 S.C. 131,\r\n133, 193 S.E. 633, 634 (1937).&nbsp; The trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will\r\nbe upheld if they are supported by any evidence in the record.&nbsp; Pittman\r\nv. Lowther, 363 S.C. 47, 50, 610 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2005) (stating that in law\r\nactions tried without a jury, the factual findings of the trial judge are to be\r\nupheld if supported by any evidence).&nbsp; In this case we do not address the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence, because the family courtâ€™s findings of fact are\r\nso tainted by errors of law as to require us to reverse the courtâ€™s decision\r\nand remand the case for a new hearing. &nbsp;\r\nI.&nbsp; Common-Law Marriage\r\nThe family court failed to apply the\r\nproper standard for determining whether Sean and Page entered into a common-law\r\nmarriage.\r\nA common-law marriage is formed when\r\ntwo parties contract to be married.&nbsp; Johnson v. Johnson, 235 S.C.\r\n542, 550, 112 S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960).&nbsp; No express contract is necessary;\r\nthe agreement may be inferred from the circumstances.&nbsp; Id.; Kirby v. Kirby, 270 S.C. 137, 140, 241 S.E.2d 415,\r\n416 (1978).&nbsp; The fact finder is to look for mutual assent: the intent of\r\neach party to be married to the other and a mutual understanding of each partyâ€™s\r\nintent.&nbsp; Consideration is the participation in the marriage.&nbsp; If these\r\nfactual elements are present, then the court should find as a matter of law that\r\na common-law marriage exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFurther, when the proponent proves\r\nthat the parties participated in â€œapparently matrimonialâ€ cohabitation, and\r\nthat while cohabiting the parties had a reputation in the community as being\r\nmarried, a rebuttable presumption arises that a common-law marriage was\r\ncreated.&nbsp; Jeanes v. Jeanes, 255 S.C. 161, 166-67, 177 S.E.2d 537,\r\n539-40 (1970).&nbsp; This presumption may be overcome by â€œstrong, cogentâ€\r\nevidence that the parties in fact never agreed to marry.&nbsp; Jeanes,\r\n255 S.C. at 167, 177 S.E.2d at 540.&nbsp;\r\nWhen, however, there is an\r\nimpediment to marriage, such as one partyâ€™s existing marriage to a third\r\nperson, no common-law marriage may be formed, regardless whether mutual assent\r\nis present.&nbsp; Further, after the impediment is removed, the relationship is\r\nnot automatically transformed into a common-law marriage.&nbsp; Instead, it is\r\npresumed that relationship remains non-marital.&nbsp; For the relationship to\r\nbecome marital, â€œthere must be a new mutual agreement either by way of civil\r\nceremony or by way of recognition of the illicit relation and a new agreement to\r\nenter into a common law marriage.â€&nbsp; Kirby, 270 S.C. at 141, 241\r\nS.E.2d at 416 (citing Byers v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 268 S.C. 68, 231\r\nS.E.2d 699 (1977)); see also Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 201-03,\r\n420 S.E.2d 856, 858-59 (Ct. App. 1992) (involving the impediment of one partyâ€™s\r\nmarriage to a third person); Bochette v. Bochette, 300 S.C. 109, 111-12,\r\n386 S.E.2d 475, 476-77 (Ct. App. 1989) (same); Prevatte v. Prevatte, 297\r\nS.C. 345, 348-49, 377 S.E.2d 114, 116-17 (Ct. App. 1989) (same);[1] Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 280 S.C. 546,\r\n551-52, 314 S.E.2d 16, 18-19 (Ct. App. 1984) (same).\r\nEven assuming, as Page urges, that\r\nthe parties lived together in Florida, New York, Massachusetts, and Ireland, and\r\nfurther assuming that they moved together from Florida to South Carolina in\r\nAugust 2000,[2] no common-law\r\nmarriage could have been formed, if at all, until after the move.&nbsp; Since\r\nnone of those other jurisdictions sanctions common-law marriages, there was an\r\nimpediment to marriage until the parties took residency here.&nbsp; It must be\r\npresumed that Sean and Pageâ€™s relationship remained non-marital after the\r\nmove, after the impediment disappeared.&nbsp; See Kirby, 270 S.C.\r\nat 141, 241 S.E.2d at 416.&nbsp; Consequently, Page has the burden of proving\r\nthat the parties entered into a marital agreement after moving to South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; See Kirby, 270 S.C. at 141, 241 S.E.2d at\r\n416.&nbsp;\r\nThe family court did not place this\r\nburden on Page, however, because the court failed to recognize the impediment to\r\nmarriage.&nbsp; Instead, the family court considered Page and Seanâ€™s\r\nrelationship in its entirety, relying heavily on the partiesâ€™ conduct prior to\r\ncoming to South Carolina.&nbsp; This\r\nconstitutes reversible error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn addition, the family court\r\nmisapprehended the meaning of intent to marry.&nbsp; The family courtâ€™s order\r\nincludes the following passage:\r\n\r\n  Analysis of the intent to be\r\n  married is a separate consideration from the actual understanding from the parties regarding a legally binding marital relationship.&nbsp; Otherwise, we would not have the\r\n  rich history of South\r\n  Carolina common law marriage law.&nbsp; I\r\n  find the Callensâ€™ intent to be as a married couple clear, even though they may not have understood the equences of their intentions and actions. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe family court cited no authority\r\nfor this proposition, and the proposition is irreconcilable with\r\nprecedent.&nbsp;\r\nA party need not understand every\r\nnuance of marriage or divorce law, but he must at least know that his actions\r\nwill render him married as that word is commonly understood.&nbsp; If a party\r\ndoes not comprehend that his â€œintentions and actionsâ€ will bind him in a â€œlegally\r\nbinding marital relationship,â€ then he lacks intent to be married.&nbsp; A\r\nlack of intent to be married overrides the presumption of marriage that arises\r\nfrom cohabitation and reputation.&nbsp; South\r\nCarolina does not impose marriage upon a couple merely because they intend to be\r\ntogether forever.&nbsp; See Jennings\r\nv. Hurt, 554 N.Y.S.2d 220, 220 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1990)\r\n(applying South Carolina law and\r\nnoting that â€œ[o]ne cannot be married unwittingly or accidentallyâ€)\r\n(quotation omitted).&nbsp; Like the failure to recognize the impediment to\r\nmarriage, the family courtâ€™s definition of â€œintent to marryâ€ constitutes\r\nreversible error.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Admission of Testimony\r\nThe family court also committed\r\nreversible error in admitting the testimony of three witnesses. &nbsp;At the\r\nhearing, Sean objected to the admission of the testimony of these witnesses on\r\nthe ground that each came as a surprise.&nbsp; Sean argued that none of the\r\nwitnessesâ€™ names had been timely disclosed in answers to interrogatories and\r\nthat he therefore had insufficient time to depose any of them.&nbsp; Page had no\r\nexplanation for the failure to reveal these witnesses sooner.&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, the family court overruled Seanâ€™s objection.&nbsp; The court\r\nruled that because there existed no pre-trial order which provided a specific\r\ndate by which the parties had to disclose witnesses, the court had no discretion\r\nand had to admit the testimony.&nbsp; This was error.\r\nA â€œtrial court is under a duty,\r\nwhen the situation arises, to delay the trial for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nthe type of witness involved and the content of his evidence, the nature of the\r\nfailure or neglect or refusal to furnish the witnessâ€™ name, and the degree of\r\nsurprise to the other party, including prior knowledge of the name by said\r\nparty.â€&nbsp; Laney v. Hefley, 262 S.C. 54, 59-60, 202 S.E.2d 12, 14\r\n(1974) (quoting with approval Wright v. Royse, 43 Ill. App. 2d. 267, 193 N.E.2d 340 (1963)).&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court is under such a duty regardless whether the proponent of the\r\ntestimony is allegedly in violation of a pre-trial order or a court rule.&nbsp; Jumper\r\nv. Hawkins, 348 S.C. 142, 150, 558 S.E.2d 911, 915-16 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp;\r\nAfter inquiring, the court has discretion whether to admit or exclude the\r\ntestimony.&nbsp;\r\nHere, there was no pre-trial order,\r\nbut Page allegedly violated Rules 26(e) and 33(b) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure[3] by failing to\r\nsupplement her answers to interrogatories in a timely fashion.&nbsp; After Sean\r\nobjected to the admission of the testimonies at issue, the family courtâ€™s duty\r\nto inquire arose. &nbsp;The family court failed to make the inquiry required\r\nunder Laney and Jumper and therefore failed to exercise its\r\ndiscretion.&nbsp; â€œWhen the trial judge is vested with discretion, but his\r\nruling reveals no discretion was, in fact, exercised, an error of law has\r\noccurred.â€&nbsp; Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565,\r\n566 (1987); see also In re Robert M., 294 S.C. 69, 70-71, 362\r\nS.E.2d 639, 640-41 (1987); State v. Smith, 276 S.C. 494, 498, 280 S.E.2d\r\n200, 202 (1981).&nbsp; Sean was prejudiced by the family courtâ€™s ruling,\r\nrequiring reversal and a new hearing.&nbsp; We do not mean to imply that the\r\nfamily court is precluded from admitting the same testimony at the new\r\nhearing.&nbsp; We hold only that the courtâ€™s failure to exercise discretion\r\nbelow requires the new hearing. &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorney Fees&nbsp;\r\nAs stated above, the family court\r\nordered Sean to pay Pageâ€™s attorney fees, $113,405.98.&nbsp; One basis for the\r\naward was the beneficial result achieved by Pageâ€™s attorneys.&nbsp; Because we\r\nreverse the finding of a common-law marriage, we also reverse the award of\r\nattorney fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court failed to apply the\r\nproper standard for determining whether Sean and Page entered into a common-law\r\nmarriage.&nbsp; The court also committed reversible error in admitting the\r\ntestimonies of allegedly surprise witnesses without first making the required\r\ninquiry and exercising discretion.&nbsp; Consequently, the family courtâ€™s\r\nfinding a common-law marriage and awarding attorney fees to Page are reversed\r\nand the case is remanded for a new hearing.&nbsp;\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:&nbsp; I\r\nrespectfully dissent.&nbsp; In my view, Sean and Page entered into a common-law\r\nmarriage.&nbsp; Therefore, I would affirm the family courtâ€™s decision.\r\nIn my view, the majority\r\nmisconstrues the law to the extent that the majority views the fact that the\r\ncouple lived outside of South Carolina as an impediment to\r\nmarriage.&nbsp; The prohibition of common-law marriage in other jurisdictions\r\ndoes not prevent a South Carolina court from recognizing the\r\nmarriage when the couple moves to this state.&nbsp; In my opinion, a marriage\r\nthat may be invalid in the state where the parties contracted the marriage,\r\nwould be valid in South Carolina if the marriage otherwise comports\r\nwith our stateâ€™s marriage laws.&nbsp; See Estate of Murnion, 686 P.2d\r\n893, 899 (Mont. 1984) (holding that a marriage that may be\r\ninvalid where contracted will be recognized under Montana\r\nlaw if the marriage does not conflict with Montana\r\nlaw).\r\nFurther, the majority ignores the\r\nproper standard of review in this case.&nbsp; The issue whether a couple is\r\ncommon-law married is a question of law.&nbsp; Tarnowski v. Lieberman, 348 S.C.\r\n616, 619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; Therefore, our review in\r\nthis case is limited to a determination of whether there is any evidence to\r\nsupport the trial judgeâ€™s findings.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe question is not what conclusion this Court would have reached after\r\nreviewing the facts, but whether the facts as found by the family court are\r\nsupported by the evidence.&nbsp; Id.\r\nIn the present case, the family\r\ncourt found that a common-law marriage existed.&nbsp; The family court relied on\r\nevidence that the couple had cohabited for several years over the course of the\r\nrelationship, most recently in South Carolina.&nbsp; The family court also found that the couple\r\nheld themselves out to the community as husband and wife.&nbsp; In fact, Sean\r\nknew that Page used the name Callen for many years, he did not object.\r\nTherefore in my opinion, there is\r\nevidence in the record supporting the family courtâ€™s findings.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, I would uphold the family courtâ€™s ruling finding that a\r\ncommon-law marriage existed.\r\n\r\n[1] In Prevatte, the Court of Appeals raised the split of\r\nauthority â€œas to whether the parties must have knowledge that the impediment\r\nhas been removed.â€&nbsp; 297 S.C. at 349, 377 S.E.2d at 117 (citations\r\nomitted).&nbsp; The court decided that it need not resolve the issue because the\r\nparties there were aware of the impediment and its removal.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The issue becomes important in\r\ncases in which the parties are aware of the impediment but not its\r\nremoval.&nbsp; The determination that must be made there is whether the parties\r\ntruly intended to enter into a valid marriage. We need not resolve the issue\r\nhere, because Page admits that she was never aware of the impediment in the\r\nfirst place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[2] As explained above, we do not comment on the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence to support the family courtâ€™s findings of fact.&nbsp;\r\n[3] Rules 26(e) and 33(b), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Peter L.

(Contractor) covered damage caused by the faulty workmanship of Contractor and its subcontractors on a road construction project.Â  We granted certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, which held that damage to the roadway constituted an â€œoccurrenceâ€ and policy exclusions did not apply.Â  L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 549, 567 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  We withdraw our prior opinion on this matter and substitute it with this opinion.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Dunes West Joint Venture (Developer) hired Contractor to perform site-development work and build roads for the Dunes West subdivision.Â  Contractor, in turn, hired subcontractors to perform most of the work.Â  In 1990, the project was completed, and by 1994, the roads had deteriorated.Â  Because of the deterioration of the roads, Developer brought the underlying action against Contractor for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence.Â  \r\nIn 1997, the underlying lawsuit settled for $750,000.Â  After settlement, Contractor sought indemnification from Bituminous and the three other insurers (Respondents).[1]Â  Respondents contributed $362,500 to the settlement amount, but Bituminous refused to indemnify Contractor.[2]\r\nConsequently, Respondents brought a declaratory judgment action against Bituminous seeking contribution and indemnification for all defense costs.Â  The circuit court referred the action to a special master, who found that the damage to the roadway system was covered under the Bituminous CGL policy.Â  More specifically, the special master found that the damage constituted an â€œoccurrence,â€ and the â€œexpected or intendedâ€ and â€œyour workâ€ exclusions did not apply to work performed by subcontractors.Â  Finally, the special master found that the CGL â€œpolicy yearsâ€ ran from 1989 to 1996, and because Bituminousâ€™s policy covered the two-year period from 1990 to 1992, Bituminous owed the other carriers a two-year contribution valued at $103,571.42.\r\nBituminous appealed and the court of appeals affirmed, finding that the property damage constituted an â€œoccurrenceâ€ and that the policy exclusions did not apply.Â  L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 549, 567 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  After granting certiorari, we reversed, holding that the CGL policy did not cover damage caused by faulty workmanship.Â  L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire and Marine Ins. Co., Op. No. 25854 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 9, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 55).\r\nOn rehearing, we now consider the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in finding that the road deterioration constituted an &ldquo;occurrence&rdquo; as defined by the CGL insurance policy?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in finding that the road deterioration was, from the Contractor&rsquo;s perspective, neither expected nor intended?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in finding that the &ldquo;your work&rdquo; exclusion restored coverage?\r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nBecause this is an action at law, the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless there is no evidence to reasonably support the trial judgeâ€™s conclusions.Â  Townes Assoc. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\n  Law/Analysis\r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œOccurrenceâ€\r\n    \r\n\r\nBituminous asserts that the court of appeals erred in finding that the road deterioration constituted an â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the CGL policy.Â  We agree.\r\nThe issue of whether property damage to the work product alone, caused by faulty workmanship, constitutes an occurrence is a question of first impression in South Carolina.Â  A majority of other jurisdictions deciding this issue have held that faulty workmanship standing alone, resulting in damage only to the work product itself, does not constitute an occurrence under a CGL policy.Â  See, e.g., Pursell Constr., Inc. v. Hawkeye-Security Ins. Co., 596 N.W.2d 67, 71 (Iowa 1999); Amerisure, Inc. v. Wurster Constr. Co., Inc., 818 N.E.2d 998, 1004 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004) (holding that faulty workmanship is not an accident and therefore not an occurrence); Helie v. Herrmann, 736 N.E.2d 566, 568 (Ohio Ct. App. 1999) (holding that faulty workmanship does not constitute an occurrence when the damage is to the work product only); Monticello Ins. Co. v. Wilfredâ€™s Constr., 661 N.E.2d 451, 456 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996) (finding that improper construction by a contractor and its subcontractors does not constitute an occurrence when the improper construction leads to defects).[3]\r\nAlthough our courts have not addressed the specific issue of whether faulty workmanship constitutes an occurrence, we have addressed the issue of whether CGL policies are intended to cover faulty workmanship.Â  For example, this Court has held that a CGL policy is not intended to cover economic loss resulting from faulty workmanship.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 563-64, 561 S.E.2d 355, 357 (2002).Â  Moreover, our court of appeals has held that any liability that is incurred because of faulty workmanship is part of the insuredâ€™s contractual liability, not an insurable event under a CGL policy.Â  Isle of Palms Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 12, 16, 459 S.E.2d 318, 320 (Ct. App. 1995); see also C.D. Walters Constr. Co., Inc. v. Firemanâ€™s Ins. Co. of Newark, 281 S.C. 593, 596-97, 316 S.E.2d 709, 711 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding that faulty workmanship is a business risk that is not intended to be covered by a CGL policy).Â  \r\nIn the present case, Bituminousâ€™s CGL policy, subject to certain exclusions, provides:\r\n\r\n  We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ to which this insurance appliesâ€¦. \r\n  This insurance applies to â€œbodily injuryâ€ and â€œproperty damageâ€ only if:\r\n  (1)Â Â Â Â  The â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ is caused by an â€œoccurrenceâ€ that takes place in the â€œcoverage territory.â€\r\n\r\nThe policy defines â€œoccurrenceâ€ as â€œan accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.â€\r\nFour years after Contractor completed construction of the Dunes West road system, the roads began to deteriorate, showing many signs of â€œalligator cracking,â€ a form of cracking in asphalt that looks like alligator skin.Â  Two expert witnesses testified in deposition as to the cause of the damage.Â  The first deponent, Kenneth Humphries, testified that approximately 50% of the cracking was caused by insufficient road subgrade preparation, which was caused by Contractorâ€™s failure to properly (1) remove tree stumps from the subgrade and (2) compact the soft, wet clay in the subgrade.Â  Humphries also opined that the cracking was caused by insufficiently thick road course, improper drainage, and excessive traffic.Â  The second deponent, L.G. Lewis, testified that the primary cause of the cracking was improper drainage.Â  Other causes, according to Lewis, included an inadequate â€œedge of curb detail and the increased frequency of heavy wheel loads on the pavement.â€\r\nAlthough the alligator cracking may have constituted property damage, we find that an â€œoccurrence,â€ as defined under the CGL policy did not take place.Â  According to the deposition testimony outlined above, the only â€œoccurrencesâ€ were various negligent acts by Contractor during road design, preparation, and construction, which led to the premature deterioration of the roads.Â  Those negligent acts included: (1) failure to prepare the subgrade by deciding not to remove the tree stumps and by failing to remove or compact the wet clay in the subgrade; (2) improperly designed drainage system; (3) ill-prepared, thin road course that could not handle heavy-wheel loads; and (4) improperly designed curb-edge detail.Â  \r\nWe find these negligent acts constitute faulty workmanship, which damaged the roadway system only.Â  And because faulty workmanship is not something that is typically caused by an accident or by exposure to the same general harmful conditions, we hold that the damage in this case did not constitute an occurrence.[4]Â  We find the analysis used by the New Hampshire Supreme Court helpful in distinguishing between a claim for faulty workmanship versus a claim for damage to the work product caused by the negligence of a third party.Â  High Country Assocs. v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., 648 A.2d 474 (N.H. 1994).Â  In High Country Assocs., the court held that a CGL provided coverage for property damage caused by continuous exposure to moisture when the complaint alleged negligent construction that resulted in property damage and not merely negligent construction damaging only the work product itself.Â  Id. at 477.Â  The complaint in High Country Assocs. alleged:\r\n\r\n  [a]ctual damage to the buildings caused by exposure to water seeping into the walls that resulted from the negligent construction methods of High Country Associates.Â  The damages claimed are for the water-damaged walls, not the diminution in value or cost of repairing work of inferior quality.Â  Therefore, the property damage described in the amended writ, caused by continuous exposure to moisture through leaky walls, is not simply a claim for the contractorâ€™s defective work.\r\n\r\nId.Â  As a result, the court held that the plaintiffsâ€™ alleged negligent construction was the result of an occurrence, rather than an allegation of faulty or defective work.Â  Id. at 478.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn the present case, the complaint did not allege property damage beyond the improper performance of the task itself.Â  The complaint alleged breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence.Â  However, each of the claims repeated verbatim the same allegation - faulty workmanship in completing the project.Â  As a result, the insurance policy will not stand to cover liability for the Contractorâ€™s contract liability for a claim that was for money damages to compensate for the defective work.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the damage in the present case did not constitute an â€œoccurrence.â€Â  If we were to hold otherwise, the CGL policy would be more like a performance bond, which guarantees the work, rather than like an insurance policy, which is intended to insure against accidents.Â  See State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Tillerson, 777 N.E.2d 986, 991 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001) (holding that if courts were to find that CGL policies covered faulty workmanship, courts would effectively transforming CGL policies into performance bonds).Â  A performance bond guarantees that the work will be performed according to the specifications of the contract by providing a surety to stand in the place of the contractor should the contractor be unable to perform as required under the contract.Â  Consequently, our holding today ensures that ultimate liability falls to the one who performed the negligent work - the subcontractor - instead of the insurance carrier.Â  It will also encourage contractors to choose their subcontractors more carefully instead of having to seek indemnification from the subcontractors after their work fails to meet the requirements of the contract.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the reasoning set forth above, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and hold that the damage to the Dunes West roadway system is not covered under Bituminousâ€™s CGL policy.Â  Therefore, Bituminous is not required to indemnify Contractor.Â  Because we find that the faulty workmanship does not constitute an â€œoccurrence,â€ we do not address Issues II and III to determine whether the policy exclusions apply.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Other providers included Transcontinental Insurance Company, The Home Indemnity Company, and The Maryland Commercial Insurance Group.\r\n[2] From 1989 to 1996, Contractor was insured under various policies.Â  Bituminous issued Contractor a CGL policy covering the period from 1990 to 1992.\r\n[3] In addition to the authority cited, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and North Carolina have reported cases which hold that a CGL does not provide coverage for faulty workmanship where the property damage is to the work product only.Â  Several different approaches are used in analyzing the issue, but a majority of the states reach the same conclusion - a CGL policy does not cover faulty workmanship.Â  However, there are several jurisdictions, including Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin, that have found CGL policies to be ambiguous and construed the ambiguity against the drafter.Â  See e.g., Wanzek Constr., Inc. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 679 N.W.2d 322, 329 (Minn. 2004) (holding the term subcontractor to be ambiguous and construing the ambiguity in favor of coverage).Â Â  \r\n[4] The CGL policy may, however, provide coverage in cases where faulty workmanship causes a third party bodily injury or damage to other property, not in cases where faulty workmanship damages the work product alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26042","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey A. Jacobs, and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  This matter was certified to this Court from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.Â  Freiburger was convicted of the 1961 murder of a Columbia taxi-cab driver.Â  He was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victim in this case, John Orner, was a taxi-cab driver who regularly serviced soldiers at Fort Jackson in Columbia.Â  Orner received his last dispatch call at 11:15 p.m. on the evening of February 28, 1961 to go to the NCO club at the fort.Â  When he did not return home from his shift the next morning, his family reported him missing.Â  Ornerâ€™s bloody cab was found around 7:30 a.m. on March 1, 1961, in the 1200 block of Assembly Street.Â  Orner was not in the cab.Â  His body was found on March 3, 1961, on the side of the road of Highway 601 in lower Richland County.Â  He had died from a gunshot wound to the brain, consistent with having been shot in the head by a passenger sitting in the back seat of the cab.Â  Forensics examinations revealed Orner had been killed by a gunshot wound from a .32 caliber bullet fired from a Harrington and Richardson (H &amp; R) revolver.Â  \r\nFreiburger was a private in the army stationed at Fort Jackson in 1961.Â  Pawn shop records revealed that on February 28, 1961, Freiburger purchased a .32 caliber H&amp;R revolver, serial number 9948, from Capital Loan and Pawn Shop at 1214 Main Street.Â  A month later, on March 29, 1961, Freiburger was stopped by a Tennessee Highway patrolman, Donald Meredith, at approximately 11:00 p.m. for hitchhiking in Newport, Tennessee.Â  Meredith testified he stopped Freiburger because it was dangerous to be out walking or hitchhiking on the road as people had been struck by cars in the vicinity.Â  Patrolman Meredith questioned Freiburger, then patted him down, discovering a .32 caliber loaded H&amp;R revolver, serial number W9948.Â  Meredith testified that, although Freiburger was not under arrest at the time of the pat down search, â€œhe was going to be for hitchhiking, or I was going to take him back to the jail.â€Â  Upon finding the weapon, Meredith arrested Freiburger for â€œcarrying arms,â€ and the gun was confiscated.Â  \r\nAfter Freiburgerâ€™s arrest, Richland County authorities (investigating Ornerâ€™s murder) requested and were given the H&amp;R revolver seized by Patrolman Meredith.Â  Testing on the weapon was inconclusive as to whether it was the weapon used in Ornerâ€™s death.Â  No charges were filed at that time.Â  Forty years later, in August 2000, the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department reopened the Orner file.Â  Re-testing of the gun and bullet fragments was initially inconclusive.Â  However, SLED retained an independent expert, John Cayton, who concluded the weapon retrieved from Freiburger in 1961 was the murder weapon.Â  Freiburger was arrested and charged with murder.Â  The jury convicted him, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n     Did the trial court properly admit the gun taken from Freiburger during the 1961 search in Tennessee?\r\n     Did the trial court err in denying Freiburgerâ€™s motion to suppress the gun due to the Stateâ€™s failure to prove a sufficient chain of custody?\r\n     Did the trial court err in admitting certain pawnshop records under the Ancient Documents and Business Records as Evidence Act?Â  \r\n     Did the trial court err in admitting evidence that Freiburger was at one time stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas?\r\n     Did the court err in denying Freiburgerâ€™s motion for a mistrial and/or for curative instructions as a result of the solicitorâ€™s improper comments during opening argument?\r\n     Did the court err in denying Freiburgerâ€™s motion for a directed verdict?\r\n  \r\n\r\n1.Â  1961 SEARCH AND SEIZURE\r\nFreiburger asserts the 1961 search and seizure of the H&amp;R weapon was illegal, having exceeded the permissible scope of a Terry[1] search.Â  The State contends the search was a lawful â€œsearch incident to arrest,â€ such that the seizure was permissible.Â  We agree with the State that the 1961 search of Freiburger was a lawful search incident to arrest.\r\nEvidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial.Â  State v. Khinggratasiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 572 S.E.2d 456 (2002), citing Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).Â  Generally, a warrantless search is per se unreasonable and violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 462 S.E.2d 279 (1995). However, a warrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search falls within one of several well recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.Â  Id.Â  One such exception is in cases of a search incident to arrest.Â  State v. Ferrell, 274 S.C. 401, 409, 266 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1980) (in the case of a lawful custodial arrest, the full search of a person does not require a search warrant and is considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment). Â The burden of establishing probable cause and the existence of circumstances constituting an exception to the general prohibition against warrantless searches is upon the prosecution.Â  Dupree, supra; State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 457 S.E.2d 616 (Ct.App.1995) (burden is upon State to justify warrantless search).\r\nThere are two historical rationales for the â€œsearch incident to arrestâ€ exception to the warrant requirement:Â  (1) the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2) the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial.Â  Knowles v. Ohio, 525 U.S. 113, 116 (1998).Â  A search may be conducted incident to an arrest only if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest.Â  State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 347 S.E.2d 882 (1986).Â  A warrantless search which precedes a formal arrest is valid if the arrest quickly follows.Â  State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 551, 451 S.E.2d 34, 37 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  See also Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 2564, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980)(search may precede a formal arrest if the officer has probable cause to arrest at the time of the search and the fruits of the search were not necessary to support probable cause to arrest).\r\nAs noted above, there are situations in which a warrantless search which immediately precedes an arrest is held lawful, in cases where the police officer is held to have had probable cause from the outset.Â  Moultrie, supra; Rawlings v. Kentucky.Â  The rationale for such a warrantless search is that it is permissible incident to a lawful arrest because of legitimate concerns for the safety of the officer and to prevent the destruction of evidence by the arrestee. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969) (when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape).Â  See also United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973).Â  \r\n At the in camera hearing, Trooper Meredith testified that, although Freiburger had not been arrested at the time of the pat down search, he was going to be arrested for hitchhiking, or taken back to the jail.Â  Trooper Meredith went on to testify that â€œwe did a safety search before we put somebody in the car.Â  You check them to see if they have any weapons.â€Â  \r\nFreiburger maintains that because he was not under arrest at the time of the search, and because he was ultimately arrested only for carrying arms, the search was illegal and the gun seized in 1961 should have been suppressed at trial.Â  We disagree.Â  As noted above, one of the rationales for the exception to the warrant requirement in the case of a search incident to arrest is the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody.Â  Here, Trooper Meredithâ€™s testimony that Freiburger was going to be arrested for hitchhiking and/or transported to the jail provides a sufficient basis upon which to conduct a limited pat-down search.Â  It would simply be unreasonable to expect a police officer, out on a deserted road at 11:00 p.m., to transport a suspect to the jail without first conducting a pat down search for weapons.Â  Â Â Â \r\nMoreover, the fact that Freiburger was not ultimately arrested for hitchhiking is not dispositive.Â  As recently stated by the United States Supreme Court, an officerâ€™s â€œsubjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause. . . . â€˜the fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the officerâ€™s action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.â€™â€ Devenpeck v. Alford, 125 S.Ct. 588, 94 (2004), citing Whren, supra, at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769.Â  Accordingly, the mere fact that Trooper Meredith did not arrest Freiburger for hitchhiking but, instead, arrested him for carrying arms upon finding the weapon does not Â vitiate the reasonableness of the underlying search.Â  We find the search conducted by Trooper Meredith was a legitimate search incident to arrest, necessary to ensure his safety in order to transport Freiburger to the jail.Â Â  As such, there was no fourth amendment violation and the trial court properly denied Freiburgerâ€™s motion to suppress.\r\n2.Â  CHAIN OF CUSTODY\r\nFreiburger next asserts the state failed to prove a sufficient chain of custody of the gun, such that it should have been excluded from evidence on this basis.Â  Initially, we agree with the state that Freiburger has failed to preserve this issue for review.Â  \r\nDuring the motion in limine hearing, Freiburger objected to the weapon only on the ground that there had been an impermissible pat-down search.Â  He renewed the same objection when the gun was introduced into evidence.Â  Accordingly, as the argument he now advances was not raised and ruled on below, it is not preserved.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989) (issue not preserved for appeal where one ground is raised below and another ground is raised on appeal).Â  In any event, the trial court properly admitted the weapon.Â  Â Â \r\nWhile the chain of custody requirement is strict where fungible evidence is involved, where the issue is the admissibility of non-fungible evidence- - that is, evidence that is unique and identifiable- - the establishment of a strict chain of custody is not required: \r\n  If the offered item possesses characteristics which are fairly unique and readily identifiable, and if the substance of which the item is composed is relatively impervious to change, the trial court is viewed as having broad discretion to admit merely on the basis of testimony that the item is the one in question and is in a substantially unchanged condition.Â  State v. Glenn, 328 S.C. 300, 305-306, 492 S.E.2d 393, 395 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nGiven the serial number and markings on the gun, and the fact that a gun is a non-fungible item, we find the chain of custody established by the state in this case was sufficient.Â  \r\n3.Â  ANCIENT DOCUMENTS/BUSINESS RECORDS EXCEPTION\r\nFreiburger next contends the trial court erred in admitting certain pawn shop records pursuant to the Ancient Documents rule and the Business Records Exception, claiming they were not properly authenticated by the state.Â  We find this issue is not adequately preserved for review, and the record is, in any event, insufficient to enable this Court to make an intelligent review.Â  \r\nIt appears Freiburger primarily objects to admission of the Capital Loan and Pawn receipt and records which indicate Freiburger purchased the H&amp;R revolver on February 28, 1961.Â  However, there is no objection to their admission during the testimony of Ms. Russ, the then 77 year old daughter of the pawn shop owner.Â  In fact, certain exhibits were specifically entered without objection.Â  To the extent that Freiburger did object, the objections came long after the documents had been received into evidence, most of which had been introduced into evidence without objection.Â  \r\nThe rule is well established that if asserted errors are not presented to the lower Court, the question cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  State v. Bellue, 259 S.C. 487, 193 S.E.2d 121 (1972).Â  Further, Freiburger has failed to present a sufficient record for review.Â  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 194, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1998) (the burden is on the appellant to provide a sufficient record for review).\r\nMoreover, we find the testimony of Ms. Russ sufficiently authenticated the pawn shop records.Â  The alleged deficiencies in Ms. Russâ€™ testimony go to the weight of the pawn shop records, rather than their admissibility.\r\n4.Â  FORT LEAVENWORTH\r\nFreiburger asserts reversible error in references to his being â€œstationedâ€ at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.[2]Â  He asserts it is well-known Leavenworth is a military prison, and that, as such, this evidence was prejudicial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nContrary to Freiburgerâ€™s contention, there was no mention of the fact that he was incarcerated at Leavenworth.Â  Mere questioning as to whether he was stationed there simply does not equate with advising the jury he was confined in a military prison.Â Â  Even assuming, arguendo, jurors were aware Leavenworth is a military prison, there is no reason to suspect they automatically believed he was imprisoned there, as opposed to having been being stationed there during his military career.Â  We see no prejudice from admission of this testimony.Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000) (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\n5.Â  SOLICITORâ€™S OPENING COMMENTS\r\nFreiburger next asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial, or curative instructions, after the solicitor improperly commented, during opening arguments, that Freiburger had been arrested by the Tennessee Highway Patrol on March 29, 1961.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nThe jury in this case was well aware, both from the solicitorâ€™s opening argument and the testimony of Trooper Meredith, that Freiburger had been stopped in Tennessee on March 29, 1961 for hitchhiking, and that he was patted down by Meredith and a weapon retrieved and confiscated.Â Â  The jury also learned that the weapon was subsequently turned over to the Richland County sheriffâ€™s department and became the focus of the investigation.Â  \r\nGiven the juryâ€™s knowledge that Freiburger had been stopped and frisked, and the weapon retrieved from him, the fact that the jury also heard he was arrested for carrying arms was simply not prejudicial in his trial for murder.Â  State v. Locklair, supra (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\n6.Â  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nFinally, Freiburger asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005); State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004). In reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, not with its weight.Â  Id.Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id.\r\nThe evidence adduced at trial which tended to implicate Freiburger was as follows: 1) he was a soldier stationed at Fort Jackson on February 28, 1961, 2) he had a habit of pawning his personal property at downtown Columbia pawn shops, 3) he purchased a .32 caliber H&amp;R revolver, serial number W9948, and bullets from the Capital Loan and Pawn shop on February 28, 1961, 4) the victim was shot on February 28, 1961 with a .32 caliber H&amp;R revolver, 5) two days after the victimâ€™s cab was found, Freiburger stayed at a downtown motel in close proximity to where Victimâ€™s bloody cab was found, 6) Freiburger was arrested in Tennessee on March 29, 1961 carrying a .32 caliber H&amp;R revolver, 7) a ballistics test conducted in 2001 indicated that the H&amp;R revolver confiscated from Freiburger in 1961 was the same weapon which fired the shot killing the victim, and 8) Freiburger was evasive when talking to Richland County police investigators in Indiana in September 2000, claiming he did not recall having been in the army, or having been stationed at Fort Jackson.Â  \r\nAlthough circumstantial, we find the above-cited evidence sufficient to withstand Freiburgerâ€™s motion for a directed verdict. Â \r\nThe judgment below is affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nMOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Terry v.

Horner, both of Sowell, Gray, Stepp &amp; Laffitte, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.Â  At issue is the liability of Respondent, State Farm Insurance Company, to Appellants, homeowners in Beaufort County (Homeowners), for allowing them to purchase Standard Flood Insurance Policies covering their homes, when Preferred Risk Policies were available for a lower cost.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to State Farm, holding it was not liable to Homeowners.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nHomeowners purchased flood insurance policies from State Farm for their homes in Beaufort County (on Hilton Head Island).Â  State Farm issued the policies pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a program established by Congress in 1968 under the National Flood Insurance Act and administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 4001 et. seq.Â  In 1983, FEMA promulgated regulations to allow private insurers, called Write-Your-Own insurance companies (WYO), to provide flood insurance under the NFIP.Â  The policies issued are called Standard Flood Insurance Policies (SFIPâ€™s), and the terms, rates and costs of such policies are established by FEMA regulations.Â  44 CFR Â§ 61 et seq.Â  Although WYO companies write the flood insurance policies in their own names, coverage is actually provided by the federal government, with premiums being paid into the National Flood Insurance Fund in the United States Treasury. [1] Â  \r\nState Farm issued SFIP policies to Homeowners through its agent John Mallet.Â  Premiums for flood insurance policies are based upon the flood zone, coverage limits selected by the policy holder, and other risk factors specified in the NFIP manual.Â  Under the NFIP, insureds may, if they meet certain criteria,Â  qualify for a Preferred Risk Policy (PRP).[2]Â  Prior to 1995, coverage limits available under a Preferred Risk Policy were less than that available under SFIP policies.Â  However, in 1995, the federal government increased the coverage limits available under the Preferred Risk Policies from a maximum of $25,000 for contents and $100,000 for buildings, to maximums of $60,000 for contents and $250,000 for the building.Â  This increase in available limits made the PRPâ€™s an alternative for many homeowners who were previously not interested due to the low coverage.Â  \r\nSubsequent to the 1995 increase in coverages available under the PRPâ€™s, State Farm began inserting brochures into its renewal premium bills, advising insureds of the increased coverage limits available, as well as reduced premiums for Preferred Risk Policies for insured in Zones B, C, and X.Â  Insureds were advised to contact their agents for information.[3]Â  According to the testimony of State Farmâ€™s coordinator of flood insurance, FEMA did not require the WYOâ€™s to notify insured of the increased coverage available under the Preferred Risk Policies.Â  \r\nAgent Mallet directly informed his clients about the availability of the Preferred Risk Policies if an insured scheduled a â€œfamily insurance check-upâ€ or if insureds called with questions about their flood insurance coverage.Â  Appellant, Jacqueline Houck, was notified of her eligibility for a Preferred Risk policy in 1999, after calling Malletâ€™s office to inquire about a hurricane brochure sent by State Farm.Â  Subsequent to speaking with Houck, Mallet increased his efforts to notify insureds in eligible zones of the availability of the PRP.[4]\r\nIn June 2001, Homeowners instituted this action contending that from 1995 to the present, State Farm owed them a duty to advise and inform them of their eligibility for a PRP, and to sell them the less expensive policy.Â  Its failure to do so, they asserted, was negligent, and constituted a breach of its covenant of good faith, a conspiracy, and a breach of contract.Â  State Farm moved for summary judgment, contending Homeowners had failed to demonstrate any duty owed to them, and that there was no evidence giving rise to a breach of contract claim.Â  The circuit court agreed and granted State Farm summary judgment.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to State Farm?\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Cafe Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 406 S.E.2d 162 (1991).Â  The mere fact that a case involves a novel issue does not render summary judgment inappropriate.Â  Medical University of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004).Â Â  \r\nTo sustain an action for negligence, it is essential the plaintiff demonstrate the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff. Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 429, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002); Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998).Â  The existence of a duty owed is a question of law for the courts.Â  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 323, 548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001); Washington v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 523 S.E.2d 204 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In a negligence action, if no duty exists, the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 39, 533 S.E.2d 312, 316 (2000).Â  Accord Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999) (in a negligence action, the Court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHomeowners concede that as a general rule, an insurance agent has no duty to advise an insured at the point of application, absent an express or implied undertaking to do so.Â  See Sullivan Co. v. New Swirl, Inc., 313 S.C. 34, 437 S.E.2d 30 (1993); Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins., 352 S.C. 319, 574 S.E.2d 502 (Ct. App. 2002); Trotter v. State Farm, 297 S.C. 465, 377 S.E.2d 343 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  A duty may be imposed, however, â€œif the agent, nevertheless, undertakes to advise the insured.â€Â  Carolina Prod. Maint., Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 310 S.C. 32, 425 S.E.2d 39, 43 (1992) (citing Trotter, 377 S.E.2d at 347). Absent an express undertaking to assume such a duty, a duty can be impliedly created.Â  Id.Â  In determining whether an implied duty has been created, courts consider several factors, including whether: (1) the agent received consideration beyond a mere payment of the premium, (2) the insured made a clear request for advice, or (3) there is a course of dealing over an extended period of time which would put an objectively reasonable insurance agent on notice that his advice is being sought and relied on.â€Â  Id. (citing Trotter, 377 S.E.2d at 347).\r\nEssentially, Homeownersâ€™ contention is that State Farm and agent Mallet owed each and every insured who lived in a B, C, or X flood zone, and who had a SFIP policy, a duty to seek them out individually, independent of any notices from the State Farm headquarters or newsletters issued by Mallet, and advise them personally and specifically of the availability of the Preferred Risk Policies, and to change their insurance to that policy, at a lower premium.Â  South Carolina caselaw does not support Homeownerâ€™s contention.\r\nIn Sullivan Co. v. New Swirl, Inc., 313 S.C. 34, 35, 437 S.E.2d 30 (1993), this Court addressed the issue of whether an insurance agent was required to obtain insurance for his clients â€œon the best possible terms and at the lowest prices.â€Â  There, the insured, New Swirl, refused to pay its insurance premiums when it acquired insurance coverage through a new agent at a cost lower than that provided by its agent, Sullivan.Â  This Court held â€œ[t]he duty of an insurance agent to procure the represented coverage does not create a duty to obtain coverage at any particular rate, absent an express promise to do so.â€Â  313 S.C. at 36, 437 S.E.2d at 30, citing Tunison v. Tillman Ins. Agency, 184 Ga.App. 776, 362 S.E.2d 507 (1987).Â  We found the view advanced by Sullivan, i.e., that its agent owed a duty to secure insurance at the best possible rates â€œwould impose an undue burden on insurance agents and brokers.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nMost recently, in Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 574 S.E.2d 502 (2002), the Court of Appeals addressed class action claims of breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud arising from the sale of preferred and non-preferred whole life insurance policies.Â  In Pitts, a corporation had purchased a life insurance policy on its president.Â  The corporation was not advised by the insurance agent that the president would have qualified for a less expensive â€œpreferredâ€ policy.Â Â  The plaintiffs brought suit alleging five causes of action: unfair trade practices, breach of fiduciary duty/constructive fraud, negligence, fraudulent concealment, and unjust enrichment.Â  The plaintiffs contended they were sold the higher priced policy when, in fact, they qualified for the less expensive policy.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the insurer, finding the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate any fiduciary relationship, or that the agent had breached any duty to them in failing to disclose the existence of preferred policies or to perform â€œfull underwriting in order to inform every standard policy applicant of any eligibility for a preferred policy.â€Â  352 S.C. at 337, 574 S.E.2d at 502.Â  \r\nSimilarly, in Trotter v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 465, 377 S.E.2d 343 (Ct. App. 1987), the insured brought a claim alleging State Farm and its agent had been negligent in failing to advising him of an exclusion in his automobile insurance policies (excluding injuries to employees which arose out of their employment), and in failing to advise him he needed workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  The Court of Appeals noted the basic principles that â€œ[g]enerally, an insurer and its agents owe no duty to advise an insured. . . . If the agent, nevertheless, undertakes to advise the insured, he must exercise due care in giving advice.â€Â  Citing Riddle-Duckworth, Inc. v. Sullivan, 253 S.C. 411, 171 S.E.2d 486 (1969).Â  The Trotter court went on to note that an insurer may assume a duty to advise either by (1) expressly undertaking to advise the insured; or (2) by impliedly undertaking to advise the insured.Â  Id.Â  An implied undertaking may be shown if (1) the agent received consideration beyond a mere payment of the premium, (2) the insured made a clear request for advice, or (3) there is a course of dealing over an extended period of time which would put an objectively reasonable insurance agent on notice that his advice is being sought and relied on.Â  \r\nÂ We find no evidence of either an express or implied undertaking in this case.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly held there is no genuine issue of material fact.\r\nAs to an express undertaking, Homeowners rely upon State Farmâ€™s assumption of responsibility as a WYO provider under the WYO agreement.Â Â  The WYO agreement on which they rely sets forth the â€œUndertakings of the Company.â€ These â€œundertakingsâ€ include policy administration, eligibility determinations, issuance, endorsements, cancellations, and correspondence.Â  We see nothing in the language here which creates an express duty on the part of State Farm to sell the best policy at the best price.Â  \r\nHomeowners also rely on State Farmâ€™s Flood Insurance Operation Guide, the purpose of which is to provide State Farm regional offices with the background and guidance to underwrite flood policies.Â  Pursuant to this guide, one of State Farmâ€™s responsibilities is to â€œConfirm eligibility (e.g., community risk, etc.) and charge proper rates - - additional guidance is provided in the Flood Manual.â€Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  It is undisputed that all rates for flood insurance under the WYO arrangement are set by FEMA under the NFIA.Â  Essentially, Homeownersâ€™ claim is that the responsibility to charge â€œproper ratesâ€ equates with charging the lowest rates available.Â  We have found no authority supporting this proposition, and such a ruling would be at odds with this Courtâ€™s opinion in New Swirl, and the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinions in Pitts and Trotter that agents do not have a duty to procure insurance at the best possible rates.Â  While the Operation Manual may oblige State Farm to charge proper rates, the rates which Homeowners were charged for the SFIP policies were proper.Â  Simply because they were not the lowest-price available policies does not render the rates charged for them improper.\r\nLastly, Homeowners rely on the testimony of State Farmâ€™s coordinator of flood insurance, Jack DeCicco, as giving rise to an express undertaking and therefore creating a duty in this case to ensure they were switched from the SFIPâ€™s to PRPâ€™s.Â  We disagree.Â  DeCicco testified that it was the policy of State Farm to offer the best available coverage at the lowest rate under the WYO program, and that State Farm did take the responsibility to notify policyholders of changes in the eligibility for preferred risk insurance whenever there was an opportunity to do so.Â  However, it is undisputed that State Farm did in fact insert brochures in its policyholdersâ€™ renewal notices advising them of the availability of PRPâ€™s and advising them to contact their agents if they had questions about their flood insurance policy.Â  The only Homeowner testimony in the record is to the effect that they did not pay much attention to the brochures.Â  DeCiccoâ€™s testimony that State Farm had a policy of offering the best coverage at the best rate, and that they did in fact notify policyholders of changes in eligibility for coverages simply does not give rise to an express duty to individually and specifically contact each and every customer who lived in a B, C, or X flood zone and advise them of the availability of the lower priced coverage.Â  \r\nAs to an implied duty, Homeowners acknowledge that they must show that (1) the agent received consideration beyond a mere payment of the premium, (2) the insured made a clear request for advice, or (3) there is a course of dealing over an extended period of time which would put an objectively reasonable insurance agent on notice that his advice is being sought and relied on.Â  Trotter, supra.Â  \r\nInitially, Homeowners contend Mallet received consideration beyond mere payment of the premiums because State Farm incurs no losses for WYO flood polices as those losses are borne by the federal government.Â  However, this is true for any flood insurance policy sold under the WYO, regardless of whether it is a SFIP or a Preferred Risk Policy.Â  Accordingly, Homeowners have not demonstrated Mallet received additional compensation beyond payment of the premiums.Â  \r\nAs to the insured making a clear request for advice, the record is simply devoid of any such evidence.\r\nLastly, we find no evidence of a course of dealing over an extended period of time which would put an objectively reasonable insurance agent on notice that his advice is being sought and relied on.Â  As noted previously, the only Homeowner testimony in the record is that of Houck and Perrini.Â  Houck testified she had had no contact whatsoever with agent Mallet prior to her husbandâ€™s death in 1995 and that, thereafter, the only direct contact she had with Mallet was a request to remove her deceased husbandâ€™s name from their correspondence.Â  She testified she assumed Mallet was her agent and would obtain the best coverage for her.Â  Similarly, Perrini testified he did not recall ever speaking to Mallet about his insurance needs, and never spoke with anyone in Malletâ€™s office about his flood insurance premiums.Â  Although he periodically visited Malletâ€™s office to pay premiums, and to have a photo taken of his classic 1967 Mustang, there is no testimony as to any specific conversations with Mallet about procuring the best flood insurance policy at the best price.Â  It is patent that Homeownerâ€™s testimony is insufficient to establish a course of dealing.Â  See Trotter, 297 S.C. at 473, 377 S.E.2d at 348 (plaintiffâ€™s â€œongoing relationshipâ€ consisting of periodic visits to pay premiums, change vehicles, discuss insurance, and conduct routing business insufficient to prove a course of dealing). \r\nWe find as a matter of law that neither State Farm nor agent Mallet owed Homeowners a duty to sell them the best policy at the lowest available price.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment.[5]Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The WYOâ€™s fees and administrative costs are first deducted.Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 4017 (d).Â  \r\n[2]Â  These criteria include living in a flood zone designated as B, C, or X, and other eligibility requirements, based on flood history.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Appellant Jacqueline Houck testified that over the years she may have received some brochures about the national flood insurance programs and sheâ€™d â€œsort of glance at them.â€Â  Similarly, the only other homeowner whose deposition testimony is in the record, Richard Perrini, testified that he did not read the brochures included in his renewal notices.Â  \r\n[4]Â  According to Malletâ€™s deposition testimony, he had not previously directly advised insureds of the preferred policies because it appeared the brochures mailed from State Farm were working as people had been switching from the SFIP to the preferred policies.Â  Â \r\n[5]Â  As to the grant of summary judgment on Homeownersâ€™ breach of contract claim, we find Homeowners have effectively abandoned this argument.Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        James Ira Ruff, pro se, of Leesville.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction provided by Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nClient A \r\nBy letter dated January 31, 2005, ODC notified respondent of a complaint submitted by Client A and requested a response within fifteen (15) days.Â  Respondent did not respond.\r\nOn February 24, 2005, ODC sent respondent a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), and again requested a response.Â  Respondent failed to respond to this letter.Â  Respondent did not respond to ODC until after he was contacted by ODCâ€™s Chief of Investigations.\r\nAn Investigative Panel authorized a full investigation on March 18, 2005. Â Respondent received a Notice of Full Investigation on March 22, 2005.Â  Respondent failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation within thirty (30) days. Â Respondent submitted he did not believe he was required to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation as he had responded to the Chief of Investigationâ€™s prior inquiry.[1]Â  \r\nClient B\r\nWhile investigating Client Aâ€™s complaint, ODC received a complaint against respondent from Client B.Â  Client B complained respondent failed to pay taxes of $1,149.89 due to the South Carolina Department of Revenue relating to a real estate transaction on October 16, 2003. Â Payment of the taxes was to be made from the net proceeds of the real estate transaction.Â  Respondentâ€™s failure to pay the taxes caused financial harm to Client B. \r\nThe original check payable to the tax authority, dated October 16, 2003, was located in Client Bâ€™s file.Â  Respondent expressed his desire to immediately make restitution to Client B.Â  Respondent sent an apology to Client B on May 27, 2005 and, on June 10, 2005, he sent Client B a certified check as full reimbursement. \r\nClient C\r\nDuring interviews with ODC, respondent acknowledged another client matter wherein a real estate closing occurred, but respondent failed to pay a tax authority.Â  In this matter, respondent closed a real estate transaction for Client C on June 12, 2001, but failed to pay taxes of $2,240.00 to the South Carolina Department of Revenue.Â  The taxes were to be paid from the proceeds of the real estate transaction.Â  Respondent paid the outstanding taxes, plus interest, in June 2005.Â  \r\nTrust Account Matters\r\nODC requested respondent provide his law firmâ€™s financial records from 2000 through 2005.Â  During this period of time, respondent maintained two trust accounts. Â Respondent admits he failed to comply with most requirements of the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR, since the ruleâ€™s adoption on January 1, 1997. Â In particular, since 1997, respondent failed to reconcile the two trust accounts and failed to identify the majority of client funds deposited into the two trust accounts by failing to place a client name or file number on the deposit tickets.Â  Respondent admits that, from 1997 to the present, he was unable to identify the clients whose monies were in his trust accounts or identify a clientâ€™s existing fund balance at any given time.[2]Â  \r\nRespondent admits he did not maintain client ledger sheets for non-real estate matters, but did maintain some form of disbursement sheet in the client file that may or may not have contained all information required by Rule 417, SCACR. \r\nRespondent admits that for several years banks imposed monthly administrative fees and/or analysis fees against his two trust accounts.Â  He admits he did not deposit funds in the trust accounts to cover these charges and the fees were paid out of client funds.Â  \r\nRespondent admits that there recently existed a client fund shortage of approximately $8,000.00.Â  Respondent represents that, in June 2005, he deposited $6,000.00 of his personal funds into the trust accounts in an attempt to cover this shortage.\r\nMisappropriation Matter\r\nRespondent admits that, since his admission in 1975, he has misappropriated and converted between $12,000.00 and $15,000.00 of clientsâ€™ funds from his trust accounts to his own personal use.Â  Respondent has not repaid these funds.[3]Â  Respondent has not maintained any list, register, or log to accurately identify the clients to whom the funds belonged or the amounts he converted.Â  Respondent voluntarily disclosed this information to ODC.Â  \r\nCommingling Matters\r\nIn 2004, respondent sold his own real property and deposited $9,433.24 into his trust account.Â  Thereafter, respondent disbursed most, if not all, of these proceeds from his trust account using trust account checks.Â  Respondent acknowledges he commingled his personal funds with client funds.Â  \r\nRespondent and a family member developed a small, informal business involved in a real estate venture.Â  From 2001 until the venture dissolved, respondent used his law firm trust accounts as an â€œescrow accountâ€ for this venture.Â  In doing so, respondent deposited non-client funds into the accounts and disbursed funds to non-client payees by use of trust account checks.[4]Â  Respondent admits that this use of his trust accounts constitutes commingling.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver to client any funds or other property to which client is entitled); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7 (a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline to knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand from a disciplinary authority), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).Â  Finally, respondent admits he has violated the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  Respondent shall make full restitution to any clients, persons, or entities owed any money as a result of his misconduct within one year from the date of this opinion.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.[5]Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It was determined respondent did not commit misconduct in his representation of Client A.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s bookkeeping procedure consisted of removing the bank deposit slip relative to a client matter from the deposit book and placing the slip in the clientâ€™s file.Â  Based on this practice, ODC was unable to identify any deposit or trace client funds from 2000 through 2005.Â  Respondent admits the only way to identify a trust account deposit was by retrieving the deposit slips from client files and comparing the deposit slips against the monthly bank statements.Â   \r\nRespondent produced bank deposit receipts for the two trust accounts.Â  The receipts were not identified in any manner as to client name or file number.Â  Respondent admits the only way to trace a clientâ€™s funds using the bank receipt would be by obtaining the copy of the deposit ticket from the clientâ€™s file and comparing that document against the monthly bank statements and bank receipts.Â  \r\n[3] As stated above, respondent represents he deposited $6,000.00 of his own funds into his trust accounts in an attempt to cover any shortages.Â  \r\n[4] In particular, respondent issued checks from the trust accounts for monthly obligations, annual taxes, insurance, and repairs related to real property owned by the business venture.Â Â  \r\n[5] The parties agreed to the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests if the Court suspended respondent for more than sixty (60) days.Â  By separate order, the Court will appoint an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26045","title":"Bray v.

Pachak, of S.C. Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari from the denial of his third application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and affirm the order of the PCR judge.\r\nThe PCR judge found that petitioner did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to appellate review of the denial of his first PCR application because his PCR counsel failed to advise him of the right to seek appellate review.Â  However, the judge found that petitionerâ€™s third PCR action was barred by laches.\r\nThis Court has never specifically required counsel to advise a PCR applicant of the right to appellate review of the denial of PCR.Â  In Sutton v. State, 361 S.C. 644, 606 S.E.2d 779 (2004), we held that neither trial nor appellate counsel are required to advise a client of the right to file a PCR application or the time limits for filing. Â However, in Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991), this Court held that an applicant has a right to an appellate counselâ€™s assistance in seeking review of the denial of PCR.Â  Appellate counsel is required to brief arguable issues, despite counselâ€™s belief the appeal is frivolous, to safeguard the right to appeal.Â  Johnson v. State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988).Â  Further, Rule 71.1(g), SCRCP, expressly provides that, if the applicant wishes to seek appellate review, PCR counsel must file a Notice of Appeal, continue representation until relieved, and assist an indigent applicant in obtaining representation by the Office of Appellate Defense.Â  \r\nWe now hold that counsel is required to advise an applicant of the right to appellate review of the denial of PCR.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge properly found that petitioner did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to appellate review since counsel failed to advise him of the right.Â  However, as discussed below, petitionerâ€™s application was properly dismissed.\r\nLaches is â€œneglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.&nbsp; Whether a claim is barred by laches is to be determined in light of the facts of each case, taking into consideration whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other party.â€Â  Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 574 S.E.2d 200 (2002), citing Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198-199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).\r\nIn this case, petitionerâ€™s PCR application was filed seven years after the denial of his first PCR application.Â  He offered no explanation for the delay other than the fact that he only recently discovered he could seek a belated review of that denial.Â  The tapes of petitionerâ€™s first PCR hearing have now been destroyed.Â  Counsel had no notes on the PCR hearing, and neither petitioner nor his prior plea counsel or PCR counsel could specifically recall the testimony presented at the PCR hearing.Â  Based on these facts, the PCR judge properly found that petitionerâ€™s claim was barred by laches.Â  Â McCray v.

Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-310 (2001). The Court noted that it &ldquo;has never specifically addressed whether a nonlawyer executor or personal representative can represent an estate in matters such as this appeal.&rdquo; We addressed that specific question by holding that because the filing of a notice of appeal on behalf of the estate and preparation of briefs that will be required to further perfect this appeal clearly constitutes the practice of law, appellant, who is not admitted to the practice of law, cannot represent the estate on appeal. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-310 (2001).\r\n \r\n It has come to our attention that there is some confusion regarding the breadth of our ruling. We therefore take this opportunity to clarify that our order was narrowly tailored to the issue before us, specifically whether a nonlawyer executor or personal representative can represent an estate on appeal.\r\n \r\n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.

See In the Matter of James Ira Ruff, Op. No. 26044 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed September 26, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 37).

Mr. Bradley shall take action as required by Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, to protect the interests of respondent&rsquo;s clients. Mr. Bradley may make disbursements from respondent&rsquo;s trust account(s), escrow account(s), operating account(s), and any other law office account(s) respondent may maintain that are necessary to effectuate this appointment.\r\n \r\n This Order, when served on any bank or other financial institution maintaining trust, escrow and/or operating accounts of respondent, shall serve as an injunction to prevent respondent from making withdrawals from the account(s) and shall further serve as notice to the bank or other financial institution that James E. Bradley, Esquire, has been duly appointed by this Court.\r\n \r\n Finally, this Order, when served on any office of the United States Postal Service, shall serve as notice that James E. Bradley, Esquire, has been duly appointed by this Court and has the authority to receive respondent's mail and the authority to direct that respondent&rsquo;s mail be delivered to Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s office.\r\n This appointment shall be for a period of no longer than nine months unless request is made to this Court for an extension. \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    s/James E.
