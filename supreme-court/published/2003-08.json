Hammack, of Leatherwood, Walker, \r\n  Todd, &amp; Mann, P.C., of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:  Appellant \r\n  Mary Louise Sloan brought this action against the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Public Safety (DPS) and Respondent Image Data, LLC (Image Data) alleging \r\n  invasion of privacy by misappropriation of personality and seeking damages, \r\n  injunctive, and declaratory relief.  In separate orders, the trial judge granted \r\n  summary judgment to DPS and Image Data.  Sloan appeals the order granting summary \r\n  judgment to Image Data.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nIn 1997, the General Assembly passed \r\n  Act No. 155, 34.15, 1997 S.C. Acts 1445 (the 1997 Act), providing:\r\n\r\n(DPS:  Sale of Photos or Digitized Images)  The Department \r\n  of Public Safety may enter into contracts to provide copies of photography, \r\n  electronically stored information, stored photographs or digitized images.  \r\n  Such items are to be used for the prevention of fraud, including but not limited \r\n  to, use in mechanisms intended to prevent the fraudulent use of credit cards, \r\n  debit cards or other forms of financial or voter transactions.  The use of such \r\n  photographs, electronically stored or digitized images obtained by private companies \r\n  or other entities is limited to the verification of the identity of the holder.  \r\n  Funds derived from the contractual sale of these copies are retained by the \r\n  Department of Public Safety to defray the costs of providing same. [1] \r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1998, DPS and Image Data \r\n  entered a â€œData Access Agreement.â€  Under the terms of this agreement, DPS agreed \r\n  to make available to Image Data the information and photograph appearing on \r\n  the face of South Carolina driversâ€™ licenses and state-issued personal identification \r\n  cards.  In return, Image Data agreed to pay DPS for the information and photographs.  \r\n  According to the agreement, Image Data intended to incorporate the information \r\n  into a multi-state or national electronic database to be used for identity verification \r\n  and fraud prevention purposes.  [2]   \r\n According to the affidavit of Robert Houvener, \r\n  Image Dataâ€™s co-founder, president, and CEO, through its â€œTrue I.D.â€ database, \r\n  Image Data electronically provides an image (i.e. photograph) corresponding \r\n  to the identification provided by a customer to a merchant at the point of sale.  \r\n  The merchant can use the image to verify the customerâ€™s identification.  \r\nBetween September 1998 and April 1, 1999, \r\n  Image Data operated a pilot test program of its True I.D. system at fifteen \r\n  retail establishments in South Carolina.  During this seven month period, approximately \r\n  2,000 transactions occurred.  Sloanâ€™s image was not displayed during the pilot \r\n  program.  \r\nDPS terminated its contract with Image \r\n  Data effective March 22, 1999.  DPS agreed to refund payments received from \r\n  Image Data and requested Image Data purge all South Carolina records from its \r\n  database, return all computer tapes to DPS, and verify that the deletions occurred.  \r\n\r\nIn 1999, the General Assembly passed \r\n  Act No. 100, Part II, 1999 S.C. Acts 842 (the 1999 Act), prohibiting DPS from \r\n  selling or providing a private party with social security numbers, photographs, \r\n  or signatures taken for purposes of a driverâ€™s license or personal identification \r\n  card.  The legislature specified social security numbers, photographs, signatures, \r\n  or digitized images from a driverâ€™s license or personal identification card \r\n  are not  public records. [3]   \r\n  In the same Act, the General Assembly amended the Freedom of Information Act \r\n  (FOIA), [4]  specifying FOIA does not permit  \r\n  DPS to sell or furnish to a private party social security numbers, photographs, \r\n  signatures, or other identifying features obtained for the purpose of a driverâ€™s \r\n  license or a personal identification card.  Act No. 100, Part II, Â§ 53, 1999 \r\n  S.C. Acts 990. [5]   In addition, \r\n  it amended FOIA to specify that a private person may not use an electronically-stored \r\n  version of information obtained from a driverâ€™s license record for any purpose.  \r\n  Id.     \r\nSloan filed her original complaint in \r\n  February 1999 alleging invasion of privacy through the unlawful appropriation \r\n  of her driverâ€™s license information and photograph by DPS and Image Data.  She \r\n  later filed an amended complaint in which she stated DPS disclosed social security \r\n  numbers to Image Data, that it also disclosed information from personal identification \r\n  cards in addition to driversâ€™ licenses, and that Image Data intended to use \r\n  the information not simply to prevent fraud, but to accumulate and to sell information \r\n  concerning consumersâ€™ buying habits.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes the purchase/sale of information and images contained \r\n  on driversâ€™ licenses and state issued identification cards, as authorized by \r\n  the General Assembly, constitute the tort of misappropriation of personality?    \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nâ€œThe right to privacy is correctly defined \r\n  ... as the right to be let alone; the right of a person to be free from unwarranted \r\n  publicity.â€  Holloman v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, 192 S.C. 454, 458, \r\n  7 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1940).  In South Carolina, there are three separate and distinct \r\n  causes of action for invasion of privacy:  1) wrongful appropriation of personality; \r\n  2) wrongful publicizing of private affairs; and 3) wrongful intrusion into private \r\n  affairs.   Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 126 (1999).  Wrongful appropriation of personality involves the intentional, \r\n  unconsented use of the plaintiffâ€™s name, likeness, or identity by the defendant \r\n  for his own benefit.  The gist of the action is the violation of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  exclusive right at common law to publicize and profit from his name, likeness, \r\n  and other aspects of personal identity.  Snakenberg v. Hartford Cas. Ins. \r\n  Co., Inc., 299 S.C. 164, 383 S.E.2d 2 (Ct. App. 1989).  \r\nThe trial judge properly determined Image \r\n  Data did not misappropriate Sloanâ€™s driverâ€™s license information and photograph.  \r\n  At the time Image Data and DPS entered the Data Access Agreement, the 1997 Act \r\n  specifically permitted the purchase/sale arrangement contemplated by the contracting \r\n  parties.  Image Data was entitled to rely in good faith on the 1997 Act as authority \r\n  to enter into its contract with DPS.  See Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. \r\n  158, 168, 112 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 118 L.Ed.2d 504, 515 (1992) ( â€œ . . . principles \r\n  of equality and fairness may suggest, . . . , that private citizens who rely \r\n  unsuspectingly on state laws they did not create and may have no reason to believe \r\n  are invalid should have some protections from liability. . . .â€).  Because the \r\n  1997 Act authorized the transaction between Image Data and DPS, Image Data did \r\n  not misappropriate Sloanâ€™s driverâ€™s license information and photograph.  [6]   \r\nFurthermore, Sloan presented no evidence \r\n  of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact that Image Dataâ€™s intended \r\n  use of the driverâ€™s license and identification card information was for other \r\n  than fraud prevention, the stated purpose of the 1997 Act.  While Sloan suggested \r\n  Image Data acquired the information in order to track and sell consumer buying \r\n  habits, she failed to offer any material evidence to support her claim.   \r\nFinally, we recognize Image Data and \r\n  DPS exceeded the scope of the 1997 Act by purchasing/selling social security \r\n  numbers.  While the transfer of social security numbers was not authorized by \r\n  the 1997 Act, the information was erroneously transferred from DPS to Image \r\n  Data. [7]   In light of the fact that the \r\n  transfer was inadvertent and there is no evidence Image Data used the information, \r\n  the technical violation of the 1997 Act does not bar Image Data from relying \r\n  on the 1997 Act.  \r\nWe conclude Sloan failed to present any genuine issue of \r\n  material fact supporting her claim for misappropriation of personality.  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge properly granted summary judgment to Image Data and the order \r\n  of the lower court is AFFIRMED.  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation \r\n  Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998) (summary judgment is proper where \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law). [8] \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The following year, the General Assembly passed an identical provision.  Act \r\n    No. 419, Â§ 36.12 , 1998 S.C. Acts 2912.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    At some point, driverâ€™s license and personal identification card holders were \r\n    permitted to â€œopt outâ€ of the Image Data program.  At her deposition, Sloan \r\n    testified she was aware she could opt out of the program, but did not do so \r\n    because she thought opting out would be â€œa real hassle.â€  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-3-545 (Supp. 2002).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-10 to -165 (1991 and Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-160 to -165 (Supp.  2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    While not directly addressing the issue of  privacy, the United States Supreme \r\n    Court upheld Congressâ€™ authority it enact the Driverâ€™s Privacy Protection \r\n    Act of 1994 (DPPA), 18 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 2721-2725 (2000) which restricts the sale \r\n    or release of a driverâ€™s personal information.  Reno v. Condon, 528 \r\n    U.S. 141, 120 S.Ct. 666, 145 L.Ed.2d 587 (2000).  The DPPA, however, permits \r\n    motor vehicle departments to disclose personal information from driverâ€™s records \r\n    for a number of purposes, one of which is for use by a business to verify \r\n    the accuracy of personal information submitted to the business and to prevent \r\n    fraud or pursue legal remedies if the information that the individual submitted \r\n    to the business is revealed to have been inaccurate.  Â§ 2721(b)(3).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  At the summary judgment hearing, \r\n    counsel for DPS stated DPS inadvertently transmitted the social security numbers \r\n    to Image Data.  Counsel for Image Data agreed the Data Access Agreement did \r\n    not call for release of social security numbers and stated the social security \r\n    numbers were neither needed nor used by Image Data.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  \r\n    Sloan sought to be certified as a class representative of similarly situated \r\n    plaintiffs.  Because of our disposition in this matter, we decline to address \r\n    the order denying class certification.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Maria Reichmanis","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-07-25-02","description":"This Order vacates the interim suspension that this Court placed on Ms. Reichmanis and changes her status to incapacity inactive based on the severity of her documented medical condition.","date":"2003-08-04","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina \r\n\r\n\r\n  In the Matter of Maria Reichmanis, Respondent.\r\n  \r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Rule 28(b)(6)(A), \r\n  of the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (&quot;RLDE&quot;), we VACATE \r\n  the interim suspension placed on Maria Reichmanis and place her on incapacity \r\n  inactive status based on the severity of her documented medical condition.\r\nFurther, pursuant to Rule 28(b)(6)(C), \r\n  RLDE, we defer all pending disciplinary matters against Ms. Reichmanis because \r\n  she has established that she is unable to assist in her own defense.

[2]   We affirm.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial judge \r\n      err by denying Countyâ€™s motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding \r\n      the verdict on the basis Jinks failed to present evidence of gross negligence \r\n      and proximate cause? \r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II. \r\n    Did the trial judge \r\n      err by failing to hold collateral estoppel barred relitigation of certain \r\n      issues? [3]   \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nCounty asserts the trial court erred \r\n  by denying its directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) \r\n  motions because Jinks failed to establish that its correctional officers acted \r\n  in a grossly negligent manner or that their alleged negligence proximately caused \r\n  Jinksâ€™ death.  We disagree.  \r\nThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act \r\n  provides that the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental \r\n  entities are â€œliable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent \r\n  as a private individual under like circumstances,â€ subject to certain limitations \r\n  and exemptions with the Act.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 2002).  Section \r\n  15-78-60 sets out â€œexceptionsâ€ to this waiver of sovereign immunity.  These \r\n  exceptions act as limitations on the liability of a governmental entity.  One \r\n  exception provides:  \r\n \r\n  The governmental entity is not \r\n    liable for loss resulting from: \r\n  responsibility or duty including \r\n    but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement or custody \r\n    of any â€¦ prisoner,  inmateâ€¦ of any governmental entity, except when the responsibility \r\n    or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25) (Supp. \r\n  2002).  \r\nGross negligence is the intentional \r\n  conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the \r\n  doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.  Etheredge v. Richland \r\n  County School Dist. 1, 341 S.C. 307, 534 S.E.2d 275 (2000).  It is the failure \r\n  to exercise slight care.  Id.  Gross negligence has also been defined \r\n  as a relative term and means the absence of care that is necessary under the \r\n  circumstances.  Hollins v. Richland County School Dist. 1, 310 S.C. 486, \r\n  427 S.E.2d 654 (1993).  Gross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question of law \r\n  and fact.  Clyburn v. Sumter County School Dist. 17, 317 S.C. 50, 451 \r\n  S.E.2d 885 (1994).                       \r\nâ€œIn ruling on motions for directed \r\n  verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences \r\n  that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party \r\n  opposing the motions and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields \r\n  more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€  Strange v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 \r\n  S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).  â€œThe trial court can only be reversed by this Court \r\n  when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.â€  Id. at 430, \r\n  445 S.E.2d at 440.      \r\nIn \r\n  his complaint, Jinks alleged Countyâ€™s correctional officers were grossly negligent \r\n  in various ways.  In particular, Jinks asserted Countyâ€™s employees failed to \r\n  properly monitor inmates, failed to call for medical attention, and failed to \r\n  provide adequate and proper medical care.  At trial, Jinks argued the correctional \r\n  officersâ€™ failure to properly monitor his medical condition proximately caused \r\n  his death.  \r\nViewing the evidence and its inferences \r\n  in the light most favorable to Jinks, there was evidence that County was grossly \r\n  negligent by failing to properly monitor Jinksâ€™ medical condition.  The trial \r\n  record establishes Jinks was arrested and booked on Friday, October 14, 1994, \r\n  for failure to pay child support and spent the weekend at Countyâ€™s detention \r\n  facility.  On Monday morning, Officer Williams, a first shift correctional officer, \r\n  and Walter Carlo, a detention center paramedic, observed Jinks shaking, sweating, \r\n  laughing, and gripping the cell bars; Jinks did not respond to conversation.  \r\n  Officer Williams and Paramedic Carlo determined Jinks should be seen by the \r\n  detention center physician.  \r\nThe detention center physician saw \r\n  Jinks at noon.  The medical assessment form notes Jinksâ€™ complaint as â€œ? D.T.â€™s.â€ \r\n  [4]   The physician diagnosed Jinks as suffering from alcohol withdrawal, \r\n  prescribed Librium, and ordered that Jinks be re-evaluated in two days.\r\nOfficer Williams testified he placed \r\n  Jinks in â€œtank oneâ€ for medical observation as directed by the paramedic.  Officer \r\n  Williams stated he was not instructed what symptoms or behavior to monitor.  \r\n  Jinks was alone in the cell.  Officer Williams testified he checked on Jinks \r\n  every fifteen to thirty minutes until he left work at 2:30 p.m.  He did not \r\n  recall speaking with Jinks.  At 2:30 p.m., Jinks was still shaking, sweating, \r\n  and laughing.  \r\nOfficer Williams testified he returned \r\n  to the jail at 6:00 the following morning.  He saw Jinks lying on the cell floor \r\n  at 6:30 a.m.  Jinks appeared to be sleeping.  Officer Williams looked in on \r\n  Jinks every thirty minutes.  At 9:30 a.m., he asked Jinks to get up off the \r\n  floor; Jinks did so and sat on a bench. \r\n  [5]   Officer Williams testified, because Jinks â€œappeared to be okay,â€ two \r\n  other detainees were placed in his cell.  When Officer Williams looked in on \r\n  Jinks after 10:00 a.m., Jinks was slumped over on the cell bench and appeared \r\n  to be asleep.  Shortly thereafter, Jinksâ€™ cellmates notified jail attendees \r\n  that Jinks needed attention.  Officer Williams entered the cell.  According \r\n  to the officer, Jinksâ€™ skin had darkened and he appeared to be dead.   \r\nOfficer \r\n  Peay testified he observed Jinks in the â€œholding tankâ€ on October 17th.  \r\n  Jinks was sweating and pale.  Officer Peay testified, when he first saw Jinks \r\n  the following morning, Jinks was lying on the cell floor and appeared to be \r\n  sleeping.  Officer Peay did not speak to Jinks.  Officer Peay stated he found \r\n  Jinks dead on the cell bench at 10:30 a.m. [6]   \r\nThe paramedic testified, when he \r\n  entered Jinksâ€™ cell at 10:33 a.m., Jinks â€œhad passed away for a sufficient amount \r\n  of time.â€  \r\nThe autopsy report stated Jinksâ€™ \r\n  death resulted from complications from alcohol withdrawal.  \r\nRetired Richland County Detention \r\n  Training Director James Haley testified that detention center officers receive \r\n  instruction on alcohol and drug abuse.  Part of this instruction addresses alcohol \r\n  withdrawal syndrome and the progressive nature of its medical symptoms.  Training \r\n  materials state officers should observe all alcohol abuse admissions closely.   \r\n  \r\nAn expert in jail supervision and \r\n  management procedure testified the Richland County Detention Centerâ€™s established \r\n  procedures require those inmates on medical observation to be observed every \r\n  fifteen minutes for any change in condition.  In addition, medical observation \r\n  requires the inmate be aroused every hour to make certain his condition is not \r\n  deteriorating.  The expert testified, according to Officers Williamsâ€™ and Peayâ€™s \r\n  deposition testimony, they did not know Jinksâ€™ medical condition and, therefore, \r\n  could not determine whether his condition was improving or deteriorating.\r\nExpert witness Peter Bower, M.D., \r\n  testified people suffering from alcohol withdrawal need to be observed intensively \r\n  and methodically.  Dr. Bower stated it was his opinion that, to a reasonable \r\n  degree of medical certainty, Jinks would have survived alcohol withdrawal if \r\n  he had been properly monitored. [7] \r\n    \r\nThe trial judge did not err by denying \r\n  Countyâ€™s directed verdict and JNOV motions.  The evidence indicates, even though \r\n  the correctional officers were aware Jinks was not well, they were not apprised \r\n  of the nature of his medical condition as diagnosed by the infirmary physician, \r\n  but were simply told Jinks was to be placed on medical observation.  Without \r\n  knowledge of Jinksâ€™ diagnosis, the officers could not have adequately monitored \r\n  his condition.  Failure of medical personnel to advise or the officers to inquire \r\n  as to Jinksâ€™ medical condition constitutes evidence of an absence of care necessary \r\n  under the circumstances amounting to gross negligence.  \r\nAssuming the officers were aware \r\n  that Jinks was suffering from alcohol withdrawal, the evidence indicates the \r\n  officersâ€™ monitoring of his medical condition was inadequate.  Although the \r\n  officers may have observed Jinks on a periodic basis, on the morning of October \r\n  18, Officers Williams and Peay neither spoke to nor aroused Jinks on an hourly \r\n  basis to ensure that his condition was not deteriorating. [8]   This failure was contrary to Countyâ€™s established detention \r\n  center policies.  Moreover, it was contrary to the medical expertâ€™s opinion \r\n  that individuals suffering from alcohol withdrawal be observed â€œintensively \r\n  and methodically.â€  \r\nAdditionally, there is evidence that \r\n  the correctional officers failed to observe Jinks every fifteen minutes as required \r\n  by the detention centerâ€™s own policies concerning medical observation.  The \r\n  trial record contains evidence which supports the conclusion the officersâ€™ failure \r\n  to properly monitor an inmate known to be suffering from alcohol withdrawal \r\n  constitutes gross negligence.   \r\nFinally, Jinks offered expert testimony \r\n  that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, he would have survived if \r\n  he had been properly monitored.  Accordingly, Jinks presented evidence that \r\n  failure to properly monitor his medical condition proximately caused his death.  \r\n  \r\nIn our capacity as an appellate court, \r\n  we are bound by the applicable standard of review.  Since there is evidence \r\n  which supports the trial judgeâ€™s ruling denying Countyâ€™s motions for a directed \r\n  verdict and JNOV, we must affirm.  Id.\r\nII.\r\nInitially, \r\n  Jinks brought this action in the United States District Court for the District \r\n  of South Carolina.  Among other claims, Jinks alleged County and other defendants \r\n  violated 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.  The district court granted the defendantsâ€™ motions \r\n  for summary judgment on the Section 1983 claim.  \r\nCounty claims \r\n  that three specific rulings by the district court judge in his order granting \r\n  summary judgment on Jinksâ€™ Section 1983 claim collaterally estop Jinks from \r\n  recovering in this state court action.  Specifically, County contends the federal \r\n  courtâ€™s rulings -- that neither  Countyâ€™s failure to adopt certain policies \r\n  concerning medical observation nor  the arrival of Jinksâ€™ medication after his \r\n  death proximately caused Jinksâ€™ death -- bar his present negligence claim.  \r\n  Additionally, County claims the district judgeâ€™s finding that correctional officers \r\n  did observe Jinks and followed the infirmary physicianâ€™s instructions bar relitigation \r\n  of this issue.  We disagree.  \r\nCollateral \r\n  estoppel prevents a party from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually \r\n  and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.  Shelton v. Oscar \r\n  Mayer Foods Corp., 325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d 706 (1997).   \r\nIt is unnecessary \r\n  for us to decide whether the federal courtâ€™s findings concerning the sufficiency \r\n  of Countyâ€™s medical observation policies and the arrival of Jinksâ€™ prescription \r\n  after his death collaterally estopped Jinksâ€™ current negligence claim as Jinks \r\n  presented other evidence of gross negligence.  \r\n  [9]   Finally, the federal courtâ€™s finding that correctional officers observed \r\n  Jinks and followed the physicianâ€™s instructions is not preclusive on the issue \r\n  of whether the officers properly observed Jinks.  Accordingly, collateral \r\n  estoppel did not bar relitigation of this issue.  Id.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The jury returned a defense verdict in Jinksâ€™ medical malpractice \r\n    action against the detention centerâ€™s physician.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Originally, the Court issued an opinion in this matter addressing \r\n    Countyâ€™s claim that Jinks failed to file this action within the statute of \r\n    limitations.  The Court held the federal statute tolling the applicable state \r\n    statute of limitations violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \r\n    Jinks v. Richland County, 349 S.C. 298, 563 S.E.2d  104 (2002).  The \r\n    United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded this matter to the Court \r\n    for further proceedings.  Jinks v. Richland County, ___ U.S. ___, 123 \r\n    S.Ct. 1667, 155 L.Ed.2d 631 (2003).  Accordingly, this opinion addresses Countyâ€™s \r\n    remaining issues.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  In its Statement of Issues on Appeal, County also asserts the lower \r\n    court erred by failing to grant its motions for a directed verdict and judgment \r\n    notwithstanding the verdict on the basis of sovereign immunity.  See \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (Supp. 2002).  Since County failed to argue this \r\n    issue in the body of its brief, the issue is deemed abandoned.  First Savings \r\n    Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (issues not argued \r\n    in the brief are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal); Fields \r\n    v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 536 S.E.2d 684 (Ct. App. 2000) (same).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  It is undisputed Jinks did not verbally convey this complaint to \r\n    the detention center staff, but rather the staff interpreted Jinksâ€™ symptoms \r\n    as possible delirium tremens.   \r\n  \r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Officer Williams admitted his incident report, transcribed the day \r\n    of Jinksâ€™ death, does not indicate he asked Jinks to get off the floor.  Similarly,  \r\n    Officer Williamsâ€™ deposition testimony does not state he asked Jinks to get \r\n    off the floor. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Jinksâ€™ prescription, filled by an outside pharmacy, arrived after \r\n    he had passed away.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  Dr. Bower suggested, when the \r\n    officers saw Jinks on the cell floor hours before his death, he could have \r\n    been recovering from a seizure rather than sleeping.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  County argues Jinks offered no testimony as to the actions of its \r\n    employees between 2:30 p.m. on October 17 and 6:00 a.m. on October 18.  Officer \r\n    Williams testified the officers on other shifts had his same duties and would \r\n    have been aware Jinks was under medical observation.  The inference from his \r\n    testimony suggests that from 2:30 p.m. on October 17 to 6:00 a.m. on October \r\n    18, Jinks received the same degree of attention that he received from Officer \r\n    Williams.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  See Discussion I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25691","title":"Huggins v.

We hold South Carolina does not recognize such a cause of \r\n  action.\r\nFACTS \r\nPlaintiff P. Kenneth Huggins, Jr., (Huggins) brought this action in federal \r\n  court against Defendants Citibank, N.A., Capital One Services, Inc., and Premier \r\n  Bankcard, Inc., (the Banks) claiming the Banks negligently issued credit cards \r\n  to an unknown imposter, â€œJohn Doe.â€  The complaint alleged Doe applied for a \r\n  credit card, asserting he was Huggins.  Doe then used the credit cards, but \r\n  failed to pay the Banks.  \r\nHuggins alleged the Banks were negligent in various ways:  1) issuing the credit \r\n  cards without any investigation, verification, or corroboration of Doeâ€™s identity; \r\n  2) failing to adopt policies reasonably designed to verify the identity of credit \r\n  card applicants; 3) adopting policies designed to result in the issuance of \r\n  credit cards without verifying the identity of applicants; and 4) attempting \r\n  to collect Doeâ€™s debt from Huggins.  Huggins asserted, as a result of the Banksâ€™ \r\n  issuance of credit cards to Doe, his credit was damaged, he was â€œhounded by \r\n  collection agencies,â€ he was distressed and embarrassed, and he expended much \r\n  time and effort attempting to rectify the damage, with only partial success. [1] \r\nThe Banks filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. \r\n  P., contending the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could \r\n  be granted.  The Banks asserted they owed no duty to Huggins because he was \r\n  not their customer.  Huggins disagreed, arguing the Banks have a duty to protect \r\n  potential victims of identity theft from imposter fraud.    \r\nISSUE \r\nThe Court agreed to answer the following question certified from the United \r\n  States District Court for the District of South Carolina:  \r\n\r\n  Does South Carolina recognize the tort of negligent enablement of imposter \r\n    fraud and, if so, what are the elements of the tort and does plaintiffâ€™s complaint \r\n    state an actionable claim for the tort?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn order to establish a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following \r\n  elements: 1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, 2) a breach \r\n  of that duty by negligent act or omission, and 3) damage proximately caused \r\n  by the breach.  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 548 S.E.2d 854 (2001).  \r\n  An essential element in a cause of action for negligence is the existence of \r\n  a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.  Id.   In \r\n  a negligence action, the court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the \r\n  defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.  Faile v. South Carolina \r\n  Dept. of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 566 S.E.2d 536 (2002).  If there \r\n  is no duty, the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Simmons \r\n  v. Tuomey Regional Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 533 S.E.2d 312 (2000).  \r\nDuty is generally defined as â€œthe obligation to conform to a particular standard \r\n  of conduct toward another.â€  Hubbard v. Taylor, 339 S.C. 582, 588, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 549, 552 (2000), quoting Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, \r\n  Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 483, 238 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1977); see Prosser \r\n  and Keaton On the Law of Torts Â§ 53 (5th ed. 1984) (â€œ . . .  â€˜dutyâ€™ is a \r\n  question of whether the defendant is under any obligation for the benefit of \r\n  the particular plaintiff; and in negligence cases, the duty is always the same \r\n  - to conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in the light of the \r\n  apparent risk.  What the defendant must do, or must not do, is a question of \r\n  the standard of conduct required to satisfy the duty.â€). \r\nDuty arises from the relationship between the alleged tortfeasor and the injured \r\n  party.  South Carolina Ports Authority v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., \r\n  289 S.C. 373, 346 S.E.2d 324 (1986).  In order for negligence liability to attach, \r\n  the parties must have a relationship recognized by law as the foundation of \r\n  a duty of care.  Ravan v. Greenville County, 315 S.C. 447, 434 S.E.2d \r\n  296 (Ct. App. 1993).  In the absence of a duty to prevent an injury, foreseeability \r\n  of that injury is an insufficient basis on which to rest liability.  South \r\n  Carolina Ports Authority v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, supra.  The \r\n  concept of duty in tort liability will not be extended beyond reasonable limits.  \r\n  Morris v. Mooney, 288 S.C. 447, 343 S.E.2d 442 (1986) (employer has no \r\n  duty to employeeâ€™s wife to investigate or prevent employeeâ€™s adulterous relationship \r\n  with co-employee).    \r\nIn Polzer v. TRW, Inc., 682 N.Y.S.2d 194 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998), individuals \r\n  in whose names an imposter had obtained credit cards sued the credit card issuers \r\n  for negligent enablement of imposter fraud.  A New York appellate division court \r\n  held summary judgment was properly granted because New York did not recognize \r\n  a cause of action for negligent enablement of imposter fraud.  The court stated \r\n  the defendant credit card issuers â€œhad no relationship either with the imposter \r\n  who stole the plaintiffsâ€™ credit information and fraudulently obtained credit \r\n  cards, or with plaintiffs, with whom they stood simply in a creditor/debtor \r\n  relationship.â€  Id. at 195.  At least one other court has relied on the \r\n  New York decision.  Smith v. Citibank, 2001 WL 34079057 (W.D. Mo. 2001) \r\n  (credit card issuer not liable in negligence to plaintiff where imposter applied \r\n  for and received credit card in plaintiffâ€™s name because credit card company \r\n  has no duty to plaintiff, a noncustomer).\r\nWe are greatly concerned about the rampant growth of \r\n  identity theft and financial fraud in this country.  Moreover, we are certain \r\n  that some identity theft could be prevented if credit card issuers carefully \r\n  scrutinized credit card applications.  Nevertheless, we agree with the New York \r\n  appellate court decision in Polzer v. TRW, Inc., supra, and decline \r\n  to recognize a legal duty of care between credit card issuers and those individuals \r\n  whose identities may be stolen.  The relationship, if any, between credit card \r\n  issuers and potential victims of identity theft is far too attenuated to rise \r\n  to the level of a duty between them. [2]   Even though it is foreseeable that injury may arise by the \r\n  negligent issuance of a credit card, foreseeability alone does not give rise \r\n  to a duty.  South Carolina Ports Authority v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, \r\n  supra.   \r\nFinally, we note that various state and national legislation provides at least \r\n  some remedy for victims of credit card fraud.  See Pub. L. No. 107-56, \r\n  115 Stat. 272 (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \r\n  Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001); 15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1681 \r\n  (Fair Credit Reporting Act) (1998); 15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1692(d) (1998) (Fair Debt \r\n  Collection Practices Act); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-500 to -530 (2003) (South \r\n  Carolina Personal Financial Security Act); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-5-108(2) (2002) \r\n  (South Carolina Consumer Protection Code).  While these regulations may not \r\n  fully compensate victims of identity theft for all of their injury, we conclude \r\n  the legislative arena is better equipped to assess and address the impact of \r\n  credit card fraud on victims and  financial institutions alike.    \r\nSince there is no duty on the part of credit card issuers \r\n  to protect potential victims of identity theft, we answer the certified question \r\n  negatively:  South Carolina does not recognize the tort of negligent enablement \r\n  of imposter fraud.  See  South Carolina State Ports Authority v. Booz-Allen \r\n  &amp; Hamilton, Inc., supra (absence of any element of negligence \r\n  renders cause of action insufficient).  \r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, an individual cannot be held liable \r\n    for charges incurred on a credit card for which the individual did not apply \r\n    and did not receive.  15 U.S.C.

Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Petitioner, James W. Sprouse, argues \r\n  that the post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€) court erred in denying his application \r\n  for PCR.     \r\nFactual / Procedural Background \r\nOn May 22, 1998, Petitioner pled \r\n  guilty to second-degree burglary, violent, in Newberry County (â€œNewberry pleaâ€).  \r\n  Petitioner was represented by counsel and was sentenced to 12 years, suspended \r\n  on service of 10 years, to run concurrent with all other sentences, and to begin \r\n  running June 15, 1997.  On June 2, 1998, Petitioner pled guilty to three counts \r\n  of second-degree burglary, violent, and one count of safecracking in Laurens \r\n  County (â€œLaurens pleaâ€). [1]   Petitioner was not represented by counsel \r\n  during the Laurens plea, and was sentenced to 12 years for each offense, suspended \r\n  on the service of 10 years, to run concurrent with each other and with the sentence \r\n  Petitioner was already serving. [2] \r\n    \r\nAt the Newberry plea, Eighth \r\n  Circuit Assistant Solicitor Jerry Pearce described the Stateâ€™s agreement with \r\n  Petitioner as follows:  \r\n\r\n  The agreement we have reached with the defendant and his attorney is that \r\n    he receive a sentence of 12 years, and that be suspended to 10 years, and \r\n    that we would nol-pross the other charges on the indictment. That those charges \r\n    would run concurrent with any charges he has pending in Laurens County, and \r\n    that the sentence will begin on June 15, 1997. . . .  The sentence in Laurens \r\n    would be nonviolent.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  At the Laurens \r\n  plea just a week or so later, Eighth Circuit Assistant Solicitor Benjamin L. \r\n  Shealy classified the burglaries as violent offenses, and then recommended Petitioner \r\n  be sentenced to 12 years suspended on service of 10 years, to run concurrent, \r\n  beginning June 15, 1997.  \r\nPetitioner did not file a direct \r\n  appeal from the Newberry or Laurens pleas.  Petitioner filed an application \r\n  for PCR, alleging that ineffective assistance of counsel caused his pleas to \r\n  be involuntary.  The PCR court denied relief, and this Court granted certiorari \r\n  to review the following issue: [3] \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PCR judge err in finding that Petitionerâ€™s \r\n      pleas were voluntary despite Petitionerâ€™s claim that the State failed to \r\n      honor the plea agreement it made with Petitioner on the Newberry and Laurens \r\n      charges?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that the State failed to honor the plea agreement it made \r\n  with him regarding his Newberry and Laurens burglary charges.  He argues that \r\n  this failure and the ineffective assistance of his Newberry attorney in failing \r\n  to ensure that the State adhered to the plea agreement on the Laurens charges \r\n  rendered both of his pleas involuntary.  We agree.\r\nIn Santobello v. New York, the United States Supreme Court established \r\n  that state prosecutors are obligated to fulfill the promises they make to defendants \r\n  when those promises serve as inducements to defendants to plead guilty.  404 \r\n  U.S. 257, 92 S. Ct. 495, 30 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1971).  In Santobello, the \r\n  Assistant District Attorney negotiated with the defendant and agreed to permit \r\n  him to plead guilty to a lesser-included offense, conviction of which would \r\n  result in a maximum prison sentence of one year.  404 U.S. at 258, 92 S. Ct. \r\n  at 497, 30 L. Ed. 2d at 431.  In addition, the prosecutor agreed to make no \r\n  sentence recommendation.  Id.  The court accepted the guilty plea and \r\n  set a date for sentencing.  Id.  At the sentencing, another prosecutor \r\n  appeared for the state, and the prosecutor that originally negotiated the plea \r\n  was not present.  Id. at 259, 92 S. Ct. at 497, 30 L. Ed. 2d at 431.  \r\n  This new prosecutor recommended that the judge impose the one-year maximum sentence \r\n  in violation of the defendantâ€™s plea agreement with the original prosecutor.  \r\n  Id.  \r\nRecognizing the fundamental rights that a defendant \r\n  forfeits when he pleads guilty, the Supreme Court made the following statements:  \r\n\r\n\r\n   This phase of the process of criminal justice, and the adjudicative element \r\n    inherent in accepting a plea of guilty, must be attended by safeguards to \r\n    insure the defendant what is reasonably due in the circumstances.  Those circumstances \r\n    will vary, but a constant factor is that when a plea rests in any significant \r\n    degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said \r\n    to be part of the inducement of consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nId. at 262, 92 S. Ct. at 499, 30 L. Ed. 2d \r\n  at 433.  The Court found that the state had promised to abstain from making \r\n  a sentencing recommendation, and that the promise of one prosecutor in the office \r\n  bound all prosecutors in the office.  Id.   The Court found it unnecessary \r\n  to engage in a prejudice analysis, concluding that â€œthe interests of justice \r\n  and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to \r\n  promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty will be best served by remanding \r\n  the case to the jury for further consideration.â€  Id. at 262-63, 92 S. \r\n  Ct. at 499, 30 L. Ed. 2d at 433.\r\nThis Court has recognized the principles espoused in Santobello on numerous \r\n  occasions.  State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341 (1994); \r\n  State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 5, 292 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1982) (â€œ[Santobello] \r\n  stands for the proposition that when an accused pleads guilty upon the promise \r\n  of a prosecutor, the agreement must be fulfilled.â€). [4]   In Thrift, this Court contemplated \r\n  the common problem of how to uncover the terms of an oral plea agreement.  \r\n  312 S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341.  The Court resolved this issue prospectively by \r\n  establishing a bright line rule limiting its review of plea agreements â€œto those \r\n  terms which are fully set forth in the record.â€  Id. at 295, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  at 348.  \r\nIn the present case, the PCR court denied Petitioner relief, finding his claim \r\n  that the State failed to fulfill the terms of his negotiated plea to be â€œwithout \r\n  credible evidentiary support.â€  Based on this Courtâ€™s holding in Thrift, \r\n  this Courtâ€™s review of a plea agreement is limited to the terms set forth in \r\n  the record.  During his recitation of Petitionerâ€™s plea agreement at the Newberry \r\n  plea, Assistant Solicitor Pearce stated, â€œ[t]he sentence in Laurens would be \r\n  nonviolent.â€ \r\nIn our opinion, the subsequent classification by Assistant Solicitor Shealy \r\n  of the Laurens offenses as violent can only be interpreted as a deviation \r\n  from the original plea agreement. [5]   The State argues that the classification of \r\n  the Laurens offenses as violent was the result of further negotiations with \r\n  Petitioner and represented a concession by Petitioner in return for the State \r\n  agreeing to drop charges pending against his sister.  Unfortunately, this \r\n  change in the plea agreement is not represented in the record, and, in the \r\n  face of Thriftâ€™s bright line rule, cannot be considered by this Court.\r\n In Santobello, the Supreme Court applied what amounts to a per se \r\n  prejudice analysis after it found the defendantâ€™s plea agreement had not been \r\n  fulfilled.  404 U.S. at 262-63.  The Court reasoned, â€œ[w]e need not reach the \r\n  question whether the sentencing judge would or would not have been influenced \r\n  had he known all the details of the negotiations for the plea.â€  Id. at \r\n  262.  Recognizing the â€œinterests of justiceâ€ and the â€œduties of the prosecution \r\n  in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleasâ€ would be best served \r\n  by remanding the case to the state courts for one of two dispositions, the Court \r\n  did not conduct a prejudice analysis.  The Court indicated that the state court \r\n  could either (1) require specific performance of the plea agreement or (2) allow \r\n  Petitioner to withdraw his guilty plea altogether and start over.  Id. at \r\n  263.\r\nWe choose to require specific performance of the plea agreement in this case.  \r\n  Here, requiring specific performance is the most efficient option because it \r\n  eliminates the need for a new trial or new plea hearings, and also grants the \r\n  parties nothing more and nothing less than the benefit for which they originally \r\n  bargained.            \r\nConclusion \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the \r\n  PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief, VACATE the Laurens County sentences, and \r\n  REMAND for resentencing on the Laurens County charges consistent with \r\n  the original plea agreement.  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Newberry County and Laurens County are both in the Eighth Judicial \r\n    Circuit and, thus, the plea negotiations were handled by the same prosecuting \r\n    authority, the Eighth Circuit Solicitorâ€™s office.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In addition to the burglary sentence resulting from the Newberry \r\n    plea, Petitioner was serving a 10-year sentence for Assault and Battery with \r\n    Intent to Kill.  It is our understanding that all of Petitionerâ€™s sentences \r\n    are concurrent to each other.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  We have consolidated the issues raised by Petitioner into one question \r\n    as each of the three issues on which the Court granted certorari depends on \r\n    resolution of whether or not the solicitorâ€™s office breached Petitionerâ€™s \r\n    plea agreement.  The Newberry and Laurens pleas hatch out of one string of \r\n    crimes, and, based on Assistant Solicitor Pearceâ€™s description of the plea \r\n    agreement to the Newberry plea judge, it appears all the offenses were contemplated \r\n    together for purposes of negotiating the plea.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  See also United States v. Ringling, 988 F.2d 504 (4th \r\n    Cir. 1993).    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  As noted, both solicitors involved in this case \r\n    represent the Eighth Judicial Circuit.  Accordingly, each are bound to fulfill \r\n    the plea agreements made by the other.

This Court affirmed his convictions and \r\n  sentences on direct appeal.  State v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, 349 S.E.2d \r\n  339 (1986). \r\n Todd \r\n  applied for PCR, which was denied, and this Court denied his petition for writ \r\n  of certiorari.  In 1990, Todd petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which \r\n  was denied.  This Court denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus in 1995 \r\n  pursuant to Key v. Currie, 305 S.C. 115, 406 S.E.2d 356 (1991). \r\nIn March \r\n  1995, Todd petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in circuit court, which was \r\n  denied.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the trial judgeâ€™s reasonable \r\n  doubt charge was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the circuit court \r\n  with instructions to treat the matter as an application for PCR.  Todd v. \r\n  State, Op. No. 98-UP-252 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed May 18, 1998).  \r\nThis Court \r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s Petition for Certiorari to review the circuit courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of PCR for Todd.  The State raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge err in finding \r\n    that the trial judgeâ€™s reasonable doubt charge was unconstitutional?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\nThe State asserts that the PCR court \r\n  erred in finding that the trial judge violated Toddâ€™s constitutional right of \r\n  due process when he charged the jury on the reasonable doubt standard.  We agree.\r\nThe standard for reviewing the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s charges on reasonable doubt has evolved over the last 15 years.  In \r\n  Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990), \r\n  the United States Supreme Court held for the first time that a trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  reasonable doubt charge violated the Due Process Clause because it diminished \r\n  the high burden that the Due Process Clause requires that the state must establish.  \r\n  The Court found that the appropriate standard for determining the constitutionality \r\n  of a reasonable doubt charge is whether â€œa reasonable juror could have \r\n  interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of \r\n  proof below that required of the Due Process Clause.â€  Id. at 41, 111 \r\n  S.Ct. at 329 (emphasis added).  \r\nIn 1991, this Court adopted the Cage \r\n  â€œcould haveâ€ standard in State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  372 (1991).  The Court ruled a reasonable doubt jury charge unconstitutional \r\n  because the judge equated reasonable doubt with a â€œmoral certaintyâ€ standard \r\n  and used a definition of circumstantial evidence which required the jury to \r\n  â€œseek some reasonable explanation of the circumstances proven other than the \r\n  guilt of the [d]efendant and if such reasonable explanation can be found [the \r\n  jury] would find the [d]efendant not guilty.â€  Id. at 416, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  at 374.  The Court found that the jury charge was so confusing that a reasonable \r\n  juror â€œcould haveâ€ found the defendant guilty based on a standard that \r\n  did not reach the level of proof encompassed by the reasonable doubt standard \r\n  that is mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id. at 416-417, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  at 374-375.    \r\nThe United States Supreme Court redefined \r\n  the reasonable doubt standard in less restrictive terms in Boyde v.California, \r\n  494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990).  See also, Estelle \r\n  v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).  The new \r\n  standard became whether there was a â€œreasonable likelihoodâ€ that the \r\n  jury applied the charge in an unconstitutional manner.  Boyde, 494 U.S. \r\n  at 380, 110 S.Ct. at 1198.   \r\nWriting for the United States Supreme \r\n  Court in Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 7, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d \r\n  583 (1994), Justice Oâ€™Connor pointed out that Cage is the only case in \r\n  which the Supreme Court declared a reasonable doubt charge unconstitutional.  \r\n  The Cage charge was as follows:\r\n\r\n  [A reasonable doubt] is one that \r\n    is founded upon a real tangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice \r\n    and conjecture.  It must be such doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty, \r\n    raised in your mind by reasons of the unsatisfactory character of the evidence \r\n    or lack thereof.  A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt.  It \r\n    is an actual substantial doubt.  It is a doubt that a reasonable man can \r\n    seriously entertain.  What is required is not an absolute or mathematical \r\n    certainty, but a moral certainty.  \r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 5-6, 1145 S.Ct. at 1243 (quoting Cage, 498 U.S. at 40, 111 S.Ct. at \r\n  329) (emphasis added by the U.S. Supreme Court in Cage).  Justice Oâ€™Connor \r\n  stated that the emphasized language is what the Court in Cage found offensive \r\n  to due process.  She then wrote for the Court:\r\n\r\n  In a subsequent case, we made clear \r\n    that the proper inquiry is not whether the instruction &quot;could have&quot; \r\n    been applied in an unconstitutional manner, but whether there is a reasonable \r\n    likelihood that the jury did so apply it.  Estelle v. McGuire, \r\n    502 U.S. 62, 72 and n. 4, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482 and n. 4, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).  \r\n    The constitutional question in the present cases, therefore, is whether there \r\n    is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow \r\n    conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the Winship [1]  [reasonable doubt] standard.  \r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 6, 114 S.Ct. at 1243 (emphasis in the opinion).  The opinion then provided \r\n  a comprehensive review of the use of the phrases â€œmoral certaintyâ€ and â€œsubstantial \r\n  doubtâ€ in the American jurisprudence of reasonable doubt charges.  The Court \r\n  analyzed challenged charges from Nebraska and California in which these phrases \r\n  were used and found that neither of the phrases automatically rendered a reasonable \r\n  doubt charge constitutionally defective.  The Court held:\r\n\r\n  The Due Process Clause requires \r\n    the government to prove a criminal defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, \r\n    and trial courts must avoid defining reasonable doubt so as to lead the jury \r\n    to convict on a lesser showing than due process requires. In these cases, \r\n    however, we conclude that &quot;taken as a whole, the instructions correctly \r\n    conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.&quot;  Holland v. \r\n    United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954).  \r\n    There is no reasonable likelihood that the jurors who determined petitioners' \r\n    guilt applied the instructions in a way that violated the Constitution. \r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 22-23, 114 S.Ct. at 1251.    \r\nPost Victor, it is clear that \r\n  under the â€œreasonable likelihoodâ€ standard, many charges which would be found \r\n  defective under Cage are now held to meet the due process requirements. [2] \r\n In the instant matter, the PCR court \r\n  order, [3]  relying heavily on the Cage \r\n  standard and this Courtâ€™s adoption of that standard in Manning, found \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence charges unconstitutional.  \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge in this case set \r\n  forth this reasonable doubt standard for the jury before evidence was presented:\r\n\r\n  The term â€œreasonable doubtâ€ means \r\n    exactly what it implies.  It is a reasonable doubt.  The definition which \r\n    I prefer is that a reasonable doubt is a substantial doubt for which \r\n    a person honestly seeking to find the truth can give a reason.\r\n\r\nAt the \r\n  close of evidence, the judge again instructed the jury on reasonable doubt:\r\n\r\n  Ladies and gentlemen, when I use \r\n    the term â€œreasonable,â€ what we mean there is that that is not some whimsical \r\n    or imaginary doubt.  Nor is it a slight, fanciful, or weak doubt.  It is none \r\n    of those things.  I charge you that a reasonable doubt is a substantial \r\n    doubt arising out of the testimony or lack of testimony in the case for \r\n    which a person honestly seeking to find the truth can give a reason.  If you \r\n    have such a doubt in your mind as to whether the State has proven this defendant \r\n    guilty, of course, you must resolve that doubt in his favor, and write a verdict \r\n    of not guilty.  If, however, on the other hand, the State of South Carolina, \r\n    through the Solicitorâ€™s Office, has established the guilt of the defendant \r\n    beyond a reasonable doubt, it would equally be your duty under your oath to \r\n    return a verdict of guilty.\r\n\r\nThe judge \r\n  continued as he gave the charge of circumstantial evidence and reasonable doubt:\r\n\r\n  Circumstantial evidence is good, \r\n    provided it meets the legal test to the extent that the State relies on circumstantial \r\n    evidence.  It must prove all the circumstances relied on beyond a reasonable \r\n    doubt.  They must wholly and in every particular perfectly consistent with \r\n    one another.  They must point conclusively, that is, to the moral certainty \r\n    of the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable \r\n    hypothesis, that is, they must be absolutely inconsistent with any reasonable \r\n    hypthesis other than the guilt of the accused.  \r\n\r\n        . \r\n  . . \r\nThe two phrases \r\n  â€œbeyond a reasonable doubtâ€ and â€œproof to a moral certaintyâ€ are synonymous \r\n  and the legal equivalent of each other.\r\nThe PCR \r\n  judge focused on similar language that was found in both the Manning \r\n  and Todd instructions, for example, equating â€œreasonable doubtâ€ with \r\n  â€œmoral certainty,â€ and asking the jury to â€œseekâ€ to find a reasonable explanation \r\n  other than the defendantâ€™s guilt, which lowered the standard to something below \r\n  reasonable doubt as defined by the Cage-Manning standard.  The judge \r\n  also pointed out that this Court had had many opportunities to adopt the Estelle-Victor \r\n  standard but failed to do so.  \r\nThis Court finally adopted the Estelle-Victor \r\n  â€œreasonable likelihoodâ€ standard in 2000 in State v. Aleksey, \r\n  343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000). Accordingly, we will apply that standard \r\n  to this matter.  \r\nFurther, \r\n  jury charges should be examined in their entirety and not in isolation in analyzing \r\n  whether the defendantâ€™s due process rights have been violated.  State v. \r\n  Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994).  A complete review of the jury \r\n  instruction in this case evinces an appropriate charge of the reasonable doubt \r\n  and circumstantial evidence standards.  While the trial judge equated â€œreasonable \r\n  doubtâ€ with â€œmoral certainty,â€ he also used alternative methods of describing \r\n  the standard.  He said:\r\n\r\n  Our South Carolina Supreme Court \r\n    has stated this presumption of innocence is like a robe of righteousness placed \r\n    about the shoulders of the defendant, and it remains with him and assigns \r\n    him to that class, the innocent, until that presumptive robe of righteousness \r\n    has been stripped from his body by evidence satisfying you of that guilt beyond \r\n    a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  charge on circumstantial evidence is almost verbatim of the charge this Court \r\n  directed be given in Manning.  305 S.C at 317, 409 S.E.2d at 374 (citing \r\n  State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989).   \r\nWhile the trial judge mentioned â€œmoral \r\n  certainty,â€ which is part of the charge that the Manning court disfavored, \r\n  â€œthe moral certainty language cannot be sequestered from its surroundings.â€  \r\n  Victor, 511 U.S. at 16, 114 S.Ct. at 1248.  We find that the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  careful and exhaustive articulation of the reasonable doubt and circumstantial \r\n  evidence standard, when examined in its entirety, effectively communicated the \r\n  high burden of proof that the state was required to establish by the Constitution.  \r\n  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe reiterate our \r\n  adherence to the Estelle-Victor standard as adopted in the Aleksey \r\n  decision, which states that the standard of review of a reasonable doubt instruction \r\n  is â€œwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged \r\n  instruction in a way that violates the Constitution.â€  Aleksey, 343 \r\n  S.C. at 27, 538 S.E.2d at 251.  We find that there is no reasonable likelihood \r\n  that the jurors who determined Toddâ€™s guilt applied the judgeâ€™s instruction \r\n  in a way that violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \r\n  Accordingly, we REVERSE the PCR judgeâ€™s grant of this application.  \r\nMOORE, WALLER \r\n  and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n  \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.  In my opinion, the record supports the post-conviction relief (PCR) \r\n  judgeâ€™s findings that the jury charge given at respondentâ€™s trial violated the \r\n  Due Process Clause.  Further, I find there is a reasonable likelihood that the \r\n  jury applied the instructions in a way that violates the Constitution.  Accordingly, \r\n  I would affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s order granting respondent a new trial.\r\nThis matter comes before the Court \r\n  in an unusual procedural posture.  In 1998, the Court of Appeals remanded the \r\n  case to the circuit court with instructions that the case be treated as one \r\n  involving a claim for PCR, and that the issue to be decided was whether â€œthe \r\n  reasonable doubt instruction given in [respondentâ€™s] trial was unconstitutionalâ€¦.â€  \r\n  Todd v. State, 98-UP-252 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 18, 1998).  To the \r\n  extent the State now argues that we should decide whether the reasonable doubt \r\n  charge cases decided since respondent was tried should be applied retroactively, \r\n  its argument comes too late. The State did not seek certiorari to review the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ 1998 decision, and therefore the law of this case is that \r\n  the â€œCage-Victorâ€ [4]  \r\n  standard applies retroactively.  See, e.g., ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, \r\n  L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997) (unchallenged \r\n  ruling, whether correct or not, is law of the case). Further, because this case \r\n  comes before us in the posture of a PCR certiorari, we must uphold the factual \r\n  findings in the order if supported by any probative evidence in the record.  \r\n  E.g., Tate v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 570 S.E.2d 522 (2002).\r\nThe PCR judge found, correctly in \r\n  my view, that the charge given in respondentâ€™s trial unconstitutionally diluted \r\n  the Stateâ€™s burden to prove respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Specifically, \r\n  the PCR judge found the charge instructed the jury that: (1) reasonable doubt \r\n  was synonymous with moral certainty; (2) reasonable doubt meant a â€œdoubt which \r\n  honest people, such as you, when searching for the truth can give a real reasonâ€ \r\n  and (3) it was required to seek some reasonable explanation other than the accusedâ€™s \r\n  guilt when considering the circumstantial evidence in this case.  The majority \r\n  view, in my opinion, minimizes the multiple deficiencies in the charges \r\n  by stressing only the â€˜moral certaintyâ€™ language.  The majority then holds that \r\n  the â€˜robe of righteousnessâ€™ portion of the instructions, coupled with the â€˜goodâ€™ \r\n  circumstantial evidence charge, effectively cured any constitutional infirmities.  \r\n  I disagree.\r\n In State v. Manning, 305 \r\n  S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d 372 (1991), we approved a circumstantial evidence charge \r\n  derived from earlier decisions:\r\n \r\n  [E]very circumstance relied upon \r\n    by the State [must] be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and â€¦ all of the \r\n    circumstances so proven [must] be consistent with each other and taken together, \r\n    point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other \r\n    reasonable hypothesis.  It is not sufficient that they create a probability, \r\n    though a strong one and if, assuming them to be true they may be accounted \r\n    for upon any reasonable hypothesis which does not include the guilt of the \r\n    accused, the proof has failed.\r\n  \r\n    Id., citing State \r\n      v. Edwards, 295 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 858 (1989), citing State \r\n      v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955).\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the \r\n  circumstantial evidence charge given in respondentâ€™s trial was:\r\n \r\n  Circumstantial evidence is good, \r\n    provided it meets the legal test to the extent that the State relies on circumstantial \r\n    evidence.  It must prove all the circumstances relied on beyond a reasonable \r\n    doubt.  They must be wholly and in every particular perfectly consistent with \r\n    one another.  They must point conclusively, that is, to the moral certainty \r\n    to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis, \r\n    that is, they must be absolutely inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis \r\n    other than the guilt of the accused.\r\n  In other words, in the consideration \r\n    of circumstantial evidence, the jury must seek some reasonable explanation \r\n    thereof other than the guilt of the accused, and if such reasonable explanation \r\n    can be found, you cannot convict on such evidence.  Of course, you can consider \r\n    the circumstantial evidence along with all the direct evidence that you heard \r\n    from this witness stand.\r\n   I charge you further that the \r\n    mere fact that the circumstances are strongly suspicious and the defendantâ€™s \r\n    guilt probable, is not sufficient to sustain a conviction because the proof \r\n    offered by the State must exclude every other reasonable hypothesis except \r\n    that of guilt, and must satisfy you the jury of that guilt beyond a reasonable \r\n    doubt.\r\n  The two phrases â€œbeyond a reasonable \r\n    doubt,â€ and, â€œproof to a moral certaintyâ€ are synonymous and the legal equivalent \r\n    of each other.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\nViewing the circumstantial evidence \r\n  charge here in its entirety, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s characterization \r\n  of this charge as â€œalmost verbatimâ€ the Edwards charge approved in State \r\n  v. Manning, supra.  In my opinion, respondentâ€™s circumstantial evidence \r\n  charge was riddled with burden shifting language and cannot be said to â€˜remedyâ€™ \r\n  other constitutional infirmities in the charge.\r\nI find there is some evidence of \r\n  probative value in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that the charge \r\n  unconstitutionally lessened the Stateâ€™s burden of proof.  This factual finding \r\n  should therefore be upheld.  Tate v. State, supra.\r\nThe more difficult issue in this \r\n  case is whether it can be said â€œthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury \r\n  applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the Constitution.â€  \r\n  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 27, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2000). \r\n  [5]   In Aleksey, we found no reversible error where the trial judge \r\n  made a single isolated reference to the juryâ€™s â€œduty to seek the truthâ€ in the \r\n  context of the charge on witness credibility.  Here, however, the charge is \r\n  rife with constitutional error, especially in the context of the circumstantial \r\n  evidence portion, in a case in which the State relied largely on circumstantial \r\n  evidence to prove respondent assaulted the victim with the intent to commit \r\n  first degree criminal sexual conduct, and then killed her.  I would therefore \r\n  affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s order granting respondent a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. \r\n    1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), the U.S. Supreme Court proclaimed that the Due \r\n    Process Clause mandates that the government prove every element of the charged \r\n    offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  A year before Victor was issued, in 1993, \r\n    Acting Justice Goolsby recognized the stricter Estelle standard in \r\n    his dissent in State v. Charping, 313 S.C. 147, 167, 437 S.E.2d 88, \r\n    99 (1993), where he found that the jury charge did not violate defendantâ€™s \r\n    due process rights.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Written in December, 1999.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39 (1990); \r\n    Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1 (1994).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  The PCR judge decided this case before we issued \r\n    our opinion in Aleksey, and therefore applied the less rigorous pre-Aleksey \r\n    standard: whether a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction \r\n    to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that required \r\n    of the Due Process Clause.  State v. Manning, supra.  Given \r\n    the protracted nature of this litigation, I agree that we should decide the \r\n    question presented under the Aleksey standard rather than remand the \r\n    case to the circuit court with instructions to redecide the matter applying \r\n    the correct standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25694","title":"State v.

We \r\n  affirm in result.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nTaylor was charged with violating \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-515(1) (1991) which provides:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for any person to \r\n    alter a motor vehicle driverâ€™s license so as to provide false information \r\n    on the license or to sell or issue a fictitious driverâ€™s license.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  At trial, the \r\n  State presented evidence that on April 24, 1998, Taylor was working as a manager \r\n  at the Walterboro Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) when she processed driverâ€™s \r\n  licenses for two illegal Mexican immigrants without requiring any identification, \r\n  written exams, or driving tests.\r\nLilia Macias testified she made arrangements \r\n  with one Maria Cortez who agreed to take Macias to the DMV and ensure she received \r\n  a driverâ€™s license without the necessary documentation in exchange for $1,000.  \r\n  Macias received her license as promised after giving only her name and birthdate, \r\n  taking a vision test, and paying the $12.50 application fee.  Macias identified \r\n  Taylor as the person who processed her license.  Armando Ramirez testified to \r\n  receiving a license in the same manner from Taylor on the same day.  Neither \r\n  one ever paid Cortez and there is no evidence Taylor received any money for \r\n  her part in processing the licenses.  \r\nAfter the Stateâ€™s case, Taylor moved \r\n  for a directed verdict.  The trial judge denied the motion.  The jury then returned \r\n  a guilty verdict on both counts.  On post-trial motion for a verdict in arrest \r\n  of judgment, Taylor reargued the substance of her directed verdict motion.  \r\n  The trial judge granted the motion and entered a verdict of acquittal.\r\nOn appeal by the State, [2]  the Court of Appeals found it \r\n  was inappropriate procedurally for the trial judge to grant Taylorâ€™s motion \r\n  for a verdict in arrest of judgment based on the sufficiency of the evidence; \r\n  moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support a charge of issuing a fictitious \r\n  license.  The Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated Taylorâ€™s convictions.  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n\r\n\r\n  Was a verdict in arrest of judgment \r\n    properly granted on these facts?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  Taylor contends the Court of Appeals should not have reversed \r\n    based on the procedural inappropriateness of a verdict in arrest of judgment \r\n    because the State never argued this defect below.  We agree.\r\n\r\nIt is well-settled that a verdict \r\n  in arrest of judgment should not be granted based on the insufficiency of the \r\n  evidence; the proper remedy is a new trial.  State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. \r\n  305, 297 S.E.2d 414 (1982); State v. Syphrett, 27 S.C. 29, 2 S.E. 624 \r\n  (1887); State v. Hamilton, 17 S.C. 462 (1882).  Because the State never \r\n  argued this procedural bar to the trial court, the issue was not preserved for \r\n  appeal and the Court of Appeals should not have reversed on this ground.  We \r\n  find, however, that the Court of Appeals properly reversed the verdict of acquittal \r\n  based on the sufficiency of the evidence. \r\n  [3]   \r\nTaylor concedes she processed the \r\n  two driverâ€™s licenses without requiring the necessary documentation or tests.  \r\n  Her argument is that although she processed the licenses, the DMV issued \r\n  them, and therefore they are not â€œfictitious licensesâ€ as a matter of law.  \r\n  Taylor contends Â§ 56-1-515(1) should apply only to licenses manufactured by \r\n  others outside the DMV.  \r\nFirst, although the license is issued \r\n  under the authority of the DMV, the license is physically â€œissuedâ€ by the employee \r\n  who processes the application.  The employeeâ€™s actions therefore are fairly \r\n  encompassed within the statutory term â€œissue.â€  \r\nFurther, a license issued by an employee \r\n  of DMV may still be â€œfictitious.â€  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-19-50 (1991) \r\n  provides:\r\n \r\n  Â§ 56-19-50.  Department \r\n    shall seize expired, fictitious and certain other certificates, cards, permits, \r\n    licenses, and plates. [4] \r\n  \r\n    The Department may take possession \r\n      of any . . . license . . . issued by it (a) upon expiration, revocation, \r\n      cancellation or suspension thereof, (b) which is fictitious or (c) which \r\n      has been unlawfully or erroneously issued.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  Under this section, \r\n  a license issued by DMV may be â€œfictitious.â€  \r\nWe construe Â§ 56-1-515(1) to require \r\n  that the issuance of a â€œfictitiousâ€ license is unlawful if knowingly done.  \r\n  See State v. Ferguson, 302 S.C. 269, 395 S.E.2d 182 (1990) (unless \r\n  otherwise indicated, prohibited act must be accompanied by criminal intent); \r\n  State v. Rothschild, 351 S.C. 238, 596 S.E.2d 346 (2002) (construing \r\n  statute to include an element of intent to avoid vagueness).  Accordingly, a \r\n  DMV employee who processes a driverâ€™s license based on information she knew \r\n  or should have known was fictitious is guilty under Â§ 56-1-515(1) for issuing \r\n  a fictitious license.\r\nHere, the fact that Taylor never \r\n  demanded any documentation from Macias or Ramirez is evidence she knew or should \r\n  have known the information she used to process the licenses was fictitious.  \r\n  Further, there is evidence neither applicant gave a social security number although \r\n  the computer would not complete the application process without one, indicating \r\n  Taylor fabricated social security numbers for the two applicants.  Neither applicant \r\n  gave Taylor an address and neither lived at the address on the license, again \r\n  indicating Taylor fabricated the information.  This evidence was sufficient \r\n  to support Taylorâ€™s convictions under Â§ 56-1-515(1).  \r\nWe find the Court of Appeals \r\ncorrectly ruled that the trial judge improperly entered a verdict of acquittal \r\nbased on the sufficiency of the evidence. \r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] 348 S.C. 152, 558 S.E.2d 917 (Ct.

We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nJerry Hardee (Husband) and Mary Hardee \r\n  (Wife) met in 1986, while Wife was working as officer manager for the law firm \r\n  which was handling Husbandâ€™s second divorce.  Both Husband and Wife had children \r\n  from prior marriages.  Wife moved into Husbandâ€™s home in April 1987, and they \r\n  lived together until December 24, 1988, when Husband proposed.  They planned \r\n  a March 18, 1989 wedding day.  In early February 1989, Husband presented Wife \r\n  with a prenuptial agreement drafted by his attorney (Miles).  Wife showed the \r\n  agreement to her employer/attorney (Young), who advised her not to sign it.  \r\n  Although Wife was upset about the agreement, she signed it on February 22, 1989.  \r\n  The parties were married on March 18, 1989.  \r\nThe prenuptial agreement noted that \r\n  Wife, age 41 at the time, had diabetes and sponge kidneys.  It also provided, \r\n  inter alia:  \r\n \r\n  1. That all properties of any kind \r\n    or nature, real, personal or mixed, wheresoever the same may be located, which \r\n    belong to each party, shall be and forever remain the personal estate of the \r\n    said party, including all interest, rents, and properties which may accrue \r\n    therefrom unless otherwise so stated in this Agreement.\r\n  4. That each party, in the event \r\n    of separation or divorce, shall have no right against the other by way of \r\n    claims for support, alimony, attorneyâ€™s fees, cost, or division of property, \r\n    except as specifically stated hereinafter.\r\n  7. It is specifically understood \r\n    and agreed that should a separation or divorce occur between the parties, \r\n    each of the parties would maintain all of their property as if the marriage \r\n    had never occurred and each of the parties will have no interest whatsoever \r\n    in the property of the other except as hereinafter provided. \r\n  9. The provisions contained herein \r\n    shall in no way affect the property, whether real, personal or mixed which \r\n    shall be acquired by the parties, whether titled separately or jointly, subsequent \r\n    to the date of this Agreement.  \r\n  10 . . . Each party acknowledges \r\n    that they shall have no right against the other by way of claim for support, \r\n    alimony, attorney fees, costs or division of property, except as stated within \r\n    this agreement.  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Wife discovered Husband \r\n  was having an affair with another woman.  As a result, Husband left the marital \r\n  home.  Thereafter, Wife instituted this action seeking a divorce on grounds \r\n  of adultery, habitual drunkenness, and physical cruelty.  She sought alimony, \r\n  spousal support, equitable distribution of marital property, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.  The family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery.  The \r\n  family court also ruled the waivers of alimony, spousal support and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees were contrary to public policy and void; it further held the agreement \r\n  did not bar equitable division of property acquired during the marriage.  The \r\n  court also found that there had been a substantial and material change in circumstances \r\n  since the execution of the agreement inasmuch as Wife was, at the time of the \r\n  final hearing, totally disabled and unable to support herself. \r\n  [1]   The family court awarded Wife permanent periodic alimony of $4,250 \r\n  per month and ruled that property acquired by the parties during the marriage \r\n  be divided with Husband receiving 70% of the assets and Wife receiving 30%.  \r\n  Lastly, the family court awarded Wife $85,000 in attorney fees and $15,000 in \r\n  accounting fees and costs. \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed in \r\n  part and reversed in part.  348 S.C. 84, 558 S.E.2d 264 (2001).  The Court upheld \r\n  the family courtâ€™s determination that the prenuptial agreement did not bar the \r\n  equitable division of property acquired by the parties during the marriage.   \r\n  However, it held the family court erred in finding the waivers of alimony, support, \r\n  and attorney fees were void and unconscionable.  Both parties appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Did the Court of Appeals err \r\n    in upholding the family courtâ€™s determination that the prenuptial agreement \r\n    did not bar equitable distribution of property acquired during the marriage?  \r\n    (Husbandâ€™s Appeal).\r\n  2. Did the Court of Appeals err \r\n    in holding that the prenuptial agreementâ€™s provisions relating to alimony, \r\n    support, and attorneyâ€™s fees were not unconscionable or contrary to public \r\n    policy?  (Wifeâ€™s Appeal).\r\n\r\n 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION\r\nHusband argues the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in holding the prenuptial agreement allowed for equitable distribution \r\n  of assets acquired by the parties during the marriage.  We disagree. [2]   As noted previously, paragraph 9 of the agreement \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  9. The provisions contained herein \r\n    shall in no way affect the property, whether real, personal or mixed which \r\n    shall be acquired by the parties, whether titled separately or jointly, subsequent \r\n    to the date of this Agreement.  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  We agree with \r\n  the Court of Appeals that this provision patently and unambiguously allows Wife \r\n  equitable distribution of any and all property acquired by the parties during \r\n  the marriage, whether titled in Husbandâ€™s name, Wifeâ€™s name, or both.    \r\nWhen a contract is unambiguous, clear, \r\n  and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used.  \r\n  B.L.G. Enterprises, Inc. v. First Financial Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 514 \r\n  S.E.2d 327 (1999).  The judicial function of a court of law is to enforce a \r\n  contract as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the \r\n  guise of judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and \r\n  unambiguous.  S.S. Newell &amp; Co. v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., \r\n  199 S.C. 325, 19 S.E.2d 463 (1942).  Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  ruling concerning the equitable distribution of property acquired during the \r\n  marriage.\r\n 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   ALIMONY, SUPPORT &amp; ATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nThe issue we must decide is whether \r\n  a prenuptial agreement purporting to waive alimony, support, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees is void and unenforceable as against the public policy of this state.  \r\n  \r\nRecent case law of this Court supports \r\n  Husbandâ€™s contention  that parties are free to contractually alter the obligations \r\n  which would otherwise attach to marriage.  In Stork v. First Natâ€™l Bank of \r\n  South Carolina, 281 S.C. 515, 516, 316 S.E.2d 400, 401 (1984), this Court \r\n  held that antenuptial agreements â€œwill be enforced if made voluntarily and in \r\n  good faith and if fair and equitable. . . . Such contracts are not opposed to \r\n  public policy but are highly beneficial to serving the best interest of the \r\n  marriage relationship.â€  Similarly, in Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, \r\n  306 S.E.2d 624 (1983), we addressed a family courtâ€™s jurisdiction over a separation \r\n  agreement which had not been merged into the partiesâ€™ divorce decree.  This \r\n  Court directly acknowledged that, although subject to family court approval, \r\n  that the parties may contract concerning their property settlement, and alimony, \r\n  and that â€œthey may agree to any terms they wish as long as the court deems the \r\n  contract to have been entered fairly, voluntarily and reasonably.â€  279 S.C. \r\n  at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627.\r\nMore recently, in Gilley v. Gilley, \r\n  327 S.C. 8, 488 S.E.2d 310 (1997), the husband brought an action for an order \r\n  of separate maintenance and support, equitable distribution, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.  Although the validity of the prenuptial agreement was not at issue in \r\n  Gilley, this Court affirmed the family courtâ€™s finding that husband's \r\n  action did not belong in family court since the prenuptial agreement provided \r\n  neither party could claim alimony or separate maintenance.   \r\nAs noted by the Court of Appeals \r\n  in this case, â€œ[t]he current trend and majority rule allows parties to prospectively \r\n  contract to limit or eliminate spousal support.â€  348 S.C. at 98, 55 8. S.E.2d \r\n  at 269, citing Pendleton v. Fireman, 5 P.3d 839, 845-46 (Cal. \r\n  2000); Allison A. Marston, Planning for Love:  The Politics of Premarital \r\n  Agreements, 49 Stan.  L. Rev. 887, 897-99 (1997).  As noted in Richard A. \r\n  Lord, 5 Williston on Contracts Â§ 11:8 (4th ed.) (May 2003):\r\n\r\n  In the past two decades . . . the \r\n    courts have reconsidered . . . public policy in light of societal changes, \r\n    and today, premarital agreements, so long as they do not promote divorce or \r\n    otherwise offend public policy, are generally favored as conducive to the \r\n    welfare of the parties and the marriage relationship as they tend to prevent \r\n    strife, secure peace, and adjust, settle, and generally dispose of rights \r\n    in property.  \r\n\r\nAccord Cary v. Cary, \r\n  937 S.W.2d 777, 782 (Tenn. 1996) (declaring agreements waiving or limiting alimony \r\n  enforceable, &quot;so long as the antenuptial agreement was entered into freely \r\n  and knowledgeably, with adequate disclosure, and without undue influence or \r\n  overreachingâ€); Marriage as Contract and Marriage as Partnership: The Future \r\n  of Antenuptial Agreement Law, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2075 (May 2003) (noting \r\n  that states have shifted from holding antenuptial agreements per se invalid \r\n  as contrary to public policy to holding them judicially enforceable).  We concur \r\n  with the majority of jurisdictions which hold that prenuptial agreements waiving \r\n  alimony, support and attorneyâ€™s fees are not per se unconscionable, nor \r\n  are they contrary to the public policy of this state. \r\n  [3] \r\nThe Court of Appeals adopted the \r\n  following test, to determine whether a prenuptial agreement should be enforced: \r\n  &quot;(1) Was the agreement obtained through fraud, duress, or mistake, or through \r\n  misrepresentation or nondisclosure of material facts? (2) Is the agreement unconscionable? \r\n  (3) Have the facts and circumstances changed since the agreement was executed, \r\n  so as to make its enforcement unfair and unreasonable?&quot;  Citing \r\n  Scherer v. Scherer, 292 S.E.2d 662, 666 (Ga. 1982); Brooks v. Brooks, \r\n  733 P.2d 1044, 1049 (Alaska 1987); Gentry v. Gentry, 798 S.W.2d 928, \r\n  936 (Ky. 1990); Rinvelt v. Rinvelt, 475 N.W.2d 478, 482 (Mich. App. 1991).  \r\n  See also Blue v. Blue, 60 S.W.3d 585 (Ky. 2001); Cantrell v. \r\n  Cantrell, 19 S.W.3d 842 (Tenn. 1999); Booth v. Booth, 486 N.W.2d \r\n  116 (Mich. 1992).  Applying these factors to the case at hand, the Court of \r\n  Appeals found the agreement had been entered after fair and full disclosure, \r\n  with advice from Wifeâ€™s attorney, it was not unconscionable, and that circumstances \r\n  had not so changed as to render the agreement unfair and unenforceable.  We \r\n  adopt this test and agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that the prenuptial \r\n  agreement in this case was enforceable.\r\nIt is patent that the agreement here \r\n  was not obtained through fraud, duress, misrepresentation or nondisclosure.  \r\n  Wife was separately represented by her own counsel, by whom she was employed, \r\n  was fully aware of the extent of husbandâ€™s assets, and was advised by her attorney \r\n  not to sign the agreement.  \r\nAs to unconscionability, this Court \r\n  has held that unconscionability is the absence of meaningful choice on the part \r\n  of one party due to one-sided contract provisions together with terms that are \r\n  so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest \r\n  person would accept them.  Munoz v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 343 S.C. \r\n  531, 542 S.E.2d 360 (2001); Fanning v. Fritz's Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, Inc., \r\n  322 S.C. 399, 472 S.E.2d 242 (1996).  Clearly, Wife here had a meaningful choice: \r\n  she could have refused to sign the agreement and opted against marrying Husband \r\n  if he insisted on a prenuptial agreement.  Further, Wife received some substantial \r\n  benefits from being married to Husband for the five-year duration of their marriage, \r\n  such as a heightened standard of living, owning several homes, and driving luxury \r\n  cars.  Accord Gant v. Gant, 329 S.E.2d 106, 116 (Ga. 1985)(noting \r\n  that â€œmarriage can be of substantial economic, as well as emotional value to \r\n  a financially weak partyâ€).\r\nLastly, the inquiry is whether the \r\n  facts and circumstances changed since the agreement was executed, so as to make \r\n  its enforcement unfair and unreasonable?  The family court found Wife totally \r\n  disabled and unable to support herself; it also found Wife would be a public \r\n  charge if substantial support were not given.  The Court of Appeals held the \r\n  facts and circumstances at the time of enforcement of the agreement had not \r\n  changed to such an extent that it was unfair or unreasonable to enforce the \r\n  agreement.  It stated:\r\n\r\n  At the time Wife signed the agreement, \r\n    she had serious health problems, including diabetes and sponge kidney disease.  \r\n    The premarital agreement specifically noted Wife's health problems.  It was \r\n    completely foreseeable to Wife that her health would worsen.  Wife's attorney \r\n    advised Wife not to sign the agreement because of her health problems.  Although \r\n    it is unfortunate that Wife's health has deteriorated, we do not find that \r\n    fact alone sufficient to justify nullifying a contract Wife freely and voluntarily \r\n    signed, fully aware that under its terms she would not receive any spousal \r\n    support.   \r\n\r\n348 S.C. at 96, 558 S.E. 2d at 270.  \r\n  Under the circumstances of this case, we agree with the result reached by the \r\n  Court of Appeals.  We concur with Husband that it would be unfair and inequitable \r\n  to permit a party who, fully aware of serious health issues and declining health, \r\n  knowingly signs a prenuptial agreement against the advice of her attorney, to \r\n  thereafter recover alimony and/or support.  Accordingly, we affirm the Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ ruling in this case. [4] \r\nFinally, Wife asserts that if this \r\n  Court affirms the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that prenuptial agreements are valid \r\n  and enforceable, our opinion should be given prospective application only as \r\n  it creates new substantive rights.  We disagree.  \r\nJudicial decisions creating new substantive \r\n  rights have prospective effect only, whereas decisions creating new remedies \r\n  to vindicate existing rights are applied retrospectively; prospective application \r\n  is required when liability is created where formerly none existed.  Osborne \r\n  v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d 319 (2001).  We find the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  holding in this case does not create any new substantive rights.  On the contrary, \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding is simply a matter of basic contract enforcement.  \r\n  Moreover, in light of our prior precedents of Stork, supra, and \r\n  Gilley, supra, our holding in this case is not a departure from \r\n  established precedent.  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    The court found Wife suffered from even more \r\n    serious conditions than those that existed prior to the marriage, including \r\n    diabetes mellitus, sponge kidney, Lupus, neuropathy of the extremities, heart \r\n    irregularities, vision problems, and thyroid problems, and that she was unable \r\n    to be gainfully employed.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(4) (Supp. 2002) permits \r\n    exclusion of property from the marital estate if excluded by a written antenuptial \r\n    agreement which was voluntarily executed and both parties were represented \r\n    by separate counsel.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]    Wife cites Towles v. Towles, 256 S.C. 307, 182 S.E.2d 53 \r\n    (1971) for the proposition that a contractual waiver of spousal support or \r\n    alimony is against public policy and void.  Towles involved a reconciliation \r\n    agreement entered into subsequent to the marriage; it is therefore distinguishable \r\n    from the present case.  In any event, we take this opportunity to overrule \r\n    Towles in light of its outdated views concerning women.  There, we \r\n    invalidated a reconciliation agreement finding it â€œtantamount to a release \r\n    of the husband of his duty to perform his essential marital obligations and \r\n    . . . therefore, void as against public policy.â€  Id. at 311, 182 S.E.2d \r\n    at 54.  We went on to state, â€œAmong the essential incidents to marriage is \r\n    the duty of the husband to support his wife.  41 Am.Jur. 2d, Husband \r\n    and Wife, Sections 329 and 330; State v. Bagwell, 125 S.C. 401, \r\n    118 S.E. 767.  An agreement whereby the husband is relieved of this obligation \r\n    to support his wife, as a condition of the marital relationship, is against \r\n    public policy and void.â€  Id. at 312, 182 S.E.2d at 55.  (emphasis \r\n    supplied).  \r\n              We find Towles \r\n    represents an outdated and unwarranted generalization of the sexes which is \r\n    no longer warranted in todayâ€™s society.  See e.g. United States \r\n    v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996)(gender \r\n    classifications should not be used as they once were to create or perpetuate \r\n    the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women; cautioning reviewing \r\n    courts to closely scrutinize generalizations or tendencies of the sexes).  \r\n    As we have done in other cases, we find the distinction between men and women \r\n    is based upon â€œold notionsâ€ that females should be afforded special protection.  \r\n    Accord In the Interest of Joseph T, 312 S.C. 15, 430 S.E.2d \r\n    523 (1993); Richland Memâ€™l Hosp. v. Burton, 282 S.C. 159, 318 S.E.2d \r\n    12 (1984).

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n          Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., and Solicitor \r\n          Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  At age eleven, appellant was adjudicated \r\n  delinquent for committing first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor \r\n  (CSCM).  He was nine years old at the time of the offense.  Appellant contends \r\n  the family courtâ€™s order requiring him to register as a sex offender violates \r\n  due process.  We affirm.\r\nDISCUSSION \r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(C)(4) (Supp. 2002), appellant is required to \r\n  register as a sex offender because of his adjudication for first degree CSCM.  \r\n  This section applies to â€œany person regardless of age. . . who has been adjudicated \r\n  delinquentâ€ for certain sex offenses.  Â§ 23-3-430(A).  Because appellant was \r\n  under the age of twelve at the time of his adjudication, however, information \r\n  collected for the registry may not be made available to the public.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 23-3-490(D)(3) (Supp. 2002). \r\n  [1]   Appellant contends the lifelong â€œstigmaâ€ of registration violates \r\n  due process because he was a juvenile at the time of his offense.\r\nThe substantive due process guarantee requires a rational basis for legislation \r\n  depriving a person of  life, liberty, or property.  In re: Care and Treatment \r\n  of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002).  The burden of showing \r\n  that a statute is unreasonable falls on the party attacking it on due process \r\n  grounds.  Id.; State v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 484 S.E.2d 869 \r\n  (1997).\r\nWe recently held sex offender registration, regardless of the length of time, \r\n  is non-punitive and therefore no liberty interest is implicated.  Hendrix \r\n  v. Taylor, 353 S.C. 542, 579 S.E.2d 320 (2003).  The intent of the legislature \r\n  in enacting the sex offender registry law is to protect the public from those \r\n  offenders who may re-offend.  State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 358 S.E.2d \r\n  524 (2002).  The registration of offenders, including juveniles who have proved \r\n  themselves capable of certain sex offenses, is rationally related to achieving \r\n  this legitimate objective.  Accord In re: Joseph G., 623 N.W.2d \r\n  137 (Wis. App. 2000).  Appellant has offered no valid basis upon which to distinguish \r\n  juvenile sex offenders for purposes of due process.  \r\nFurther, since the registry information will not be made available to the public \r\n  because of appellantâ€™s age at the time of his adjudication, there is no undue \r\n  harm to his reputation even if we were to recognize a liberty interest in a \r\n  juvenileâ€™s reputation.  Cf. In re:  M.A.H., 20 S.W.3d 860 (Tex. \r\n  App. 2000) (noting no authority for finding juvenileâ€™s reputation is a protected \r\n  liberty interest).  \r\nAccordingly, we hold the requirement that appellant register as a sex offender \r\n  under Â§ 23-3-430 does not violate due process.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Registry \r\n    information remains available to law enforcement under subsection (E). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25697","title":"Tilley v.

[1]   This Court affirmed summary judgment on the \r\n  issue of liability and remanded for a determination on damages.  Tilley v. \r\n  Pacesetter Corp., 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d 16 (1998) (â€œTilley Iâ€).  \r\n  This appeal was taken following the circuit courtâ€™s determination of damages.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background \r\nPacesetter is a Nebraska corporation that sells aluminum windows, awnings, \r\n  and doors in South Carolina.  Buyers in this case each entered into a â€œRetail \r\n  Installment Sales Contract and Mortgageâ€ to purchase products from Pacesetter \r\n  secured by a mortgage on their homes. \r\n  [2]   After entering into these contracts, Buyers instituted this action \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-2-413 (Supp. 1996), \r\n  [3]  contending that Pacesetter failed to ascertain their preference of \r\n  attorney and insurance agent in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102 (Supp. \r\n  1996). [4]   The trial court granted \r\n  Buyers summary judgment on the issue of liability, and this Court affirmed in \r\n  Tilley I, 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d 16. [5] \r\nFollowing this Courtâ€™s Tilley I decision, the case was remanded for \r\n  a determination of damages and was assigned to the Honorable James C. Williams, \r\n  Jr.  On March 12, 2001, Judge Williams issued an order awarding damages pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-105(a) (Supp. 1996).  Section 37-10-105 was amended \r\n  in 1997, altering the penalties for violations of the chapter. \r\n  [6]   See 1997 S.C. Acts 99, Â§ 1, eff. June 15, 1997.  Buyers initiated \r\n  this action in 1995, and the trial court granted summary judgment for Buyers \r\n  in April 1997, prior to the effective date of the amendment.  Judge Williams \r\n  applied the pre-1997 version to award damages, finding that the retroactive \r\n  application of the amended version of the statute would violate the Due Process \r\n  clauses of the South Carolina and United States Constitutions. \r\nJudge Williams then ordered Pacesetter to pay damages in an amount equal to \r\n  the total of the finance charges actually paid by Buyers in all of the consumer \r\n  credit transactions involving the Class pursuant to subsection (a) of Â§ 37-10-105 \r\n  and refused to assess penalties pursuant to subsection (b) of  Â§ 37-10-105.  \r\n  Judge Williams also declined to award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest \r\n  on the award, and allowed Pacesetter to set off the damages owed by the amount \r\n  of the unpaid debt written off by Pacesetter.  Finally, Judge Williams granted \r\n  Pacesetterâ€™s post-trial motion to exclude class members who died during the \r\n  pendency of the proceedings.  The order calculated the total amount of the judgment, \r\n  prior to setoff, to be $3,273,010.52. \r\nBoth Buyers and Pacesetter appealed, raising the \r\n  following issues in their cross-appeals:\r\nBuyersâ€™ Issues:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in applying the pre-1997 version \r\n      of Â§ 37-10-105 to assess penalties against Pacesetter based on its finding \r\n      that applying the 1997 amendment to Â§ 37-10-105 to Buyersâ€™ claims would \r\n      violate Due Process? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in refusing to award damages under \r\n      subsection (b) of original Â§ 37-10-105 after awarding damages under subsection \r\n      (a) of original Â§ 37-10-105?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in refusing to award pre-judgment \r\n      interest on the award?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    IV.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in ordering that the damages awarded \r\n      to the class members be set off by the amount of any unpaid debts written \r\n      off by Pacesetter?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    V.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in excluding class members who died \r\n      during the pendency of this action where the applicable statute does not \r\n      require fraud and deceit to award damages?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPacesetterâ€™s Issues:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    VI.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in finding Pacesetter had charged an improper \r\n      fee and, thereby, in awarding any damages under original Â§ 37-10-105(a)?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    VII.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in granting Buyersâ€™ motion to conform, and then \r\n      in modifying the class definition that was originally pled by Buyers and \r\n      certified in June 1996?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    VIII.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in adding a subclass of plaintiffs whose claims \r\n      were barred by the statute of limitations set out in Tilley I?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    IX.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in refusing to send notice of the pendency of \r\n      this action to absent class members? \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nI.  Application of Â§ 37-10-105 \r\nBuyers argue that the circuit court erred in applying the pre-1997 version \r\n  of Â§ 37-10-105 (â€œoriginal Â§ 37-10-105â€) to determine Buyersâ€™ damages \r\n  instead of applying the 1997 amended version of Â§ 37-10-105 (â€œnew Â§ 37-10-105).  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nJudge Williams refused to apply new Â§ 37-10-105 on grounds that applying it \r\n  would violate Pacesetterâ€™s right to Due Process because Buyersâ€™ claims accrued \r\n  and were filed prior to the amendment, summary judgment had been granted for \r\n  Buyers prior to the effective date of the amendment, and Pacesetterâ€™s penalties \r\n  would be greater under new Â§ 37-10-105 than they would be under original Â§ 37-10-105. \r\n  [7]   The circuit court recognized that the purpose of the amendment was \r\n  to decrease liability for violations of the attorney and insurance preference \r\n  statutes, but found that, in this case, the amended version would have the opposite \r\n  effect, resulting in far greater penalties for Pacesetterâ€™s violations.  \r\nOriginal Â§ 37-10-105 provided, in relevant part,\r\n\r\n  With respect to a loan transaction subject to the provisions of this chapter, \r\n    any person who shall receive or contract to receive a loan finance charge \r\n    or other charge or fee in violation of this chapter shall forfeit -\r\n   (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the total amount of the loan finance \r\n    charge and the costs of the action; and the unpaid balance of the loan shall \r\n    be repayable without any loan finance charge;\r\n   (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double the amount of the excess loan finance \r\n    charge or other charges or fees actually received by the creditor or paid \r\n    by the debtor to a third party, to be collected by a separate action or allowed \r\n    as a counterclaim in any action brought to recover the unpaid balance.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-105 (Supp. 1996).  The 1997 \r\n  amendment to Â§ 37-10-105 changed the penalty structure to a per debtor penalty \r\n  and prohibits class actions.  New Â§ 37-10-105 provides, in relevant part,\r\n\r\n   (A)&nbsp;If a creditor violates a provision of this chapter, the debtor \r\n    has a cause of action, other than in a class action, to recover actual damages \r\n    and also a right in an action, other than in a class action, to recover from \r\n    the person violating this chapter a penalty in an amount determined by the \r\n    court of not less than one thousand five hundred dollars and not more than \r\n    seven thousand five hundred dollars.  No debtor may bring a class action for \r\n    a violation of this chapter.  No debtor may bring an action for a violation \r\n    of this chapter more than three years after the violation occurred, except \r\n    as set forth in subsection (C).  The three-year statute of limitations applies \r\n    to actions commenced after May 2, 1997.  No inference should be drawn as to \r\n    the applicable statute of limitations for any pending actions.  This subsection \r\n    does not bar a debtor from asserting a violation of this chapter in an action \r\n    to collect a debt which was brought more than three years from the date of \r\n    the occurrence of the violation as a matter of defense by recoupment or set-off \r\n    in such action.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-105 (Supp. 1997 &amp; Rev. 2002). [8] \r\nThe circuit court appears to have based its decision on the â€œharsh and oppressiveâ€ \r\n  results that applying new Â§ 37-10-105 would have on Pacesetter.  See U.S. \r\n  Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 17 n. 13 (1977) (noting that â€œ[t]he \r\n  Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally does not prohibit retrospective \r\n  civil legislation, unless the consequences are particularly â€˜harsh and oppressiveâ€™â€) \r\n  (citations omitted).  Throughout its order, the circuit court expressed a sense \r\n  that applying new Â§ 37-10-105, enacted after the Buyersâ€™ claims accrued \r\n  and were filed and after summary judgment on the issue of liability was granted, \r\n  was unfair under some other, yet undefined, principle.  The circuit court explained,\r\n\r\n  Without relying on - and being bound by - definitions and distinctions, such \r\n    as â€œvested,â€ â€œright,â€ â€œremedy,â€ and the like, the Court finds that, at the \r\n    time [Buyers] were granted summary judgment on liability, the interests of \r\n    the parties to this action became fixed.  They knew that any damages awarded \r\n    to [Buyers] and assessed against Pacesetter were somewhere within the parameters \r\n    of original Â§ 37-10-105.  Who can say that their respective actions in this \r\n    litigation from that point were not determined by this knowledge of the potential \r\n    damages under the original statute?  This Court certainly cannot and must \r\n    hold that the amendment should not be applied in this action.\r\n\r\nWe agree that original Â§ 37-10-105, not new Â§ 37-10-105, should be applied \r\n  to determine Buyersâ€™ damages.  We base this conclusion on South Carolinaâ€™s â€œretroactivityâ€ \r\n  jurisprudence, and, accordingly, find that it is unnecessary to address whether \r\n  new Â§ 37-10-105, as applied to Pacesetter, violates Due Process.  \r\nIn Stephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 488 S.E.2d 307 (1997), this \r\n  Court discussed the impact of its earlier decision in Nelson v. Concrete \r\n  Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991) (prospectively abrogating \r\n  the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of comparative negligence).  \r\n  In Stephens, Stephens brought a medical malpractice action against his \r\n  doctor when he became addicted to the narcotic drug (Percocette) prescribed \r\n  to him by his doctor.  Stephensâ€™ wife brought a loss of consortium claim against \r\n  the doctor.  Stephens, 327 S.C. at 3, 488 S.E.2d at 308.  Stephens \r\n  was a patient of the doctorâ€™s from 1985 until May 1992.  Id. This Court \r\n  abrogated contributory negligence, effective July 1, 1991.  Nelson.  The \r\n  Stephenses argued that the trial court erred in charging the jury with both \r\n  contributory and comparative negligence, and that comparative negligence alone \r\n  should have been charged. \r\nThe Court found the question of when the Stephensâ€™ causes of action \r\n  arose to be dispositive because â€œthe law in effect at the time the cause of \r\n  action accrued controls the partiesâ€™ legal relationships and rights.â€  Stephens, \r\n  333 S.C. at 5, 488 S.E.2d at 309.  Applying Brown v. Finger, 240 \r\n  S.C. 102, 134 S.E.2d 781 (1962), the Court found that â€œ[a] cause of action accrues \r\n  at the moment when the plaintiff has a legal right to sue on it.â€  Stephens, \r\n  333 S.C. at 4-5, 488 S.E.2d at 309.  The Court then held that both Stephensâ€™ \r\n  and his wifeâ€™s actions accrued long before July 1, 1991, the date contributory \r\n  negligence was abrogated, and, therefore, that their claims were controlled \r\n  by the doctrine of contributory negligence, as that was the rule in effect when \r\n  their claims first accrued.  Id.\r\nIn the present case, all of the Buyersâ€™ claims accrued prior to the date they \r\n  filed this class action in 1995. [9] \r\n    At the time Buyersâ€™ claims accrued and were filed, original Â§ 37-10-105 \r\n  was in place.  In addition, original Â§ 37-10-105 was in effect when the trial \r\n  court granted summary judgment on the issue of liability in April 1997.  Under \r\n  this analysis, original Â§ 37-10-105 should be applied to determine Buyersâ€™ damages, \r\n  not the 1997 amendment to that section.\r\nII.  Applicability of Â§ 37-10-105(b)\r\nBuyers argue that the circuit court erred in awarding damages only under subsection \r\n  (a) of original Â§ 37-10-105, and finding subsection (b) inapplicable in this \r\n  case.  We disagree.\r\nAs noted previously, original Â§ 37-10-105 provides, in relevant part,\r\n\r\n  With respect to a loan transaction subject to the provisions of this chapter, \r\n    any person who shall receive or contract to receive a loan finance charge \r\n    or other charge or fee in violation of this chapter shall forfeit -\r\n   (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the total amount of the loan finance \r\n    charge and the costs of    the action; and the unpaid balance of the loan \r\n    shall be repayable without any loan finance charge;\r\n   (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double the amount of the excess \r\n    loan finance charge or other charges or fees actually received by the creditor \r\n    or paid by the debtor to a third party, to be collected by a separate action \r\n    or allowed as a counterclaim in any action brought to recover the unpaid balance.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-105 (Supp. \r\n  1996) (emphasis added).  In its order, the circuit court determined that subsection \r\n  (b) created an additional penalty for those who charged interest rates in excess \r\n  of the statutory maximum.  Because no evidence was presented that Pacesetter \r\n  charged â€œexcessâ€ interest on any of the transactions at issue, the circuit court \r\n  refused to award damages under subsection (b).\r\nIn our opinion, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  analysis is correct.  Although the provisions of the consumer protection code \r\n  are to be liberally construed in favor of the consumer, its provisions must \r\n  still be read in accordance with the first rule of statutory construction: giving \r\n  words their plain and unambiguous meaning.\r\n\r\n  When the language of a statute is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear \r\n    and definite meaning, the application of standard rules of statutory interpretation \r\n    is unwarranted.  Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 \r\n    S.E.2d 890 (1995); Miller v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 441 S.E.2d 319 (1994).  \r\n    The statutory terms, therefore, must be applied according to their literal \r\n    meaning.  Paschal, 317 S.C. at 436, 454 S.E.2d at 892; Holley v. \r\n    Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994).  In such \r\n    circumstances, this Court simply lacks the authority to look for or impose \r\n    another meaning and may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an \r\n    attempt to limit or expand a statute's scope. Paschal, 317 S.C. at \r\n    437, 454 S.E.2d at 892; Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 426 S.E.2d \r\n    760 (1993).\r\n\r\nState v. Benjamin, 341 \r\n  S.C. 160, 163, 533 S.E.2d 606, 607 (Ct. App. 2000).  In our view, use of the \r\n  word â€œexcessâ€ in subsection (b) is plain and unambiguous.  Giving â€œexcessâ€ its \r\n  literal meaning is thus required; this Court cannot overlook the wordâ€™s plain \r\n  meaning in an attempt to apply the statute liberally. \r\nBeyond the plain meaning of the \r\n  word â€œexcess,â€ there is historical support for the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation \r\n  of subsection (b).  The circuit court conducted a thorough review of the legislation \r\n  that preceded original Â§ 37-10-105:  the various versions of South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  now repealed usury penalty.  In so doing, the circuit court followed this Courtâ€™s \r\n  lead in Tilley I when it used the statuteâ€™s history to conclude that \r\n  the appropriate statute of limitations was that previously available for a usury \r\n  claim.  Tilley I, 333 S.C. at 42, 508 S.E.2d at 20.\r\n\r\n  Section 37-10-105 recodifies the penalty for usury in former S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 34-31-50.  The statute of limitations for an action seeking the remedies \r\n    recoverable for usury begins to run at the time each payment is made on the \r\n    loan.  Accordingly, although we find the three year statute of limitations \r\n    applicable, it begins to run from each payment, such that plaintiffsâ€™ claims \r\n    are not barred. \r\n\r\nId.  Similarly, the circuit \r\n  court compared Â§ 34-31-50 (the old usury statute), repealed by 1982 S.C. Acts \r\n  835, with prior versions of Â§ 34-31-50, and with Â§ 37-10-105 at issue here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Section 34-31-50 provided,\r\n  Any person who shall receive or contract to receive as interest any greater \r\n    amount than is provided for in Â§ 34-31-30 shall forfeit all interest and the \r\n    costs of the action and such portion of the original debt as shall be due \r\n    shall be recovered without interest or costs.  When any amount so charged \r\n    or contracted for has been actually received by such person he shall also \r\n    forfeit double the total amount received in respect of interest. \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-50 (1976) \r\n  (emphasis added).  Section 34-31-50 was very similar to the 1898 version of \r\n  the usury statute which provided that any person or corporation charging or \r\n  contracting for interest in excess of the legal rate who has actually received \r\n  such interest â€œshall also forfeit double the total amount received \r\n  in respect of interest.â€  1898 S.C. Acts 39, Â§ 2 (emphasis added).  \r\nThe 1898 Act was construed by \r\n  this Court in Frick Co. v. Tuten, 204 S.C. 226, 232, 29 S.E.2d 260, 262 \r\n  (1944), as follows:  \r\n\r\n  upon contracting for illegal interest, the userer forfeits all interest, \r\n    that which he may have contracted legally to receive and the excess as well; \r\n    and should he actually receive usurious interest he is made to forfeit (pay \r\n    back) double the total amount received.  \r\n\r\nApparently, the 1898 Act was a \r\n  reaction by the General Assembly to the Courtâ€™s interpretation of the 1882 usury \r\n  statute.  Frick.  In Hardin v. Trimmier, 30 S.C. 391 (1888), the \r\n  Court interpreted the following language to impose double the sum of the amount \r\n  of interest collected in excess of the legal interest rate:  â€œThat any \r\n  person or corporation who shall receive as interest any greater amount than \r\n  is herein provided for shall, in addition to the forfeiture herein provided \r\n  for [all interest], forfeit also double the sum so received.â€ 1882 S.C. \r\n  Acts 21.  The Hardin court made the following interpretation,\r\n\r\n  It seems to us clear that the meaning is, that if the lender, on such a contract \r\n    as this, receives an amount greater than seven per cent., he shall forfeit \r\n    double the sum received in excess of seven per cent.  The thing forbidden \r\n    is to receive interest in excess of seven per cent., and when the act declares \r\n    a forfeiture of double the amount so received, it must mean double \r\n    the amount of such excess, and not double the whole amount of interest received. \r\n    \r\n\r\nHardin v. Trimmier, 30 \r\n  S.C. at 396 (emphasis in original).\r\nAs Â§ 34-31-50 shares language \r\n  most similar to the 1898 version, it follows that under that provision, the \r\n  penalty was double the total amount of interest received.  When the legislature \r\n  then repealed Â§ 34-31-50 in 1982 and simultaneously enacted Â§ 37-10-105, the \r\n  use of the word â€œexcessâ€ in the latter marks an intentional change.  In light \r\n  of the historical interpretation of the usury statute, it is apparent that the \r\n  legislature chose the word excess with the purpose of altering the existing \r\n  usury penalties.  As Buyers have presented no evidence of interest in excess \r\n  of the legal interest rate, the circuit court correctly refused to assess penalties \r\n  under subsection (b) of original Â§ 37-10-105.\r\nIII.  \r\n  Pre-Judgment Interest\r\nBuyers argue they are entitled \r\n  to prejudgment interest from October 27, 1995, the date the action was filed, \r\n  to April 3, 1997, the date of entry of summary judgment.  We disagree.\r\nThis Court requires parties to \r\n  plead for pre-judgment interest in order for it to be recovered.  Hopkins \r\n  v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 540 S.E.2d 454 (1996); Calhoun v. Calhoun, \r\n  339 S.C. 96, 529 S.E.2d 14 (2000).  If no request for pre-judgment interest \r\n  is made in the pleadings, it cannot be recovered on appeal.  Id.  If \r\n  pre-judgment interest is pled for in the complaint, it â€œis allowed on obligations \r\n  to pay money from the time the payment is demandable, either by agreement of \r\n  the parties or by operation of law, if the sum is certain or capable of being \r\n  reduced to certainty.â€  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, \r\n  101, 478 S.E.2d 45, 50 (1996). \r\nIn this case, the Buyers did not \r\n  plead for pre-judgment interest in their original complaint of October 27, 1995, \r\n  or in their amended complaint of January 23, 1996.  Under the rule established \r\n  in Calhoun and Hopkins, Buyers cannot now recover pre-judgment \r\n  interest. [10]   Further, Buyers had no right to demand Pacesetter \r\n  pay penalties until Pacesetterâ€™s liability was established because the amount \r\n  recoverable was not a â€œsum certain.â€  See Future Group, II.  Buyers claimed \r\n  penalties under new Â§ 37-10-105, and Pacesetter claimed penalties should be \r\n  assessed under original Â§ 37-10-105.  As the amount of damages varies greatly \r\n  depending on which version of the statute is applied, it is difficult to see \r\n  how the amount recoverable could qualify as a â€œsum certain.â€\r\nFor these reasons, Buyers are \r\n  not entitled to pre-judgment interest.\r\n IV.&nbsp;Setoff\r\nBuyers argue that the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting Pacesetterâ€™s request for setoff of the amount of any \r\n  principal written off by Pacesetter and could deduct such amount from the penalties \r\n  it paid to Buyers.  We disagree.\r\nAfter the circuit court issued \r\n  its order granting setoff, Buyers moved for the circuit court to reconsider, \r\n  claiming the court erred by ordering setoff of amounts claimed to be in default \r\n  without affording any opportunity for evidentiary review by Buyers or the court.  \r\n  In response, the circuit court ordered Pacesetter to produce to Buyersâ€™ counsel, \r\n  prior to disbursement of funds, all identifying information in Pacesetterâ€™s \r\n  possession pertaining to each individual class member, and the amount of any \r\n  setoff to which Pacesetter claims to be entitled, along with all evidence to \r\n  support its entitlement to setoff.  Buyers note in their brief that Pacesetter \r\n  has produced no such evidence to date.\r\nAlthough Buyers claim that Pacesetterâ€™s \r\n  claim for setoff came too late (after summary judgment on liability was granted), \r\n  they offer no authority in support of this proposition.  As such, we see no \r\n  reason why Pacesetter cannot request setoff before the circuit court during \r\n  the damages portion of the case.  The circuit courtâ€™s post-trial order requires \r\n  Pacesetter to produce evidence of its entitlement to setoff prior to disbursement \r\n  of funds, and that order still stands.  In order to receive any setoff, Pacesetter \r\n  will have to produce this evidence.  Therefore, Pacesetter should be allowed \r\n  to setoff the award by the amount of principal Pacesetter has written off per \r\n  class member.  As the circuit court noted, set offs will be applied on an individual \r\n  class member basis only and will have no effect on the awards to class members \r\n  not in default and whose principal loan amount was not written off by Pacesetter.  \r\n\r\n V. Deceased Class Members\r\nBuyers argue that the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting Pacesetterâ€™s motion to exclude deceased class members.  \r\n  We agree.  \r\nThe circuit court held that the \r\n  interests of the parties became fixed with the April 3, 1997, order granting \r\n  summary judgment on the issue of liability.  Pacesetter concedes that the class \r\n  members alive on the date of summary judgment remain part of the class regardless \r\n  of subsequent death, but argues that those members of the originally defined \r\n  class who predeceased the April 3, 1997, order do not survive as members of \r\n  the class.  \r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s general survivability \r\n  statute has a wide ambit that includes all causes of action not covered by specific \r\n  exceptions.  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (1976) provides that â€œ[c]auses \r\n  of action for and in respect to . . . any and all injuries to the person or \r\n  to personal property shall survive both to and against the personal or real \r\n  representative . . . of a deceased person . . . any law or rule to the contrary \r\n  nothwithstanding.â€  Over the years, this Court has created certain exceptions \r\n  to the survivability statute.  See, e.g., Estate of Covington v. AT&amp;T \r\n  Nassau Metals Corp., 304 S.C. 436, 405 S.E.2d 393 (1991) (workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claims); Brown v. Bailey, 215 S.C. 175, 54 S.E.2d 769 (1949) (actions \r\n  for malicious prosecution); Carver v. Morrow, 213 S.C. 199, 48 S.E.2d \r\n  814 (1948) (actions for slander); See Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, \r\n  349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2001) (actions for fraud and deceit).\r\nPacesetter argues that this action \r\n  does not survive the deceased class membersâ€™ deaths pursuant to the fraud and \r\n  deceit exception to the general survivability statute.  Ferguson. In \r\n  Ferguson, this Court held that a cause of action brought under the South \r\n  Carolina Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (â€œDealers \r\n  Actâ€) [11]  did not survive \r\n  the death of the plaintiff.  Id.  The plaintiff alleged that the Dealer \r\n  included an improper fee in the purchase price of the car and concealed that \r\n  price through either fraudulent actions or negligent practices.  Id.  The \r\n  Dealers Act defined fraud broadly, to include â€œa misrepresentation in any manner, \r\n  whether intentionally false or due to gross negligence, of a material fact; \r\n  a promise or representation not made honestly and in good faith; and an intentional \r\n  failure to disclose a material fact.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-10(m).  This Court \r\n  reasoned that plaintiffâ€™s cause of action was grounded in fraud and deceit and \r\n  thus did not survive his death under that exception.  Ferguson.\r\nThe Consumer Protection Code and the Dealers Act share a common purpose:  protection \r\n  of the consumer.  However, the Dealers Act arguably expanded the definition \r\n  of fraud to include actions that would not normally amount to fraud.  The Consumer \r\n  Protection Code does not define fraud at all.  Ferguson alleged that the Dealer \r\n  had committed an unfair act by failing to disclose a closing fee in the price \r\n  of the car Ferguson purchased.  Ferguson.  In this case, Buyers charge \r\n  Pacesetter with violating the statutory mandate of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102 \r\n  in failing to notify them of their right to choose an attorney and insurance \r\n  agent of their preference.  Neither Â§ 37-10-102 nor the penalty section, Â§ 37-10-105, \r\n  refer to violation of the statutory preference requirements in terms of unfairness, \r\n  fraud, or deceit. \r\nWhether or not a cause of action for violation of the attorney /insurance preference \r\n  statute amounts to an action brought on a theory of fraud and deceit is an issue \r\n  of first impression for the court.  The Buyersâ€™ claims here are based on a simple \r\n  violation of a statutory requirement; the penalties for violating the statutory \r\n  preference provisions of Â§ 37-10-102 are absolute and do not depend on actual \r\n  fraud.  Further, the Consumer Protection Code, within which the preference provisions \r\n  are contained, does not define fraud.  For these reasons, we hold that the claims \r\n  presented here are not grounded in fraud and deceit and, accordingly, survive \r\n  a class memberâ€™s death. [12] \r\n VI.&nbsp;Improper Fee\r\nIn its status as Appellant, Pacesetter \r\n  argues that the circuit court erred in awarding damages under original Â§ 37-10-105 \r\n  at all because Pacesetter did not charge any â€œimproperâ€ fees.  We disagree.\r\nThis Courtâ€™s finding of liability in Tilley I answers \r\n  this question in the negative.  As discussed in Part II of this opinion, there \r\n  is no evidence that Pacesetter charged Buyers an illegal interest rate, in the \r\n  sense that the rate was beyond that legally allowable.  However, original Â§ \r\n  37-10-105(a) only requires that the defendant receive or contract to receive \r\n  a fee â€œin violation of this chapterâ€ in order to be subjected to the statuteâ€™s \r\n  penalties under subsection (a).  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-105 (Supp. 1996).  The \r\n  chapter is violated whenever a creditor fails to ascertain the buyerâ€™s preference \r\n  as to legal counsel and insurance agent.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102(a).  Therefore, \r\n  charging any fee, no matter how reasonable, triggers the penalties of original \r\n  Â§ 37-10-105(a) when the creditor fails to ascertain the buyerâ€™s attorney/insurance \r\n  agent preference as Pacesetter did here.  Accordingly, we find this issue to \r\n  be without merit.\r\nVII.  Motion to Conform\r\nPacesetter argues that the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  Buyersâ€™ motion to conform the class definition to the statute of limitations \r\n  established by this Court in Tilley I, which resulted in the addition \r\n  of almost 1,500 class members to the class as originally defined by Buyers.  \r\n  We agree.\r\nThe original complaint, filed on October 27, 1995, contained \r\n  the following definition of the class to be certified:\r\n\r\n  The class consists of all individual mortgagors who executed Promissory Notes \r\n    and Mortgages in South Carolina to Pacesetter after July 1, 1982, and said \r\n    mortgages are still outstanding in connection with the transactions \r\n    more particularly described hereinafter.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  The January 19, 1996, amended complaint \r\n  contained an identical class description.  In addition, the interrogatories \r\n  that Buyers submitted to Pacesetter inquire about the mortgages currently held \r\n  by Pacesetter.  Summary judgment on liability was granted without any change \r\n  in the class definition, and was then affirmed by this Court in Tilley I.\r\nOn February 19, 2001, Buyers moved to conform the pleadings and class definition, \r\n  arguing that the statute of limitations established in Tilley I modified \r\n  the class definition.  In Tilley I, this Court held that the applicable \r\n  statute of limitations ran three years from the date of each payment made on \r\n  the loan.  333 S.C. at 42, 508 S.E.2d at 20.  Buyers now contend that the class \r\n  definition should be modified because the statute of limitations set by this \r\n  Court made more of Pacesetterâ€™s customers eligible than Buyers had contemplated. \r\n  [13]   The circuit court recognized that granting this motion would expand \r\n  the putative class membership by some 1,500 persons whose mortgages had been \r\n  released before this lawsuit was filed, but concluded that the â€œexpansion was \r\n  required by the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling.â€  \r\nWe disagree that our Tilley I opinion requires any such modification \r\n  to the class, and believe that allowing the Buyers to modify the class definition \r\n  they chose at this late date would be unfair.  Tilley I did not address \r\n  the choice of class definition made in the pleadings, and it was not raised \r\n  by the parties, or by this Court sua sponte.\r\nRule 23(d)(1), SCRCP, addresses the procedure for entering and altering a certification \r\n  order.\r\n\r\n  As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class \r\n    action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained.  \r\n    An order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or \r\n    amended before the decision on the merits.  \r\n\r\nWhen the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the \r\n  issue of liability and this Courtâ€™s affirmed, a â€œdecision on the meritsâ€ was \r\n  made.  The definition espoused by the Buyers in their original and amended complaints \r\n  was adopted by the courts and used by the parties as the working definition \r\n  of the class.  The fact that the Buyers limited the class more than was necessary \r\n  to fit within the statute of limitations was the result of a strategy choice, \r\n  and, according to Rule 23(d)(1), SCRCP, is one that they have to live with since \r\n  a decision on the merits was made.  The portion of the circuit courtâ€™s order \r\n  granting Buyersâ€™ Motion to Conform the class is therefore reversed.\r\n VIII.&nbsp;Statute of Limitations for New Subclass\r\nIn our opinion, the circuit court improperly expanded the \r\n  class definition.  As such, it is unnecessary to determine whether the claims \r\n  of the added subclass are barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nIX.  Notice to Absent Class Members\r\nPacesetter argues that the circuit court erred in agreeing \r\n  to defer the mailing of the class notice to absent class members until the conclusion \r\n  of this appeal.  We disagree.\r\nDuring the damages phase, the Buyers informed the circuit court that they intended \r\n  to appeal some of that courtâ€™s rulings, and requested that the mailing of the \r\n  class notice be deferred until the issues had been resolved on appeal.  Recognizing \r\n  that this Court could modify the content of any class notice Buyers created, \r\n  in order to avoid the expense and confusion that mailing two notices could cause, \r\n  the circuit court agreed to defer mailing the class notice.\r\nRule 23(d)(2), SCRCP, provides that the court â€œmay order \r\n  that notice be given in such a manner as it may direct of the pendency of the \r\n  action by the party seeking to maintain the action on behalf of the class.â€  \r\n  The Notes to this rule, however, state that â€œ[t]his rule requires those seeking \r\n  to maintain an action on behalf of a class to notify the members of the class \r\n  of the pendency of the action.â€  \r\nIn our opinion, the circuit court made a good practical decision in agreeing \r\n  to defer the mailing of the class notice until after the conclusion of this \r\n  appeal.  As it turns out, the definition of the class  has changed since the \r\n  circuit court issued its order.  If the circuit court had ordered Buyers to \r\n  mail the class notices in 2001 when it issued its order, approximately 1,500 \r\n  class members would have received notices indicating they could join the class \r\n  who, in fact, are not eligible to join the class.  The circuit court did not \r\n  eliminate the requirement that a class notice be mailed to absent class members; \r\n  it simply delayed the mailing of the notice until this Court finalized the definition \r\n  of the class.  As such, we believe the circuit court made the correct decision.  \r\n  Following this Courtâ€™s decision, the parties must mail a notice to the absent \r\n  class members according to the definition created by the Buyers in their original \r\n  complaint and used by the parties throughout Tilley I.\r\nConclusion \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the circuit court on issues I, \r\n  II, III, IV, VI, and IX, and REVERSE on issues V and VII, and find it \r\n  unnecessary to address issue VIII.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-1-101 et seq.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The contracts contained \r\n    the following provision:\r\n\r\n\r\n   OBLIGATIONS PERTAINING TO PROPERTY INSURANCE AND MY REAL ESTATE:  \r\n    1. I promise to keep my house in good repair and keep it insured for at least \r\n    80% of its replacement value by buying fire and extended coverage insurance \r\n    policy.  The insurance company must be approved by you, ... and the company \r\n    must agree that it will not cancel my policy without first telling you.  I \r\n    authorize the insurance company to pay you directly for any loss.  You can \r\n    choose to use this insurance payment to either repay any amounts I owe you \r\n    or to repair my house.

I know that if you decide \r\n    to buy insurance for me you do not have to obtain any homeowner or liability \r\n    insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Section 37-2-413(2) provides:\r\n\r\n \r\n  With respect to a consumer credit sale that is secured in whole \r\n    or in part by a lien on real estate the provisions of Â§ 37-10-102(a) apply \r\n    whenever the seller requires the debtor to purchase insurance or pay any attorneyâ€™s \r\n    fees in connection with examining the title and closing the transaction.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Section 37-10-102(a) provides, in relevant part,\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    Whenever the primary purpose of a loan that is secured in whole or in part \r\n      by a lien on real estate is for personal, family, or household purposes \r\n      -\r\n    (a) The creditor must ascertain prior to closing the preference of the \r\n      borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed to represent the debtor \r\n      in all matters of the transaction relating to the closing of the transaction \r\n      and . . . the insurance agent to furnish required hazard and flood property \r\n      insurance in connection with the mortgage and comply with such preference. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  In addition to determining that Pacesetter had \r\n    violated section 37-10-413(2), this Court held (1) that Buyers could seek \r\n    remedies set forth in section 37-10-105 as well as section 37-5-202, (2) that \r\n    the old usury statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-50, provided the applicable \r\n    statute of limitations for Buyersâ€™ claims - 3 years from the date of each \r\n    payment made on the loan, and finally (3) that certification of Buyersâ€™ class \r\n    by the trial court was proper.  Tilley I. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  The amendment prohibited class actions prospectively, and established \r\n    that debtors proving violations would be awarded penalties ranging from $1,500 \r\n    to $7,500.  The circuit court found that, in this class action, the penalties \r\n    assessed against Pacesetter would be far greater under the amendment than \r\n    under the pre-1997 version.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]   The circuit court dismissed Pacesetterâ€™s argument that applying \r\n    the amendment would violate separation of powers under the rationale explained \r\n    in Steinke v. South Carolina Dept. of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 \r\n    S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).  We agree; the statute was amended by the \r\n    legislature, and there was no intervening action by this Court.  Consequently, \r\n    nothing has occurred to create a separation of powers conflict.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  The stated purposes of the 1997 amendment to Â§ \r\n    37-10-105 were to (1) delete certain penalty provisions, (2) to create a private \r\n    cause of action and to prohibit class actions for violations of this chapter, \r\n    (3) to set elements of recoverable damages, and (4) to make the new provisions \r\n    apply to causes of action, including appeals, pending on May 2, 1997, and \r\n    to limit recovery in class actions filed before that date.  1997 S.C. Acts \r\n    99. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  In Tilley I, we determined that the statute of limitations \r\n    for these claims runs for three years from the time each payment is made on \r\n    the loan.  Tilley I, 333 S.C. at 42, 508 S.E.2d at 20.  Consistent \r\n    with this finding, we find that the Buyersâ€™ claims accrued with the \r\n    first payment each buyer made on his or her loan.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]  Buyers moved to amend their complaint to request \r\n    pre-judgment interest when their damages case was pending before the circuit \r\n    court.  Judge Williams found their request for pre-judgment interest untimely \r\n    and denied it.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [11]   S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-130 (Supp.  2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [12]  In addition, Pacesetter argues that the members of the class added \r\n    following Pacesetterâ€™s February 19, 2001, motion to conform who predeceased \r\n    entry of that order do not survive as members of the class.  Because we reverse \r\n    the circuit courtâ€™s decision to conform the class in Part VII of this opinion, \r\n    it is unnecessary for us to address the status of those who would have been \r\n    added to the class by that order but who are now deceased.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [13]  Buyers had limited the class to those customers \r\n    of Pacesetter with outstanding mortgages when the complaint was filed in October \r\n    1995.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25698","title":"State v.

Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25698\r\n  Heard June 25, 2003 - Filed August 11, 2003\r\n\r\nVACATED \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Chief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, of South Carolina Office of Appellate \r\n          Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Deputy Director for Legal Services Teresa A.

Benjamin Aplin, all of South Carolina \r\n          Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services, of Columbia, for \r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  Kenneth Crouch (â€œappellantâ€) was charged with three \r\n  probation violations.  The court revoked in full the remaining fifty-one months \r\n  of a five year sentence, partially revoked two lesser sentences, and continued \r\n  appellant on probation on these latter two charges.  The court ordered the continued \r\n  probationary terms tolled while appellant was incarcerated on the fifty-one \r\n  month sentence.  Appellant contends this was error.  We vacate the probation \r\n  revocations related to the two latter charges.  \r\nISSUE \r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in revoking appellantâ€™s probation?\r\n\r\nFACTS \r\nOn October 20, 1998, appellant pled guilty in Saluda County (â€œSaluda County \r\n  chargesâ€) to two counts of burglary in the second degree, and one count of grand \r\n  larceny of property valued at less than $5,000.  On June 18, 1999 \r\n  [1] , appellant was sentenced on each charge to concurrent terms of five \r\n  years imprisonment, suspended upon service of nine months imprisonment and five \r\n  years probation.  \r\nOn January 26, 1999, and January 27, 1999, in Newberry County (â€œNewberry County \r\n  chargesâ€), appellant pled guilty to two counts of obtaining property by false \r\n  pretenses, and was sentenced on each charge to concurrent terms of three years \r\n  imprisonment, suspended upon time served and two years probation.\r\nOn March 30, 1999, in Aiken County (â€œAiken County chargeâ€) appellant pled guilty \r\n  to burglary and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, suspended upon service \r\n  of four years imprisonment, and four years probation.  Appellant did not appeal \r\n  any of his convictions.  All sentences were concurrent since in no case did \r\n  the sentencing judge specify the sentences were to be served consecutively.  \r\n  Finley v. State, 219 S.C. 278, 64 S.E.2d 881 (1951).  \r\nOn November 8, 2000, appellant was released on parole on the Aiken County charge, \r\n  with parole to expire on May 17, 2001.  On May 1, 2001, 16 days before parole \r\n  was to expire, a probation arrest warrant was issued on the Aiken County charge.  \r\n  On June 27, 2001, a probation arrest warrant was issued on the Saluda County \r\n  charges, and on June 29, 2001, a probation arrest warrant was issued on the \r\n  Newberry County charges.  \r\nOn July 26, 2001, at the probation revocation hearing, the judge revoked the \r\n  Saluda County sentence in full, requiring appellant to serve the remaining fifty-one \r\n  months of the sentence.  The judge also revoked the Newberry County sentences, \r\n  requiring service of 37 days. The judge purported to toll the two year Newberry \r\n  County probationary period while the appellant served the Saluda County sentence.  \r\n  Finally, the judge revoked the Aiken County sentence, requiring service of 37 \r\n  days.  The judge also â€œtolledâ€ the Aiken County probation until after appellant \r\n  served the 51 month active sentence for the Saluda County charges. \r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends that the trial judge erred in tolling the Newberry and Aiken \r\n  County probationary periods while he was incarcerated on the Saluda County charge.  \r\n  We address each charge individually. \r\n1. Newberry County charges\r\nAppellant was sentenced on the Newberry County charges on January 26 and 27 \r\n  of 1999.  Appellant received two sentences to be served concurrently: the first \r\n  was suspended upon credit for time served and two years probation and restitution \r\n  (the 1/26/99 sentence), the second was suspended upon credit for time served \r\n  and two years probation (the 1/27/99 sentence).  Appellantâ€™s probation began \r\n  to run, at the latest, on January 27, 1999.  Therefore, appellantâ€™s probation \r\n  on the Newberry County charges ended no later than January 27, 2001. \r\n  [2]   The probation violation arrest warrant for the Newberry County charges \r\n  was not issued until June 29, 2001. On July 26, 2001, the judge purportedly \r\n  revoked the Newberry County sentence and sought to toll the running of probation \r\n  during appellantâ€™s incarceration on the Saluda County charge.  \r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 \r\n  (Supp. 2002), an arrest warrant for violation of terms of probation may be issued \r\n  â€œ[a]t any time during the period of probation or suspension of sentence.â€  The \r\n  statute â€œauthorizes the court to issue or cause the issuing of a warrant only \r\n  during the period of probation and, in the absence of the timely issuance of \r\n  such warrant, the court is without authority to revoke the probation after the \r\n  probationary period has passed, even though the violation occurred during such \r\n  period.â€  State v. Hutto, 252 S.C. 36, 45-46, 165 S.E.2d 72, 76 (1968).  \r\n  Because the warrant implicates the trial courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  the issue can be raised at any time.  Id.  \r\nA decision â€œto revoke probation generally rests within the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  discretion, [however] an appellate court should reverse when that decision is \r\n  based on an error of law or lacks supporting evidence.â€  State v. Brown, \r\n  349 S.C. 414, 417-18, 563 S.E.2d 339, 340 (Ct. App. 2002).  The Newberry County \r\n  probationary sentences expired approximately five months prior to the issuance \r\n  of the probation arrest warrant.  We need not reach the tolling issue since \r\n  the judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction to revoke the Newberry County \r\n  sentences because a probation arrest warrant was not issued during the probationary \r\n  period. We vacate the judgeâ€™s purported revocation of the Newberry sentences.  \r\n\r\n2. Aiken County charge\r\nAppellant was incarcerated for \r\n  the Aiken County crime, and was paroled on November 8, 2000, with parole expected \r\n  to expire on May 17, 2001.  On May 1, 2001, sixteen days prior to the expiration \r\n  of parole, a probation arrest warrant was issued on the Aiken County charge.  \r\n  Appellant was on parole for the Aiken County sentence when the probation arrest \r\n  warrant for the Aiken County sentence was issued.  \r\nIn South Carolina, parole and probation are governed by statute.  When a prisoner \r\n  is released on parole, the prisoner â€œmust remain in the jurisdiction of the \r\n  [Board of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services] and may at any time on the \r\n  order of the board be imprisoned as and where therein designated.â€  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 24-21-660 (Supp. 2002).  When a parolee violates the terms of his parole, \r\n  â€œthe parole agent must issue a warrant or citation charging the violation of \r\n  the parole, and a final determination must be made by the board as to whether \r\n  the prisonerâ€™s parole should be revokedâ€¦the board shall be the sole judge as \r\n  to whether or not a parole has been violatedâ€¦.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-680 \r\n  (Supp. 2002), Sanders v. McDougall, 244 S.C. 160, 161, 135 S.E.2d 836, \r\n  837 (1964).  \r\nMany states have statutes that \r\n  specifically address the issue of whether parole and probation for the same \r\n  charge run simultaneously.  See eg., Alaska Stat. Â§ 33.20.040(c) \r\n  (2002); Ark. Code Ann. Â§ 5-4-307(b) (2002); N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 15A-1375 (2003).    \r\n  South Carolina has no such statutory provision. In this case, appellant was \r\n  on parole, not probation, when the probation arrest warrant was issued.  The \r\n  Parole Board had revocation authority over the appellant, not the court.  The \r\n  Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services is the supervising agency \r\n  whether a person is on probation or parole.  Since, however, the General Assembly \r\n  has seen fit to provide for different revocation authorities depending upon \r\n  the status of a person as a parolee or a probationer; it is logical to conclude \r\n  that the legislature did not intend for the two states to co-exist.  In the \r\n  absence of a specific statutory direction from the General Assembly that parole \r\n  and probation for the same offense can exist simultaneously, we decline to judicially \r\n  impose such a standard.   \r\nThe probation arrest warrant was \r\n  a nullity since it was not issued â€œduring the time of probation.â€  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 (Supp. 2002). Thus, the alleged revocation of probation on \r\n  the Aiken County charge was a nullity, as the judge had no subject matter jurisdiction.  \r\n  State v. Hutto, supra; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-680 (Supp. 2002).  \r\n  Therefore, the judge could not toll the probation on the Aiken County sentence \r\n  while appellant served the Saluda County sentence. We vacate the judgeâ€™s purported \r\n  revocation of the Aiken County sentence. Since we have held the two lesser probation \r\n  revocations should be vacated, we need not address whether probationary sentences \r\n  can be tolled so as to turn concurrent sentences into consecutive ones.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe revocation of the Saluda County sentence was proper. \r\nHowever, the judgeâ€™s revocation \r\n  of the Newberry County and the Aiken County sentences are VACATED because \r\n  the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and \r\n  BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The record is unclear as to why sentencing was \r\n    deferred.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The record reveals no appropriate period of tolling, \r\n    e.g., absconding or partial revocation and continuance.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25699","title":"In the Matter of F.

In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a nine month suspension \r\n  from the practice of law.  We accept the agreement and suspend respondent from \r\n  the practice of law for nine months.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was retained to represent clients in eight domestic matters and \r\n  one post-conviction relief matter.  Respondent admits that his representation \r\n  of these clients lacked diligence and that he failed to keep the clients adequately \r\n  informed about the status of their actions.  In one of the domestic matters, \r\n  respondent failed to file an action on his client's behalf.  In another domestic \r\n  matter, respondent failed to timely serve the opposing party.  In a third domestic \r\n  matter,  he failed to timely complete the Qualified Domestic Relations Order \r\n  and the action, in general, took an inordinate amount of time to complete.  \r\n  Respondent acknowledges that in two other domestic matters he abandoned his \r\n  representation of the clients.  In four of the domestic matters, respondent \r\n  failed to timely refund the unused portion of the retainer fees to the clients, \r\n  although those clients have now received a refund of their fees.  In seven of \r\n  these matters, and one matter where there was no underlying misconduct found, \r\n  respondent failed to respond to inquiries from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nRespondent acknowledges a pattern of misconduct, but represents, in mitigation, \r\n  that he was suffering from serious depression during the period of time in which \r\n  the misconduct occurred.  As a result of his depression, respondent was unable \r\n  to attend to, or was tardy in performing, some of his work.  Respondent regrets \r\n  his misconduct and has sought professional medical help to address his problems.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall \r\n  act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule \r\n  1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit \r\n  the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation, keep the \r\n  client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply \r\n  with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15(b) (a lawyer shall promptly \r\n  deliver to the client any funds the client is entitled to receive); Rule 1.16(a)(2) \r\n  (a lawyer shall not represent or, where representation has commenced, shall \r\n  withdraw from representation of the client if the lawyer's physical or mental \r\n  condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client); \r\n  Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent \r\n  with the interests of the client); Rule 8.1 (a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary \r\n  matter shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information \r\n  from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it \r\n  is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to \r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority including a \r\n  request for a response); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe hereby accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent \r\n  from the practice of law in this state for nine months.

The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent has had an ongoing shortage \r\n  of client funds in his law firm trust account since approximately 1994.  Since \r\n  that time he has misappropriated approximately $800,000 in client funds to purposes \r\n  other than those for which they were intended.  Currently, there is a shortage \r\n  of $542,000 in client funds.  Respondent's trust account has had repeated overdrafts, \r\n  negative balances and dishonored checks.  Respondent has commingled approximately \r\n  $300,000 of personal funds with client funds in an effort to reduce or cure \r\n  the shortages.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct \r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and \r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer shall hold property \r\n  of clients that is in the lawyer's possession in connection with a representation \r\n  separate from the lawyer's own property); Rule 1.15(b) (a lawyer shall promptly \r\n  deliver to the client any funds that the client is entitled to receive); Rule \r\n  8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that \r\n  is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also acknowledges that \r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions \r\n  of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it \r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to \r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession \r\n  into disrepute); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a \r\n  lawyer to violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in \r\n  this state).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.  Respondent shall pay restitution to presently \r\n  known and subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities \r\n  who have incurred losses as a result of respondent's misconduct in connection \r\n  with this matter.  Respondent shall also reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client \r\n  Protection for any claims paid as a result of his misconduct in connection with \r\n  this matter.  Respondent shall not apply for readmission unless and until all \r\n  such restitution has been paid in full.\r\n Within fifteen days of the date \r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court \r\n  showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also \r\n  surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of \r\n  Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 607, SCACR, Court Reporter Transcripts and Tapes","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-08-06-02","description":"The Supreme Court revised Rule 607(i), effective immediately to require court reporters to retain the primary and backup tapes of a proceeding for at least five years after the date of the proceeding.","date":"2003-08-11","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntitled Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n  RE: Amendment to Rule 607, SCACR, \r\n    Court Reporter Transcripts and Tapes\r\n  \r\n  ORDER\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  We find that the retention schedule for court reporter tapes should be amended. \r\n  Accordingly, pursuant to Article V, &sect;4, of the South Carolina Constitution, \r\n  we amend Rule 607(i), SCACR to read as follows: \r\n\r\n  (i) Retention of Tapes.

[1]   This Court granted the petition \r\n  to provide declaratory judgment and appointed the Honorable Edward B. Cottingham \r\n  as referee.  We conclude Doeâ€™s business association, when conducted as herein \r\n  below prescribed, is proper.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties have stipulated Lender contacted Doe to supervise the execution \r\n  and recordation of loan documents under the following scenario:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Borrower contracts with Lender to refinance an existing first mortgage \r\n  loan previously obtained from the same Lender.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Lender notifies Title Insurance Company of refinance transaction and provides \r\n  relevant Borrower information.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       3.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Out of state office of Title Insurance Company licensed to do business in South \r\n  Carolina orders title search from an independent contractor of its choosing.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       4.\r\n       \r\n  Upon receipt of title search, Title Insurance Company prepares a title commitment \r\n  for the benefit of the Lender.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       5.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Title Insurance Company orders pay-off of existing mortgage.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       6.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Title Insurance Company orders endorsement for Borrowerâ€™s existing homeowners \r\n  insurance policy, if requested by Lender.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Lender prepares loan documents including a set of instructions, a note and mortgage, \r\n  Truth-in-Lending Statement, HUD-1 settlement statement, miscellaneous affidavits \r\n  regarding employment and other forms and forwards to Attorney.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       8.\r\n       \r\n  Attorney reviews loan documents and title commitment and performs any necessary \r\n  curative work on the loan documents or regarding the title.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Attorney meets with Borrower to explain legal ramifications of loan documents \r\n  and answer any questions Borrower may have regarding the documents or the refinancing \r\n  process.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       10.&nbsp;\r\n       Attorney \r\n  supervises execution of loan documents.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       11.&nbsp;\r\n       Attorney \r\n  forwards properly executed loan documents to Title Insurance Company with specific \r\n  instructions regarding how, when and where to satisfy the existing first mortgage \r\n  and to record the new mortgage and any assignments, if applicable.  Attorney \r\n  also authorizes the disbursement of funds if the Borrower does not rescind during \r\n  the three-day period set forth in the Truth-In-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1601, \r\n  et seq. (1997).\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       12.\r\n       In accordance \r\n  with the Attorneyâ€™s instructions, Title Insurance Company satisfies the existing \r\n  first mortgage and transmits for recording the new mortgage and any assignments, \r\n  if applicable, and disburses funds pursuant to the HUD-1 settlement statement.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       13.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       The Lender \r\n  or, in accordance with the Attorneyâ€™s instructions, the Title Insurance Company \r\n  transmits documents evidencing the satisfaction of the paid-off mortgage to \r\n  the appropriate Register of Deeds for recording.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       14.&nbsp;\r\n       Title \r\n  Insurance Company issues final title insurance policy to Lender.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       15.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       For representing \r\n  the Borrower, Attorney receives a fee consistent with the fee typically charged \r\n  in a South Carolina refinance transaction. \r\n  [2] \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe issue of unauthorized practice of law in the area of real estate closings \r\n  is a prolonged legal issue assuming growing national prominence. [3]  The South Carolina Constitution \r\n  provides the Supreme Court with the duty to regulate the practice of law in \r\n  the state.  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 4; In re Unauthorized Practice \r\n  of Law Rules, supra; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-10 \r\n  (1986).  \r\nâ€œThe generally understood definition of the practice of law â€˜embraces the preparation \r\n  of pleadings, and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings, \r\n  and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before \r\n  judges and courts.â€™â€  State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 319, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  576, 577 (1995) (quoting In re Duncan, 83 S.C. 186, 189, 65 S.E. 210, \r\n  211 (1909)).  The practice of law, however, â€œis not confined to litigation, \r\n  but extends to activities in other fields which entail specialized legal knowledge \r\n  and ability.â€  State v. Buyers Service Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 430, \r\n  357 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1987).  For this reason, this Court has consistently refrained \r\n  from adopting a specific rule to define the practice of law.  In re Unauthorized \r\n  Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. at 305, 422 S.E.2d at 124 (stating â€œit is \r\n  neither practicable nor wiseâ€ to formulate a comprehensive definition of what \r\n  the practice of law is).  Instead, the definition of what constitutes the practice \r\n  of law turns on the facts of each specific case.  Id.\r\nThis Court last addressed the unauthorized practice of law in the context of \r\n  real estate closings in State v. Buyers Service Co., Inc., supra. \r\n  Buyers Service divided the purchase of residential real estate into four \r\n  steps:  1) title search; 2) preparation of loan documents; 3) closing; and 4) \r\n  recording title and mortgage.\r\nInitially, Doe suggests the present case is different from Buyers Service \r\n  because the buyer and Lender are attempting to refinance an existing mortgage \r\n  and not to purchase new property.  This distinction is without significance.  \r\n\r\nIn refinancing a real estate mortgage the four steps in the initial  purchase \r\n  situations still exist.  A title examination is conducted to determine the current \r\n  status of the title and any new encumbrances; new loan documents and instruments \r\n  must be crafted to ensure buyer obtains funds to pay off an existing mortgage \r\n  and Lender receives a mortgage to protect its interest; buyer and Lender must \r\n  close on the loan; and the settlement of the old mortgage and recordation of \r\n  the new mortgage must be perfected.  In sum, refinancing affects identical legal \r\n  rights of the buyer and Lender as initial financing and protection of these \r\n  rights is the crux of the practice of law.\r\nA.      Title Search\r\nThe title search portion of the present case encompasses stipulated facts 2 \r\n  through 6.  Doe asserts Title Company has a right to furnish title because it \r\n  is incidental to its business. \r\nIn Buyers Service, this Court addressed a commercial title companyâ€™s \r\n  preparation of title abstracts for persons other than attorneys or themselves.  \r\n  The State in the case argued the buyer relies on the title search to determine \r\n  if he receives good, marketable title.  We agreed and rejected the title companyâ€™s \r\n  argument that it did not need attorney supervision because the title search \r\n  was merely incidental to their own business.  Instead, we found the title search \r\n  company could conduct title examinations only under the supervision of a licensed \r\n  attorney because the â€œexamination of titles requires expert legal knowledge \r\n  and skillâ€ and the search affected the rights of buyers.  Id. at 432, \r\n  357 S.E.2d at 18.\r\nAccording to the stipulated facts it appears Title Company conducts a title \r\n  search and prepares a commitment, for the benefit of the Lender, without supervision \r\n  by a licensed attorney.  While Doe notes the Title Company is licensed to do \r\n  business in South Carolina, we rejected the incidental-to-business approach \r\n  in Buyers Service.  \r\nTitle Companyâ€™s title search and preparation of title documents for the Lender, \r\n  without direct attorney supervision, constitutes the unauthorized practice of \r\n  law.  The title search and subsequent preparation of related documentation is \r\n  permissible only when a licensed attorney supervises the process.  In order \r\n  to comply with this Courtâ€™s ruling Doe must ensure the title search and preparation \r\n  of loan documents are supervised by an attorney.\r\nB.      Preparation of Loan Documents\r\nStipulated facts 7 and 8 concern Lenderâ€™s preparation of loan documents as \r\n  well as the attorneyâ€™s review of the documents and subsequent curative work, \r\n  if needed.  Doe argues the preparation of real estate documents constitutes \r\n  the practice of law, but Lender has a pro se right to prepare documents \r\n  where it is a party.  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina law recognizes an individualâ€™s ability to appear pro se \r\n  with leave of the court.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-80 (Supp. 2002).  \r\n  Corporations, which are artificial creatures of state law, do not have a right \r\n  to appear pro se in all instances.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-320 \r\n  (1986).  We granted corporations the ability to appear pro se, with leave \r\n  of the court, in civil magistrateâ€™s court.  See In re Unauthorized \r\n  Practice of Law, supra.  We explicitly rejected a corporationâ€™s ability \r\n  to appear pro se in a state circuit or appellate court.  Renaissance \r\n  Enterprises, Inc. v. Summit Teleservices, Inc., 334 S.C. 649, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  257 (1999).\r\nThe right of a corporation to practice law by completing real estate loan documents \r\n  is not co-extensive with an individualâ€™s right.  Doeâ€™s citation to this Courtâ€™s \r\n  previous holdings to suggest otherwise is misplaced. \r\n  [4]   In Buyers Service we specifically held the preparation \r\n  of real estate instruments by lay persons constituted the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law.  See Buyers Service, 292 S.C. at 430-31, 357 S.E.2d at \r\n  17-18.  Without the presence of Doe, acting as an independent supervising attorney, \r\n  Lender could not prepare such instruments.\r\nDoe correctly differentiates this case from Buyers Service because an \r\n  independent attorney will review the documents and correct them, if needed.  \r\n  Lender may prepare legal documents for use in refinancing a loan for real property \r\n  as long as an independent attorney reviews and corrects, if needed, the documents \r\n  to ensure their compliance with law.\r\nC.      Closing\r\nStipulated facts 9 and 10 describe the closing process.  We held in Buyers \r\n  Service â€œreal estate and mortgage loan closings should be conducted only \r\n  under the supervision of attorneys.â€  Id. at 434, 357 S.E.2d at 19. \r\nDoe differentiates the present case from Buyers Service because an attorney \r\n  is actively involved in the closing and answers any questions the buyer may \r\n  have.  The purchaser in Buyers Service never spoke with an attorney and \r\n  any questions were answered by non-attorney employees of the title company.  \r\n  Additionally, in Buyers Service the title company employed attorneys \r\n  to review the closing documents.  Yet, we concluded the presence of attorneys, \r\n  acting as employees, did not save the company from unauthorized practice of \r\n  law.  This Court cited to an Arizona case \r\n  [5]  and approved its rationale that â€œadverse interests in real estate \r\n  transactions make it extremely difficult for the attorney to maintain a proper \r\n  professional posture toward each party.â€  Id. at 431-32, 357 S.E.2d at \r\n  18.\r\nHere Lender employs Doe as an attorney to supervise \r\n  the preparation of legal documents, then supervise the loanâ€™s closing and provide \r\n  legal advice to the buyer.  Doe is an independent attorney unlike the attorneys \r\n  in Buyers Service who were employees of the title company.  Doeâ€™s activities \r\n  may still pose an ethical dilemma, however, because a lawyer may not represent \r\n  a client whose interests may be adverse to another client unless the lawyer \r\n  believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with \r\n  the other client and the client consents after consultation. [6]   See Rule 407, SCACR (Rule 1.7 Conflict of \r\n  Interest). \r\nUnder the stipulated facts Lender retains Doe to supervise its own legal work \r\n  as well as provide advice to the buyer at closing.  Although the Lender and \r\n  Buyer have adverse interests, there is no consultation with the buyer to waive \r\n  any potential conflict.  Because real estate closings present a unique situation \r\n  regarding dual representation we do not believe it to be in the publicâ€™s interest \r\n  to create a per se rule barring an attorney under the stipulated facts \r\n  from representing Lender and borrower.  Instead, Doe may participate in the \r\n  closing after giving full disclosure of his role to both parties and obtaining \r\n  consent from both parties to continue. \r\nD.      Recording Instruments\r\nThe final phase of the real estate loan process is recordation of the new mortgage \r\n  and related documents, shown in stipulated facts 11 through 13.  Buyers Service \r\n  clarified the mailing of documents to the courthouse occurs as part of a real \r\n  estate transfer, which is an aspect of conveyancing affecting legal rights, \r\n  is the practice of law.  We held â€œinstructions to the Clerk of Court or Register \r\n  of Mesne Conveyances as to the manner of recording, if given by a lay person \r\n  for the benefit of another, must be given under the supervision of an attorney.â€  \r\n  Buyers Service, 292 S.C. at 434, 357 S.E.2d at 19.\r\nThe recordation process in the stipulation of facts establishes attorney supervision \r\n  of the process.  As such, Doeâ€™s supervisory activities do not constitute the \r\n  unauthorized practice of law.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude Doeâ€™s association as discussed is not violative of the proscription \r\n  against the unauthorized practice of law, as long as the association is conducted \r\n  as herein prescribed.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Rule 5.5 (b), \r\n    SCACR prohibits an attorney from assisting â€œa person who is not a member of \r\n    the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice \r\n    of law.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Due to the nature and procedural posture \r\n    of this case, this opinion is limited to the stipulated facts outlined above.   \r\n    See In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. 304, \r\n    305, 422 S.E.2d 123, 124 (1992).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Disputes between \r\n    attorneys and real estate service providers consistently appear in cases since \r\n    1917.  See, e.g., Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co. v. Maloney, \r\n    165 N.Y.S. 280 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1917); see generally Joyce Palomar, \r\n    The War Between Attorneys and Lay Conveyancers Empirical Evidence Says \r\n    â€œCease Fire!â€, 31 Conn. L. Rev. 423, 471-74 (1999).  The issue is attracting \r\n    attention from the Federal Trade Commission and the Anti-Trust Division of \r\n    the United States Department of Justice.   The FTC and USDOJ have taken a \r\n    greater interest in the monopolistic effects of stateâ€™s unauthorized practice \r\n    of law rules in the real estate context. See John Gibeaut, Real \r\n    Estate Closing Tussle in Tarheel State, 1 No. 3 ABA J. E-Report 7 (2002).  \r\n    However, state limitations in the area are exempt from federal antitrust liability \r\n    under the Sherman Actâ€™s state action exception. See Lenderâ€™s Serv., \r\n    Inc. v. Dayton Bar Assâ€™n, 758 F. Supp. 429, 434-41 (S.D. Ohio 1991).  \r\n    Further, this Court grounds its unauthorized practice rules in the Stateâ€™s \r\n    ability to protect consumers in the state and not as a method to enhance the \r\n    business opportunities for lawyers.  See In re Unauthorized Practice \r\n    of Law Rules, supra.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Doe cites to In \r\n    re Easler, 275 S.C. 400, 272 S.E.2d 32 (1980) (holding that the preparation \r\n    of a deed for another constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); State \r\n    v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 460 S.E.2d 576 (1995) (holding that the preparation \r\n    of legal documents for others to present in family court constitutes the practice \r\n    of law).  Doe argues these cases imply a corporation engages in unauthorized \r\n    practice of law only where it seeks to act on behalf of others and \r\n    not solely itself.  We disagree.\r\n  In re Easler and State v. Despain concerned an individual attempting \r\n    to provide legal advice or services to other individuals.  The fact-specific \r\n    holdings involved individuals providing legal services to others for a fee, \r\n    therefore, the individual was not acting within the pro se exception.  \r\n    As previously stated, the pro se exception for corporations is strictly \r\n    limited.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  State Bar of Arizona \r\n    v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co., 90 Ariz. 76, 366 P.2d 1, reheard, \r\n    91 Ariz. 293, 371 P.2d 1020 (1962).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] \r\n    These ethical concerns are only applicable when there is a\r\n  business relationship between Lender and the attorney. At oral argument, Doe\r\n  made clear that there is no formal business arrangement between himself and\r\n  Lender. Doe is chosen, as is often the case, by Borrower from a list of\r\n  attorneys provided by Lender. Doe affirmed Lender informs Borrower of her\r\n  right to employ an attorney not on the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25701","title":"Camburn v.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(33) (Supp. \r\n  2002).  Appellants contend the statute was unconstitutionally applied.  We agree \r\n  and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nGrandparents, who are Motherâ€™s parents, brought this action in January 2001 \r\n  seeking visitation with their grandchildren - Laura (age 13), Kacie (age 11), \r\n  and David (age 2).  Laura was born while Mother was married to Stephen Biebel \r\n  whose whereabouts are now unknown.  After her brief marriage to Biebel, Mother \r\n  married Husband, to whom she is still married, and gave birth to Kacie.  During \r\n  a period of separation from Husband, Mother conceived and gave birth to her \r\n  son, David, by David Markley.  All three children reside with Mother and Husband, \r\n  who is a long-distance trucker and comes home only on weekends.  Markley is \r\n  incarcerated and Mother brings David to visit him on weekends.\r\nMother, Husband, and Markley contested Grandparentsâ€™ \r\n  visitation.  Mother testified she did not want her children visiting Grandparents \r\n  because she felt it was not a â€œhealthy environment.â€  She objects that Grandfather \r\n  drinks, uses abusive language, and denigrates the childrenâ€™s fathers.  Because \r\n  Grandfather was physically and mentally abusive to her when she was a child, \r\n  she does not consider him her father.  Husband and Markley concurred in Motherâ€™s \r\n  reasons for denying visitation.  Grandfather did not testify.\r\nOn March 12, 2002, the family court entered its final \r\n  order allowing Grandparents weekend visitation with the children every fourth \r\n  weekend, one full week of visitation in the summer, reasonable telephone contact, \r\n  and daytime visitation on December 27 each year.  The family court also ordered \r\n  the payment of guardian ad litem and attorneyâ€™s fees.  Mother and Husband appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.&nbsp;\r\n       Does the application of Â§ 20-70-420(33) in this \r\n  case violate due process?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n       Should the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and guardian ad litem fees be reversed?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n DISCUSSION\r\n1.  Due Process Clause\r\nSection 20-7-420(33) provides:\r\n\r\nThe family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\n(33) To order periods of visitation for the grandparents \r\n  of a minor child where either or both parents of the minor child is or are deceased, \r\n  or are divorced, or are living separate and apart in different habitats [1]  regardless of the existence of a court order or agreement, \r\n  and upon a written finding that the visitation rights would be in the best interests \r\n  of the child and would not interfere with the parent/child relationship. [2]   In determining whether to order \r\n  visitation for the grandparents, the court shall consider the nature of the \r\n  relationship between the child and his grandparents prior to the filing of the \r\n  petition or complaint. \r\n\r\nIn applying this statute, the family court found there was no evidence to â€œjustifyâ€ \r\n  appellantsâ€™ decision denying visitation and visitation was in the childrenâ€™s \r\n  best interest.  Appellants contend this application of Â§ 20-7-420(33) violates \r\n  their due process rights.\r\n          It is well-settled that parents have a protected liberty interest \r\n  in the care, custody, and control of their children.  This is a fundamental \r\n  right protected by the Due Process Clause.  Troxel v. Granville, 530 \r\n  U.S. 57, 65-66 (2000).  \r\nUnder Troxel, the court must give â€œspecial weightâ€ to a fit parentâ€™s \r\n  decision regarding visitation.  530 U.S. at 69-70.  A court considering grandparentsâ€™ \r\n  visitation over a parentâ€™s objection must allow a presumption that a fit parentâ€™s \r\n  decision is in the childâ€™s best interest:  \r\n\r\n[S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., \r\n  is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into \r\n  the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent \r\n  to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parentâ€™s children.\r\n\r\nTroxel, 520 U.S. at 68-69 (parenthetical in original).  Parental unfitness \r\n  must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.  Greenville County \r\n  Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 437 S.E.2d 107 (1993); see \r\n  also Roth v. Weston, 789 A.2d 431 (Conn. 2002).    \r\nThe presumption that a fit parentâ€™s decision is in the best interest of the \r\n  child may be overcome only by showing compelling circumstances, such as significant \r\n  harm to the child, if visitation is not granted.  See Blixt v. Blixt, \r\n  774 N.E.2d 1052 (Mass. 2002); Stacy v. Ross, 798 So.2d 1275 (Miss. 2001).  \r\n  The fact that a child may benefit from contact with the grandparent, or that \r\n  the parentâ€™s refusal is simply not reasonable in the courtâ€™s view, does not \r\n  justify government interference in the parental decision.  See Glidden \r\n  v. Conley, 820 A.2d 197 (Vt. 2003).\r\nIn sum, parents and grandparents are not on an equal footing in a \r\n  contest over visitation.  Before visitation may be awarded over a parentâ€™s objection, \r\n  one of two evidentiary hurdles must be met:  the parent must be shown to be \r\n  unfit by clear and convincing evidence, or there must be evidence of compelling \r\n  circumstances to overcome the presumption that the parental decision is in the \r\n  childâ€™s best interest.\r\nTurning to the facts here, there has been no finding of parental unfitness \r\n  or, more particularly, that Mother, the parent to all three children, is unfit.  \r\n  The family court concluded visitation would be in the childrenâ€™s best interest \r\n  as a stabilizing factor in their lives in light of  Motherâ€™s perceived instability.  \r\n  The court noted the following:  Mother had a child with Markley while she was \r\n  married to Husband; she took the children to Maryland with Markley when Markley \r\n  fled there to avoid arrest and during this time their whereabouts were unknown \r\n  to Husband; the children were not enrolled in school for the few months they \r\n  lived in Maryland; [3]  and Mother was involuntarily committed to psychiatric \r\n  care by Grandmother upon her return from Maryland.\r\nIt is uncontested, however, that the children are well-cared for \r\n  by both Mother and Husband.  Husband has been a father not only to his own daughter, \r\n  Kacie, but to Motherâ€™s older daughter, Laura, as well.  Regarding all three \r\n  children, Husband testified he â€œhas been in their lifeâ€ although he acknowledges \r\n  that David is Markleyâ€™s biological son.  \r\nThere is no clear and convincing evidence here that Mother or Husband is unfit, \r\n  nor did the family court make any such finding.  Further, there are no compelling \r\n  circumstances to overcome the presumption that this decision by fit parents \r\n  is in the childrenâ€™s best interest.  In applying Â§ 20-7-420(33), the court erroneously \r\n  required these parents to â€œjustifyâ€ their decision and found those reasons unsatisfactory.  \r\n  Because the family courtâ€™s application of Â§ 20-7-420(33) unduly interfered with \r\n  appellantsâ€™ parental rights in the care, custody, and control of their own children, \r\n  we reverse the order allowing Grandparents visitation.\r\n2.  Guardian ad \r\n  litem and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nThe family court ordered Mother to pay $3,500 in attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and ordered both Mother and Husband to pay a certain percentage of fees \r\n  for each of the two guardians ad litem.  Appellants contend they should not \r\n  have to pay these fees if the order granting visitation is reversed.  We agree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees will be reversed where the substantive \r\n  results achieved by counsel are reversed on appeal.  Sexton v. Sexton, \r\n  310 S.C. 501, 427 S.E.2d 665 (1993).  Similarly, where guardian ad litem fees \r\n  are incurred in an action that is found meritless on appeal, the party instigating \r\n  the action should pay.  See Hucks v. Dolan, 288 S.C. 468, 343 \r\n  S.E.2d 613 (1986); Schwartz v. Schwartz, 311 S.C. 303, 428 S.E.2d \r\n  748 (Ct. App. 1993).  Accordingly, we reverse the order assessing attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and guardian ad litem fees against Mother and Husband.\r\n REVERSED.  \r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice C. Victor \r\n  Pyle, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    family court found Husband â€œstays at [Motherâ€™s] home on those weekends he \r\n    is in townâ€ but concluded Mother and Husband were separated as required under \r\n    Â§ 20-7-420(33).  There has been no appeal from the finding of separation. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] We \r\n    note the family court failed to find that the ordered weekend visitation will \r\n    not interfere with Husbandâ€™s relationship with Kacie or with Markleyâ€™s relationship \r\n    with his son David.  Husband testified his job prevents him from being home \r\n    except on weekends and visitation with Grandparents would interfere with his \r\n    time with Kacie.  Markley testified weekend visitation would interfere with \r\n    his relationship with David since Mother brings the child to visit him on \r\n    weekends.  There has been no appeal, however, from the family courtâ€™s failure \r\n    to make the requisite findings. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Mother \r\n    testified the children were home-schooled during this time.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Kenneth L.

David Sawyer, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25702\r\nHeard March 5, 2003 - Filed August 25, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThomas E. Elliott, Jr., of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nWilliam Yon Rast, Jr., of W. Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Theron Yon (â€œHusbandâ€) \r\n  appeals the Court of Appealsâ€™ determination that his obligation to make periodic \r\n  alimony payments was revived after his ex-wifeâ€™s subsequent remarriage was annulled.  \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nHusband and Laurie Joye (â€œWifeâ€) were \r\n  married in 1970, and they divorced 26 years later on October 31, 1996.  Husband \r\n  was required to pay wife periodic alimony payments of $750 per month.  On March \r\n  23, 1999, [1]  wife married Donald \r\n  Vance (â€œVanceâ€), but two months later, she discovered that Vance never divorced \r\n  his former spouse.  Wife immediately filed an annulment action, and the family \r\n  court judge granted the annulment on September 24, 1999.  \r\n Wife filed a contempt action against Husband \r\n  for his failure to pay alimony arguing that since her subsequent marriage was \r\n  void ab initio, Husbandâ€™s obligation to make periodic alimony payments \r\n  never terminated.  The judge did not hold Husband in contempt, but he did find \r\n  Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation continued and ordered Husband to make the payments \r\n  retroactively and prospectively.  \r\nHusband appealed, and the Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed, finding that a second bigamous marriage is void from its inception \r\n  and is perceived as never having existed.  Consequently, husbandâ€™s alimony obligation \r\n  never ceased.  Joye v. Yon, 345 S.C. 264, 547 S.E.2d 888 (Ct. App. 2001).  \r\n\r\nThis Court granted a Petition for Certiorari \r\n  to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to uphold the trial judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s delinquency in paying wife alimony.  Husband raises the following \r\n  issue on appeal:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals \r\n  err in affirming the family court judgeâ€™s reinstatement of Husbandâ€™s alimony \r\n  obligation?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nWhether an annulment of a remarriage reinstates \r\n  the payor spouseâ€™s periodic alimony obligation is a novel issue of law in South \r\n  Carolina.  In South Carolina, the payor spouseâ€™s periodic alimony obligation \r\n  terminates upon his death, remarriage of payee spouse, or after payee spouse \r\n  has continuously cohabitated with another for a ninety-day period.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1) (Supp. 2002).  [2]     \r\nCourts are split as to how to classify \r\n  the effect a payee spouseâ€™s remarriage and subsequent annulment has on pre-existing \r\n  periodic alimony payments.  They have adopted one of the following rules: (1) \r\n  the void/voidable approach, (2) the automatic termination approach, or (3) a \r\n  case by case approach.  See Carla M. Venhoff, Divorce or Death, Remarriage \r\n  &amp; Annulment: The Path Toward Reinstating Financial Obligations from a Previous \r\n  Marriage, 37 Brandeis L.J. 435 (1998) (advocating that courts should adopt \r\n  the void/voidable approach).\r\nUnder the void/voidable approach, the \r\n  courts will determine whether the subsequent marriage was either void ab \r\n  initio or voidable.  A subsequent marriage that is void ab initio \r\n  is deemed to never have existed.  Thus, states that have adopted the void/voidable \r\n  approach find that since a void marriage never existed, the payor spouse is \r\n  not relieved of his periodic alimony obligation.  See Broadus v. Broadus, \r\n  361 So.2d 582, 585 (Ala.Civ.App.1978); Reese v. Reese, 192 So.2d 1, 2 \r\n  (Fla. 1966); Johnston v. Johnston, 592 P.2d 132, 135 (Kan. 1979); Watts \r\n  v. Watts, 547 N.W.2d 466, 470 (Neb. 1996); Brewer v. Miller, 673 \r\n  S.W.2d 530, 532 (Tenn. App. 1984). \r\n  [3]   A voidable marriage is legally valid until an annulment is granted, \r\n  and these jurisdictions hold that the prior periodic alimony obligation is terminated \r\n  upon remarriage.  Id.  \r\nUnder the automatic termination approach, \r\n  a subsequent marriage extinguishes the payor spouseâ€™s periodic alimony obligation \r\n  regardless of the future status of the remarriage.  In re Marriage of Kolb, \r\n  425 N.E.2d 1301 (Ill. App. 1981).  This approach operates under the notion that \r\n  the payee spouse, who entered into the subsequent marriage, should bear the \r\n  risk that the subsequent marriage is voided.  Glass v. Glass, 546 S.W.2d \r\n  738 (Mo. App. 1977); Shank v. Shank, 691 P.2d 872 (Nev. 1984); G. \r\n  v. G., 387 A.2d 200 (Del. Fam. Ct. 1977).  These courts find that the payor \r\n  spouse should be able to rely on the expectation that payee spouseâ€™s subsequent \r\n  marriage is not voided due to the actions of payee spouseâ€™s subsequent spouse.  \r\n  See Richards v. Richards, 353 A. 141 (N.J. 1976); McKonkey v. McKonkey, \r\n  215 S.E.2d 640 (Va. 1975).  Finally, these jurisdictions reason that the payee \r\n  spouseâ€™s decision to remarry transfers any financial burden from payor spouse \r\n  to the new spouse.  Beebe v. Beebe, 179 S.E.2d 758 (Ga. 1971).\r\nThe third and final approach allows the \r\n  family court judge to achieve an equitable result to this unique issue on a \r\n  case by case basis.  See, In re Marriage of Cargill, 843 P.2d \r\n  1335 (Colo. 1993); Peters v. Peters, 214 N.W.2d 151 (Iowa 1974); Louanne \r\n  S. Love, The Way We Were: Reinstatement of Alimony After Annulment of Spouseâ€™s \r\n  â€œRemarriageâ€, 28 J. Fam. L. 289 (1990).  Under this method, the family court \r\n  need not adhere to a bright-line rule and can consider relevant factors such \r\n  as: length of the subsequent marriage, whether the payee spouse receives support \r\n  and maintenance from the annulled marriage, whether the payor spouse is prejudiced \r\n  by the revival of alimony payments, whether the subsequent marriage was properly \r\n  annulled, and any change in the spousesâ€™ personal and financial circumstances \r\n  after the subsequent marriage is annulled.  Cargill, 843 P.2d at 1343; \r\n  see also, Peters, 214 N.W.2d 151; In re Marriage of Williams, \r\n  677 P.2d 585 (Mont. 1984); Love, Alimony After Annulment, 28 J. Fam. \r\n  L. 289 (1990).     \r\n We hold that the case by case approach \r\n  affords the Court the most appropriate method for resolving this novel issue.  \r\n  Just as the family court employs principles of equity in determining support \r\n  and maintenance, equitable distribution, and child custody, so should it embrace \r\n  these same principles in determining whether payor spouseâ€™s periodic alimony \r\n  obligation is revived after payee spouseâ€™s subsequent marriage is annulled.  \r\n\r\nRestricting family courts to the rigid \r\n  void/voidable approach or the automatic termination approach could produce unjust \r\n  results.  For example, payee spouse remarries, and ten years later, she discovers \r\n  that her present marriage was bigamous.  If the state employs the void/voidable \r\n  approach, former payor spouseâ€™s support and maintenance is revived regardless \r\n  of the change of circumstances and the amount of time payee spouse had to determine \r\n  that her second marriage was void ab initio.  Equity may deem \r\n  this result unfair.  Another example would be a payee spouse being fraudulently \r\n  induced into a subsequent marriage.  She quickly discovers the fraud, brings \r\n  an annulment action, and her subsequent marriage is void.  Under the automatic \r\n  termination approach, the family court judge would be barred from reinstating \r\n  periodic alimony.  Equity may also deem this result unfair, as the payee \r\n  spouseâ€™s subsequent marriage was short-lived, and the payor spouse would likely \r\n  not be prejudiced if he resumed making the alimony payments. \r\n  [4]   A case by case approach provides the family court judge with the tools \r\n  to avoid these potentially inequitable results.   \r\nWe believe that the Cargill factors \r\n  mentioned above provide a sound basis for a case by case analysis, and since \r\n  the Record on Appeal contains scant information as to Husbandâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s change \r\n  of circumstances after their divorce, we hold that the case should be remanded \r\n  to the family court so that the record can be reopened to include evidence to \r\n  assist the court in employing the Cargill analysis.  We also hold that \r\n  regardless of whether the family court determines to reinstate periodic alimony \r\n  payments or not, Husband has no obligation to pay retroactive alimony to Wife \r\n  for the time period that Wife was married to her bigamous husband.   \r\nConclusion\r\nWe REVERSE the \r\n  Court of Appeals and REMAND this case to family court and direct it to \r\n  apply the case by case approach in analyzing whether to reinstate payor spouseâ€™s \r\n  pre-existing periodic alimony obligation after payee spouseâ€™s remarriage was \r\n  annulled.  \r\n MOORE and BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J, dissenting in a separate opinion in which WALLER, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in adopting the void/voidable approach and therefore agree that its decision \r\n  should be reversed.  However, I disagree with the majority that the case by \r\n  case approach is the best alternative and would adopt automatic termination \r\n  as the most appropriate method for terminating the payor spouseâ€™s periodic alimony \r\n  obligation. Therefore, I would not remand the case to the family court.  \r\nOne of the Cargill factors to be considered in the case by case approach \r\n  is the length of the subsequent marriage.  In South Carolina, alimony can be \r\n  terminated under the ninety day cohabitation statute. \r\n  [5]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(B) (Supp. 2002). The ninety day cohabitation \r\n  rule does not require that the couple cohabit while married, only that the â€œsupported \r\n  spouse reside[] with another person in a romantic relationship for a period \r\n  of ninety or more consecutive days.â€  Id. [6]   In my opinion, if residing with another in a romantic relationship \r\n  for ninety days, without being married, terminates alimony, then marrying, regardless \r\n  of the length of the marriage or whether it was legal, should terminate alimony. \r\n  The intent of the payee spouse is important. Whether the payee spouse lives \r\n  in a romantic relationship with another or marries another, the payee spouse \r\n  enters into the relationship fully aware that periodic alimony will terminate.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several policy considerations that, in my \r\n  opinion, make automatic termination a better rule.  The case by case approach \r\n  seems to imply that a payee spouse would not remarry were it not for the existence \r\n  of a substitute source of support.  I do not agree with this implication. Further, \r\n  the automatic termination approach provides a bright line rule that is predictable. \r\n  Under the case by case or void/voidable approach, a payor spouse could conceivably \r\n  be in limbo for years, assuming that the ninety day rule were not triggered.  \r\n  While inequitable results could obtain for either spouse under any approach, \r\n  the certainty of the automatic termination approach makes it the most appealing.  \r\n  If either party should bear the risk of uncertainty arising out of entry into \r\n  a new relationship, it should be the payee spouse.  Therefore, I would hold \r\n  automatic termination is the appropriate rule.  \r\n\r\nWALLER, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Husbandâ€™s final periodic alimony payment was on \r\n    March 25, 1999.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  We note that a recent amendment to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. \r\n    2002) does not apply to this matter.  The amendment added â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ \r\n    of the supported spouse as an additional ground to terminate periodic alimony \r\n    payments, S.C. Code Â§ 20-3-130(B)(1) (Supp. 2002), and defined â€œcontinued \r\n    cohabitationâ€ as â€œthe supported spouse [residing] with another person in a \r\n    romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more consecutive days.â€  This \r\n    section does not apply to this case because the Record shows that Wife was \r\n    married to Vance for only two months before she filed the annulment action, \r\n    so she could not have satisfied the ninety-day requirement.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The following types of marriages in South Carolina \r\n    are considered void ab initio: (1) bigamous marriages, S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 20-1-80 (Supp. 2002); (2) same sex marriages, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-1-15 (Supp. \r\n    2002); and (3) marriages of minors under the age of 16, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-1-100 \r\n    (supp. 2002).   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The dissent would adopt the automatic termination approach because \r\n    the payee spouseâ€™s decision to remarry evidences her intent to no longer receive \r\n    alimony.  In addition, the dissent argues the payor spouse could be inconvenienced \r\n    by the case by case method.  We disagree. The new, ninety day cohabitation \r\n    rule will drastically reduce the time that a payor spouse will be â€œin limbo.â€  \r\n    Further, for instances, such as this, where the ninety day rule does not apply, \r\n    the case by case method will provide an equitable approach to resolving the \r\n    alimony issue, and the payee spouse will not be subjected to a bright line \r\n    rule that may have an inequitable result.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Although this statute does not apply in this case \r\n    because the action was filed in 1999, before the effective date, I note that \r\n    the ninety day rule will remove most future cases from the ambit of the case \r\n    by case approach.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  The ninety day rule cannot be defeated by cessation \r\n    of cohabitation for brief periods for that purpose.  Rather, â€œtackingâ€ of \r\n    the periods is allowed.  S.C. Code Ann.

Ballard, of West Columbia, \r\n  and Philip Lacy, of Columbia, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  This case \r\n  involves a cross appeal of the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict in favor of Collins Music Company (â€œCollinsâ€) because the Appellant/Respondent, \r\n  James R. Munn (â€œMunnâ€), could not prove actual compensable damages in his claim \r\n  of fraud.   \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn February of 1987, \r\n  FMW Corporation (â€œFMWâ€) issued a note and mortgage to Collins in the principal \r\n  sum of $50,000.  The debt was to be repaid in one year and was secured by certain \r\n  real property.  FMW used the proceeds of the check to renovate its truck stop.  \r\n  While Bob Finney (â€œFinneyâ€), F.M. Witt (â€œWittâ€), and Munn admit that they signed \r\n  and personally guaranteed the FMW note and mortgage, they testified that Collins \r\n  never intended that they pay back the note.  Instead, they testified that the \r\n  $50,000 represented an advancement on the future proceeds that Collinsâ€™ video \r\n  poker machines would generate, and the note and mortgage were to provide security \r\n  that its machines would remain at the truck stops.  Collinsâ€™ agent testified \r\n  that he never promised to forgive the obligation on the note.  \r\nIn 1989, Collins entered \r\n  into a Coin Machine Lease Agreement with Munn and FMW, which does not refer \r\n  to the 1987 note and mortgage but does contain an integration provision.  The \r\n  integration clause states that the agreement â€œcontains all agreements of the \r\n  parties, there being no other reservations or understandings.â€  \r\nCollins brought this \r\n  action to collect on the 1987 note and mortgage.   In their answer, Finney, \r\n  [1]  Witt, and Munn asserted fraud as an affirmative defense and counterclaimed \r\n  asserting that Collins fraudulently induced them to personally guarantee the \r\n  note and mortgage.  The jury returned a verdict for Finney, Munn, and Witt on \r\n  the fraud counterclaim awarding each of the three parties $1.00 in nominal damages \r\n  and $200,000 in punitive damages.  FMW was not awarded any damages.  \r\nThe trial judge granted \r\n  Collinsâ€™ motion for JNOV, finding that Witt, Munn, and Finney had not established \r\n  a cause of action for fraud since they did not prove actual damages - an essential \r\n  element of a fraud claim.  In addition, the judge also concluded that Collins \r\n  could not recover on its breach of contract cause of action since the jury found \r\n  for Witt, Munn, and Finney on its affirmative defense to fraud. [2]   Both parties have appealed raising the following issue:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial judge err in granting Collinsâ€™ JNOV motion on Witt, Finney and \r\n  Munnâ€™s fraud counterclaim on the basis that they could not establish a fraud \r\n  cause of action since they failed to show they suffered actual damages resulting \r\n  from the alleged misrepresentation?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nUpon appellate \r\n  review of an action at law tried by a jury, the juryâ€™s findings of fact will \r\n  not be disturbed unless the reviewing tribunal determines that no evidence in \r\n  the record supports the juryâ€™s conclusion.  Townes Associates Limited v. \r\n  City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).  \r\nI.       \r\n  Actual Damages\r\nMunn argues that the \r\n  trial judge erred in setting aside the verdict on their counterclaim for fraud \r\n  on the grounds that they failed to establish actual damages.  We disagree.   \r\n\r\nA determination of the \r\n  presence of actual damages in this case is controlled by our analysis in Daniels, \r\n  253 S.C. 218, 169 S.E.2d 593.  In Daniels, the plaintiffsâ€™ brother and \r\n  father owed the defendant a sizeable debt.  The plaintiffsâ€™ father conveyed \r\n  his $75,000 to $100,000 farm to the plaintiffs for $5.00 and love and affection.  \r\n  The defendant, who became angered by this transaction, sought to settle a portion \r\n  of the outstanding debt with the plaintiffs.  The parties negotiated a settlement \r\n  where the plaintiffs executed a $20,000 note, secured by a mortgage on the farm \r\n  to the defendant, and the defendant agreed to release the father from any debt \r\n  obligation and to restructure the brotherâ€™s obligation by reducing the interest \r\n  rate.  Id. at 222-223, 169 S.E.2d at 595.    \r\nThe plaintiffs signed \r\n  the note, but the parties had not agreed to the provisions of the release when \r\n  the defendant surreptitiously â€œtookâ€ the note and mortgage from the plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  attorneyâ€™s office and attempted to record the mortgage.  The defendant had not \r\n  attempted to collect on the debt when the plaintiffs filed an action for fraud.  \r\n  The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, declaring the note and mortgage \r\n  null and void and granting $17,000 of punitive damages for the fraud action.  \r\n  Id. at 223-224, 169 S.E.2d at 595-596.  \r\nThis Court reversed, \r\n  finding that the plaintiffs did not prove that they suffered any actual damages.  \r\n  The Court analyzed a line of cases that suggested that damages are inherently \r\n  embedded within oneâ€™s obligation on a promissory note.  See Nipper v. Griffin \r\n  Mercantile Co., 120 S.E. 439 (Ga. App. 1923); Plantersâ€™ Bank &amp; Trust \r\n  Co., v. Yelverton, 117 S.E. 299 (N.C. 1923): See also 91 A.L.R. 2d \r\n  354 (1963).  The Court held that while the potential damages associated with \r\n  a promissory obligation are sufficient to establish the damage element of the \r\n  affirmative defense to fraud, they are insufficient to establish the actual \r\n  pecuniary damages element of a fraud claim.  Id. at 226-227, 169 S.E.2d \r\n  at 597. \r\nThe Daniels Court reasoned \r\n  that when fraud is asserted as an affirmative defense to a breach of contract \r\n  action, the defendant is exposed to a threat of loss in that the plaintiff might \r\n  prevail on the breach of contract and subject the defendant to liability on \r\n  the obligation.  Id.  The Daniels Court distinguished the threat \r\n  of loss concept from the actual loss element that was necessary for the plaintiffs \r\n  to prevail on their fraud claim and held that the plaintiffs had suffered no \r\n  pecuniary loss resulting from defendantâ€™s questionable actions in procuring \r\n  the note and mortgage.  Id.\r\nThe present case closely resembles \r\n  the Daniels case.  Here, Witt, Finney, and Munn could successfully defend \r\n  against Collinsâ€™ breach of contract action because there was a threat of damages \r\n  if Collins prevailed.  If Collinsâ€™ prevailed, Witt, Finney, and Munn would be \r\n  stuck with a sizeable judgment against them for $50,000 plus interest.  \r\nIn our opinion, the trial judge \r\n  correctly ruled that the jury found that Witt, Finney, and Munn prevailed on \r\n  the fraud affirmative defense since they could establish the threat of damages.  \r\n  Consequently, their obligation on the note and mortgage was terminated.  As \r\n  to their fraud claim, they could not establish any actionable, out-of-pocket \r\n  damages because the only threat of damages to which they were subjected was \r\n  the potential liability on the note and mortgage.  Further, any expenses that \r\n  Witt, Finney or Munn may have incurred in defending this action do not fall \r\n  within the ambit of fraud damages.  This Court has stated,\r\n\r\nWhere the rights, or asserted \r\n  rights, of parties are in conflict, it is inevitable that each party desiring \r\n  to protect his rights must give time and attention to that end.  To do so is \r\n  not generally an element of damage, although it may be in some situations where \r\n  loss of earnings is involved, which is not the case here.  \r\nNor do recoverable damages include \r\n  the expense of employing counsel, except when so provided by contract or statute, \r\n  which is not the case here.\r\nThis is the general law of the \r\n  land.  \r\n\r\nRimer v. State Farm Mutual \r\n  Automobile Insurance Company, 248 S.C. 18, 27, 148 S.E.2d 742, 746 (1966) \r\n  (citing 25 C.J.S. Damages Â§ 50); see also Prickett v. A &amp; \r\n  B Electrical Service, Inc., 280 S.C. 123, 311 S.E.2d 402 (Ct. App. 1984) \r\n  (finding that expenses incurred defending a cross-complaint are not considered \r\n  consequential damages, so without evidence of other actual damages, fraud cannot \r\n  be proved). \r\n The trial judge correctly \r\n  held that the threat of damages allowed Witt, Finney, and Munn to prevail on \r\n  their affirmative defense to Collinsâ€™ breach of contract claim, and their obligation \r\n  on the note and mortgage was extinguished.  However, we find that the threat \r\n  of loss on the breach of contract action, which was not a pecuniary loss to \r\n  which Witt, Finney and Munn were subjected prior to the cause of action, is \r\n  not a form of actual damages that is contemplated by the fraud cause of action.  \r\n  Therefore, we hold that the trial judgeâ€™s grant of JNOV in setting aside the \r\n  award of punitive damages was appropriate.  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, \r\n  we AFFIRM the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a JNOV.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Finney had passed away, and his estate was substituted \r\n    as a party.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The judge ruled in Witt, Munn, and Finneyâ€™s favor based on the following \r\n    principle: â€œwhere fraud is merely set up as a defense and compensation by \r\n    way of damages is not sought, it has been held that damage need not be proved.â€  \r\n    Daniels v.

Taggart, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAndrew F. Lindemann and Barton Jon Vincent, both of Davidson, \r\n  Morrison, and Lindemann, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: \r\n  Appellant, Charles Sullivan (\"Sullivan\"), appeals from the circuit court's \r\n  decision affirming the Administrative Law Judge's (\"ALJ\") dismissal of his claim.  \r\n\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nSullivan is currently serving a 35-year \r\n  sentence within the South Carolina Department of Corrections (\"SCDC\") after \r\n  pleading guilty to 32 separate charges in 1998. \r\n  [1]   Once incarcerated, Sullivan attended and successfully completed Phase \r\n  I of the Sex Offender Treatment Program (\"SOTP\").  Upon completion of Phase \r\n  I, Sullivan sought admission to the second phase of the SOTP, but received no \r\n  response to his request.  Subsequently, Sullivan filed a Step 1 Inmate Grievance \r\n  Form complaining that he was denied access to Phase II of the SOTP.  In his \r\n  grievance, Sullivan requested to be enrolled immediately in Phase II of the \r\n  program.\r\nWhen Sullivan failed to receive the requested \r\n  relief, he filed a Step 2 Inmate Grievance Form.  The SCDC denied Sullivan's \r\n  grievance as follows:\r\n\r\nDue to bed space availability, inmates are placed on a waiting \r\n  list for evaluation and interviewed prior to participation in the SOTP program.  \r\n  The interview will determine if an inmate will participate in SOTP Phase II.\r\n\r\nTherefore, your grievance is denied.\r\nSullivan appealed the SCDC's \r\n  decision to the ALJ Division (\"ALJD\").  SCDC filed a motion to dismiss, alleging \r\n  that the ALJD lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review SCDC's decision.  \r\n  Citing the ALJD's en banc decision, McNeil v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, \r\n  02-ALJ-04-00336-AP (filed Sept. 5, 2001), the ALJ concluded that \"no jurisdiction \r\n  exists in the ALJD to decide this matter.\" \r\nSullivan filed a petition \r\n  in the circuit court seeking review of the ALJ's dismissal order.  The appeal \r\n  was heard, and several months later, an order dismissing Sullivan's appeal was \r\n  issued.  The circuit court's order found that \"because [Sullivan] does not challenge \r\n  the calculation of his sentence-related credits, custody status, nor is [Sullivan] \r\n  the object of punishment in a major disciplinary hearing that the ALJD did not \r\n  have jurisdiction.\" \r\nSullivan appealed to \r\n  the South Carolina Court of Appeals, and by order dated June 28, 2002, the appeal \r\n  was certified to this Court.  The following issues are currently before this \r\n  Court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the ALJD have subject matter jurisdiction to review the SCDC's resolution \r\n  of Sullivan's grievance?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    If so, may Sullivan proceed in forma pauperis before the ALJD? \r\n  [2] \r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  ALJD's Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nSullivan argues that the \r\n  ALJ erred in refusing to review the SCDC's denial of his grievance, and, in \r\n  turn, that the circuit court erred in affirming the ALJ's decision.  We disagree.\r\nIn Al-Shabazz v. State, this Court held:\r\n\r\n[a]n inmate may . . . seek review of [the SCDC's] final \r\n  decision in an administrative manner under the [Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  (&quot;APA&quot;)].  Placing review of these cases within the ambit of the APA \r\n  will ensure that an inmate receives due process, which consists of notice, a \r\n  hearing, and judicial review.\r\n\r\n338 S.C. 354, 369, 527 S.E.2d 742, 750 (1999).  \r\n\r\nIn Al-Shabazz, the Court recognized that \r\n  the administrative matters entitled to review by the ALJD \"typically arise in \r\n  two ways:  (1) when an inmate is disciplined and punishment is imposed and (2) \r\n  when an inmate believes prison officials have erroneously calculated his sentence, \r\n  sentence-related credits, or custody status.&quot;  338 S.C. at 369, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  at 750.  The Court explained further that procedural due process was guaranteed \r\n  only when an inmate was deprived of an interest encompassed by the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment's protection of liberty and property.  Id.  \r\nIn Wolff v. McDonnell, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court determined that Nebraska had created a liberty interest to good \r\n  time credits by statute, which provided that good time credits were to be forfeited \r\n  only for serious misbehavior.  418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d \r\n  935, 951 (1974) (citing Neb.Rev.Stat. Â§ 83-1 (Supp.1972)). Based on Nebraska's \r\n  statute, the United States Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\nthe State having created the right to good time and itself \r\n  recognizing that its deprivation is a sanction authorized for major misconduct, \r\n  the prisoner's interest [in good time credits] has real substance and is sufficiently \r\n  embraced within the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;liberty&quot; to entitle him \r\n  to those minimum procedures appropriate under the circumstances and required \r\n  by the Due Process clause to ensure that the state-created right is not arbitrarily \r\n  abrogated.\r\n\r\n418 U.S. at 557, 94 S.Ct. at 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  951.\r\nTwo decades after Wolff, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court decided Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 115 S. Ct. 2293, \r\n  132 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995).  In Sandin, the Supreme Court reexamined the \r\n  circumstances under which state prison regulations afforded inmates a liberty \r\n  interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  Id.  The Sandin \r\n  Court recognized that states may create liberty interests which are protected \r\n  by the Due Process Clause, but held that \"these interests will be generally \r\n  limited to freedom from restraint which . . . imposes atypical and significant \r\n  hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"  \r\n  Id. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300, 132 L. Ed. 2d. at 430 (emphasis added).  \r\n  The inmate in Sandin challenged that the prison's imposition of solitary \r\n  confinement for his misconduct implicated a liberty interest deserving of due \r\n  process protection.  The Court disagreed, holding that \"discipline in segregated \r\n  confinement did not present the kind of atypical, significant deprivation \r\n  in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.\"  \r\n  Id. at 486, 115 S. Ct. at 2301, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 431 (emphasis added). [3]     \r\nLike the inmate in Wolff, the inmate in \r\n  Al-Shabazz protested the SCDC's reduction of good time credits that he \r\n  had accrued as a method of punishment.  In Al-Shabazz, this Court found \r\n  the inmate had a &quot;protected liberty interest due to the potential loss \r\n  of sentence-related credits&quot; and, therefore, that he was entitled to review \r\n  by the ALJD and then by the judicial branch.  338 S.C. at 382, 527 S.E.2d at \r\n  757.\r\nRecently, in Furtick v. S.C. Dept. of Probation, \r\n  Parole and Pardon Services, this Court held that the permanent denial \r\n  of parole eligibility implicates a liberty interest sufficient to require \r\n  at least minimal due process, and, therefore, review by the ALJD.  352 S.C. \r\n  594, 598, 576 S.E.2d 146, 149 (2003).  In reaching this conclusion, the Court \r\n  emphasized the finality of the Department's decision, and distinguished the \r\n  final determination of parole eligibility from the temporary granting \r\n  or denial of parole to an eligible inmate.  Id. at n.4.  Although the \r\n  Court found S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-620 created a liberty interest in the one-time \r\n  determination of parole eligibility, it was quick to note that the statute \r\n  did not create a liberty interest in parole. [4]   Id.\r\nDenial of Sullivan's grievance did not arise in \r\n  any of the \"typical\" ways enumerated in Al-Shabazz; it is not the result \r\n  of a disciplinary proceeding and does not involve sentence-related credits or \r\n  custody status.  Sullivan's claim is most accurately described as a \"condition \r\n  of confinement claim.\"  Under Wolff, Sandin, Al-Shabazz, and Furtick, \r\n  to determine whether Sullivan is entitled to review of the SCDC's decision, \r\n  the Court must decide whether Sullivan's request for access to SOTP II implicates \r\n  a liberty interest sufficient to trigger procedural due process guarantees.  \r\n  The only way for the ALJ Division to obtain subject matter jurisdiction over \r\n  Sullivan's claim is if it implicates a state-created liberty interest.  See \r\n  Sandin; Furtick.  \r\nSullivan contends that the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  guarantees him a right to rehabilitation, which requires the SCDC to give him \r\n  access to sex offender treatment while incarcerated.  The South Carolina Constitution \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly shall establish institutions for the \r\n  confinement of all persons convicted of such crimes as may be designated by \r\n  law, and shall provide for the custody, maintenance, health, welfare, education, \r\n  and rehabilitation of the inmates.           \r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. XII, Â§ 2 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nIn McLamore v. State, \r\n  this Court declined to impose a duty of education or rehabilitation on the \r\n  prison system.  257 S.C. 413, 186 S.E.2d 250 (1972).  Instead, the Court held \r\n  that \"[e]fforts to rehabilitate and educate are to be commended; to require \r\n  that every prisoner be treated exactly alike might discourage rather than encourage \r\n  the programs.\"  Id. at 423, 186 S.E.2d at 255.  Even if this provision \r\n  is read to require some rehabilitation for inmates, it does not mandate \r\n  any specific programs that must be provided by the General Assembly or the SCDC \r\n  and, more importantly, it does not mandate any particular timetable for the \r\n  furnishing of any rehabilitative services.    \r\nSullivan has already received \r\n  some rehabilitation; he successfully completed Phase I of the SOTP.  Further, \r\n  in denying Sullivan's grievance request for \"immediate\" enrollment in Phase \r\n  II of the SOTP, the SCDC simply stated that there was no space in the program, \r\n  but indicated that there was a waiting list.  If room becomes available, it \r\n  may even become possible for Sullivan to enroll in Phase II.\r\nIn our opinion, the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution does not require that the SCDC grant Sullivan enrollment in SOTP \r\n  II.  To interpret the constitutional mandate in Article XII, Â§ 2, as requiring \r\n  the SCDC to provide this specific program, would make the ALJD and then the \r\n  judicial branch micro-managers of the prison system.  See Abbeville County \r\n  Sch. Dist. v. State, 335 S.C. 58, 68-69, 515 S.E.2d 535, 541 (1999) (holding \r\n  that S.C. Const. Art. XI, Â§ 3, which requires the General Assembly \"to provide \r\n  for the maintenance and support of a system of free public education,\" guarantees \r\n  only a \"minimally adequate education,\" and does not call for this Court to dictate \r\n  what programs are to be used in this State's public schools).  In addition, \r\n  such a holding would conflict with the hands-off approach that this Court has \r\n  taken towards internal prison matters.  Al-Shabazz.  Finally, recognizing \r\n  a liberty interest in a specific course of rehabilitation does not comport with \r\n  Sandin's standard; denying Sullivan access to SOTP II or any other sex \r\n  offender program does not impose an \"atypical or significant hardship\" on Sullivan \r\n  as all other inmates designated as sex offenders are afforded the same access \r\n  to treatment. \r\nBecause the SCDC's denial of \r\n  enrollment in SOTP II does not implicate a liberty interest, we find that Sullivan's \r\n  grievance is not entitled to review by the ALJD. [5] \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn Forma Pauperis \r\n   \r\nSullivan maintains that \r\n  indigent inmates should be entitled to proceed in forma pauperis in appeals \r\n  from the decision of the ALJ under the APA.  We disagree.\r\nIn Ex Parte: Martin v. State, 321 S.C. 533, \r\n  471 S.E.2d 135 (1995), the Court addressed when an inmate may proceed \r\n  in forma pauperis. This Court held, \"[i]n the absence of a statutory \r\n  provision allowing the general waiver of filing fees, we conclude motions to \r\n  proceed in forma pauperis may only be granted where specifically authorized \r\n  by statute or required by constitutional provisions.\"  Id. at 535, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d at 134-35 (citations omitted).  There is no statutory provision that \r\n  permits the waiver of filing fees for an appeal brought under the APA, and S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 8-21-310(11)(a) provides that a clerk of court must collect a filing \r\n  fee of $100.00 for any complaint or petition. \r\nSullivan urges the Court to make an exception for \r\n  appeals from the ALJD that would have been brought as PCRs prior to Al-Shabazz.  \r\n  Alternatively, Sullivan contends that the waiver of the filing fees for cases \r\n  like his is constitutionally required.  See Martin, 321 S.C. at 535, \r\n  471 S.E.2d at 135 (noting that \"where certain fundamental rights are involved, \r\n  the Constitution requires that an indigent be allowed access to the courts.\").\r\nThe General Assembly is the body charged with the \r\n  power to waive filing fees, and they have not created a waiver for this set \r\n  of cases.  Further, this is not a case involving \"fundamental rights,\" so access \r\n  to the courts is not constitutionally required in this case.  Therefore, Sullivan \r\n  is not entitled to proceed in forma pauperis on his appeal from the ALJ's \r\n  dismissal.  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM \r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Sullivan pled guilty to multiple counts of the following charges: \r\n    committing a lewd act upon a child, exhibiting harmful performance, sexual \r\n    exploitation of a minor, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  \r\n    Sullivan also pled guilty to two counts of assault and battery of a high and \r\n    aggravated nature. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  This issue was briefed at the request of the Court. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that disciplinary segregation \r\n    mirrored conditions other inmates experienced who were in administrative segregation \r\n    and protective custody.  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  In simple terms, this means that an inmate has a right of review \r\n    by the ALJD after a final decision that he is ineligible for \r\n    parole, but that a parole-eligible inmate does not have the same right of \r\n    review after a decision denying parole; the parole board is, however, required \r\n    to review an inmate's case every twelve months after a negative parole determination.  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-620 (Supp. 2002).  This distinction stems from the \r\n    fact that parole is a privilege, not a right.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The en banc decision of the ALJD in McNeil formed the basis \r\n    for the ALJD's and the circuit court's dismissal of Sullivan's claim.  For \r\n    this reason, and because we know McNeil has been relied upon by the \r\n    ALJ in other cases to deny jurisdiction, the ALJD and the circuit court are \r\n    instructed to look to this opinion, not McNeil, for guidance in future \r\n    cases.  Although much of McNeil's analysis is accurate, we believe \r\n    Wolff requires minimal due process when for state-created liberty interests, \r\n    which are not necessarily limited to sentence credit issues and major disciplinary \r\n    decisions. We recognize that a condition of confinement could implicate \r\n    a state created liberty interest under Wolff.  However, we adhere to \r\n    Sandin's  pronouncement that \"these interests will generally be limited \r\n    to freedom from restraint which . . . imposes atypical or significant hardship \r\n    on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"  Sandin \r\n    at 484, 115 S.

Clare, of \r\n  Columbia, for Petitioner(s).\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen \r\n  Bullard, Assistant Attorney General William Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  David and \r\n  Donnie Ray Gibson submit that the post-conviction relief (â€œPCR) judge erred \r\n  in denying their PCR applications.  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nDavid and Donnie Ray \r\n  Gibson were convicted of murdering Marvin Bramlett (â€œBramlettâ€) in Seneca, South \r\n  Carolina on July 23, 1976 and sentenced to life imprisonment.  \r\nDonnie Ray applied for PCR in 1981, which \r\n  was denied and this Court affirmed.  Gibson v. State, Op. No. 83-MO-029 \r\n  (S.C. Sup Ct. filed January 24, 1983).  Donnie Ray and David petitioned for \r\n  writs of habeas corpus in 1995, which were denied.  On appeal, this Court remanded \r\n  their cases to be considered as separate PCR applications.  Gibson v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 37, 495 S.E.2d 426 (1998).  Petitioners now appeal the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  denial of post-conviction relief and raise the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the PCR judge err in denying Donnie Rayâ€™s petition for post-conviction relief \r\n  because it was a successive application?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial judgeâ€™s malice charge shift the burden from the prosecution to \r\n  the defense, and if so, should this Court retroactively apply Sandstrom v. \r\n  Montana to grant a new trial?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI\r\nDonnie Ray asserts that the PCR \r\n  judge erred in finding that he has applied for successive PCR petitions.  We \r\n  disagree.  \r\nDonnie Ray wants to assert that \r\n  he should be granted a new trial because of the trial judgeâ€™s defective malice \r\n  charge, which was deemed unconstitutional in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 \r\n  U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979).  This Court disfavors successive \r\n  PCR applications, especially when the new ground that the petitioner raises \r\n  could have been raised in his initial application.  Tilley v. State, \r\n  334 S.C. 24, 511 S.E.2d 689 (1999); Aice v. State, 305 S.C. 448, 409 \r\n  S.E.2d 392 (1991).  \r\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court decided \r\n  Sandstrom in 1979, Donnie Ray could have raised the issue in 1981, in \r\n  his first application.  Therefore, we find that he should not be able to raise \r\n  the issue in the present PCR application.  \r\nII\r\nDavid asserts that this Court \r\n  should retroactively apply Sandstrom v. Montana to the defective malice \r\n  charge that the trial judge enunciated to the jury.  We disagree.    \r\nDonnie Ray and David shot and \r\n  killed Marvin Bramlett in January 1976.  The brothers and Bramlett had a history \r\n  of dislike for one another, which involved Bramlett pointing a handgun at Donnie \r\n  Ray, Donnie Ray slapping Bramlett over the head, and various verbal threats \r\n  uttered by both parties during the time leading up to Bramlettâ€™s death.  On \r\n  the night of the killing, the hostility that the parties shared for each other \r\n  escalated as both Bramlett and Donnie Ray fired warning gunshots in the air \r\n  towards each other.   \r\nBramlett got into the car of a \r\n  friend, Theresa Edwards (â€œEdwardsâ€), and told her his plans to kill Donnie Ray \r\n  when he said, â€œHeâ€™s crazy. Iâ€™m going to kill him tonight.â€  Meanwhile, Donnie \r\n  Ray returned to town and found David.  They got in their car, which contained \r\n  their two loaded guns in the back.  On their way out of town, they saw Edwardsâ€™ \r\n  car on the side of the road and slowed down to speak with Edwards not knowing \r\n  that Bramlett was in the vehicle.  Bramlett got out of the car and fired his \r\n  sawed off shotgun in the direction of the brothersâ€™ car.  Donnie Ray then shot \r\n  his 30-30 at Bramlett through the back window of Edwardsâ€™ car, which knocked \r\n  Bramlett down.  David got out of the car, walked around Edwardsâ€™ car, and shot \r\n  Bramlett three times with a .22 magnum as Bramlett was crawling in his direction.  \r\n  Bramlett died on the scene.  \r\nAt David and Donnie Rayâ€™s trial, \r\n  the trial judge charged the jury on malice as follows:\r\n\r\nI charge you that malice \r\n  is presumed from the willful, deliberate, intentional commission of a felony, \r\n  and murder is a felony, or an unlawful act without just cause or excuse.  In \r\n  other words, in its general signification, malice means the doing of a wrongful \r\n  act intentionally and without just cause or excuse.\r\nI charge you also that \r\n  even if the facts proven are sufficient to raise the presumption of malice, \r\n  such presumption would be a rebuttable one, and it is for you, the jury, to \r\n  determine from all the evidence whether or not malice has been proven in the \r\n  case.\r\nI charge you further \r\n  that malice is presumed from the use of a deadly weapon, and I charge you in \r\n  that connection, that the burden is on the State to prove malice by evidence, \r\n  satisfying you beyond a reasonable doubt.  This presumption is also a rebuttable \r\n  one.  And when all the facts and circumstances are brought out in the evidence, \r\n  the presumption vanishes and it is for you to determine from all the facts and \r\n  circumstances whether or not malice did, in fact, exist.  \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court \r\n  found this malice charge unconstitutional in Sandstrom, because when \r\n  the trial judge states that a jury can presume malice, he is alleviating the \r\n  prosecutionâ€™s burden of proof of one of the elements of murder and implying \r\n  that the burden shifts to the defense to disprove the presumption.  We believe \r\n  the malice charge quoted above is unconstitutional because the charge effectively \r\n  shifted the burden to prove malice from the prosecution to the defense.  See \r\n  also, Yates v. Aiken, 484 U.S. 211, 108 S.Ct. 534, 98 L.Ed.2d 546 \r\n  (1988); Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d \r\n  344 (1985).\r\nBut during the trial, \r\n  which took place in 1976, the instruction that permits the jury to presume malice \r\n  if the homicide is committed with a deadly weapon was not yet deemed an unconstitutional \r\n  burden shift from the prosecution to the defense.  Thus, this Court could grant \r\n  the brothers a new trial only if Sandstrom is retroactively applied, \r\n  and in our opinion, Sandstrom should not be retroactively applied in \r\n  this case based on the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s analysis of when the retroactivity \r\n  of a landmark criminal procedure decision can be collaterally attacked.\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court \r\n  set forth two exceptions to the general principle that landmark criminal procedure \r\n  decisions should not have a retroactive effect in Teague v. Lane, 489 \r\n  U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).  The first exception is that \r\n  a decision may be retroactively applied â€œif it places â€˜certain kinds of primary, \r\n  private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority \r\n  to proscribe.â€™â€  Teague, 489 U.S. at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1075 (quoting \r\n  Justice Harlanâ€™s opinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 692, \r\n  91 S.Ct. 1160, 1180, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971)).  This first exception is not applicable \r\n  to this case.  The second exception applies to â€œthose new procedures without \r\n  which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.â€  Id. [1]   \r\nWe hold that the defective \r\n  malice charge did not rise to the very high standard established in Teague.  \r\n  We do not believe that the accuracy of the Gibson brotherâ€™s murder conviction \r\n  was seriously diminished by the charge that allowed the jury to presume malice.  \r\n  The jury heard plenty of testimony that established the malice element.  For \r\n  example, the brothers testified that they killed Bramlett; the defense stipulated \r\n  that the brotherâ€™s weapons were used to kill Bramlett; the brothers had a prior \r\n  history of altercations with Bramlett; knowing that Bramlett was out to cause \r\n  trouble on the evening of the killing, the brothers armed themselves with loaded \r\n  weapons and carried them in the back seat of their vehicle; and David testified \r\n  that he shot Bramlett two times with his .22 Magnum as Bramlett was in a crouch \r\n  beside Edwardsâ€™ car.  Based on this evidence, we do not believe that the juryâ€™s \r\n  capacity to arrive at a verdict was seriously diminished by the defective malice \r\n  charge.  See Adams, 965 F.2d 1306 (holding that the Cage v. Louisiana, \r\n  reasonable doubt rule should not be retroactively applied because it does not \r\n  meet the Teague standard).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nHarmless \r\n  Error \r\nThis Court has employed \r\n  a harmless error analysis in reviewing post-Sandstrom defective malice \r\n  charges.  See e.g., Arnold v. Plath, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).  \r\n  Since, we find that Sandstrom should not be retroactively applied to \r\n  this case, it is unnecessary to employ the harmless error analysis to review \r\n  the effect of the defective malice charge in this case.  Nevertheless, even \r\n  if a harmless error analysis was applied to the defective malice charge, we \r\n  believe that the jury found malice based on the evidence presented at trial \r\n  and not based upon the judgeâ€™s instruction allowing it to presume malice.  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we find that the Sandstrom decision should not be retroactively applied \r\n  to this case because the stringent Teague standard has not been met, \r\n  as the validity of the murder conviction was not seriously diminished by the \r\n  defective malice charge.  Accordingly, we AFFIRM the PCR judgeâ€™s denial \r\n  of the Gibson brothersâ€™ applications for PCR.&nbsp; \r\n MOORE, WALLER and \r\n  BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  These matters come before the Court on certiorari \r\n  to two circuit court orders denying petitionersâ€™ applications for post-conviction \r\n  relief (PCR).  I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm the orders, but \r\n  write separately because I view the issues in a slightly different light.\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donnie Ray Gibson\r\nPetitioner Donnie Ray Gibson (Donnie) contends the circuit\r\ncourt erred in summarily dismissing his PCR application as successive. [2]   While I tend to agree, \r\n  [3]  the PCR judge went further and addressed the merits of Donnieâ€™s claim \r\n  that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to object to the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  malice charge.  I agree with the PCR judge that counsel were not ineffective \r\n  in failing to anticipate at Donnieâ€™s 1976 trial that in 1979 the United States \r\n  Supreme Court would declare the malice charge unconstitutional.  See, e.g., \r\n  Gilmore v. State, 314 S.C. 453, 445 S.E.2d 454 (1994) (trial counsel \r\n  not required to be clairvoyant).  The question is whether trial counselsâ€™ performance \r\n  met prevailing professional norms. \r\n  [4]   Robinson v. State, 308 S.C. 74, 417 S.E.2d 88 (1994).  There \r\n  is probative evidence in this record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that \r\n  counsel were not ineffective in failing to object to the malice charge, and \r\n  therefore we should uphold that finding.  Id.   Accordingly, I agree \r\n  with the majority that we should affirm the PCR order denying Donnie relief. \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Gibson\r\nWe granted certiorari to review Petitioner David Gibsonâ€™s \r\n  (Davidâ€™s) claim that the circuit court judge erred in denying Davidâ€™s request \r\n  for PCR.  Like his brother Donnie, he contends that the malice charge given \r\n  at their joint 1976 trial violated the Constitution.  Like Donnie, David raised \r\n  this claim below solely as one of ineffective assistance of counsel. For the \r\n  reasons given above, I agree with the majority that we should affirm the PCR \r\n  judgeâ€™s ruling denying David relief on this claim.\r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nI concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm the PCR \r\n  orders denying Donnie and David post-conviction relief.  Unlike the majority, \r\n  I would not reach the retroactivity issue.  Were I to find it necessary to reach \r\n  the claim, I would employ a different analytical approach.  In my opinion, whether \r\n  to apply a new decision retroactively under Teague v. Lane is determined \r\n  by applying the Teague v. Lane exceptions to that new decision.  Therefore, \r\n  I would analyze the Sandstrom decision to determine whether it met a \r\n  Teague v. Lane exception.  Only if I found that Sandstrom \r\n  met one of these exceptions would I engage in a review of the \r\n  facts of the case in which the unconstitutional malice charge was given \r\n  to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the defendant in that pre-Sandstrom \r\n  case had been so prejudiced by the charge that he was entitled to a new trial.\r\nFor the reasons given above, I concur in the majorityâ€™s \r\n  decision to affirm the PCR orders. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The same test for retroactivity was applied by the Fourth Circuit \r\n    Court of Appeals in Adams v. Aiken, 965 F.2d 1306, 1312 (4th Cir. 1992).  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  In 1998, we remanded an order summarily dismissing \r\n    Donnieâ€™s and Davidâ€™s petitions for habeas corpus and instructed the circuit \r\n    court to treat the habeas petitions as  PCR applications.  Gibson v. State. \r\n    329 S.C. 37, 495 S.E.2d 426 (1998).  On remand, the brothers were required \r\n    to show why their applications were not impermissibly successive.  Id. \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  But see Keeler v. Mauney, 330 S.C. \r\n    568, 500 S.E.2d 123 (Ct. App. 1998)(South Carolinaâ€™s reluctance to acknowledge \r\n    and apply Sandstrom v. Montana did not excuse applicantâ€™s failure to \r\n    raise claim in first PCR application).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  I recognize the validity of Donnieâ€™s contention \r\n    that Sandstrom v. Montana is merely a logical extension of In re \r\n    Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970) and Mullany v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684 \r\n    (1975).  See, e.g. Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 326 ( \r\n    1985) (â€œSandstrom v. Montana made clear that the Due Process Clause \r\n    of the 14th Amendment prohibits the State from making use of jury \r\n    instructions that have the effect of relieving the State of the burden of \r\n    proof enunciated in In re Winship on the critical question of intent \r\n    in a criminal prosecution.  Today we reaffirm the rule of Sandstrom \r\n    and the wellspring due process principle from which it was drawnâ€).  Had Donnie \r\n    framed his claim as a violation of his due process rights, rather than as \r\n    a violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel,  I would reach \r\n    the issue of retroactivity under Teague v.

(â€œPetitionersâ€) challenge the State Election Commissionâ€™s decision \r\n  to uphold the election results for the Sales and Use Tax Referendum (â€œReferendumâ€) \r\n  presented to voters during the 2002 general election in Charleston County.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nIn 1995, the General \r\n  Assembly enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 4-37-10 et seq. (Supp. 2002) to provide counties \r\n  with an optional method of financing transportation facilities.  Section 4-37-30 \r\n  empowers counties to impose a sales and use tax in order to raise revenue for \r\n  transportation related projects.   Section 4-37-30 provides, in relevant part,\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the requirements \r\n  of this section, the governing body of a county may impose by ordinance a sales \r\n  and use tax in an amount not to exceed one percent within its jurisdiction for \r\n  a single project or multiple projects and for a specific period of time to collect \r\n  a limited amount of money.\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The governing body of a county may vote to impose the tax authorized by this \r\n  section, subject to a referendum, by enacting an ordinance.  The ordinance must \r\n  specify:\r\n    \r\n  (a)  the project or projects and a description of the project or projects for \r\n  which the proceeds of the tax are to be used, which may include projects located \r\n  within or without, or both within or without, the boundaries of the county imposing \r\n  the tax and which may include:\r\n(i) highways, roads, streets, bridges, mass transit systems, \r\n  greenbelts, and other transportation-related projects facilities including, \r\n  but not limited to, drainage facilities relating to the highways, roads, streets, \r\n  bridges, and other transportation related projects;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-37-30(A) (Supp. \r\n  2002).  After the County has enacted an ordinance pursuant to this section, \r\n  and it is submitted to the county election commission, the county election commission \r\n  is required to conduct a referendum for approval of the optional sales and use \r\n  tax.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-37-30(A)(2).\r\nIn July 2002, the Charleston \r\n  County Council (â€œCounty Councilâ€) enacted an ordinance to impose a one-half \r\n  percent sales and use tax, and submitted it to the Charleston County Election \r\n  Commission (â€œCounty Election Commissionâ€).  Upon receipt of the request to hold \r\n  a referendum on the proposed tax, the County Election Commission noted that \r\n  the proposed Ballot question and instructions did not appear neutral, and so \r\n  advised County Council to change them.  Initially, County Council agreed to \r\n  change the language, but subsequently called a special meeting during which \r\n  they voted to resubmit the original language.  Upon receipt of this news, the \r\n  County Election Commission voted unanimously that the instructions on the Ballot \r\n  advocating the taxâ€™s passage should be eliminated.  County Council objected, \r\n  claiming that the County Election Commission had no authority to alter the language \r\n  submitted.  The State Election Commission agreed, and, as a result, the County \r\n  Election Commission printed the Ballot for the November 2002 general election \r\n  as it was originally submitted by County Council.\r\nThe Ballot contained the following \r\n  instructions to the voters: [1] \r\n\r\nAll qualified electors desiring to vote in favor of the traffic \r\n  congestion relief, safe roads, and clean water sales tax, for the stated purposes \r\n  shall vote â€œYES.â€\r\nAll qualified electors opposed to the traffic congestion relief, \r\n  safe roads, and clean water sales tax for the stated purposes shall vote â€œNO.â€\r\n\r\nApparently at the County Election \r\n  Commissionâ€™s request, County Council printed handouts for distribution by poll \r\n  workers on election day.  The Ballot appeared verbatim on one side of the yellow \r\n  handout, and the projects to be funded by the tax were listed on the opposite \r\n  side of the handout.  There is some confusion concerning who authored the handout, \r\n  but it appears staff for County Council produced the handout and included the \r\n  list of projects to be funded by the tax in addition to the Ballot question.  \r\n\r\nThe tax passed by a \r\n  narrow margin of 865 votes. [2]   \r\n  Petitioner Douan filed a timely protest to the election results on November \r\n  13, 2002.  In addition, state Representative Wallace Scarborough and numerous \r\n  other public officials filed a timely protest against the election results.  \r\n  The County Election Commission held a hearing on November 18, 2002, and upheld \r\n  the election results.  Petitioners (both groups) appealed to the State Election \r\n  Commission.  After considering the transcript of the proceeding below, arguments \r\n  of counsel, and various exhibits, one member of the Commission made a motion \r\n  to void the results of the election.  Two members of the State Election Commission \r\n  voted to void the results, but the other two members voted to uphold the election.  \r\n  The fifth seat on the Commission was vacant, and the motion to void the election \r\n  failed for lack of a majority. [3]   \r\nThis Court granted \r\n  certiorari to review the following issues raised in the election protests:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the County and State Election Commissions err in refusing to void the results \r\n  of the 2002 Referendum to adopt the Sales and Use Tax in Charleston County?\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Did the non-neutral language of the Ballot violate the fundamental integrity \r\n  of the election?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      Did the Handout distributed by the County Election Commission \r\n  at the polls constitute unlawful campaign literature?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n     \r\n  Should the County and State Election Commissions have recused themselves from \r\n  hearing the appeals below?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nI.  Election Results\r\nPetitioners argue that \r\n  the results of the Referendum must be voided because the language of the Ballot \r\n  violated mandatory statutory requirements and the fundamental integrity of the \r\n  election, and that the handout constituted campaign literature, distributed \r\n  in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-25-180 (Supp. 2002).  \r\nThe scope of appellate \r\n  review of the State Election Commissionâ€™s order is limited to corrections of \r\n  errors of law; findings of fact will not be overturned unless wholly unsupported \r\n  by the evidence.  Fielding v. South Carolina Election Comâ€™n, 305 S.C. \r\n  313, 408 S.E.2d 232 (1991).  â€œThe Court will employ every presumption to sustain \r\n  a contested election and will not set aside an election due to mere irregularities \r\n  unless the result is changed or rendered doubtful.â€  George v. Municipal \r\n  Election Comâ€™n of City of Charleston, 335 S.C. 182, 186, 516 S.E.2d 206, \r\n  208 (1999) (citations omitted).  We have consistently recognized that perfect \r\n  compliance with the numerous statutes regulating elections is unlikely, and \r\n  have been loathe to nullify an election based on minor violations of technical \r\n  requirements.  Id.  \r\nThis Court will overturn the \r\n  results of an election, however, when mandatory statutory provisions have been \r\n  violated and those violations interfere with a full and fair expression of the \r\n  voterâ€™s choice.  Id. (citing State ex rel. Parler v. Jennings, 79 \r\n  S.C. 414, 60 S.E. 967 (1908); accord Laney v. Baskin, 201 S.C. 246, 22 \r\n  S.E.2d 722 (1945); Smoak v. Rhodes, 201 S.C. 237, 22 S.E.2d 685 (1942); \r\n  Killingsworth v. State Exec. Comm. of Democratic Party, 125 S.C. 487, \r\n  118 S.E. 822 (1921); State ex rel. Davis v. State Bd. of Canvassers, \r\n  86 S.C. 451, 68 S.E. 676 (1910)).  We â€œmay deem such provisions to be mandatory \r\n  [even] after an election - and thus capable of nullifying the results - when \r\n  the provisions substantially affect the free and intelligent casting of a vote, \r\n  the determination of the results, an essential element of the election, or the \r\n  fundamental integrity of the election.â€  George, 335 S.C. at 187, 516 \r\n  S.E.2d at 208.  \r\nIn George, the Court made \r\n  it clear that total disregard of a statute cannot be treated as an irregularity, \r\n  but must be held to be a cause for declaring the election void and illegal.  \r\n  Id.  In short, this Court â€œâ€˜will not sanction practices which circumvent \r\n  the plain purposes of the law and open the door to fraud.â€™â€  Id. at 187, \r\n  516 S.E.2d at 209 (quoting May v. Wilson, 199 S.C. 354, 19 S.E.2d 467 \r\n  (1942)).\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ballot Language\r\nPetitioners argue that the language of the Ballot \r\n  is not neutral and, in fact, advocates passage of the Referendum.  As such, \r\n  Petitioners argue the ballot language violates the mandate of two statutory \r\n  sections - S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 4-37-30(A)(3) and 7-13-400 - and violates the fundamental \r\n  integrity of the election.  We agree.\r\nSection 4-37-30(A)(3) requires that the Ballot \r\n  question read substantially as follows:\r\nâ€œI approve a special sales and use tax in the amount \r\n  of (fractional amount of one percent) (one percent) to be imposed in (county) \r\n  for not more than (time) to fund the following project or projects:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Project (1) for\r\n        _____________________ $ _______.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Yes _____\r\n        No&nbsp; _____\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Project (2), etc.&quot;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-37-30(A)(3) \r\n  (Supp. 2002).  The language actually placed on the ballot in this case differed \r\n  from the required language in three ways.\r\nFirst, instead of listing a dollar amount for the cost \r\n  of each project, the Ballot question adopted by County Council listed the percentage \r\n  of the total amount to be collected that would be allotted to each project.  \r\n  The Ballot question included the total amount to be collected in the first paragraph \r\n  of the ballot: 1,303,360,000.  Second, the two main projects were not numbered \r\n  (1) and (2) as suggested in Â§ 4-37-30(A)(3), and, instead, were separated into \r\n  two different paragraphs.  The second projectâ€™s purpose (purchasing and improving \r\n  parklands and otherwise preserving greenspace) \r\n  [4]  was buried at the end of the paragraph, after all of the benefits of \r\n  the project were listed.  Third, and, most importantly, the title and instructions \r\n  to the voters appeared to advocate passage of the tax. [5] \r\nIn our opinion, the first two differences between \r\n  the Ballot actually used and the model ballot set forth in section 4-37-30(A)(3) \r\n  do not require voiding the election results under the prevailing standard.  \r\n  George (recognizing that perfect compliance with the numerous statutes \r\n  regulating elections is unlikely, and that this Court has been loathe to nullify \r\n  an election based on minor violations of technical requirements).  We find the \r\n  advocacy language within the Ballot, however, to be more troublesome.\r\nThis Court nullified election results because the \r\n  ballot contained empty promises and misleading language in Bellamy v. Johnson, \r\n  234 S.C. 172, 107 S.E.2d 33 (1959).  In Bellamy, the ballot, used \r\n  in an election to determine whether certain property should be annexed to the \r\n  municipality, contained a stipulation that if the measure passed, the municipality \r\n  would exempt parcels of more than 10 acres in the newly annexed area from taxation \r\n  until the property was sub-divided.  Id.  This Court found the stipulation \r\n  to be misleading, stating that it was nothing more than an â€œempty promise,â€ \r\n  â€œunfairly calculated to induce favorable votes by freeholders who were residents \r\n  in the area proposed to be annexed.â€  Id. at 175, 107 S.E.2d at 34-35.\r\nâ€œA question should not be submitted in such form \r\n  as to amount to an argument for its acceptance or rejection.â€  29 C.J.S. Elections \r\n  Â§ 170 (1965).  This common sense proposition was applied by the Appellate Court \r\n  of Illinois when it nullified the results of a referendum on the issuance of \r\n  bonds by the city.  Oâ€™Beirne v. City of Elgin, 1914 WL 2613 (Ill. App. \r\n  1914).  In Oâ€™Beirne, the city council passed an ordinance to issue $162,000 \r\n  of bonds for an electrical lighting plant and electric street lighting.  The \r\n  ordinance was put before the public on a referendum, and passed on the following \r\n  ballot:\r\n\r\nIf you favor Municipal Ownership Vote Yes.\r\nIf you oppose Municipal Ownership Vote No.\r\nBy making a cross in one square below, thus: (X).\r\nShall Bonds or obligations of the City of Elgin for the purpose \r\n  of providing funds for the purposes mentioned in the ordinance printed hereon \r\n  to the amount of One Hundred and Sixty-Two Thousand Dollars ($162,000) be issued \r\n  by the City Council of the City of Elgin, Illinois?\r\n          Yes _____\r\n          No  _____\r\n\r\nOâ€™Beirne at 1.  Those protesting the election \r\n  objected to the characterization of a yes vote as a â€œvote in favor of municipal \r\n  ownershipâ€ rather than a vote in favor of the bonds at issue.  The Illinois \r\n  court agreed and nullified the election finding that the ballot did not substantially \r\n  conform to the statute. [6]   \r\n  The court found that the statute intended for the instructions to aid the voter \r\n  in understanding the meaning of his vote and not the reason for \r\n  it.  Id. at 2.  The court explained,\r\n\r\n[i]t was not intended that public officers charged with \r\n  a duty to impartially submit a question to the vote of the people \r\n  should use the ballot as a vehicle for information or argument as to the \r\n  motives that might influence the voter in making his choice.  Such suggestions \r\n  as were made are open to argument.  It was not for the City Council of Elgin \r\n  to determine that every voter in favor of municipal ownership should vote â€œYes.â€  \r\n  It is quite conceivable that there might be among the voters those who favored \r\n  municipal ownership but for reasons satisfactory to themselves did not favor \r\n  the bond issue in question.\r\n\r\nId. at 2 (emphasis added).  For these reasons, \r\n  the court held that the ballot did not substantially conform to the form prescribed \r\n  by statute, and rendered the election results void.  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the instructions to the voters \r\n  characterized the tax as the â€œtraffic congestion relief, safe roads, and clean \r\n  water sales tax.â€  The Petitioners complain that the characterization of the \r\n  tax in the voterâ€™s instructions was so misleading as to warrant nullification \r\n  of the election results.  Under the rule established in Bellamy and under \r\n  the reasoning of Oâ€™Beirne, we agree.  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-400 \r\n  provides for the form of the ballot when questions are submitted.  That section \r\n  states, in relevant part: \r\n\r\nThe form of the ballot in an election on the issuance of \r\n  bonds or in which any other question or issue is submitted to a vote of the \r\n  people shall be a statement of the question or questions and shall thereafter \r\n  have the following words: \r\n  \r\n    In favor of the question or issue (as the case may be) &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Opposed to the question or issue (as the case may be)&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n  \r\nThe voter shall be instructed in substance, if he \r\n  wishes to vote in favor of the proposition to place a check or cross mark in \r\n  the square after the words second above written.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-400 (1976 \r\n  &amp; Supp. 2002).  \r\nIn our opinion, the Ballot used here does not conform \r\n  with this statutorily mandated format, and the non-conformance is so substantial \r\n  that it affects the fundamental integrity of the election.  See George.  \r\n  The purpose of section 7-13-400 is the same as that of the Illinois statute \r\n  discussed in Oâ€™Beirne: to aid the voter in understanding the meaning \r\n  of his vote, not the reason for it.  See Oâ€™Beirne.  Instead of \r\n  explaining how the voter could vote for or against the sales tax, the \r\n  instructions to the voters in this case attributed reasons to vote in \r\n  favor of the measure:  â€œtraffic congestion relief, safe roads, and clean water.â€  \r\n  In fact, these were the very same reasons that supporters of the tax espoused \r\n  in favor of the tax in the weeks preceding election day.  Additionally, just \r\n  as in Oâ€™Beirne, persons may be in favor of traffic congestion relief \r\n  and clean water, â€œbut for reasons satisfactory to themselves [do] not favor \r\n  the [tax] in question.â€  Oâ€™Beirne at 2.\r\nLike the ballot in Bellamy, \r\n  the voter instructions here appear calculated to persuade and ultimately mislead \r\n  voters into voting in favor of the tax by obscuring the fact that a vote for \r\n  clean water was a vote for increased sales tax.  This conclusion is supported \r\n  by the language of Question 2 on the Ballot.  In contrast to the language used \r\n  on Question 1 of the Ballot, the voter instructions for Question 2 are worded \r\n  neutrally.  The voter instructions for Question 2 stated:\r\n\r\nAll qualified electors desiring \r\n  to vote in favor of the issuance of bonds for the stated purposes shall vote \r\n  â€œYes.â€\r\nand\r\nAll qualified electors opposed \r\n  to the issuance of bonds for the stated purposes shall vote â€œNO.â€ \r\n\r\nSee  Appendix 1.  In addition, the Ballot \r\n  submitted in the 2000 election on the same sales and use tax, which was defeated, \r\n  was worded more like Question 2 on the 2002 Ballot, in a content-neutral manner.\r\nWhile we do not fault County Council for advocating \r\n  the passage of this tax before election day, the fundamental integrity \r\n  of the election process requires that the voters be presented with an objectively \r\n  phrased choice on election day.   Section 7-13-400 sets forth the format to \r\n  create a neutrally worded Ballot and does not contemplate words of advocacy.  \r\n  Accordingly, we find that the election results in this case must be voided.\r\nB.  Election Day Handout\r\nPetitioners argue that \r\n  the handout distributed on election day by election officials constitutes unlawful \r\n  campaign literature, and serves as an additional reason for the election to \r\n  be voided. [7]   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 7-25-180(A) prohibits the distribution of any type of campaign literature \r\n  within 200 feet of a polling place on election day.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-25-180(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2002).  The statute gives law enforcement officers the authority to remove \r\n  any such material upon the request of the poll manager.  Id.  Section \r\n  7-25-180(A) was intended to grant poll managers authority to prevent certain \r\n  activity by members of the public on election day.  In this case, the poll managers \r\n  themselves distributed the alleged â€œcampaign literatureâ€ at the behest of the \r\n  County Election Commission. [8]   \r\nPetitioners also contend \r\n  that there is no statutory authority for distribution of a supplemental handout \r\n  except when constitutional amendments are proposed.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 7-13-2110 \r\n  and -2120 (1976).  This Court has recognized that â€œ[t]he only supplemental ballot \r\n  handout local election officials are explicitly authorized by statute to distribute \r\n  is an explanation of a proposed constitutional amendment.â€  Charleston County \r\n  Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Elec. Comâ€™n., 336 S.C. 174, 185, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  567, 573 (1999).  However, we also recognize that a practice of distributing \r\n  such handouts for questions other than constitutional amendments has developed \r\n  over the years.  Id. at n.2.  \r\nResolution of the specific question \r\n  presented to us is unnecessary as we have determined that the election should \r\n  be voided based on the ballot language alone.  Because a practice of distribution \r\n  by county election officials of explanatory handouts for questions other than \r\n  constitutional amendments has developed, however, we urge the General Assembly \r\n  to offer local election officials some statutory guidance in this area. It may \r\n  be that distribution by the election commission of neutral explanatory material \r\n  will be approved by the General Assembly.  Nevertheless, we can find no logical \r\n  distinction which would allow partisan, campaign literature drafted by a governmental \r\n  entity to be distributed within 200 feet of a polling place on election day \r\n  when the same literature distributed by a private party would not be allowed \r\n  pursuant to Â§ 7-25-180(A).  Preserving the fundamental integrity of the election \r\n  process requires that governmental entities with a position on or stake in an \r\n  election adhere to the same rules which all private groups with a stake in an \r\n  election are required to follow on election day.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRecusal \r\n  of Election Commission  \r\nPetitioners argue that both the \r\n  County Election Commission and the State Election Commission erred in refusing \r\n  to recuse themselves from reviewing Petitionersâ€™ election protests.  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code sections 4-37-30 \r\n  and 7-17-30 vest the county election commissions with the duty to hold referenda, \r\n  canvas ballots, and hear election protests.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 4-37-30 and 7-17-20 \r\n  &amp; -30 (Supp. 2002).  The County Election Commission is always â€œinvolvedâ€ \r\n  in elections as a matter of statutory mandate.  Thus, to follow Petitionersâ€™ \r\n  logic would be to vitiate the County Election Commissionâ€™s duty to hear any \r\n  county election protests. [9] \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the \r\n  State Election Commissionâ€™s order and nullify the results of the 2002 Sales \r\n  and Use Tax Referendum in Charleston County. \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  See Appendix 1 for complete text of the Ballot used within \r\n    the City of Charleston.

The protests differ only \r\n    in that Douan sued County Council and the County Election Commission, and \r\n    Representative Scarborough sued only the County Election Commission.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Section 4-37-30(A) includes â€œgreenbeltsâ€ as a permissible project \r\n    for funding through the tax.

Chavis \r\n  was admitted to Respondentâ€™s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (â€œNICUâ€) and placed \r\n  on a ventilator due to respiratory distress.  While in the NICU, Chavis became \r\n  infected with Flavobacterium Memingosepticum (â€œFMâ€), a highly virulent \r\n  organism.  Chavis suffered permanent neurological injury as a result of the \r\n  infection.\r\nOn May 8, 1998, Appellants filed \r\n  suit against Respondent alleging negligence in the care and treatment of Chavis. \r\n  [1]   After filing an answer denying all allegations of negligence, Respondent \r\n  offered to settle the claim and entered into negotiations with Appellants.  \r\n  The parties agreed to execute a settlement and release in which they stipulated \r\n  that Chavisâ€™s damages totaled $1.5 million, but recognized that a dispute existed \r\n  regarding the applicability of the liability caps set forth in the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120 (Supp. 1994). [2]   Respondent contended its liability was limited \r\n  to the $250,000 cap imposed by Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1).  Accordingly, Respondent paid \r\n  Appellants $250,000 with the understanding that either party was entitled to \r\n  file a declaratory judgment to determine the applicability of the caps.\r\nAppellants filed for declaratory \r\n  judgment.  Thereafter, both parties filed motions for summary judgment.  The \r\n  trial court found that the caps within    Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) applied to Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  cause of action and limited Respondentâ€™s liability to the $250,000 Respondent \r\n  had already paid Appellants. Appellants raise the following issue on appeal:\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in finding \r\n    that the $250,000 liability cap in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) limits \r\n    Appellantsâ€™ recovery to $250,000?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis \r\n\r\nIn 1986, \r\n  the Legislature established statutory caps to limit the Stateâ€™s liability when \r\n  it enacted the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) \r\n  (Supp. 1987).  In 1988, the Legislature adopted the Uniform Contribution Among \r\n  Joint Tortfeasorâ€™s Act (â€œUniform Contribution Actâ€) which purported to provide \r\n  an unlimited right of contribution for joint tortfeasors who have paid more \r\n  than their pro rata share of common liability.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(B) \r\n  (Supp. 1993).  In a 1994 decision, Southeastern Freight Lines v. City of \r\n  Hartsville, 313 S.C. 466, 443 S.E.2d 395 (1994), this Court held that the \r\n  unlimited pro rata liability required by the Uniform Contribution Act was inconsistent \r\n  with the caps on liability imposed by Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1).  Accordingly, the Court \r\n  held that Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) had been impliedly repealed in 1988 with the enactment \r\n  of the Uniform Contribution Act.  \r\nThe Legislature \r\n  reacted swiftly to the Southeastern decision by passing 1994 Act. No. \r\n  497, Part II, Â§ 107(B)(1) (â€1994 Actâ€).  The 1994 Act provided, \r\n\r\n  The provisions of Section 15-78-120(a)(1) \r\n    of the 1976 Code are reenacted and made retroactive to April 5, 1988, the \r\n    effective date of the South Carolina Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors \r\n    Act, except for causes of action that have been filed in a court \r\n    of competent jurisdiction before July 1, 1994.\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  (emphasis added). [3]  \r\nSoutheastern did not address \r\n  whether subsections (a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) of  Â§ 15-78-120 were also impliedly \r\n  repealed by the Uniform Contribution Act. \r\n  [4]   In Dykema v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, 348 S.C. 549, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 894 (2002), this Court found that subsections (a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) had \r\n  been impliedly repealed by the enactment of the Uniform Contribution Act.  The \r\n  Dykema court found that while the 1994 Act reset the caps within subsection \r\n  (a)(1) of Â§ 15-78-120, it did not reset the caps within subsections (a)(3) &amp; \r\n  (a)(4).  Dykema.  Apparently the Legislature had realized their error \r\n  already: in 1997, the Legislature passed an Act reinstating Â§ 15-78-120, in \r\n  toto. [5]    1997 Act No. 155, Part II, Â§ 55(C) (â€œ1997 \r\n  Actâ€).  The 1997 Act contained the following statement concerning its applicability: \r\n  \r\n\r\n  Except where otherwise provided, \r\n    this section takes effect upon approval by the Governor and applies to \r\n    claims or actions pending on that date or thereafter filed, except \r\n    where final judgment has been entered before that date.\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  (emphasis added).  \r\nIn Steinke \r\n  v. S.C. Dept. of Labor, the Court examined the Legislatureâ€™s attempt to \r\n  reinstate the caps in the 1997 Act with respect â€œto claims or actions pending,â€ \r\n  in addition to those â€œthereafter filed.â€  336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).  \r\n  In Steinke, the accident that was the subject of the plaintiffsâ€™ suit \r\n  (the death of their son) occurred in 1993, and the plaintiffs filed their complaint \r\n  on June 29, 1994, two days before the 1994 Actâ€™s reinstatement of the caps became \r\n  effective.  As such, the 1994 amendment did not apply to plaintiffsâ€™ claim, \r\n  but the defendant contended that the caps within the 1997 Act did apply, and \r\n  that they limited plaintiffsâ€™ recovery.  \r\nThis \r\n  Court disagreed.  Based on the Courtâ€™s prior decision in Lindsay v. Natâ€™l \r\n  Old Line Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 621, 207 S.E.2d 75 (1974), the Steinke \r\n  Court found that the Legislature had attempted to reset the caps retroactively, \r\n  which would effectively â€œreverseâ€ this Courtâ€™s Southeastern decision.  \r\n  Steinke, 336 S.C. at 403, 520 S.E.2d at 157-58.  The Court quoted the \r\n  following language from Lindsay for support:  \r\n\r\n  Subject to constitutional limitations, \r\n    the legislature has plenary power to amend a statute.  However, a judicial \r\n    [interpretation] of a statute is determinative of its meaning and effect, \r\n    and any subsequent legislative amendment to the contrary will only be effective \r\n    from the date of its enactment and cannot be applied retroactively.\r\n\r\nSteinke, \r\n  336 S.C. at 402, 520 S.E.2d at 157 (quoting Lindsay, 262 S.C. 621, \r\n  628-29, 207 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1974) (citation omitted)). [6]   Because the Steinke claim was filed \r\n  before either the 1994 or 1997 Act became effective, the Court found that \r\n  the defendantâ€™s liability was not limited by the caps.  \r\nThe following \r\n  quote from the Steinke opinion has spawned the question presently before \r\n  the Court:  â€œThe Legislature may, of course, do what it did in 1994, which was \r\n  to resolve the statutory conflict and reinstate the statutory caps in future \r\n  cases.â€  Id. at 403, 520 S.E.2d at 157-58 (emphasis added).  \r\n  The case before us now calls for a final decision on whether â€œfuture casesâ€ \r\n  includes all cases that have not been filed regardless of when they arose \r\n  or accrued.  In other words, whether the liability caps within the 1994 \r\n  and 1997 Acts are applicable to claims which arose or accrued prior \r\n  to each Actâ€™s effective date, but which were not filed until after the \r\n  effective date.  This precise question was not resolved in Steinke or \r\n  Dykema because the claims in both Steinke and Dykema were \r\n  filed before the effective date of the 1994 and 1997 Acts reinstating \r\n  the applicable caps by the Legislature.  In Appellantsâ€™ case, the claim accrued \r\n  before the effective date of either Act, but was not filed until 1998, \r\n  after both Acts became effective.\r\nRespondent \r\n  argues that the Courtâ€™s language in Steinke emphasizing the filing date \r\n  supports a holding that the date of filing is the only significant date for \r\n  purposes of determining retroactivity.  We disagree and believe such a finding \r\n  would betray logic. [7]   As noted, \r\n  the preceding cases were filed before the effective date of the relevant Act, \r\n  and so the date of accrual was not significant.  At the time Appellantsâ€™ claim \r\n  arose - when Chavis was infected shortly after his birth in 1992 - there were \r\n  no statutory caps in place under the rule of Southeastern.  Therefore, \r\n  the Legislatureâ€™s attempt to reach back and change the status of such claims \r\n  that arose prior to the Legislatureâ€™s 1994 reinstatement of the liability caps \r\n  in Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1), and of Â§ 15-78-120 in toto in 1997, is, by definition, \r\n  retroactive, and violates the doctrine of separation of powers.  Steinke; \r\n  Lindsay.  The Legislature had authority to reinstate the caps, but it could \r\n  only do so prospectively, with respect to those claims that arose or accrued \r\n  after the effective date of the reenactments.\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the liability caps within S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  15-78-120(a)(1) apply to Appellantsâ€™ claim.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Appellants filed suit both as individuals and as guardians for their \r\n    minor child.  The Appellantsâ€™ individual suits were dismissed because they \r\n    were filed after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, \r\n    but the suit brought on behalf of Appellantsâ€™ minor child survived.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120 (Supp. 1994) states, \r\n    in part, as follows:\r\n  (a) For any action or claim for \r\n    damages brought under the provisions of this chapter, the liability shall \r\n    not exceed the following limits:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) Except as provided in Section \r\n      15-78-120(a)(3), no person shall recover in any action or claim brought \r\n      hereunder a sum exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars because of \r\n      loss arising from a single occurrence regardless of the number of agencies \r\n      or political subdivisions involved.\r\n    (2) Except as provided in Section \r\n      15-78-120(a)(4), the total sum recovered hereunder arising out of a single \r\n      occurrence shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars regardless of \r\n      the number of agencies or political subdivisions or claims or actions involved.\r\n    (3) No person may recover in \r\n      any action or claim brought hereunder against any governmental entity and \r\n      caused by the tort of any licensed physician or dentist, employed by a governmental \r\n      entity and acting within the scope of his profession, a sum exceeding one \r\n      million dollars because of loss arising from a single occurrence regardless \r\n      of the number of agencies or political subdivisions involved.\r\n    (4) The total sum recovered hereunder \r\n      arising out of a single occurrence of liability of any governmental entity \r\n      for any tort caused by any licensed physician or dentist, employed by a \r\n      governmental entity and acting within the scope of his profession, may not \r\n      exceed one million dollars regardless of the number of agencies or political \r\n      subdivisions or claims or actions involved.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The 1994 Act recognized that a window of unlimited liability existed \r\n    for cases filed between April 5, 1988, (the effective date of \r\n    the Uniform Contribution Act) and July 1, 1994.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Subsections (a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) of Â§ 15-78-120 limit recovery in \r\n    suits against licensed physicians and dentists employed by governmental entities. \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n    \r\n    [5] In addition, the 1997 Act amended the original Â§ 15-78-120 by increasing \r\n    the liability caps.  1997 Act No. 155, Part II, Â§ 55(D). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  In Lindsay, the Court held that the Legislatureâ€™s attempt \r\n    to declare, by retroactive amendment, that insurance companies were entitled \r\n    to certain investment credits, after this Court had interpreted the relevant \r\n    statutes to mean that insurance companies were not entitled to the credits, \r\n    violated the separation of powers doctrine.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  In addition, the Courtâ€™s holding today is consistent with its prior \r\n    opinion in Moore v. Berkeley County, 290 S.C. 43, 348 S.E.2d 174 (1986).  \r\n    In Moore, the Court was asked to interpret the following language it \r\n    used when it abolished the doctrine of sovereign immunity in McCall v. \r\n    Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 246, 329 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1985):  â€œ[s]overeign immunity \r\n    will not bar recovery in any case currently pending or in those filed on or \r\n    before July 1, 1986, provided the defendant has liability insurance coverage.  \r\n    Recovery shall not exceed the limits of the liability insurance coverage,â€ \r\n    and â€œ[s]overeign immunity shall not apply to any case filed after July 1, \r\n    1986.â€  The Moore Court held that â€œthe Court intended that sovereign \r\n    immunity shall not bar recovery in any case pending or which arose \r\n    prior to July 1, 1986.â€  290 S.C. at 45, 348 S.E.2d at 176 (emphasis added).\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25709","title":"Williamson v.

Goforth, of Holcombe, Bomar, Gunn and Bradford, \r\n  P.A., of Spartanburg, for Appellants.\r\nMichael Parham and S. Blakely Smith, of Parham &amp; Smith LLC, of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  This is an appeal from \r\n  the circuit court.  Respondents brought a declaratory judgment action to determine \r\n  a number of issues involving interpretation of the South Carolina Tort Claims \r\n  Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 through 200 (â€œTCAâ€).  The trial court found \r\n  that Respondents were entitled to collect the full $2.5 million in stipulated \r\n  damages, and that the South Carolina Insurance Reserve Fund (â€œthe Fundâ€) was \r\n  obligated, under the insurance policy it issued to Spartanburg County Health \r\n  Services District, Inc., (â€œthe Districtâ€) to pay this entire amount.  The Fund \r\n  and the District appealed. \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\n  Gaylan and Catherine Williamson filed suit against \r\n  the District on October 20, 1997, after Catherine gave birth to a son, Cody, \r\n  on January 3, 1997.  The Williamsons alleged two doctors employed by the District, \r\n  Drs. Kiesau and Davis, had rendered negligent professional services during the \r\n  childâ€™s delivery, as a proximate result of which, Cody was born with severe \r\n  birth defects.  The Williamsons brought two suits, one as guardians ad litem \r\n  for Cody, and a second suit in their own right, seeking damages they had incurred \r\n  and would incur in the future in caring for Cody.  The District was defended \r\n  in the suits by its liability insurance provider, the Fund.\r\n  The parties settled the underlying negligence \r\n  suits.  Codyâ€™s damages were stipulated to be $1.5 million, and the Williamsonsâ€™ \r\n  damages were set at $1 million.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Fund \r\n  paid the Williamsons $1 million at the time of settlement, $800,000 to be applied \r\n  to Codyâ€™s total damages of $1.5 million, and $200,000 to be applied to the Williamsonsâ€™ \r\n  $1 million damages.  The settlement agreement contemplated that Respondents \r\n  would subsequently file a declaratory judgment to determine:\r\n\r\n  (1) the Districtâ€™s total monetary liability under the\r\n  TCA;\r\n  (2) whether the underlying acts of Drs. Kiesau and Davis constituted \r\n  more than a single â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the TCA;\r\n  (3) whether the liability limits contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  15-78-120 applied to Respondentsâ€™ claims; and,\r\n  (4) whether the Fund was obligated to pay more than $1 million \r\n  under the insurance policy.\r\n\r\nThe settlement further \r\n  stipulated that the Districtâ€™s liability for damages would extend only to the \r\n  limits of insurance coverage provided by the Fund.  The parties agreed that \r\n  resolution of the declaratory judgment action involved only questions of law, \r\n  and each filed a motion for summary judgment.  The trial court determined the \r\n  statutory caps at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120 (a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) (Supp. 1996) \r\n  applied to Respondentsâ€™ causes of action.  The court found further that the \r\n  Williamsonsâ€™ loss, as parents, was separately cognizable from Codyâ€™s loss.  \r\n  Thus, the Williamsons were entitled to recover a maximum of $1 million per occurrence, \r\n  and Cody was entitled to a maximum recovery of $1 million per occurrence.\r\nThe trial court found that Respondents had established \r\n  two separate â€œoccurrencesâ€ for purposes of the TCA, one â€œoccurrenceâ€ arising \r\n  from Dr. Kiesauâ€™s negligence, and a second â€œoccurrenceâ€, separate and apart \r\n  from the first, arising from Dr. Davisâ€™s negligence.\r\nFinally, the trial court determined that \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-140 (a) \r\n  [1]  (effectively repealed on June 14, 1997), the State Budget and Control \r\n  Board was obligated to provide insurance coverage, through the Fund, up to the \r\n  amount of the Districtâ€™s liability regardless of any liability limits contained \r\n  in the insurance policy, or the statutory caps.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  permitted Respondents to recover from the Fund the entire amount of the stipulated \r\n  damages of $2.5 million, or $1.5 million above that already paid pursuant to \r\n  the settlement agreement.\r\nWith the exception of \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s determination that the monetary caps applied to Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  claims, Appellants challenge all of the holdings above.  Respondents urge, inter \r\n  alia, pursuant to Rule 220 (c), SCACR, that we should affirm the judgment \r\n  of the trial court because the caps do not apply to their claims.  The following \r\n  issues are before the Court:\r\nRespondentâ€™s Issue:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in determining that the statutory caps apply to Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  claims?\r\n\r\nAppellantsâ€™ Issues: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in ruling that the childâ€™s \r\n  claim for bodily injuries and the parentsâ€™ claim for medical expenses entitled \r\n  each party to an aggregate cap of $1 million per single occurrence?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in ruling the injuries and \r\n  damages sustained by the Respondents were the result of two separate â€œoccurrencesâ€?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the \r\n  trial court err in ruling that the Fund was obligated, under the insurance policy \r\n  it issued to the District to pay the entire amount of the stipulated damages?\r\n\r\n   Law /Analysis\r\nI.  Statutory Caps \r\nRespondents argue, as an additional \r\n  basis upon which to affirm the judgment below that the monetary caps contained \r\n  in the TCA do not apply to their causes of action. [2]   We agree.  \r\nIn Southeastern Freight Lines \r\n  v. City of Hartsville, 313 S.C. 466, 443 S.E.2d 395 (1994), we held the \r\n  Legislature's adoption of the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasor's \r\n  Act (â€œUniform Contribution Actâ€) impliedly repealed the statutory tort claims \r\n  cap set forth in section 15-78-120 (a)(1), which was adopted by the Legislature \r\n  as part of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act in 1986.  We recently recognized, \r\n  in Dykema v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, 348 S.E.2d 549, 560 S.E.2d \r\n  894 (2002), that the statutory caps set forth in 15-78-120(a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) \r\n  were likewise impliedly repealed by adoption of the Uniform Contribution Act.  \r\n  Accordingly, the statutory caps of subsections (a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) were repealed \r\n  upon adoption of the Uniform Contribution Act, April 5, 1988.  Although the \r\n  Legislature reenacted the provisions of section 15-78-120 (a)(1) with 1994 Acts \r\n  No. 497, Part II, Section 107, this Act did not reenact subsections (a)(3) &amp; \r\n  (a)(4).  Dykema.      \r\nIn 1997, the Legislature enacted \r\n  1997 Act No. 155, Part II, Â§ 55, in which it reenacted section 15-78-120, in \r\n  toto.  The reenactment of section 15-78-120 states that it takes effect upon \r\n  approval by the Governor [June 14, 1997] and &quot;applies to claims or actions \r\n  pending on that date or thereafter filed, except where final judgment \r\n  has been entered before that date.&quot;   1997 Act No. 155, Part II, Â§ 55(F).  \r\n\r\nHowever, in Steinke \r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999), we addressed \r\n  the Legislatureâ€™s 1997 reenactment of section 15-78-120, and its attempt to \r\n  reinstate the caps with respect to claims which were then pending.  We held \r\n  that â€œ a judicial [interpretation] of a statute is determinative of its meaning \r\n  and effect, and any subsequent legislative amendment to the contrary will only \r\n  be effective from the date of its enactment and cannot be applied retroactively.â€  \r\n  336 S.C. at 402, 520 S.E.2d at 157.  Accordingly, we held the legislature could \r\n  not retroactively reenact the caps to apply to claims filed prior to \r\n  amendment.  Id.  Steinke went on to hold, however, that the Legislature \r\n  was free to reinstate the statutory caps in future cases.  \r\nAlthough Steinke held the Legislature could \r\n  not retroactively reinstate caps with respect to claims filed prior to \r\n  June 14, 1997, it did not address whether such caps could be reinstated with \r\n  respect to other â€œclaims or actions pending.â€  We finally resolved this question \r\n  in Simmons v. Greenville Hospital System, Op. No. 25708 (S.C.Sup.Ct. \r\n  filed August 25, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32).  In Simmons, the \r\n  plaintiffsâ€™ cause of action accrued in 1992, prior to the effective date \r\n  of both the 1994 and 1997 reenactments of the caps, but was not filed until \r\n  after the respective effective dates in 1998.  Because the caps were not in \r\n  effect at the time the plaintiffsâ€™ claim accrued, we held that the Legislature \r\n  could not â€œreach back and change the statusâ€ of plaintiffsâ€™ claims without violating \r\n  the doctrine of separation of powers.  Id.  In short, we held that the \r\n  â€œLegislature had authority to reinstate the caps, but it could only do so prospectively, \r\n  with respect to those claims that arose or accrued after the effective \r\n  date of the reenactments.â€  Id. \r\nHere, the negligent act or acts occurred on January \r\n  3, 1997, but both complaints (Codyâ€™s complaint and the Williamsonsâ€™ complaint) \r\n  were filed on October 20, 1997.  The claims arose or accrued prior \r\n  to the effective date of the 1997 Act that reenacted subsections (a)(3) &amp; \r\n  (a)(4) of Â§ 15-78-120, but were not filed until after the effective date \r\n  of the 1997 Act.  As we determined in Simmons, the date of accrual is \r\n  the determinative date.   Both Codyâ€™s and the Williamsonsâ€™ claims arose or \r\n  accrued before the reinstatement of the caps within subsections (a)(3) \r\n  &amp; (a)(4) took effect.  Therefore, neither partyâ€™s recovery is limited by \r\n  the caps within the TCA, and the District must pay the parties the remainder \r\n  of the stipulated damages.\r\nII.  Aggregate Cap\r\nAppellants contend the trial court erred \r\n  in holding that the Williamsons and Cody could each recover $1 million per occurrence.  \r\n  Based on our finding that the liability caps within Â§ 15-78-120(a)(3) &amp; \r\n  (a)(4) are not applicable in this case, it is unnecessary to address this issue.  \r\n\r\nIII.  Number of Occurrences\r\nAppellants argue that \r\n  the trial court erred in ruling the injuries and damages sustained by the Respondents \r\n  were the result of two separate â€œoccurrencesâ€.  Our finding that Â§ 15-78-120(a)(3) \r\n  &amp; (a)(4) has no application to this case makes it unnecessary for us to \r\n  address this issue also. \r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe \r\n  Fundâ€™s Obligation  \r\nAppellants assert that the trial court erred in holding \r\n  the Fund must provide the District with coverage in excess of $1 million per \r\n  occurrence.  We disagree.\r\nThe â€œinsuring agreementâ€ portion of the contract of insurance \r\n  between the District and the Fund provides,\r\n\r\nThe Fund will pay on behalf of \r\n  the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay \r\n  as damages because of an occurrence which results in Injury to any person.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the policy contained \r\n  a section entitled â€œLimits of Liabilityâ€ which read as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Regardless of the number of (1) insureds under this policy, (2) persons or organizations \r\n  who sustain Injury, or (3) claims made or suits brought on account of Injury \r\n  the Fundâ€™s liability is limited as follows.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    The total liability of the Fund for all damages as the result of any Occurrence \r\n  including damages for care and loss of services, because of Injury sustained \r\n  by one or more persons or organizations, shall not exceed the limit of liability \r\n  stated in the declarations as applicable to â€œeach Occurrence.â€  The limits under \r\n  Coverage â€œAâ€ and Coverage â€œBâ€ are separate limits and under no circumstances \r\n  would both limits apply to one Occurrence.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    For any action or claim brought under [the Act], the liability of the Fund shall \r\n  not exceed the following limits:\r\n\r\n\r\nCoverage A\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      No person shall recover in any action or claim a sum exceeding 250,000 dollars \r\n  because of a loss arising from a single Occurrence regardless of the number \r\n  of agencies or political subdivisions involved.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      The total sum recovered arising out of a single Occurrence shall not exceed \r\n  500,000 dollars regardless of the number of agencies involved.\r\n  \r\nCoverage B\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      No person may recover in any action or claim brought hereunder against \r\n  any governmental entity and caused by the tort of any licensed physician or \r\n  dentist, employed by a governmental entity and acting within the scope of his \r\n  profession, a sum exceeding one million dollars because of loss arising from \r\n  a single Occurrence regardless of the number of agencies or political subdivisions \r\n  involved. \r\n   \r\n    \r\n      The total sum recovered hereunder arising out of a single occurrence \r\n  of liability of any governmental entity for any tort caused by any licensed \r\n  physician or dentist, employed by a governmental entity and acting within the \r\n  scope of his profession, may not exceed one million dollars regardless of the \r\n  number of agencies or political subdivisions or claims or actions involved. \r\n   \r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  Despite these \r\n  liability limits in the policy, the trial court held that the Fund was obligated \r\n  to provide coverage to the extent of the stipulated damages.  According to the \r\n  trial court, Â§ 15-78-140 (Supp. 1996) mandated this result.\r\nSection 15-78-140(a) \r\n  provides,\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the Budget \r\n  and Control Board to cover risks for which immunity has been waived under the \r\n  provisions of this chapter by the purchase of insurance as authorized in Â§ 15-78-150.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-140(a) \r\n  (Supp. 1996).  This provision establishes a duty for the Budget and Control \r\n  Board to purchase insurance against risks for which immunity has been waived.  \r\n  As discussed in Part I of this opinion, the TCA waived this stateâ€™s immunity \r\n  up to the monetary limits defined in Â§ 15-78-120.  The limits of liability language \r\n  within the insurance policy was taken verbatim from Â§ 15-78-120.  However, on \r\n  the date the present action accrued in January 1997, the liability limits within \r\n  subsections (a)(3) &amp; (a)(4) were effectively repealed and had yet to be \r\n  reinstated by the 1997 Act.  See Part I, infra; Dykema; \r\n  Steinke.  \r\nAccordingly, there was no limit \r\n  on the Districtâ€™s liability for the negligence of one of its physicians on the \r\n  date this claim arose or accrued, and the District is legally obligated \r\n  to compensate Cody and the Williamsons for their stipulated damages.  In turn, \r\n  the Budget and Control Board was obligated to insure against risks for which \r\n  liability had been waived.  This statutory duty, reiterated within the policyâ€™s \r\n  promise â€œto pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become \r\n  legally obligated to pay as damages,â€ obligates the Fund to cover the total \r\n  amount of the stipulated damages against the District. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM \r\n  IN PART AND REVERSE IN PART.  \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] That section provided: â€œIt is the duty of the Budget and Control Board \r\n    to cover risks for which immunity has been waived under the provisions of \r\n    this chapter by the purchase of insurance as authorized in Â§ 15-78-150.â€  \r\n    S.C.

Lamar, of Sowell Gray Stepp &amp; Laffitte, L.L.C., \r\n  both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Sandra Jones \r\n  (â€œClaimantâ€) appeals the affirmance of the Worker's Compensation Commission's \r\n  (â€œCommissionâ€) finding that she was not entitled to benefits because she committed \r\n  fraud in filling out her employment application.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nClaimant applied for a job at Georgia \r\n  Pacific (â€œRespondentâ€) in 1991.  The application requested that Claimant respond \r\n  to the following question: â€œDo you have any physical or mental disability which \r\n  would interfere with or impair your ability to perform the job(s) for which \r\n  you have applied?â€  Claimant checked the â€œNoâ€ box on the application.  Claimant \r\n  had to fill out a health history form as a part of her pre-employment physical \r\n  exam, on which she was asked to check off whether or not she had various prior \r\n  medical conditions.  Claimant failed to disclose that she had had back trouble, \r\n  leg pain and Bursitis on the health history form. \r\n  [1]   In her testimony before the Hearing Commissioner, Claimant admitted \r\n  to lying on the application and health history form.  \r\nClaimant received a job offer from Respondent \r\n  and began working as a General Laborer.  While working for Respondent over the \r\n  ensuing six years, Claimant repeatedly returned to her doctor, Dr. Poole, due \r\n  to nagging back and leg pain.  Then, on August 7, 1997, Claimant was picking \r\n  up large pieces of cardboard and felt something â€œpopâ€ in her back.  She complained \r\n  of the pain to her superiors, and they sent her to the Respondentâ€™s doctor, \r\n  Dr. Hodge, who determined that nothing major was wrong with Claimantâ€™s back. [2]   Claimant sought help from Dr. Poole and three \r\n  other doctors over the next two years, had two back surgeries, and finally had \r\n  to stop working in 1999. \r\n Claimant filed a claim \r\n  seeking benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 42-1-10 et seq., stemming from her August 7, 1997, back injury.  Commissioner \r\n  Catoe agreed with Claimant that she suffered an accidental injury on August \r\n  7, 1997, and that her continued back problems and eventual surgery resulted \r\n  from the injury.  The Commissioner determined that Respondent should pay all \r\n  of Claimantâ€™s post August 7, 1997, medical bills and ordered that Respondent \r\n  pay Claimant a weekly temporary total disability payment of $321.12.  \r\nRespondent appealed the decision, and \r\n  the full Commission reversed, finding that the Claimant did not establish that \r\n  her back problems were directly and causally related to the August 7, 1997, \r\n  incident and that, regardless, her claim was barred by this Courtâ€™s holding \r\n  in Cooper v. McDevitt &amp; Street Co., 260 S.C. 463, 196 S.E.2d 833 \r\n  (1973) because she committed fraud in filling out her application for employment. \r\n\r\n The Circuit Court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  holding, and Claimant appeals the court decision raising the following issues \r\n  on appeal: \r\n\r\n  \r\n     \r\n  Did the Circuit Court correctly determine that the Commission did not err in \r\n  finding that Claimantâ€™s back problems did not directly and causally relate to \r\n  her accidental injury on August 7, 1997?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the Circuit Court err in affirming the Commissionâ€™s finding that Claimantâ€™s \r\n  claim for Workerâ€™s Compensation is barred because she committed fraud in filling \r\n  out her employment application?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the Circuit Court err in finding that the Commissionâ€™s decision in Oglesby \r\n  v. Manpower of Seneca, S.C. Workerâ€™s Compensation file number 9643449/9714003 \r\n  (September 25, 2000), was not controlling?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court will not \r\n  overturn a decision by the Commission unless the determination is unsupported \r\n  by substantial evidence.  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d \r\n  304 (1981).  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record \r\n  as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative \r\n  agency reached to justify its action.â€  Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, \r\n  291 S.C. 469, 354 S.E.2d 384 (1987).      \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.         \r\nInjury\r\nClaimant asserts that \r\n  the Commission erred in determining that her existing back problems are not \r\n  directly and causally related to her August 7, 1997, injury.  We disagree. \r\nClaimant saw many doctors \r\n  after her accident on August 7, 1997, and there is conflicting testimony as \r\n  to whether the doctors believed that the accident caused Claimantâ€™s subsequent \r\n  back problems.  Claimant saw Dr. Mitchell shortly after the accident.  Dr. Mitchell \r\n  prescribed physical therapy for Claimant, which seemed to suppress some of the \r\n  pain.  Dr. Mitchell opined that Claimant had significant back problems prior \r\n  to the accident.  \r\nDr. Poole referred the \r\n  Claimant to Dr. Robert E. Flandry in March 1999.  Dr. Flandry was unaware of \r\n  Claimantâ€™s long history of back problems, yet he also opined that she had back \r\n  problems prior to the 1997 accident.  Claimantâ€™s regular doctor, Dr. Poole, \r\n  testified that Claimant had a history of back problems, but also stated that \r\n  Claimant had a â€œmajor problemâ€ as of August 8, 1997.  \r\nDr. Flandry referred \r\n  Claimant to Dr. Robert Stephen Harley, who performed surgery on Claimant in \r\n  June 1999.  Harley testified that he believed that the August 7, 1997, incident \r\n  caused Claimantâ€™s resulting back problems:\r\n\r\nI feel that the straw that broke \r\n  the camelâ€™s back was when she lifted those heavy pieces of cardboard when she \r\n  was on the job in September of 1997 as she describes.  I think indeed she may \r\n  have had some aches and pains in her back before but that indeed it was the \r\n  last straw that broke the camelâ€™s back that caused her to have this aggravation \r\n  of her problems.\r\n\r\nWhile the doctorsâ€™ testimony \r\n  is inconsistent as to whether the August 7, 1997, injury triggered Claimantâ€™s \r\n  subsequent back problems, we find there was substantial evidence presented upon \r\n  which the Commission could conclude that Claimantâ€™s injuries were not directly \r\n  and causally related to the August 7, 1997, accident.  Our standard of review \r\n  does not permit us to weigh the evidence and make our own determination.  We \r\n  are bound to uphold the Commissionâ€™s decision unless its factual determination \r\n  is not supported by substantial evidence.  Howell, 291 S.C. 469, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 384: see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-386(A)(6) (Supp. 2002) (&quot;the \r\n  court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight \r\n  of evidence on the questions of fact.&quot;)   \r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFraud in the Employment Application \r\n   \r\nClaimant argues that the Commission \r\n  erred in holding that her claim for benefits was barred since she committed \r\n  fraud in filling out her employment application.  We disagree.\r\nClaimant testified that \r\n  she lied when she filled out the employment application when she failed to disclose \r\n  that she had prior back problems.  According to this Courtâ€™s decision in Cooper, \r\n  a Claimantâ€™s claim for Workerâ€™s Compensation benefits will be barred if the \r\n  following factors are proven:  â€œ(1) The employee must have knowingly and willfully \r\n  made a false representation as to his physical condition.  (2) The employer \r\n  must have relied upon the false representation and this reliance must have been \r\n  a substantial factor in the hiring.  (3) There must have been a causal connection \r\n  between the false representation and the injury.â€  260 S.C. at 468, 196 S.E.2d \r\n  at 835 (citation omitted).    \r\nThe Respondent put forth \r\n  substantial evidence that satisfied the three prongs of this test.  First, Claimant \r\n  testified that she lied on the application and health history form when she \r\n  failed to disclose her history of back and leg problems.  She testified that \r\n  she was afraid that she would not get the job with Respondent if she responded \r\n  truthfully on the forms.  Second, Respondentâ€™s Human Resource Manager, Philip \r\n  Stilwell (â€œStilwellâ€), testified that the fact that Claimant had prior physical \r\n  ailments would not have barred her from working for Respondent. [3]   Rather, Respondent would have attempted to \r\n  find a job for Claimant that would not subject a pre-existing physical impairment \r\n  to further deterioration.  Stilwell also testified that Respondent relies on \r\n  the answers given by applicants on the employment application and considers \r\n  them as a substantial factor in hiring the applicants.  Finally, there is a \r\n  causal connection between Claimantâ€™s injuries and the false representation as \r\n  she had documented back problems prior to employment and claims that she injured \r\n  her back while working for Respondent.  \r\nWe hold that the Respondent \r\n  presented substantial evidence that that the three prongs of the Cooper test \r\n  were satisfied.\r\nIII.   \r\nThe Oglesby Decision\r\n Claimant argues that \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s prior decision in Ogelsby is controlling.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\n Ogelsby was decided \r\n  the day before the Comission made its decision in this matter.  In Ogelsby, \r\n  the same panel members involved in this case determined that the Cooper \r\n  decision had been overruled by the Americans with Disabilities Act (â€œADAâ€), \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 12101, et seq. (2000).  Claimant alleges that the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  conclusion in the present case was arbitrary and capricious given the prior \r\n  holding in Ogelsby, and that this Court should reverse the decision based \r\n  on a provision of the Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(f) \r\n  (Supp. 2002). [4]   \r\nIn our opinion, the \r\n  ADA does not trump the Cooper determination of when fraud in the application \r\n  process bars the applicantâ€™s attempt to collect Workerâ€™s Compensation benefits.  \r\n  The ADA permits employers to â€œmake preemployment inquiries into the ability \r\n  of an applicant to perform job-related functions.â€  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1211(d)(2)(B).  \r\n  The section mentioned above authorizes the Respondentâ€™s question on its employment \r\n  application regarding the existence of a physical or mental impairment.  Further, \r\n  the ADA does not have a section that provides protection to an applicant who \r\n  commits fraud in the application process.  \r\nWe find that the Commission was \r\n  neither arbitrary nor capricious in concluding that the three Cooper factors \r\n  were met because there was substantial evidence presented to support that determination.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the reasons set \r\n  forth above, we AFFIRM the Circuit Courtâ€™s determination that the Commission \r\n  did not err in concluding that Claimantâ€™s claim for benefits was barred.  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Claimant also failed to disclose that she had \r\n    a back X-Ray taken. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Dr. Hodge diagnosed her as having mild lumbosacral \r\n    muscle strain.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Next to the question on the employment application - â€œDo you have \r\n    any physical or mental disability which would interfere with or impair your \r\n    ability to perform the job(s) for which you have applied?â€ - was the statement: \r\n    â€œA â€˜yesâ€™ answer is not an automatic bar to employment.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The provision states:\r\n  \r\n  (6) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the \r\n    agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.  The court may \r\n    affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.  \r\n    The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the \r\n    appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, \r\n    conclusions or decisions are:\r\n    (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion \r\n    or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
